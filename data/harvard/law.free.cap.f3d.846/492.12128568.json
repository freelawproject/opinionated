The Creek\u2019s water, in turn, flows into another reservoir, then through an aqueduct, and then through several more reservoirs and tunnels alongside the Hudson River, having crossed the River to its Eastern shore some 50 miles north of New York City. Eventually, it arrives at its final destination: the many taps, faucets, and the like within the City\u2019s five boroughs.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-16\">The movement of water from the Scho-harie Reservoir through the Shandaken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Tunnel into the Esopus Creek is what is known as a \u201cwater transfer,\u201d an activity that conveys or connects waters of the United States without subjecting those waters to any intervening industrial, municipal, or commercial use. Water transfers are an integral part of America\u2019s water-supply infrastructure, of which the Scho-harie Reservoir system is but a very small part. Each year, thousands of water transfers are employed in the course of bringing water to homes, farms, and factories not only in the occasionally rain-soaked Eastern, Southern, and Middle- and North-Western portions of the country, but also in the arid West (including large portions of the Southwest). Usable bodies of water in the West tend to be scarce, and most precipitation there falls as snow, often in sparsely populated areas at considerable distance from their water authorities\u2019 urban and agricultural clientele.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Historically, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) has taken a hands-off approach to water transfers, choosing not to subject them to the requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\u201cNPDES\u201d) permitting program established by the Clean Water Act in 1972. Some have criticized the EPA for this approach. They argue that like ballast water in ships,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> water transfers can move harmful pollutants from one body of water to another, potentially putting local ecosystems, economies, and public health at risk. While acknowledging these concerns, the EPA has held fast to its position. Indeed, following many lawsuits seeking to establish whether NPDES permits are required for water transfers, the EPA formalized its stance in 2008\u2014more than three decades after the passage of the Clean Water Act\u2014in a rule known as the \u201cWater Transfers Rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZ2\">Shortly thereafter, several environmentalist organizations and state, provincial, and tribal governments challenged the Rule by bringing suit against the EPA and its Administrator in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. After many entities\u2014governmental, tribal, and private\u2014intervened on either side of the case, the district court (Kenneth M. Karas, Judge) granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, vacating the Rule and remanding the matter to the EPA. In a thorough, closely reasoned, and detailed opinion, the district court concluded that although <em>Chevron </em>deference is applicable and requires the courts to defer to the EPA and uphold the Rule if it is reasonable, the Rule represented an unreasonable interpretation of the Clean Water Act, and was therefore invalid under the deferential two-step framework for judicial review established in <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). The court held that the Rule was contrary to the requirements established by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The Federal Government and the inter-venor-defendants timely appealed. Despite the district court\u2019s herculean efforts and its careful and exhaustive explanation for the result it reached, we now reverse for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">At step one of the <em>Chevron </em>analysis, we conclude\u2014as did the district court\u2014that the Clean Water Act does not speak directly to the precise question of whether NPDES permits are required for water transfers, and that it is therefore necessary to proceed to <em>Chevron\u2019s </em>second step. At step two of the <em>Chevron </em>analysis, we conclude\u2014contrary to the district court\u2014 that the Water Transfers Rule\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act is reasonable. We view the EPA\u2019s promulgation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the Water Transfers Rule here as precisely the sort of policymaking decision that the Supreme Court designed the <em>Chevron </em>framework to insulate from judicial second- (or third-) guessing. It may well be that, as the plaintiffs argue, the Water Transfers Rule\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act is not the interpretation best designed to achieve the Act\u2019s overall goal of restoring and protecting the quality of the nation\u2019s waters. But it is nonetheless an interpretation supported by valid considerations: The Act does not require that water quality be improved whatever the cost or means, and the Rule preserves state authority over many aspects of water regulation, gives regulators flexibility to balance the need to improve water quality with the potentially high costs of compliance with an NPDES permitting program, and allows for several alternative means for regulating water transfers. While we might prefer an interpretation more consistent with what appear to us to be the most prominent goals of the Clean Water Act, <em>Chevron </em>tells us that so long as the agency\u2019s statutory interpretation is reasonable, what we might prefer is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-14\">\n<em>The Clean Water Act and the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\u201cNPDES\u201d) Permitting Program</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-15\">In 1972, following several events such as the 1969 \u201cburning\u201d of the' Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio that increased national concern about pollution of our nation\u2019s waters, Congress enacted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (\u201cFWPCA\u201d) Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 816, <em>as amended, </em>88 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251 ei <em>seq., </em>commonly known as the Clean Water Act (sometimes hereinafter the \u201cAct\u201d or the \u201cCWA\u201d). Congress\u2019s principal objective in passing the Act was \u201cto restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a). Congress also envisioned that the Act\u2019s passage would enable \u201cthe discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters [to] be eliminated by 1985.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1251(a)(1). Although time has proven this projection to have been over-optimistic at best, it is our understanding that the Act has succeeded to a significant degree in cleaning up our nation\u2019s waters.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>The Act \u201cprohibits \u2018the discharge of any pollutant by any person\u2019 unless done in compliance with some provision of the Act.\u201d <em>S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist. v. Miccosukee Tribe, </em>541 U.S. 95, 102, 124 S.Ct. 1537, 158 L.Ed.2d 264 (\u201cMiccosukee\u201d) (quoting 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(a)). The statute defines the discharge of a pollutant as \u201cany addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(12)(A), where \u201cnavigable waters\u201d means \u201cthe waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1362(7). The principal provision under which such a discharge may be allowed is Section 402, which establishes the \u201cNational Pollutant Discharge Elimination System\u201d (\u201cNPDES\u201d) permitting program. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342. With narrow exceptions not relevant here, a party must acquire an NPDES permit in order to discharge a specified amount of a specified pollutant. <em>See id.; Miccosukee, </em>541 U.S. at 102, 124 S.Ct. 1537. Thus, without an NPDES permit, it is unlawful for a party to discharge a pollutant into the nation\u2019s navigable waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">\u201c[B]y setting forth technology-based effluent limitations and, in certain cases, additional water quality based effluent limitations[, ]the NPDES permit \u2018defines, and facilitates compliance with, and enforcement of, a preponderance of a discharger\u2019s obligations under the [Act].\u2019 \u201d <em>Waterkeeper Alliance, Inc. v. EPA, </em>399 F.3d 486, 492 (2d Cir. 2005) (third brackets in original) (quoting <em>EPA v. California ex rel. State Water Res. Control Bd., </em>426 U.S. 200, 205, 96 S.Ct. 2022, 48 L.Ed.2d 578 (1976)). Noncompliance with an NPDES permit\u2019s conditions is a violation of the Clean Water Act. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(h). Once an NPDES permit has been issued, the EPA, states, and citizens can bring suit in federal court to enforce it. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1319(a)(3), 1365(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The Act envisions \u201ccooperative federalism\u201d in the management of the nation\u2019s water resources. <em>See, e.g., New York v. United States, </em>505 U.S. 144, 167, 112 S.Ct. 2408, 120 L.Ed.2d 120 (1992) (referring to the Act as an example of \u201ccooperative federalism\u201d); <em>Arkansas v.

Reflecting that approach, states typically control the NPDES permitting programs as they apply to waters within their borders, subject to EPA approval. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1314(f)(2), 1342(b)-(c).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Act also preserves states\u2019 \u201cprimary responsibilities and rights\u201d to abate pollution, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1251(b), including their traditional prerogatives to \u201cplan the development and use (including restoration, preservation, and enhancement) of ... water resources,\u201d <em>id. </em>and to \u201callocate quantities of water within [their] jurisdiction,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1251(g),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> subject to the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>floor, on environmental protection set by the Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the EPA, <em>see Nat. Res. Def. Council v. EPA, </em>808 F.3d 556, 580 (2d Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\"><em>Water Transfers and the Water Transfers </em>Rule<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">According to EPA regulations, a \u201cwater transfer\u201d is \u201can activity that conveys or connects waters of the United States without subjecting the. transferred water to intervening industrial, municipal, or commercial use.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.3(i). Water transfers take a variety of forms. A transfer may be accomplished, for example, through artificial tunnels and channels, or natural streams and water bodies; 'and through active pumping or passive direction. There are thousands of water transfers currently in place in the United States, including at least sixteen major diversion projects west of the Mississippi River. Many of the largest U.S. cities draw on water transfers to bring drinkable water to their residents. The City of New York\u2019s \u201cwater supply system ... relies on transfers of water among its [nineteen] collecting reservoirs. The City provides approximately 1.2 billion gallons of ... water a day to nine million people\u2014nearly half of the population of New York State.\u201d Letter Dated August 7, 2006, from Mark D. Buffer, General Counsel, City of New York Department of Environmental Protection to EPA, at 1, J.A. at 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The parties and <em>amici </em>tell us that water transfers are of special significance in the Western United States. Because much precipitation in the West falls as snow, water authorities there must capture water when and where the snow falls and melts, typically in remote and sparsely populated areas, and then transport it to agricultural and urban sites where it is most needed. <em>See </em>Western States Br. 1-2; <em>see also </em>State of California <em>Amicus </em>Br. 16 n.5. Colorado, for example, engages in over forty interbasin diversions in order to serve the State\u2019s water needs. <em>See </em>Letter Dated July 17, 2006, from Brian N. Nazar-enus, Chair, Colorado Water Quality Control Commission, to Water Docket, EPA, at 1, J.A. at 320. California uses the \u201cCalifornia State Water Project,\u201d a complex water delivery system based on interbasin transfers from Northern California to Southern California, to serve the water needs of 25 million of its 37 million residents. <em>See </em>State of California <em>Amicus </em>Br. 3-10. Water transfers are also obviously crucial to agriculture, conveying water to enormously' important farmihg regions such as the Central and Imperial Valleys of California, Weld and Larimer Counties in Colorado, the Snake River Valley of Idaho, and the Yakima Valley of Washington. <em>See </em>Water Districts Br. 16-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">At the same time, though, water transfers, like ballast water in ships, <em>see generally Nat. Res. Def, Council, </em>808 F.3d at 561-62, can move pollutants from one body of water to another, potentially endangering ecosystems, portions of the economy, and public health near the receiving water body\u2014and possibly beyond. Despite these risks, for many years the EPA has taken a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>passive approach to regulating water transfers, effectively exempting them from the NPDES permitting system. The States have also generally adopted a hands-off policy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">During the 1990s and 2000s, prior to its codification in the Water Transfers Rule, the EPA\u2019s position was challenged by, among others, environmentalist groups, which filed several successful lawsuits asserting that NPDES permits were required for some specified water transfers. <em>See, e.g., Catskill Mountains Chapter of Trout Unlimited, Inc. v. City of New York, </em>461 F.3d 77 (2d Cir. 2006) <em>(\u201cCatskill IF), cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 1252, 127 S.Ct. 1373, 167 L.Ed.2d 160 (2007); <em>N. Plains Res. Council v. Fid. Expl. &amp; Dev. Co., </em>325 F.3d 1155 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 967, 124 S.Ct. 434, 157 L.Ed.2d 312 (2003); <em>Catskill Mountains Chapter of Trout Unlimited, Inc. v. City of New York, </em>273 F.3d 481 (2d Cir. 2001) <em>(\u201cCatskill </em>/\u201d); <em>see also Dubois v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agrie., </em>102 F.3d 1273 (1st Cir. 1996), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Loon Mountain Recreation Corp. v. Dubois, </em>521 U.S. 1119, 117 S.Ct. 2510, 138 L.Ed.2d 1013 (1997). None of these decisions classified the EPA\u2019s views on the regulation of water transfers as sufficiently formal to warrant <em>Chevron </em>deference. <em>See, e.g., Catskill II, </em>451 F.3d at 82 (declining to apply <em>Chevron </em>deference framework); <em>Catskill I, </em>273 F.3d at 491 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In response, the EPA took steps to formalize its position. In August 2005, the EPA\u2019s Office of General Counsel and Office of Water issued a legal memorandum written by then-EPA General Counsel Ann R. Klee (the \u201cKlee Memorandum\u201d) that argued that Congress did not intend for water transfers to be subject to the NPDES permitting program. The EPA proposed a formal rule incorporating this interpretation on June 7, 2006, 71 Fed. Reg. 32,887, and then, following notic\u00e9- and-comment rulemaking proceedings, on June 13, 2008, adopted a final rule entitled \u201cNational Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Water Transfers Rule\u201d (the \u2018Water Transfers Rule\u201d), 73 Fed. Reg. 33,697-708 (June 13,2008) (codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.3(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">The Water Transfers Rule\u2019s summary states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">EPA is issuing a regulation to clarify that water transfers are not subject to regulation under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program. This rule defines water transfers as an activity that conveys or connects waters of the United States without subjecting the transferred water to intervening industrial, municipal, or commercial use.

Reg. at 33,700-03. The EPA explained that its \u201cholistic approach to the. text\u201d of the statute was \u201cneeded here in particular because the heart of this matter is the balance Congress created between federal and State oversight of activities affecting the nation\u2019s waters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33,701.

The States of New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, and Washington, and the Province of Manitoba, Canada (collectively, the \u201cAnti-Rule States\u201d) did the same on October 2, 2008. In their complaints, the plaintiffs requested that the district court hold unlawful and set aside the Water Transfers Rule pursuant to Section 706(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act (the \u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In October 2008, the district court consolidated the two cases and granted a motion by the City of New York to intervene in support of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">At about the same time these actions were filed, five parallel petitions for review of the Water Transfers Rule were filed in the First, Second, and Eleventh Circuits. On July 22, 2008, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated these petitions and randomly as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>signed them to the Eleventh Circuit. The Eleventh Circuit then consolidated a sixth petition for review, and stayed all of these petitions pending its disposition of <em>Friends of the Everglades v. South Florida Water Management </em>District, 570 F.3d 1210 (11th Cir. 2009) <em>(\u201cFriends I\u201d), </em>a separate but conceptually related case. The district court in the case now before us granted the EPA\u2019s motion to stay, the proceedings pending the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s resolution of <em>Friends I </em>and the six consolidated petitions. <em>See Catskill Mountains Chapter of Trout Unlimited, Inc. v. EPA, </em>630 F.Supp.2d 295, 307 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). In June 2009, the Eleventh Circuit issued a decision in <em>Friends I, </em>570 F.3d 1210 (11th Cir. 2009), <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>605 F.3d 962 (2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>562 U.S. 1082, 131 S.Ct. 643, 645, 178 L.Ed.2d 512, <em>and cer., denied sub nom.

EPA, </em>8 F.Supp.3d 500 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). At the first step of the <em>Chevron </em>analysis, the district court decided that the Clean Water Act is ambiguous as to whether Congress intended the NPDES program to apply to water transfers. <em>Id. </em>at 518-32. The district court then proceeded to the second step of the <em>Chevron </em>analysis, at which it struck down the Water Transfers Rule as an unreasonable interpretation of the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 532-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">The defendants and intervenor-defen-dants other than the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District (hereinafter \u201cthe defendants\u201d) timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">\u201cOn appeal from a grant of summary judgment in a challenge to agency action under the APA, we review the administrative record and the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo.\u201d Bellevue Hosp.

We conclude that the Water Transfers Rule is a reasonable interpretation of the Clean Water Act and is therefore entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>We evaluate challenges to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute that it administers within the two-step <em>Chevron </em>deference framework. <em>Lawrence </em>+ <em>Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Burwell, </em>812 F.3d 257, 264 (2d Cir. 2016). At <em>Chevron </em>Step One, we ask \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. If the statutory language is \u201csilent or ambiguous,\u201d however, we proceed to <em>Chevron </em>Step Two, where \u201cthe question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute\u201d at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 843,104 S.Ct. 2778. If it is\u2014i.e., if it is not \u201carbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrail to the statute,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778\u2014we will accord deference to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute so long as it is supported by a reasoned explanation, and \u201cso long as the construction is \u2018a reasonable policy choice for the agency to make,\u2019\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Cable &amp; Telecomms.

After the head of the Executive Branch, the President, signs that bill, it becomes the law of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Second, the Executive Branch, if given the authority to do so by legislation, may address the issue through its authorized administrative agency or agencies, typically although not necessarily by regulation\u2014 in this case the EPA through its Water Transfer Rule. In doing so, the executive agency must defer to the Legislative Branch by following the law or laws that it has enacted and that cover the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Only last, in case of a challenge to the Legislative Branch\u2019s authority to pass the law, or to the Executive Branch\u2019s authority to administer it in the manner that it has chosen to adopt, may we in the Judicial Branch become involved in the process. When we do so, though, we are not only last, we are least: We must defer both to the Legislative Branch by refraining from reviewing Congress\u2019s legislative work beyond determining what the statute at issue means and whether it is constitutional, and to the Executive Branch by using the various principles of deference, including <em>Chevron </em>deference, which we conclude is applicable in the case at bar. For us to decide for ourselves what in fact is the preferable route for addressing the substantive problem,at hand would be directly contrary to this constitutional scheme. What we may think to be the best or wisest resolution of problems of water transfers and pollution emphatically does not matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">Abiding by this constitutional scheme, we begin at <em>Chevron </em>Step One. We conclude, as did the district court, that Congress did not in the Clean Water Act clearly and unambiguously speak to the precise question of whether NPDES permits are required for water transfers. It is therefore necessary to proceed to <em>Chevron </em>Step Two, under which we conclude that the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the Act in the Water Transfers Rule represents a reasonable policy choice to which we must defer. The question is whether the Clean Water Act can support the EPA\u2019s interpretation, taking into account the full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>panoply of interpretive considerations advanced by the parties. Ultimately, we conclude that the Water Transfers Rule satisfies <em>Chevron\u2019s </em>deferential standard of review because it is supported by a reasoned explanation that sets forth a reasonable interpretation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">I. <em>Chevron </em>Step One</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">At <em>Chevron </em>Step One, \u201cthe [reviewing] court must determine \u2018whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u2019\u201d <em>City of Arlington v. FCC, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1863, 1868, 185 L.Ed.2d 941 (2013) (quoting <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778). To determine whether a statute is ambiguous, we employ \u201ctraditional tools of statutory construction\u201d to ascertain if \u201cCongress had an intention on the precise question at issue\u201d that \u201cmust be given effect.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843 n.9, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The issue before us at this point, then, is whether the Act plainly requires a party to acquire an NPDES permit in order to make a water transfer. We agree with the district court that the Clean Water Act does not clearly and unambiguously speak to that question. We will begin, however, by addressing the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that we previously held otherwise in <em>Catskill I, </em>273 F.3d 481 (2d Cir. 2001), and <em>Catskill II, </em>451 F.3d 77 (2d Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\"><em>A. </em>Catskill I <em>and </em>Catskill II</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">The plaintiffs argue that this case can be resolved at <em>Chevron </em>Step One because we held in <em>Catskill I </em>and <em>Catskill II </em>that the Clean Water Act unambiguously requires NPDES permits for water transfers. We disagree with the plaintiffs\u2019 reading of those decisions because our application there of the deference standard set forth in <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944), and <em>United States v. Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001)\u2014 so-called <em>\u201cSkidmore\u201d </em>or <em>\u201cSkidmore/Mead\u201d </em>deference\u2014and the reasoning underlying the decisions make clear that we have not previously held that the statutory language at issue here is unambiguous, such that we cannot defer under <em>Chevron </em>to the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act in the Water Transfers Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-17\">In <em>Catskill I, </em>we held that that the City of New York<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> violated the Clean Water Act by transferring turbid water<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> from the Schoharie Reservoir through the Shan-daken Tunnel into the Esopus Creek without an NPDES permit, because the transfer of turbid water into the Esopus Creek was an \u201caddition\u201d of a pollutant. 273 F.3d at 489-94. Following our remand in <em>Catskill I, </em>the district court assessed a $5,749,000 civil penalty against New York City and ordered the City to obtain a permit for the operation of the Shandaken Tunnel. The City\u2019s appeal from that ruling was resolved in <em>Catskill II, </em>in which we reaffirmed the holding of <em>Catskill I. Catskill II, </em>451 F.3d at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-18\">In both <em>Catskill I </em>and <em>Catskill II, </em>we applied the <em>Skidmore </em>deference standard to informal policy statements by the EPA that interpreted the same provision of the Act at issue here not to require NPDES permits for water transfers. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number><em>id. </em>at 83-84 &amp; n.5 (noting that under <em>Skid-more </em>\u201c[w]e ... defer to the' agency interpretation according to its \u2018power to persuade\u2019 \u201d and \u201cdeclinfing] to defer to the EPA[\u2019s]\u201d informal interpretation of the CWA as expressed in the Klee Memorandum (quoting <em>Mead, </em>533 U.S. at 235, 121 S.Ct. 2164)); <em>Catskill I, </em>273 F.3d at 490-91 (applying <em>Skidmore </em>to the EPA\u2019s position as expressed in informal policy statements and litigation positions, and concluding that \u201cwe do not find the EPA\u2019s position to be persuasive\u201d). <em>Skidmore </em>instructs that \u201cthe rulings, interpretations and opinions\u201d of an agency may constitute \u201ca body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.\u201d <em>Skidmore, </em>323 U.S. at 140, 65 S.Ct. 161. The appropriate level of deference accorded to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute under the <em>Skidmore </em>standard depends on the interpretation\u2019s \u201cpower to persuade,\u201d which in turn depends on, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, [and] its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This \u201capproach has produced a spectrum of judicial responses, from great respect at one end, to near indifference at the other.\u201d <em>Mead,, </em>533 U.S. at 228, 121 S.Ct. 2164 (internal citations omitted).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A9X\">Although the <em>Chevron </em>and <em>Skid-more </em>deference standards differ in application, they are similar in one respect: As with <em>Chevron </em>deference, we will defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation under the <em>Skidmore </em>standard only when the statutory language at issue is ambiguous. <em>See, e.g., Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>552 U.S. 312, 326, 128 S.Ct. 999, 169 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008) (suggesting that it is \u201cunnecessary\u201d to engage in <em>Skidmore </em>analysis if \u201cthe statute itself speaks clearly to the point at issue\u201d); <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. &amp; Affiliated Cos. v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>689 F.3d 191, 200 n.13 (2d Cir. 2012) (explaining that <em>Skidmore </em>analysis applies to \u201can agency\u2019s interpretation of an ambiguous statute\u201d); <em>Wong v. Doar, </em>571 F.3d 247, 258 (2d Cir. 2009) (concluding that \u201cCongress did not speak directly to the issue\u201d before proceeding to apply <em>Skidmore </em>deference); <em>see also Gen. Dynamics Land Sys., Inc. v.

As commentators have noted, although the Supreme Court has not explicitly stated \u201cthat <em>Skidmore </em>necessarily includes a \u2018step one\u2019 inquiry along the lines of <em>Chevron </em>[S]tep [0]ne[,] ... in practice, <em>Skidmore </em>generally does include a \u2018step one,\u2019 \u201d in which a court \u201cfirst review[s] the statute for a plain meaning [to] determin[e] [whether] the statute [is] ambiguous.\u201d Kristin E. Hickman <em>&amp; </em>Matthew D. Krueg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>er, <em>In Search of the Modem Skidmore Standard, </em>107 Colum. L. Rev. 1235, 1280 (2007) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">But as the dissent correctly notes, <em>see </em>Dissent at 541-42, it does not follow that a particular application of the <em>Skidmore </em>framework implies a threshold conclusion that the relevant statutory language is ambiguous. Although a court could first conclude that the text is unambiguous\u2014and therefore that <em>Skidmore </em>deference is inappropriate or unnecessary<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>\u2014it could instead engage in <em>Skidmore </em>analysis without answering this threshold question by considering the statutory text as one of several factors relevant to determining whether the agency interpretation has the \u201cpower to persuade.\u201d <em>Skidmore, </em>323 U.S. at 140, 65 S.Ct. 161. Yet even under this approach, courts will not rely on agency interpretations that are inconsistent with unambiguous statutory language. <em>See, e.g., EEOC v. Arabian American Oil, </em>499 U.S. 244, 257, 111 S.Ct. 1227, 113 L.Ed.2d 274 (1991) (declining to rely on an agency interpretation that \u201clack[ed] support in the plain language of the statute\u201d after considering the statutory language as one of several' factors relevant to <em>Skidmore </em>analysis).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, regardless of whether or not a court makes a threshold ambiguity determination, \u201cthe <em>Skidmore </em>standard implicitly replicates <em>Chevron\u2019s </em>first step.\u201d Hickman &amp; Krueger, <em>supra, </em>at 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"AFN\">Our application of the <em>Skidmore </em>deference standard in <em>Catskill I </em>and <em>Catskill II </em>makes clear that we did not decide and have not decided that the statutory language at issue in this case\u2014\u201caddition ... to navigable waters\u201d\u2014is unambiguous. Although we did not explicitly conclude in those cases that the statutory text was ambiguous, we made clear that we did not intend to foreclose the EPA from adopting a unitary-waters reading of the Act (i.e., waters of the United States means all of those waters rather than each of them) in a formal rule; indeed, we stated in <em>Catskill I </em>that \u201c[i]f the EPA\u2019s position had been adopted in a rulemaking or other formal proceeding, <em>[Chevron </em>] deference might be appropriate.\u201d <em>Catskill I, </em>273 F.3d at 490-91 &amp; n.2. This statement implies that we thought the relevant statutory text was at least possibly ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The few references to \u201cplain meaning\u201d in <em>Catskill I </em>and <em>Catskill II </em>do not compel a different conclusion. The crucial interpretive question framed by <em>Catskill </em>I\u2014 which we identified as the \u201ccrux\u201d of the appeal\u2014was \u201cthe meaning of \u2018addition,\u2019 which the Act does not define.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486. As the dissent points out, see Dissent at 543-44, we concluded in <em>Catskill I </em>that, based on the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of that term, the transfer of turbid water resulted in \u201can \u2018addition\u2019 of a \u2018pollutant\u2019 from a \u2018point source\u2019c <footnotemark>[21]</footnotemark> ... to a \u2018navigable water.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number><em>Catskill I, </em>273 F.3d at 492.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We do not, however, think that by referring to the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of \u201caddition\u201d in <em>Catskill I </em>we were holding that the broader statutory phrase \u201caddition ... to navigable waters\u201d <em>unambiguously </em>referred to a collection of individual \u201cnavigable waters\u201d\u2014such that the term \u201cto navigable waters\u201d could possibly mean only \u201cto <em>a </em>navigable water\u201d or \u201cto <em>any </em>navigable water,\u201d and not to \u201cnavigable waters\u201d in the collective singular (i.e., <em>\u201call </em>the qualifying navigable waters viewed as a single, \u2018unitary\u2019 entity\u201d). Nowhere in <em>Catskill I </em>did we state that \u201cnavigable waters\u201d or the broader phrase \u201caddition ... to navigable waters\u201d could bear only one meaning based on the unambiguous language contained in the statute. Such a statement would have been inconsistent with our acknowledgment that <em>Chevron </em>deference might be owed to a more formal agency interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Nor did we make any such statement in <em>Catskill II. </em>There, we began by succinctly summarizing <em>Catskill I </em>as \u201cconcluding that the discharge of water containing pollutants from one distinct water body into another is an \u2018addition of [a] pollutant\u2019 under the CWA.\u201d <em>Catskill II, </em>451 F.3d at 80 (brackets in original)' (citing <em>Catskill I, </em>273 F.3d at 491-93). We then again rejected the City\u2019s arguments in favor of reconsidering <em>Catskill I, </em>including its argument in favor of the \u201cunitary-water theory of navigable waters,\u201d essentially for the reasons stated in <em>Catskill I\u2014 </em>most importantly, that these arguments \u201csimply overlook[ed]\u201d the \u201cplain language\u201d and \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of the term \u201caddition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81-84. We also noted that in the then-recent <em>Miccosukee </em>decision, the Supreme Court noted the existence of the unitary-waters theory and raised possible arguments against it, providing further support for our rejection of the theo.-ry in <em>Catskill I. Catskill II, </em>451 F.3d at 83 (citing <em>Miccosukee, </em>541 U.S. at 105-09, 124 S.Ct. 1537). Nowhere did we state that the phrase \u201caddition ... to navigable waters\u201d was unambiguous such that it would preclude <em>Chevron </em>deference in the event that the EPA adopted a formal rule. We held only that the EPA\u2019s position, as expressed in an informal interpretation, was unpersuasive under the <em>Skid-more </em>framework. <em>Id. </em>at 83 &amp; n.5 (noting that under <em>Skidmore </em>\u201c[w]e ... defer to the agency interpretation according to its \u2018power to persuade\u2019\u201d and \u201cdeclin[ing] to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>defer to the EPA\u201d under that standard (quoting <em>Mead, </em>533 U.S. at '235, 121 S.Ct. 2164)).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The best interpretation of <em>Catskill I </em>and <em>Catskill II, </em>we think, is that those decisions set forth what those panels saw as the most persuasive reading of the phrase \u201caddition ... to navigable waters\u201d in light of how the word \u201caddition\u201d is plainly and ordinarily understood. <em>Catskill I </em>and <em>Catskill II </em>did not hold that \u201caddition ... to navigable waters\u201d could bear only one meaning, such that the EPA could not interpret the phrase differently in an interpretive rule. Therefore, as the district court concluded, neither <em>Catskill I </em>nor <em>Catskill II </em>requires us to resolve this appeal at <em>Chevron </em>Step One.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\n<em>B. Statutory Text, Structure, and Purpose</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Having determined that the meaning of the relevant provision of the Clean Water Act has not been resolved by prior case law, we turn to the overall statute and its context. In evaluating whether Congress has directly spoken to whether NPDES permits are required for water transfers, we employ the \u201ctraditional tools of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Li v. Renaud, </em>654 F.3d 376, 382 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843 n.9, 104 S.Ct. 2778). We examine the statutory text, structure, and purpose as reflected in its legislative history. <em>See id. </em>If the statutory text is ambiguous, we also examine canons of statutory construction. <em>See Lawrence </em>+ <em>Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>812 F.3d at 264; <em>see also Am. Farm Bureau Fed\u2019n v. EPA, </em>792 F.3d 281, 301 (3d Cir. 2015), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 136 S.Ct. 1246, 194 L.Ed.2d 176 (2016); <em>Heino v. Shinseki, </em>683 F.3d 1372, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2012); <em>EEOC v. Seafarers Int\u2019l Union, </em>394 F.3d 197, 203 (4th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">\n<em>1. Statutory text and structure.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">\u201cAs with any question of statutory interpretation, we begin with the text of the statute to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning.\u201d <em>Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A. v. LY USA Inc., </em>676 F.3d 83, 108 (2d Cir. 2012). The statutory language at issue is found in Sections 301, 402, and 502 of the Clean Water Act. Section 301(a) states that \u201c[e]xcept as in compliance with [the Act], the discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(a). Section 402(a)(1) states that the EPA may issue an NPDES permit allowing the \u201cdischarge of any pollutant, or combination of pollutants, notwithstanding [Section 301(a) ],\u201d so long as the discharge meets certain requirements specified by the Clean Water Act and the permit. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1342(a)(1). Section 502 defines the term \u201cdischarge of a poEutant,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201cany addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1362(12). Section 502 also defines the term \u201cnavigable waters\u201d as \u201cthe waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1362(7). But nowhere do these provisions speak directly to the question of whether an NPDES permit may be required for a water transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">Nor is the meaning of the relevant statutory text plain. The question, as we have indicated above, is whether \u201caddition of any pollutant to navigable waters\u201d\u2014or, \u201caddition of any pollutant to the waters of the United States\u201d\u2014refers to <em>all </em>navigable waters, meaning <em>all </em>of the waters of the United States viewed as a singular whole, or to <em>individual </em>navigable waters, meaning <em>one of </em>the waters of the United States. The term \u201cwaters\u201d may be used in either sense: As the Eleventh Circuit observed, \u201c[i]n ordinary usage \u2018waters\u2019 can collectively refer to several different bodies of water such as \u2018the waters of the Gulf coast,\u2019 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>can refer to any one body of water such as \u2018the waters of Mobile Bay.\u2019 \u201d <em>Friends I, </em>570 F.3d at 1223. The Supreme Court too has noted that the phrase \u201c[w]aters of the United States,\u201d as used in Section 502, is \u201cin some respects ambiguous.\u201d <em>Rapanos v. United States, </em>547 U.S. 715, 752, 126 S.Ct. 2208, 165 L.Ed.2d 159 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis removed). The statutory text yields no clear answer to the question before us; it could support either of the interpretations proposed by the parties.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, based on the text alone, we' remain at sea.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Unfortunately, placing this statutory language in the broader context of the Act as a whole does not help either. A statutory provision\u2019s plain meaning may be \u201cunderstood by looking to the statutory scheme as a whole and placing the particular provision within the context of that statute.\u201d <em>Louis Vuitton, </em>676 F.3d at 108 (quoting <em>Saks v. Franklin Covey Co., </em>316 F.3d 337, 345 (2d Cir. 2003)). \u201cIt is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Sturgeon v. Frost, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 136 S.Ct. 1061, 1070, 194 L.Ed.2d 108 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Roberts v. Sea-Land Servs., Inc., </em>566 U.S. 93, 132 S.Ct. 1350, 1357, 182 L.Ed.2d 341 (2012)). Examination of the other uses of the terms \u201cnavigable waters\u201d and \u201cwaters\u201d elsewhere in the Clean Water Act does not establish that these terms can bear only one meaning. The Clean Water Act sometimes regulates individual water bodies and other times entire water systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">As the plaintiffs and the dissent point out, several other provisions in the Clean Water Act suggest that \u201cnavigable waters\u201d refers to any of several individual water bodies, specifically the Act\u2019s references to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5p\">\u2022 \u201cthe navigable waters involved,\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(c)(2)(A), (c)(4);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-12\">\u2022 \u201cthose waters or parts thereof,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1313(d)(1)(B);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-13\">\u2022 \u201call navigable waters,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1314(a)(2);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-14\">\u2022 \u201cany navigable waters,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1314(f)(2)(F);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-15\">\u2022 \u201cthose waters within the State\u201d and \u201call navigable waters in such State,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1314(i)(l)(A)-(B);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-16\">\u2022 \u201call navigable waters in such State\u201d and \u201call navigable waters of such State,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1315(b)(l)(A)-(B); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-17\">\u2022 \u201cthe navigable waters within the jurisdiction of such State,\u201d \u201cnavigable waters within [the State\u2019s] jurisdiction,\u201d and \u201cany of the navigable waters,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1342.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-18\">But this pattern of usage does not establish that \u201cnavigable waters\u201d cannot ever refer to all waters as a singular whole because it also suggests that when Congress wants to make clear that it is using \u201cnavigable waters\u201d in a particular sense, it can and sometimes does provide additional language as a beacon to guide interpretation. <em>Cf. Rapanos, </em>547 U.S. at 732-33, 126 S.Ct. 2208 (holding that \u201c[t]he use of the definite article (\u2018the\u2019) and the plural number (\u2018waters\u2019)\u201d made clear that \u00a7 1362(7) is limited to \u201cfixed bodies of water,\u201d such as \u201cstreams, ... oceans, rivers, [and] lakes,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>and does not extend to \u201cordinarily dry channels through which water occasionally or intermittently flows\u201d).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> If Congress had thought about the question and meant for Section 502(12) of the Clean Water Act to refer to individual water bodies, it could have referred to something like \u201cany addition of any pollutant to <em>a navigable water </em>from any point source,\u201d or \u201cany addition of any pollutant to <em>any navigable water </em>from any point source.\u201d As the plaintiffs and the dissent would have it, the phrases \u201caddition to navigable waters,\u201d \u201caddition to a navigable water,\u201d and \u201caddition to any navigable water\u201d necessarily mean the same thing, at least in the context of the Act. We do not disagree that the phrases <em>could </em>be interpreted to have the same meaning, but we disagree that this interpretation is clearly and unambiguously mandated in light of how the terms \u201cnavigable waters\u201d and \u201cwaters\u201d are used in other sections of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">We thus see nothing in the language or structure of the Act that indicates that Congress clearly spoke to the precise question at issue: whether Congress intended to require NPDES permits for water transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\n<em>2. Statutory purpose and legislative history</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Inasmuch as the statutory text, context, and structure have yielded no definitive answer to the question before us, we conclude the first step of our <em>Chevron </em>analysis by looking to whether Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting the Clean Water Act establishes that the phrase \u201caddition ... to navigable waters\u201d can reasonably bear only one meaning. <em>See Gen. Dynamics, </em>540 U.S. at 600, 124 S.Ct. 1236 (using both statutory purpose and history at <em>Chevron </em>Step One). Beginning with the name of the statute, it seems clear enough that the predominant goal of the Clean Water Act is to.ensure that our nation\u2019s waters are \u201cclean,\u201d at least in the sense of being reasonably free of pollutants. The Act itself states that, its main objective is \u201cto restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a). The plaintiffs and the dissent argue that exempting water transfers from the NPDES permitting program could frustrate the achievement of this goal by allowing unmonitored transfers of polluted water from one water body to another. <em>Cf Catskill II, </em>451 F.3d at 81 (observing that a unitary-waters interpretation of navigable waters would allow for \u201cthe transfer of water from a heavily polluted, even toxic, water body to one that was pristine\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">As the Supreme Court has noted, however, \u201cno law pursues its purpose at all costs.\u201d <em>Rapanos, </em>547 U.S, at 752,126 S.Ct. 2208. We see no reason to think that the Clean Water Act is an exception. To the contrary, the Clean Water Act is \u201camong the most complex\u201d of federal statutes, and it \u201cbalances a welter of consistent and inconsistent goals,\u201d <em>Catskill I, </em>273 F.3d at 494, establishing a complicated scheme of federal regulation employing both federal and state implementation and supplemental state regulation, <em>see, e.g., </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(g) (federal agencies must cooperate with state and local governments to develop \u201ccomprehensive solutions\u201d for pollution \u201cin concert with ... managing water resources\u201d). In this regard, the Act largely preserves states\u2019 traditional authority over water allocation and use, while according <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>the EPA a degree of policymaking discretion and flexibility with respect to water quality standards\u2014both of which might well counsel against requiring NPDES permits for water transfers and instead in favor of letting the States determine what administrative regimen, if any, applies to water transfers. Accordingly, Congress\u2019s broad purposes and goals , in passing the Act do not alone establish that the Act unambiguously requires that water transfers be subject to NPDES permitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Even careful analysis of the Clean Water Act\u2019s legislative history does not help us answer the interpretive question before us. Although we are generally \u201creluctant to employ legislative history at step one of <em>Chevron </em>analysis,\u201d legislative history is at times helpful in resolving ambiguity; for example, when the \u201c\u2018interpretive clues [speak] almost unanimously,\u2019 making Congress\u2019s. intent clear \u2018beyond reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>Mizrahi v. Gonzales, </em>492 F.3d 156, 166 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting <em>Gen. Dynamics, </em>540 U.S. at 586, 590, 124 S.Ct. 1236). But here Congress has not. left us a trace of a clue as to its intent. The more than 3,000-page legislative history of the Clean Water Act appears to be silent, or very nearly so, as to the applicability of the NPDES permitting program to water transfers. <em>See generally </em>Comm, on Env\u2019t. &amp; Pub. Works, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., A Legislative History of the Clean Water Act of 1977 &amp; A Continuation of the Legislative History of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (1978); Comm, on Pub. Works, 93rd Cong., 1st Sess., A Legislative History of the Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (1973). As we noted in <em>Catskill I, </em>the legislative history does not speak to the meaning of the term \u201caddition\u201d standing alone, 273 F.3d at 493, suggesting that the history is similarly silent as. to the meaning of the broader phrase that includes this term, \u201caddition ... to navigable waters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Finally and tellingly, neither the parties nor <em>amici </em>have pointed us to any legislative history that clearly addresses the applicability of the NPDES permitting program to water transfers. What few examples from the legislative history they have cited\u2014such as the strengthening of the permit requirements in Section 301(b)(1)(C) to include water quality-based limits in addition to technology-based limitations, <em>see </em>William L. Andreen, <em>The Evolution of Water Pollution Control in the United States\u2014State, Local, and Federal Efforts, 1789-1972: Part II, </em>22 Stan. Envtl. L.J. 215, 270, 275-77 (2003), and broad aspirational statements about the elimination of water pollution and the need to regulate every point source by the report of the Senate\u2019s Environment and Public Works Committee, S. Rep. No. 92-414, at 3738, 3758 (1971), provide at most keyhole-view insights into Congress\u2019s intent. They do not speak to the issue before us with the \u201chigh level of clarity\u201d necessary to resolve the textual ambiguity before us at <em>Chevron </em>Step One. <em>Cohen v. JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co., </em>498 F.3d 111, 120 (2d Cir, 2007). The question is whether Congress has <em>\u201cdirectly </em>spoken,\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778, to whether NPDES permits are required for water transfers\u2014not whether it has made a stray or oblique reference to that issue here and .there.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">\n<em>3. Canons of statutory construction-</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">The traditional canons of statutory construction also provide no clear answer to the question whether Congress intended that the NPDES permitting system apply to water transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">First, the dissent asserts that the Water Transfers Rule violates the principle that \u201c \u2018[w]here Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence of evidence of contrary legislative intent,\u2019 \u201d <em>Hillman v. Maretta, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1943, 1953, 186 L.Ed.2d 43 (2013) (quoting <em>Andrus v. Glover Constr. Co., </em>446 U.S. 608, 616-17, 100 S.Ct. 1905, 64 L.Ed.2d 548 (1980)). <em>See </em>Dissent at 537-39. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, however, that canon of construction is not applicable where, as here, the issue is not whether to create an implied exception to a general prohibition, but the scope of the general prohibition itself.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Second, the plaintiffs invoke the canon of construction that a \u201cstatute should be interpreted in a way that avoids absurd results.\u201d <em>SEC v. Rosenthal, </em>650 F.3d 156, 162 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting <em>United States v. Venturella, </em>391 F.3d 120, 126 (2d Cir. 2004)). They again underscore their arguments concerning statutory purpose in arguing that by allowing for the unpermitted transfer of polluted water from one water body to another, the Water Transfers Rule is contrary to the Act\u2019s principal stated objective: \u201cto restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a). Additionally, the plaintiffs argue that the Water Transfers Rule may undermine the ability of downstream states to protect themselves from the pollution generated by upstream states.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The simplicity of the plaintiffs\u2019 approach helps cloak their arguments with considerable force. But we are ultimately not persuaded that they establish that the Clean Water Act unambiguously forecloses the EPA\u2019s interpretation in the Water Transfers Rule. Indeed, it is unclear to us how one can argue persuasively that the Water Transfers Rule leads to a result so absurd that the result could not possibly have been intended by Congress, while asserting at the same time that it codifies the EPA\u2019s practice of not issuing NPDES permits that has prevailed for decades without Congressional course-correction of any kind. In light of the immense importance of water transfers, it seems more likely that Congress has contemplated the very result that the plaintiffs argue is foreclosed by the Act, and acquiesced in that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Furthermore, as the plaintiffs would have it, the EPA and the States could not, consistent with the Clean Water Act, select <em>any </em>policy that does not improve water quality as much as is possible. But the Clean Water Act is more flexible than that. Far from establishing a maxi-malist scheme under which water quality must be pursued at all costs, the Act leaves a considerable amount of policymak-ing discretion in the hands of both the EPA and the States\u2014entirely understandably in light of its \u201cwelter of consistent and inconsistent goals.\u201d <em>Catskill I, </em>273 F.3d at 494. We cannot say that the Act could not reasonably be read to permit water transfers to be exempt from the NPDES permitting program, in light of the possibility that other measures will do. Athough the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>tension between the Rule\u2019s reading of the Act and the statute\u2019s overall goal of improving water quality casts some doubt on the reasonableness of the Rule, it may nevertheless be understandable and permissible if it furthers other objectives of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">We think that the legislative compromises embodied in the Act counsel against the application of the absurdity canon here. We generally apply that canon only \u201cwhere thp result of applying the plain language would be, in a genuine sense, absurd, <em>i.e., </em>where it is quite impossible that Congress could have intended the result and where the alleged absurdity is so clear as to be obvious to most anyone.\u201d <em>Pub. Citizen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>491 U.S. 440, 470-71, 109 S.Ct. 2558, 105 L.Ed.2d 377 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment) (citation omitted). Exempting water transfers from the NPDES program does not, we conclude, lead directly to a result so absurd it could not possibly have been contemplated by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">As to the effect of the Rule on downstream states, even in the absence of NPDES permitting for water transfers, the States can seek to protect themselves against polluted water transfers through other means\u2014for example, through filing a common-law nuisance or trespass lawsuit in the polluting state\u2019s courts, see, <em>e.g., Int'l Paper Co. v. Ouellette, </em>479 U.S. 481, 497-98, 107 S.Ct. 805, 93 L.Ed.2d 883 (1987)\u2014even if the protections provided by such lawsuits are less robust than those that would be available through the NPDES permitting program\u2019s application to transfers.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The inconsistency of the Water Transfers Rule with the Clean Water Act\u2019s primary objective may be a strike against its reasonableness, but only one strike, which is not enough for the EPA\u2019s position to be \u201cout.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Third, arguing to the contrary, the defendants and <em>amicus curiae </em>State of California argue that we should reject the plaintiffs\u2019 preferred interpretation of Section 402 of the Clean Water Act (i.e., that permits are required for water transfers) based on a clear-statement rule and principles of federalism derived from the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, </em>531 U.S. 159, 121 S.Ct. 675, 148 L.Ed.2d 576 (2001) <em>(\u201cS WANCC\u2019), </em>and <em>Rapanos, </em>as well as the Tenth Amendment. If that were so, it would make our task much easier. But we think it is incorrect. To the extent that <em>SWANCC </em>and <em>Rapanos </em>establish a clear-statement rule, it does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">In <em>SWANCC, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the \u201cMigratory Bird Rule\u201d issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the \u201cCorps\u201d) under which the Corps asserted jurisdiction pursuant to Section 404(a) of the Clean Water Act to require permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material into intrastate waters used as habitat by migratory birds. <em>SWANCC, </em>531 U.S. at 163-64, 121 S.Ct. 675. The Rule applied even to small, isolated ponds located entirely within a single state, such as those located in the abandoned sand and gravel pit there at issue. <em>See id. </em>at 163-65, 121 S.Ct. 675. The Court reasoned that, \u201c[w]here an administrative interpretation of a statute invokes the outer limits of Congress\u2019 power, [it] expect[s] a clear indication that Congress intended that result,\u201d and that \u201c[t]his concern is heightened where the administrative interpretation alters the federal-state framework by permitting federal encroachment upon a tradi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>tional state power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172-73, 121 S.Ct. 675. Thus, \u201cwhere an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173, 121 S.Ct. 675 (quoting <em>Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Fla. Gulf Coast Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council, </em>485 U.S. 568, 575, 108 S.Ct. 1392, 99 L.Ed.2d 645 (1988)). The Supreme Court rejected the Corps\u2019 interpretation because (1) the Migratory Bird Rule \u201craise[d] significant constitutional questions\u201d with respect to Congress\u2019s authority under the Commerce Clause; (2) Congress had not clearly stated \u201cthat it intended \u00a7 404(a) to reach an abandoned sand and gravel pit\u201d; and (3) the Corps\u2019 interpretation of Section 404(a) \u201cwould result in a significant impingement of the States\u2019 traditional and primary power over land and water use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173-74, 121 S.Ct. 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In <em>Rapanos, </em>a plurality of the Supreme Court rejected the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act as providing authority to regulate isolated wetlands lying near ditches or artificial drains that eventually empty into \u201cnavigable waters\u201d because the wetlands are adjacent to \u201cwaters of the United States.\u201d <em>Rapanos, </em>547 U.S. at 723-24, 729, 739, 126 S.Ct. 2208. The plurality rejected the interpretation because it \u201cwould authorize the Corps to function as a <em>de facto </em>regulator of immense stretches of intrastate land,\u201d which was impermissible because a \u201c \u2018clear and manifest\u2019 statement from Congress\u201d is required \u201cto authorize an unprecedented intrusion\u201d into an area of \u201ctraditional state authority\u201d such as the regulation of land use. <em>Id. </em>at 738, 126 S.Ct. 2208 (citation omitted). Citing <em>SWANCC, </em>the Court also noted that \u201cthe Corps\u2019 interpretation stretches the outer limits of Congress\u2019s commerce power and raises difficult questions about the ultimate scope of that power,\u201d which further counseled in favor of requiring a clear statement from Congress in order to authorize such jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>SWANCC, </em>531 U.S. at 173, 121 S.Ct. 675).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The clear-statement rule articulated in <em>SWANCC </em>and <em>Rapanos </em>does not apply here. The case at bar presents no question regarding Congress\u2019s authority under the Commerce Clause, inasmuch as it is undisputed that Congress has the power to regulate navigable waters and to delegate its authority to do so. <em>SWANCC </em>and <em>Rapanos </em>both involved attempts by the Army Corps of Engineers to extend the scope of the phrase \u201cnavigable waters\u201d to include areas not traditionally understood to be such. They were therefore treated as attempts by the Corps to stretch the limits of its delegated authority vis-\u00e1-vis the States. Here, the EPA is not seeking to expand the universe of waters deemed to be \u201cnavigable.\u201d The question before us is not whether the EPA has the authority to regulate water transfers; it is whether the EPA is using (or not using) that authority in a permissible manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The Clean Water Act was <em>designed </em>to alter the federal-state balance with respect to the regulation of water quality. Congress passed the Act precisely because it found inconsistent state-by-state regulation not up to the task of restoring and maintaining the integrity of the nation\u2019s waters. <em>See </em>S. Rep. No. 95-370, at 1 (1977) (the Act is intended to be a \u201ccomprehensive revision of national water quality policy\u201d). True, as the defendants point out, water allocation is an area of traditional state authority. But again, we are concerned here not with water allocation, but with water quality. We know of no authority or accepted principle that would require a \u201cclear statement\u201d by Congress before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>the EPA could adopt the plaintiffs\u2019 preferred interpretation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Fourth, and finally, several of the defendants raise the related argument that requiring permits for water transfers under the plaintiffs\u2019 preferred interpretation would pose a serious Tenth Amendment<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> problem because it would upset the traditional balance of federal and state power with respect to water regulation. This, in turn, would violate the canon of constitutional avoidance, which provides that if one of two competing statutory interpretations \u201cwould raise a multitude of constitutional problems, the other should prevail.\u201d <em>Clark v. Martinez, </em>543 U.S. 371, 380-81, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005); <em>see also FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., </em>556 U.S. 502, 516, 129 S.Ct. 1800, 173 L.Ed.2d 738 (2009) (\u201cThe so-called canon of constitutional avoidance is an interpretive tool, counseling that ambiguous statutory language be construed to avoid serious constitutional doubts.\u201d). These defendants argue that the EPA\u2019s interpretation must prevail because it avoids this constitutional problem,</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">But the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed interpretation raises no Tenth Amendment concerns that we can discern because it would not result in federal overreach into states\u2019 traditional authority to allocate water quantities. The Clean Water Act\u2019s preservation of states\u2019 water-allocation authority \u201cdo[es] not limit the scope of water pollution controls that may be imposed on users who have obtained, pursuant to state law, a water allocation.\u201d <em>PUD No. 1 of Jefferson Cty. v. Wash. Dep\u2019t of Ecology, </em>511 U.S. 700, 720, 114 S.Ct. 1900, 128 L.Ed.2d 716 (1994). As we noted in <em>Catskill II, </em>the \u201cflexibility built into the [Act] and the NPDES permit scheme,\u201d which includes variances, general permits, and the consideration of costs in setting effluent limitations, \u201callow[s] federal authority over quality regulation and state authority over quantity allocation to coexist without materially impairing either.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> 451 F.3d at 85-86. The resolution of this appeal is not dictated by a clear-statement rule or the Tenth Amendment, but rather by straightforward considerations of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">We conclude, then, that Congress did not in the Clean Water Act speak directly to the question of whether NPDES permits are required for water transfers.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Act is therefore silent or ambiguous as to this question, which means that this case cannot be resolved by the Step One analysis under <em>Chevron. See also Friends I, </em>570 F.3d at 1227 (similarly concluding at <em>Chevron </em>Step One that the statutory phrase \u201caddition .,. to navigable waters\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>is ambiguous). Accordingly, we proceed to Step Two. <em>See New York v. FERC, </em>783 F.3d 946, 954 (2d Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">II. <em>Chevron </em>Step Two</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">At last, we reach the application of the second step of <em>Chevron </em>analysis, upon which our decision to reverse the district court\u2019s judgment turns. We conclude that the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act is reasonable and neither arbitrary nor capricious. Although the Rule may or may not be the best or most faithful interpretation of the Act in light of its paramount goal of restoring and protecting the quality of U.S. waters, it is supported by several valid arguments\u2014interpretive, theoretical, and practical. And the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the Act as reflected in the Rule seems to us to be precisely the kind of policymaking decision that <em>Chevron </em>is designed to protect from overly intrusive judicial review. As we have already pointed out, although we might prefer a different rule more clearly guaranteed to reach the environmental concerns underlying the Act, <em>Chevron </em>analysis requires us to recognize that our preference does not matter. We conclude that the Water Transfers Rule satisfies <em>Chevron\u2019s </em>deferential standard of review, and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\n<em>A. Legal Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The question for the reviewing court at <em>Chevron </em>Step Two is \u201cwhether the agency\u2019s answer [to the interpretive question] is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Mayo Found. for Med. Educ. &amp; Research v. United States, </em>562 U.S. 44, 54, 131 S.Ct. 704, 178 L.Ed.2d 588 (2011) (quoting <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778).

Brovm &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>529 U.S. 120, 159, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000).

An agency interpretation would surely be \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201ccapricious\u201d if it were picked out of a hat, or arrived at with no explanation, even if it might otherwise be deemed reasonable on some unstated ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In the course of its <em>Chevron </em>Step Two analysis, the district court incorporated the standard for evaluating agency action under APA \u00a7 706(2)(A) set forth in <em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, </em>463 U.S. 29, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983) <em>(\u201cState Farm\u201d), </em>a much stricter and more exacting review of the agency\u2019s rationale and deci-sionmaking process than the <em>Chevron </em>Step Two standard. Under that section, a reviewing court may set aside an agency action if it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). In <em>State Farm, </em>the Supreme Court explained that under Section 706(2)(A),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZBI\">an agency rule would be arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">463 U.S. at 43, 103 S.Ct. 2856. On appeal, the plaintiffs urge us to incorporate the <em>State Farm </em>standard into our <em>Chevron </em>Step Two analysis, and to affirm the district court\u2019s vacatur of the Rule for essentially the same reasons stated by the court. While we have great respect for the district court\u2019s careful and searching analysis of the EPA\u2019s rationale for the Water Transfers Rule, we conclude that it erred by incorporating the <em>State Farm </em>standard into its <em>Chevron </em>Step Two analysis and thereby applying too strict a standard of review. .An agency\u2019s initial interpretation of a statutory.provision should be evaluated only under the <em>Chevron </em>framework, which does not incorporate the <em>State Farm </em>standard. <em>State Farm </em>review may be appropriate in a case involving a non-interpretive rule or a rule setting forth a changed interpretation of a statute; but that is not so in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">As the Supreme Court, our Circuit, and other Courts of Appeals have made reasonably clear, <em>State Farm </em>and <em>Chevron </em>provide for related but distinct standards for reviewing rules promulgated by administrative agencies. <em>See, e.g., Encino, </em>136 S.Ct. at 2125-26; <em>Judulang v. Holder, </em>565 U.S. 42, 132 S.Ct. 476, 483 n.7, 181 L.Ed.2d 449 (2011); <em>Nat. Res. Def. Council, </em>808 F.3d at 569; <em>New York v. FERC, </em>783 F.3d at 958; <em>Pub. Citizen, Inc. v.

Cir. 2005); <em>Arent v. Shalala, </em>70 F.3d 610, 619 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (Wald, J., concurring). <em>State Farm </em>is used to evaluate whether a rule is procedurally defective as a result of flaws in the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process. <em>See Encino, </em>136 S.Ct. at 2125; <em>FERC v. Elec. Power Supply Ass\u2019n, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 760, 784, 193 L.Ed.2d 661 (2016). <em>Chevron, </em>by contrast, is generally used to evaluate whether the conclusion reached as a result of that process\u2014an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statutory provision it administers\u2014is reasonable. <em>See Encino, </em>136 S.Ct. at 2125; <em>Entergy, </em>556 U.S. at 217-18, 129 S.Ct. 1498. A litigant challenging a rule may challenge it under <em>State Farm, Chevron, </em>or both. As Judge Wald explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>there are certainly situations where a challenge to an agency\u2019s regulation will fall squarely within one rubric, rather than the other. For example, we might invalidate an agency\u2019s decision under <em>Chevron </em>as inconsistent with its statutory mandate, even though we do not believe the decision reflects an arbitrary policy choice. Such a result might occur when we believe the agency\u2019s course of action to be the most appropriate and effective means of achieving a goal, but determine that Congress has selected a different\u2014albeit, in our eyes, less propitious\u2014path. Conversely, we might determine that although not barred by statute, an agency\u2019s action is arbitrary and capricious because the agency has not considered certain relevant factors or articulated any rationale for its choice. Or, along similar lines, we might find a regulation arbitrary and capricious, while deciding that <em>Chevron </em>is inapplicable because Congress\u2019 delegation to the agency is so broad as to be virtually unreviewable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><em>Arent, </em>70 F.3d at 620 (Wald, J., concurring) (citation and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Much confusion about the relationship between <em>State Farm </em>and <em>Chevron </em>seems to arise because both standards purport to provide a method by which to evaluate whether an agency action is \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201ccapricious,\u201d and <em>Chevron </em>Step Two analysis and <em>State Farm </em>analysis often, though not always, take the same factors into consideration and therefore overlap. <em>See Judulang, </em>132 S.Ct. at 483 n.7 (stating, in a case governed by the <em>State Farm </em>standard, that had the Supreme Court applied <em>Chevron, </em>the \u201canalysis would be the same, because under <em>Chevron </em>step two, we ask whether an agency interpretation is arbitrary or capricious in substance\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Pharm. Research &amp; Mfrs. of Am. v. FTC, </em>790 F.3d 198, 204 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (noting that it is \u201coften the case\u201d that an agency\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of its authority under <em>Chevron </em>Step Two overlaps with our arbitrary and capricious review under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)\u201d); <em>Am. Petroleum Inst. v. EPA, </em>216 F.3d 50, 57 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (\u201cThe second step of <em>Chevron </em>analysis and <em>State Farm </em>arbitrary and capricious review overlap, but are not identical.\u201d). We read the case law to stand for the proposition that where a litigant brings both a <em>State Farm </em>challenge and a <em>Chevron </em>challenge to a rule, and the <em>State Farm </em>challenge is successful, there is no need for the reviewing court to engage in <em>Chevron </em>analysis. As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201cwhere a proper challenge is raised to the agency procedures, and those procedures are defective, a court should not accord <em>Chevron </em>deference to the agency interpretation.\u201d <em>Encino, </em>136 S.Ct. at 2125.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In other words, if an interpretive rule was promulgated in a procedurally defective manner, it will be set aside regardless of whether its interpretation of the statute is reasonable. If the rule is not defective under <em>State Farm, </em>though, that conclusion does not avoid the need for a <em>Chevron </em>analysis, which does not incorporate the <em>State Farm </em>standard of review. In fact, in many recent cases, we have applied <em>Chev</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number><em>ron </em>Step Two without applying <em>State Farm, </em>or conducting an exacting review of the agency\u2019s decisionmaking and rationale. <em>See, e.g., Stryker v. SEC, </em>780 F.3d 163, 167 (2d Cir. 2015); <em>Florez v. Holder, </em>779 F.3d 207, 211-12 (2d Cir. 2015); <em>Lee, </em>701 F.3d at 937; <em>Adams, </em>692 F.3d at 95; <em>WPIX, Inc. v. ivi, Inc., </em>691 F.3d 275 (2d Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Several other considerations also counsel against employing the searching <em>State Farm </em>standard of review of the agency\u2019s decisionmaking and rationale at <em>Chevron </em>Step Two. The Supreme Court has decided that agencies are not obligated to conduct detailed fact-finding or cost-benefit analy-ses when interpreting a statute\u2014which suggests that the full-fledged <em>State Farm </em>standard may not apply to rules that set forth for the first time an agency\u2019s interpretation of a particular statutory provision. <em>See, e.g., Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. LTV Corp., </em>496 U.S. 633, 651-52, 110 S.Ct. 2668, 110 L.Ed.2d 579 (1990) (an agency may interpret an ambiguous statutory provision by making \u201cjudgments about the way the real world works\u201d without making formal factual findings); <em>Entergy, </em>556 U.S. at 223, 129 S.Ct. 1498 (absent statutory language to the contrary, an agency is not required to conduct cost-benefit analysis under Chevron); <em>Am. Textile Mfrs. Inst., Inc. v. Donovan, </em>452 U.S. 490, 510, 101 S.Ct. 2478, 69 L.Ed.2d 185 (1981) (\u201cWhen Congress has intended that an agency engage in cost-benefit analysis, it has clearly indicated such intent on the face of the statute.\u201d). These decisions seem to establish that while an agency may support its statutory interpretation with factual materials or cost-benefit analyses, an agency need not do so in order for its interpretation to be regarded as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Further, the Supreme Court has cautioned that <em>State Farm </em>is \u201cinapposite to the extent that it may be read as prescribing more searching judicial review\u201d in a case involving an agency\u2019s \u201cfirst interpretation of a new statute.\u201d <em>Verizon Commc\u2019ns Inc. v. FCC, </em>535 U.S. 467, 502 n.20, 122 S.Ct. 1646, 152 L.Ed.2d 701 (2002); <em>see also Judulang, </em>132 S.Ct. at 483 n.7 (stating that' \u201cstandard arbitrary or capricious review under the APA\u201d was appropriate because the agency action at issue was \u201cnot an interpretation of any statutory language\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)). Dovetailing with this point, the Supreme Court held in <em>Brand X </em>and <em>Fox Television Stations </em>that when an agency changes its interpretation of a particular statutory provision, this change is reviewable under APA \u00a7 706(2)(A), and will be set aside if the agency has failed to provide a \u201creasoned explanation ... for disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or were engendered by the prior policy.\u201d <em>Fox Television, </em>556 U.S. at 516, 129 S.Ct. 1800; <em>Brand X, </em>545 U.S. at 981, 125 S.Ct. 2688 (explaining that \u201c[unexplained inconsistency\u201d is \u201ca reason for holding an [agency] interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change from agency practice under the [APA]\u201d). Of course, if <em>all </em>interpretive rules were reviewable under APA \u00a7 706(2)(A) and the <em>State Farm </em>standard, these pronouncements in <em>Brand X </em>and <em>Fox Television Stations </em>would have been unnecessary. We also note that applying a reasonableness standard to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking and rationale at <em>Chevron </em>Step Two instead of a heightened <em>State Farm-type </em>standard promotes respect for agencies\u2019 policymaking discretion and promotes policymaking flexibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">For these reasons, the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the Water Transfers Rule is properly analyzed under the <em>Chevron </em>framework, which does not incorporate the <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number><em>Farm </em>standard.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We will therefore address only whether the EPA provided a reasoned rationale for the Water Transfers Rule, and whether the Rule\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act is reasonable. As to the former, the question is not whether the EPA\u2019s reasoning was flawless, impervious to counterarguments, or complete\u2014the EPA only must have provided a reasoned explanation for its action.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\n<em>B. Reasoned Rationale for the EPA\u2019s Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">We conclude that the EPA provided a reasoned explanation for its decision in the Water Transfers Rule to interpret the Clean Water Act as not requiring NPDES permits for water transfers. We can see from the EPA\u2019s rationale how and why it arrived at the interpretation of the Clean Water Act set forth in the Water Transfers Rule. It is clear that the EPA based the Rule on a holistic interpretation of the Clean Water Act that took into account the statutory language, the broader statutory scheme, the statute\u2019s legislative history, the EPA\u2019s longstanding position that water transfers are not subject to NPDES permitting, congressional concerns that the statute not unnecessarily burden water quantity management activities, and the importance of water transfers to U.S. infrastructure. <em>See </em>Water Transfers Rule, 73 Fed. Reg. at 33,699-33,703.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">In the Water Transfers Rule, the EPA analyzed the text of the statute, explaining how its interpretation was justified by its understanding of the phrase \u201cthe waters of the United States,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 33,701, as well as by the broader statutory scheme, noting that the Clean Water Act provides for several programs and regulatory initiatives other than the NPDES permitting program that could be used to mitigate pollution caused by water transfers, <em>id. </em>at 33,701-33,702. The EPA also justified the Rule by reference to statutory purpose, noting its view that \u201cCongress intended to leave primary oversight of water transfers to state authorities in cooperation with Federal authorities,\u201d and that Congress intended to create a \u201cbalance ... between federal and State oversight of activities affecting the nation\u2019s waters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33.701. The EPA also stated that subjecting water transfers to NPDES permitting could affect states\u2019 ability to effectively allocate water and water rights, <em>id. </em>at 33.702, and explained how its interpretation was justified in light of the Act\u2019s legislative history, <em>see id. </em>at 33,703. The EPA concluded by addressing several public comments on the Rule, and explaining in a reasoned manner why it rejected proposed alternative readings of the Clean Water Act. <em>See id. </em>at 33,703-33,706.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">This rationale, while not immune to criticism or counterargument, was sufficiently reasoned to clear Chevron\u2019s rather minimal requirement that the agency give a reasoned explanation for its interpretation. We see nothing illogical in the EPA\u2019s rationale.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> \u00edhe agency provided a sufficient<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>ly reasoned explanation for its interpretation of the Clean Water Act in the Water Transfers Rule. The Rule\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act was therefore not adopted in an \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201ccapricious\u201d manner. Accordingly, we must address whether the Rule\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act was, ultimately, reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\n<em>C. Reasonableness of the EPA\u2019s Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Having concluded that the EPA offered a sufficient explanation for adopting the Rule, we next examine whether the Rule reasonably interprets the Clean Water Act. We conclude that it does. The EPA\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act as reflected in the Rule is supported by several valid arguments\u2014interpretive, theoretical, and practical. The permissibility of the Rule is reinforced by longstanding practice and acquiescence by Congress, recent case law, practical concerns regarding compliance costs, and the existence of alternative means for regulating pollution resulting from water transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">First, as far as we have been able to determine, in the nearly forty years since the passage of the Clean Water Act, water transfers have never been subject to a general NPDES permitting requirement. Congress thus appears to have, however silently, acquiesced in this state of affairs. This may well reflect an intent not to require NPDES permitting to be imposed in every situation in which it might be required, including as a means for regulating water transfers. This in turn suggests that the EPA\u2019s unitary-waters interpretation of Section 402 of the Act in the Water Transfers Rule is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Second, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miccosukee </em>and the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Friends I </em>support this conclusion. <em>Miccosukee </em>was decided before the EPA issued the Water Transfers Rule and, absent the interpretation of an agency rule, did not involve the application of <em>Chevron. </em>It was a citizen suit against the South Florida Water Management District (the \u201cDistrict\u201d), which is also an intervenor-defendant in the instant proceedings. The <em>Miccosukee </em>plaintiffs argued that the District was impermissibly operating a pumping facility without an NPDES permit. 541 U.S. at 98-99, 124 S.Ct. 1587. The district court granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs; the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 99, 124 S.Ct. 1587. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case on the ground that granting summary judgment was inappropriate because further factual findings as to whether the two water bodies at issue were meaningfully distinct were necessary. <em>Id. </em>In its decision, the Supreme Court addressed three key questions. First, it asked whether the definition of \u201cdischarge of a pollutant\u201d in Section 502 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(12)) reaches point sources that do not themselves generate pollutants. The Court held that it does. <em>Miccosukee, </em>541 U.S. at 105,124 S.Ct. 1537.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">Second, the Court addressed whether \u201call the water bodies that fall within the Act\u2019s definition of \u2018navigable waters\u2019 (that is, all \u2018the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,\u2019 \u00a7 1362(7)) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>should be viewed unitarily for purposes of NPDES permitting requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105-06, 124 S.Ct. 1537. The Court declined to defer to the EPA\u2019s \u201clongstanding\u201d view to that effect because \u201cthe Government d[id] not identify any administrative documents in which [the] EPA ha[d] espoused that position\u201d; in point of fact, \u201cthe agency once reached the opposite conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107, 124 S.Ct. 1537. As the dissent points out, the Supreme Court suggested that it took a dim view of the unitary-waters reading of the CWA, stating that: \u201cseveral NPDES provisions might be read to suggest a view contrary to the unitary-waters approach\u201d; \u201c[t]he \u2018unitary waters\u2019 approach could also conflict with current NPDES regulations\u201d; and \u201c[t]he NPDES program ... appears to address the movement of pollutants among water bodies, at least at times.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107-8, 124 S.Ct. 1537. But the Court also seemed to acknowledge that the statute could be interpreted in different ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">It may be that construing the NPDES program to cover such transfers would therefore raise the costs of water distribution prohibitively, and violate Congress\u2019 specific instruction that \u201cthe authority of each State to allocate quantities of water within its jurisdiction shall not be superseded, abrogated or otherwise impaired\u201d by the Act. \u00a7 1251(g). On the other hand, it may be that such permitting authority is necessary to protect water quality, and that the States or EPA could control regulatory costs by issuing general permits to point sources associated with water distribution programs. <em>See </em>40 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 122.28, 123.25 (2003).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 108, 124 S.Ct. 1537. Ultimately, the Court declined to rule on the unitary-waters theory because the parties did not raise the argument before the Eleventh Circuit or in their briefs supporting and opposing the Court\u2019s grant of <em>certiorari. </em>Instead, the Court did no more than note that unitary-waters arguments would be open to the parties on remand. <em>Id. </em>at 109, 124 S.Ct. 1537.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Third, the Supreme Court addressed whether a triable issue of fact existed as to whether the water transfer at issue was between \u201cmeaningfully distinct\u201d water bodies, and thus required an NPDES permit. The Court held that such a triable issue did exist, and vacated and remanded for further fact-finding. <em>Id. </em>at 109-12, 124 S.Ct. 1537. The Court stated that if after reviewing the full record, the district court concluded that the water transfer was not between two meaningfully distinct bodies of water, then the District would not need to obtain an NPDES permit in order to operate the pumping facility. <em>Id. </em>at 112, 124 S.Ct. 1537. Thus, it seems as though the purpose of the remand was (a) to address the parties\u2019 unitary-waters arguments as a preliminary legal matter, and (b) to engage in fact-finding necessary to resolve the case if the argument as to unitary-waters did not prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">With respect to the unitary-waters interpretation of Section 402, then, <em>Miccosukee </em>suggested that a unitary-waters interpretation of the statute was unlikely to prevail because it was not the <em>best </em>reading of the statute, but did not conclude that it was an <em>unreasonable </em>reading of the statute. By acknowledging the arguments against requiring NPDES permits for water transfers, and noting that unitary-waters arguments would be open to the parties on remand, the Court can be read to have suggested that such arguments are reasonable, even if not, in the Court\u2019s view, preferable.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">This interpretation of <em>Miccosukee </em>is reflected in subsequent case law interpreting that decision. In <em>Catskill II, </em>we expressed our view that <em>\u201cMiccosukee </em>did no more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>than note the existence of the [unitary-waters] theory and raise possible arguments against it.\u201d 451 F.3d at 83. And in <em>Friends I, </em>the Eleventh Circuit concluded, despite its discussion of <em>Miccosukee, </em>that the Water Transfers Rule\u2019s interpretation of the CWA <em>is </em>entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference. <em>See Friends I, </em>570 F.3d at 1217-18, 1225,1228.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"><em>Friends I </em>provides further support for the reasonableness of the Rule\u2019s interpretation. Like <em>Miccosukee, </em>the decision addressed whether the District was required to obtain NPDES permits to conduct certain specified water transfers. <em>See Friends I, </em>570 F.3d at 1214. This time, however, the issue was addressed <em>after </em>the EPA had issued the Water Transfers Rule, and the deferential framework of <em>Chevron </em>therefore applied. In <em>Friends I, </em>the parties did not contest that the donor water bodies (canals from which water was pumped into Lake Okeechobee) and the receiving water body (the lake) were \u201cnavigable waters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1216. Because under <em>Miccosukee </em>the NPDES \u201cpermitting requirement does not apply unless the bodies of water are meaningfully distinct,\u201d the question was therefore \u201cwhether moving an existing pollutant from one navigable water body to another is an \u2018addition ... to navigable waters\u2019 of that pollutant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1216 &amp; n.4 (quoting 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(12)). The District argued, based on the \u201cunitary waters theory,\u201d that \u201cit is not an \u2018addition ... to navigable waters\u2019 to move existing pollutants from one navigable water to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1217. \u201cAn addition occurs, under this theory, only when pollutants first enter navigable waters from a point source, not when they are moved between navigable waters.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A1_\">The Eleventh Circuit agreed. It began its analysis by surveying relevant prior decisions, noting that \u201c[t]he unitary waters theory has a low batting average. In fact, it has struck out in every court of appeals where it has come up to the plate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(collecting cases). In the time since those decisions were issued, however, there \u201cha[d] been a change. An important one. Under its regulatory authority, the EPA ha[d then-]recently issued a regulation adopting a final rule specifically addressing this very question. Because that regulation was, not available at the time of the earlier decisions,\u201d including <em>Catskill I, Catskill II, </em>and <em>Miccosukee, </em>\u201cthey [we]re not precedent against it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1218. Therefore, the question before the Court was whether to give <em>Chevron </em>deference to the Rule. \u201cAll that matters is whether the regulation is a reasonable construction of an ambiguous statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1219. The cases on which the plaintiffs relied\u2014which included <em>Catskill I, Catskill II, </em>and <em>Micco-</em>sukee\u2014were therefore unhelpful because there was then no formal rule to which to apply the <em>Chevron </em>framework. \u201cDeciding how best to construe statutory language is not the same thing as deciding whether a particular construction is within the ballpark of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1221.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The court then engaged in a <em>Chevron </em>analysis strikingly similar to the one we are tasked with conducting here. As to the plain meaning of the statutory language, the Eleventh Circuit determined that the key question was whether \u201c \u2018to navigable waters\u2019 means to <em>all </em>navigable waters as a singular whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1223 (emphasis in original). This question could not be resolved by looking to the common meaning of the word \u201cwaters,\u201d which could be used to refer to several different bodies of water collectively (e.g., \u201cthe waters of the Gulf coast\u201d) or to a single body of water (e.g., \u201cthe waters of Mobile Bay\u201d). <em>Id. </em>After examining the statutory language in the context of the Clean Water Act as a whole, the court then noted that Congress knew how to use the term \u201cany navigable waters\u201d in other statutory provisions when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>it wanted to protect individual water bodies (even though it at times used the unmodified term \u201cnavigable waters\u201d for the same meaning), and determined that the Act\u2019s goals were so broad as to be unhelpful in answering this difficult, specific question. <em>See id. </em>at 1224-27. The court therefore concluded that the statutory language was ambiguous, and that the EPA\u2019s unitary-waters reading of Section 402 was reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 1227-28. The Court of Appeals explained, using an analogy we think is applicable to in the case before us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjE\">Sometimes it is helpful to strip a legal question of the contentious policy interests attached to it and think about it in the abstract using a hypothetical. Consider the issue this way: Two buckets sit side by side, one with four marbles in it and the other with none. There is a rule prohibiting \u201cany addition of any marbles to buckets by any person.\u201d A person comes along, picks up two marbles from the first bucket, and drops them into the second bucket. Has the marble-mover \u201cadd[ed] any marbles to buckets\u201d? On one hand, as the [plaintiffs] might argue, there are now two marbles in a bucket where there were none before, so an addition of marbles has occurred. On the other hand, as the [District] might argue and as the EPA would decide, there were four marbles in buckets before, and there are still four marbles in buckets, so no addition of marbles has occurred. Whatever position we might take if we had to pick one side or the other we cannot say that either side is unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1228 (first brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Following <em>Friends I, </em>the Eleventh Circuit in <em>Friends II </em>dismissed several petitions for direct appellate review of the Water Transfers Rule on the grounds that the Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction under the Act (specifically, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1369(b)(1)(E), (F)) and could not exercise hypothetical jurisdiction. <em>Friends II, </em>699 F.3d at 1286-89. In the course of doing so, the Eleventh Circuit clarified its holding in <em>Friends I </em>that \u201cthe water-transfer rule was a reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous provision of the Clean Water Act,\u201d and therefore passed muster under <em>Chevron\u2019s </em>deferential standard of review. <em>Id. </em>at 1285. We are in general agreement with the <em>Friends I </em>approach, and in complete agreement with its conclusion that we must give <em>Chevron </em>deference to the EPA\u2019s interpretation of Section 402 of the Act in the Water Transfers Rule.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Another factor favoring the reasonableness of the Water Transfers Rule\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act is that compliance with an NPDES permitting scheme for water transfers is likely to be burdensome and costly for permittees, and may disrupt existing water transfer systems. For instance, several intervenor-de-fendant water districts assert that it could cost an estimated $4.2 billion to treat just the most significant water transfers in the Western United States, and that obtaining an NPDES permit and complying with its conditions could cost a single water provider hundreds of millions of dollars. <em>See </em>Water Districts Br. 21. Similarly, intervenor-defendant New York City submits that if it is not granted the permanent variances it has requested in its most recent permit application, it will be forced to construct an expensive water-treatment plant, <em>see </em>NYC Br. 22-23, 28-30, 35-37, 55-56, and <em>amicus curiae </em>the State of California argues that requiring NPDES permits would put a significant financial and logistical strain on the California State Water Project, <em>see </em>State of California <em>Amicus </em>Br. 16. Further, <em>amici curiae </em>the American Farm Bureau Federation and Florida Farm Bureau Federation argue that the invalidation of the Water Transfers Rule would (i) throw the status of agricultural water-flow plans into doubt, and (ii) require state water agencies to increase revenues to pay for permits for levies and dams, which they would likely accomplish by raising agricultural and property taxes, and which in turn would raise farmers\u2019 costs and hurt their international economic competitiveness. <em>See </em>Farmer <em>Amici </em>Br. 2-3. The potential for such disruptive results, if accurate, would provide further support for the EPA\u2019s decision to interpret the statutory ambiguity at issue so as not to require NPDES permits for water transfers.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Yet another consideration supporting the reasonableness of the Water Transfers Rule is that several alternatives could regulate pollution in water transfers even in the absence of an NPDES permitting scheme, including: nonpoint source programs; <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> other federal statutes and regulations (like the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300f <em>et seq., </em>and the Surface Water Treatment Rule, 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 141.70 <em>et seq.y, </em>the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\u2019s, regulatory scheme for non-federal hydropower dams; state permitting programs that have more stringent requirements than the NPDES program, <em>see </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1370(1); other state authorities and laws; interstate compacts; and international treaties.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The availability of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>regulatory alternatives further points towards the reasonableness of the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the Act in the Water Transfers Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">With respect to other state authorities and laws, the Act \u201crecognizes that states retain the primary role in planning the development and use of land and water resources, allocating quantities of water within their jurisdictions, and regulating water pollution, as long as those state regulations are not less stringent than the requirements set by the CWA.\u201d <em>Catskill II, </em>451 F.3d at 79 (citations omitted). To these ends, states can rely on statutory authorities at their disposal for regulating the potentially negative water quality impacts of water transfers.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> States can also enforce water quality standards through their certification authority under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which requires that applicants for federal licenses or permits obtain a state certification that any discharge of pollutants will comply with the water-quality standards applicable to the receiving water body. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341; <em>S.D. Warren Co. v. Me. Bd. of Envtl. Prot., </em>547 U.S. 370, 386,126 S.Ct. 1843, 164 L.Ed.2d 625 (2006); <em>PUD No. 1, </em>511 U.S. at 712,114 S.Ct. 1900. .</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">States have still more regulatory tools at their disposal. State agencies may be granted specific authority to address particular pollution or threats of pollution. For example, in New York, the NYSDEC is authorized and directed to promulgate rules to protect the recreational uses\u2014 such as trout fishing and canoeing\u2014of waters affected by certain large reservoirs such as the Schoharie Reservoir. <em>See </em>N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law \u00a7\u00a7 15-0801, 15-0805 (McKinney 2008). And as discussed above, states likely can also bring common-law nuisance suits to enjoin and abate pollution. <em>See Int\u2019l Paper Co. v. Ouellette, </em>479 U.S. 481, 487, 107 S.Ct. 805, 93 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>883 (1987) (the common law of the state in which the point source is located can provide a basis for a legal challenge to an interstate discharge or transfer). Lastly, although water transfers apparently do not often have interstate or international effects, the States and the Federal Government can address any such effects through interstate compacts or treaties,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> as well as Section 310 of the Clean Water Act, which authorizes an EPA-initiated procedure for abating international pollution, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320. The existence of these available regulatory alternatives suggests that exempting water transfers from the NPDES permitting program would not necessarily defeat the fundamental water-quality aims of the Clean Water Act, which further counsels in favor of the reasonableness of the Water Transfers Rule. We need not now evaluate the effectiveness of such alternatives; we note only that their existence suggests that the Rule is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The plaintiffs advance several other arguments against the reasonableness of the Water Transfers Rule\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act. Ultimately, none persuades us that the Rule is an unreasonable interpretation of the Clean Water Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The plaintiffs first argue, as we have noted, that the Water Transfers Rule arises out of an unreasonable reading of the Act because it subverts the main objective of the Clean Water Act, \u201cto restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters,\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a), by allowing \u201cthe transfer of water from a heavily polluted, even toxic, water body to one that was pristine,\u201d <em>Catskill </em>17, 451 F.3d at 81. While this is a powerful argument against the EPA\u2019s position, we are not convinced that it establishes that the Water Transfers Rule is an unreasonable interpretation of the Clean Water Act, which is \u201camong the most complex\u201d of federal statutes and \u201cbalances a welter of consistent and inconsistent goals.\u201d <em>Catskill </em>1, 273 F.3d at 494. Congress\u2019s overarching goal in passing the Act does not imply that the EPA could not accommodate some of the compromises and other policy concerns embedded in the statute in promulgating the Water Transfers Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Some plaintiffs also argue that the EPA\u2019s interpretation of Section 402 contained in the Water Transfers Rule is unreasonable in light of the EPA\u2019s interpretation of Section 404. They point out that the EPA has interpreted the phrase \u201cdischarge of dredged ... material into the navigable waters\u201d from Section 404 to require a permit when dredged material is moved from one location to another within the same water body, regardless of whether the dredged material is ever removed from the water. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(a); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 232.2. They argue that if moving dredged material from one part of a water body to another part of that same water body is an \u201caddition ... into ... the waters of the United States,\u201d <em>see </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 232.2, then it is unreasonable to say that the movement of heavily polluted water from one water body into a pristine water body is not also an \u201caddition\u201d to \u201cwaters\u201d that would require an NPDES permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">But Section 404 contains different language that suggests that a different interpretation of the term \u201caddition\u201d is appropriate in analyzing that section. Section 404 concerns \u201cdredged material,\u201d which, as the EPA pointed out in the Water Transfers Rule, \u201cby its very nature comes from a waterbody.\u201d 73 Fed, Reg. at 33,703. As the Fifth Circuit has observed, in the context of Section 404, one cannot reasonably interpret the phrase \u201caddition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>... into ... the waters of the United States\u201d to refer only to the addition of dredged material from the \u201coutside world\u201d\u2014that is, from outside the \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d\u2014because the dredged material comes from within the waters of the United States itself. <em>See Avoyelles Sportsmen\u2019s League, Inc. v. Marsh, </em>715 F.2d 897, 924 n.43 (5th Cir. 1983). Interpreting Section 404 so as not to require permits for dredged material already present in \u201cthe waters of the United States\u201d would effectively mean that dredged material would <em>never </em>be subject to Section 404 permitting, eviscerating Congress\u2019s intent to establish a dredge- and-f\u00edll permitting system. By contrast, Section 402 concerns a much broader class of pollutants than Section 404, and the Water Transfers Rule\u2019s interpretation of Section 402 would not require the dismantling of existing NPDES permitting programs. The EPA can therefore reasonably interpret what constitutes an \u201caddition\u201d into \u201cthe waters of the United States\u201d differently under each provision.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Finally, we think that the plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Clark v. Martinez, </em>543 U.S. 371, 386-87, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005), and <em>Sorenson v. Sec'y of the Treasury of U.S., </em>475 U.S. 851, 860, 106 S.Ct. 1600, 89 L.Ed.2d 855 (1986), is misplaced. In <em>Clark, </em>the Supreme Court cautioned against \u201cthe dangerous principle that judges can give the same statutory text different meanings in different cases.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>543 U.S. at 386, 125 S.Ct. 716. But that cautionary statement referred to an interpretation of a specific subsection of the Immigration and Nationality Act that would give a phrase one meaning when applied to the first of three categories of aliens, and another meaning when applied to the second of those categories. <em>See id. </em>at 377-78, 386, 125 S.Ct. 716. It does not follow that an agency cannot interpret similar, ambiguous statutory language in one section of a statute differently than similar language contained in another, entirely distinct section. In <em>Sorenson, </em>the Supreme Court noted in <em>dicta </em>that there is a presumption that \u201cidentical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning,\u201d 475 U.S. at 860, 106 S.Ct. 1600 (quoting <em>Helvering v.

It can be rebutted by evidence that Congress intended the words to be interpreted differently in each section, or to leave a gap for the agency to fill. <em>See Duke, </em>549 U.S. at 575-76, 127 S.Ct. 1423 (\u201cThere is, then, no effectively irrebuttable presumption that the same defined term in different provisions of the same statute must be interpreted identically.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Here, there is evidence that Congress gave the EPA the discretion to interpret the terms \u201caddition\u201d and the broader phrases \u201caddition ... to navigable waters\u201d (Section 402) and \u201caddition ... into ... the waters of the United States\u201d (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 232.2, defining \u201cdischarge of dredged material\u201d in Section 404) differently.</p>\n<p id=\"pAv_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">In sum, the Water Transfers Rule\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act\u2014 which exempts water transfers from the NPDES permitting program\u2014is supported by several reasonable arguments. The EPA\u2019s interpretation need not be the \u201conly possible interpretation,\u201d nor need it be \u201cthe interpretation deemed <em>most </em>reasonable.\u201d <em>Entergy, </em>556 U.S. at 218, 129 S.Ct. 1498 (emphasis in original). And even though, as we note yet again, we might conclude that it is not the interpretation that would most effectively further the Clean Water Act\u2019s principal focus on water quality, it is reasonable nonetheless. Indeed, in light of the potentially serious and disruptive practical consequences of requiring NPDES permits for water transfers, the EPA\u2019s interpretation here involves the kind of \u201cdifficult policy choices that agencies are better equipped to make than courts.\u201d <em>Brand X, </em>545 U.S. at 980, 125 S.Ct. 2688. Because the Water Transfers Rule is a reasonable construction of the Clean Water Act supported by a reasoned explanation, it survives deferential review under <em>Chevron, </em>and the district court\u2019s decision must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we defer under <em>Chevron </em>to the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Water Act in the Water Transfers Rule.

In these opinions, the District of Columbia and Sixth Circuits deferred to the EPA's position that water released back into the same surrounding water from which it was taken is not an \"addition\u201d to navigable waters under the CWA, even though the water so released contained material that either was or could be considered a pollutant. <em>Gorsuch, </em>693 F.2d at 174-75, 183; <em>Consumers Power, </em>862 F,2d at 584-87, 589. We noted that our definition of \u201caddition\u201d was consistent with the holdings in the dams cases, because \"[i]f one takes a ladle of soup from a pot, lifts it above the pot, and pours it back into the pot, one has not 'added' soup or anything else to the pot.\u201d <em>Catskill I, </em>273 F.3d at 492. We explained that <em>Catskill I </em>was factually distinguishable from those cases because it involved the discharge of water from one distinct body of water (the Schoharie Reservoir) into another (the Esopus Creek). <em>Id. </em>at 491-92, <em>Gorsuch </em>and <em>Consumers Power </em>have no bearing on the meaning of the term \u201cnavigable waters\u201d because the discharges at issue in those cases would not constitute' \"addition[s] .., to navigable waters\u201d either under a unitary-waters theory (because the potential pollutants in the dams cases were already within the navigable waters) or a non-unitary-waters theory (because those potential pollutants were not transferred from one navigable water body to another). These two cases therefore have no bearing on the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b535-8\">. We find the dissent\u2019s arguments relating to the ordinary meaning of the term \u201caddition\u201d to be unpersuasive. <em>See </em>Dissent at 536-37. We agree that the ordinary meaning of that term refers to an increase or an augmentation. But that dictionary definition does not answer the question at issue here: whether such an increase or augmentation occurs when a pollutant is moved from one body of water to another. In addressing that question, we must consider the entire statutory phrase, \"addition ... to navigable waters,\u201d not simply the definition of the term \"addition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b536-7\">. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Rapanos </em>does not compel the conclusion that the statutory phrase \"navigable waters\u201d is unambiguous because that phrase, unlike the phrase addressed in <em>Rapanos, </em>is not limited by a definite article. <em>See </em>Dissent at 535-37.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b538-8\">. The dissent's argument proceeds as follows: (1) the Act imposes a general ban on \"the discharge of any pollutant,\u201d defined by Section 502 as \"any addition ... to navigable waters\u201d; (2) the Act specifies certain exemptions to the general ban; and (3) the Water Transfers Rule must be rejected because it effectively creates an implied exemption to the general ban on the discharge of pollutants. <em>See </em>Dissent at 537-39. This strikes us as decidedly circular: It presupposes that the scope of the general ban on the discharge of pollutants, as defined by Section 502, extends to water transfers in order to conclude that the Water Transfers Rule is an exemption from that general ban. This argument, therefore, is unhelpful because it sidesteps the question at issue here\u2014whether \"any addition ... to navigable waters\u201d is ambiguous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b539-7\">.

There is no reason to think that applying the NPDES program to water transfers would turn the prior appropriation doctrine (\"first in time, first in right\u201d) on its head, as some of the defendants insist. <em>See </em>Western States Br. 31-32.

The dissent asserts that in reaching this conclusion we are effectively construing \"navigable waters\u201d to mean all the navigable waters of the United States, collectively. <em>See </em>Dissent at 535, Not so: By concluding that the phrase \"addition ... to navigable waters\u201d is ambiguous for purposes of <em>Chevron </em>Step One, we are emphatically declining to adopt any construction of the statute in the first instance. We are instead acknowledging that Congress has left the task of resolving that ambiguity to the EPA by delegating to that agency the authority \"to make rules carrying the force of law\u201d to which we must defer so long as they are reasonable. <em>Mead, </em>533 U.S, at 226-27, 121 S.Ct. 2164.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b544-6\">.

The district court criticized the EPA's rationale for the Water Transfers Rule on the grounds that it was illogical for EPA to reason that: (1) Congress did not intend to subject water transfers to NPDES permitting; (2) therefore, water transfers do not constitute an addition to navigable waters; (3) because water transfers are not an \"addition,\u201d they do not constitute a \"discharge of a pollutant\u201d under \u00a7 301(a), and therefore do not require an NPDES permit. <em>Catskill III, </em>8 F.Supp.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>at 543. According to the district court, because the NPDES program is only one of many provisions that regulate discharges made unlawful under \u00a7 301(a), step (1) could not possibly lead to steps (2) and (3)\u2014that is, Congressional intent not to regulate water transfers under the NPDES program does not imply Congressional intent not to regulate water transfers under the other programs for regulating discharges of pollutants. <em>Id. </em>at 544.

In <em>Los Angeles County, </em>the Supreme Court held that \"the flow of water from an improved portion of a navigable waterway into an unimproved portion of the very same waterway does not qualify as a discharge of pollutants under the CWA,\u201d reasoning that, \"[u]nder a common understanding of the meaning of the word 'add,' no pollutants are 'added' to a water body when water is merely transferred between different portions of that water body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713. This conclusion is consistent with both a unitary-waters reading of the CWA (under which a discharge of a pollutant occurs only when the pollutant is first introduced to any of the navigable waters), and with a non-unitary-waters reading (under which a discharge of a pollutant occurs only when a pollutant is first introduced from a particular navigable water to another, and not when it moves around within the same navigable water).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Los Ange-les County </em>does not discuss the definition of \"navigable waters,\u201d nor does it imply a definition of that term.

The question presented is whether a transfer of water containing pollutants from one body of water to another\u2014say, in upstate New York, from the more-polluted Schoharie Reservoir through the Shandaken Tunnel to the less-polluted Esopus Creek\u2014is subject to these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">The United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) takes the position that such a transfer is not covered, on what has been called the \u201cunitary waters\u201d theory\u2014all water bodies in the United States, that is, all lakes, rivers, streams, etc., constitute a single unit, and therefore the transfer of water from a pollutant-laden water body to a pristine one is not an \u201caddition\u201d of pollutants to the \u201cnavigable waters\u201d of the United States because the pollutants are already present in the overall single unit. Consequently, in a rule adopted in 2008 (the \u2018Water Transfers Rule\u201d), EPA determined that water transfers from one water body to another, without intervening industrial, municipal, or commercial activity, were excluded from the permitting requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\u201cNPDES\u201d), even if dirty water was transferred from a polluted water body to a clean one. The majority holds that the Water Transfers Rule is a reasonable interpretation of the Act. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">As the majority notes, we evaluate EPA\u2019s interpretation of the Act under the two-step framework of <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). At step one, we consider whether Congress has \u201cunambiguously expressed\u201d its intent. <em>Riverkeeper Inc. v. EPA, </em>358 F.3d 174, 184 (2d Cir. 2004). If so, we \u201cmust give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. If the statute is \u201csilent or ambiguous,\u201d however, we turn to step two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>and determine \u201c \u2018whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute,\u2019 which is to say, one that is \u2018reasonable,\u2019 not \u2018arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Biverkeeper, </em>358 F.3d at 184 (quoting Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">I would affirm the district court\u2019s decision to vacate the Water Transfers Rule. First, I would hold at <em>Chevron </em>step one that the plain language and structure of the Act is unambiguous and clearly expresses Congress\u2019s intent to prohibit the transfer of polluted water from one water body to another distinct water body without a permit. In my view, Congress did not intend to give a pass to interbasin transfers of dirty water, and excluding such transfers from permitting requirements is incompatible with the goal of the Act to protect our waters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, prior decisions of this Court and the Supreme Court make clear that the unitary waters theory is inconsistent with the plain and ordinary meaning of the text of the Act and its purpose. Third, even assuming there is any ambiguity, I would hold at <em>Chevron </em>step two that the Water Transfers Rule is an unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious interpretation of the Act. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">I begin with the language of the Act, its structure, and its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">A. <em>The Statutory Language</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">The Act provides that \u201cthe discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful,\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(a), except to the extent allowed by other provisions, including, for example, those provisions establishing the NPDES permit program, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">The Act defines <em>\u201cdischarge </em>of a pollutant\u201d to include \u201cany addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(12)(A) (emphasis added). It defines \u201cpollutant\u201d to include solid, industrial, agricultural, and biological waste. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1362(6) (emphasis added). It defines <em>\u201cnavigable waters\u201d </em>as \u201cthe waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1362(7) (emphasis added). And it defines a <em>\u201cpoint source\u201d </em>as \u201cany discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, including but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, or vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants are or may be discharged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1362(14) (emphasis added). The Act does not define the word <em>\u201caddition.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">In my view, the plain language of the Act makes clear that the permitting requirements apply to water transfers from one distinct body of water through a conveyance to another. As noted, the Act prohibits \u201cany addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1362(12)(A). The transfer of contaminated water from a more-polluted water body through a conveyance, such as a tunnel, to a distinct, less-polluted water body is the \u201caddition\u201d of a pollutant (contained in the contaminated water) to \u201cnavigable waters\u201d (the less-polluted water body) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>from a \u201cpoint source\u201d (the conveyance). In the context of this case, as we held in <em>Catskill I:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">Here, water is artificially diverted from its natural course and travels several miles from the [Schoharie] Reservoir through Shandaken Tunnel to Esopus Creek, a body of water utterly unrelated in any relevant sense to the Schoharie Reservoir and its watershed. No one can reasonably argue that the water in the Reservoir and the Esopus are in any sense the \u201csame,\u201d such that \u201caddition\u201d of one to the other is a logical impossibility. When the water and the suspended sentiment therein passes from the Tunnel into the Creek, an \u201caddition\u201d of a \u201cpollutant\u201d from a \u201cpoint source\u201d has been made to a \u201cnavigable water,\u201d and the terms of the statute are satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">273 F.3d at 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">EPA contends that such a transfer of contaminated water, from a polluted body of water to a distinct and pristine one, is not an \u201caddition\u201d because all the waters of the United States are to be \u201cconsidered collectively,\u201d EPA Br. at 2, that is, because the polluted and pristine bodies of water are both part of the waters of the United States and all the waters of the United States are considered to be one unit, the transfer of pollutants from one part of the unit to another part is not an \u201caddition.\u201d I do not believe the words of the Act can be so interpreted. The critical words for our purposes are \u201caddition\u201d and \u201cnavigable waters.\u201d I take them in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">1. <em>\u201cNavigable Waters\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">EPA\u2019s position\u2014accepted by the majority\u2014requires us to add words to the Act, as we must construe \u201cnavigable waters\u201d to mean <em>\u201call </em>the navigable waters of the United States, considered <em>collectively,\u201d Contra Dean v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 568, 572, 129 S.Ct. 1849, 173 L.Ed.2d 785 (2009) (courts must \u201cordinarily resist reading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on its face\u201d) (quoting <em>Bates v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 23, 29, 118 S.Ct. 285, 139 L.Ed.2d 215 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">EPA also argues that if Congress had intended the NPDES permitting requirements to apply to individual water bodies, it would have inserted the word \u201cany\u201d before \u201cnavigable waters.\u201d <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(12)(A) (\u201cany addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source\u201d). This interpretation is flawed, for the use of the plural \u201cwaters\u201d obviates the need for the word \u201cany.\u201d The use of the plural \u201cwaters\u201d indicates that Congress was referring to individual water bodies, not one collective water body. The Supreme Court addressed this precise issue in its discussion of \u201cthe waters of the United States\u201d in <em>Rayanos v. United States. </em>There the Court considered the issue of whether \u00a7 1362(7)\u2019s definition of \u201cnavigable waters\u201d meant \u201cwaters of the United States,\u201d and the Court squarely held that \u201cwaters\u201d referred to \u201cindividual bodies,\u201d not one collective body:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-12\">But \u201cthe waters of the United States\u201d is something else. The use of the definite article (\u201cthe\u201d) and the plural number (\u201cwaters\u201d) shows plainly that \u00a7 1362(7) <em>does not refer to water in general. </em>In this form, \u201cthe waters\u201d refers more narrowly to water \u201c[a]s found in streams and <em>bodies </em>forming geographical features such as oceans, rivers, [and] lakes,\u201d or \u201cthe flowing or moving masses, as of waves or floods, making up such streams or <em>bodies.\u201d </em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 2882.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">547 U.S. 715, 732, 126 S.Ct. 2208, 165 L.Ed.2d 159 (2006) (alterations in original) (emphases added). Hence, the Supreme Court concluded the plural form \u201cwaters\u201d does not refer to \u201cwater in general,\u201d but to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>water <em>bodies </em>such as streams, lakes and ponds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">As the majority acknowledges, the Act contains multiple provisions suggesting that the term \u201cnavigable waters\u201d refers to multiple water bodies, not one national collective water body. Op. at 513 (citing 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1313(c)(2)(A), (c)(4), 1313(d)(1)(B), 1314(2), 1314(f)(2)(F), 1314(Z)(1)(A)-(B), 1342).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Likewise, EPA\u2019s own regulations suggest that \u201cnavigable waters\u201d refers to individual water bodies. For example, 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.45(g)(4) regulates intake credits. As the Supreme Court has observed, this regulation is incompatible with the \u201cunitary waters\u201d theory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">The \u201cunitary waters\u201d approach could also conflict with current NPDES regulations. For example, 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.45(g)(4)(2003) allows an industrial water user to obtain \u201cintake credit\u201d for pollutants present in the water that it withdraws from navigable waters. When the permit holder discharges the water after use, it does not have to remove pollutants that were in the water before it was withdrawn. There is a caveat, however: EPA extends such credit \u201conly if the discharger demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water into which the discharge is made.\u201d The NPDES program thus appears to address the movement of pollutants among water bodies, at least at times.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-10\"><em>S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist. v. Miccosukee Tribe, </em>541 U.S. 95, 107-08, 124 S.Ct. 1537, 158 L.Ed.2d 264 (2004). In all of these instances, the phrase \u201cnavigable waters\u201d refers to individual water bodies and not one collective national water body. Indeed, neither the majority nor the parties have identified a single provision in the Act where \u201cnavigable waters\u201d refers to the waters of the United States as a unitary whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">2. <em>\u201cAddition\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">EPA\u2019s interpretation also requires us to twist the meaning of the word \u201caddition.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Because the word \u201caddition\u201d is not defined in the Act, we consider its common meaning. <em>See S.D.

Transferring water containing pollutants from a polluted water body to a clean water body is \u201cadding\u201d something to the latter; there is an \u201caddition\u201d\u2014an increase in the number of pollutants in the second water body. In this context, \u201caddition\u201d means adding a pollutant to \u201cnavigable waters\u201d when that pollutant would not otherwise have been in those \u201cnavigable waters.\u201d Words should be given their \u201ccontextually appropriate ordinary meaning,\u201d Antonin Scalia <em>&amp; </em>Bryan A. Garner, <em>Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts </em>70 (2012), and the context here is a statute intended to eliminate water pollution discharges. <em>See Catskill I, </em>273 F.3d at 486. That context makes clear that the word \u201caddition\u201d encompasses an increase in pollution caused by an interba-sin transfer of water. The plain words of the statute thus make clear that Congress did not intend to except water transfers from \u00a7\u00a7 1311 and 1362 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">B. <em>The Structure of the Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Congress\u2019s intent to require a permit for interbasin water transfers is even clearer when we consider the statutory language in light of the Act\u2019s structure. In determining whether Congress has spoken to the precise question at issue, we consider the words of the statute in \u201ctheir context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme,\u201d <em>FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>529 U.S. 120, 132, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000), because \u201cthe meaning\u2014or ambiguity\u2014of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context,\u201d <em>King v.

Section 1311(a) of the Act prohibits \u201c[t]he discharge of any pollutant by any person.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(a). The Supreme Court has held that <em>\u201cevery </em>point source discharge\u201d is covered by the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">Congress\u2019 intent in enacting the [1972] Amendments [to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act] was clearly to establish an all-encompassing program of water pollution regulation. <em>Every </em>point source discharge is prohibited unless covered by a permit, which directly subjects the discharger to the administrative apparatus established by Congress to achieve its goals. The \u201cmajor purpose\u201d of the Amendments was clearly to \u201cestablish a <em>comprehensive </em>long-range policy for the elimination of water pollution.\u201d S. Rep. No. 92-414, at 95, 2 Leg. Hist. 1511 (emphasis supplied). No Congressman\u2019s remarks on the legislation were complete without reference to the \u201ccomprehensive\u201d nature of the Amendments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-6\"><em>See City of Milwaukee v. Illinois, </em>451 U.S. 304, 318, 101 S.Ct. 1784, 68 L.Ed.2d 114 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Congress created specific exceptions to the prohibition on the discharge of pollutants, as \u00a7 1311(a) bans such discharges \u201c[e]xcept as in compliance with this section and sections 1312, 1316, 1317, 1328, 1342, and 1344.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(a). These include specific exemptions to the NPDES permitting requirements for, <em>e.g., </em>return flows from irrigated agriculture, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(Z )(1), stormwater runoff, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(Z)(2), and discharging dredged or fill material into navigable waters, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(a). Congress did not create an exception for interbasin water transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">It is well-settled that when exceptions are explicitly enumerated, courts should not infer additional exceptions. <em>See Hill-man v. Maretta, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1943, 1953, 186 L.Ed.2d 43 (2013) (\u201cWhere Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence of evidence of contrary legislative intent.\u201d (citing <em>Andrus v. Glover Constr., Co., </em>446 U.S. 608, 616-617, 100 S.Ct. 1906, 64 L.Ed.2d 548 (1980))). This prohibition against implying exceptions has been applied to the Act\u2019s permitting requirements. <em>See NRDC v. Costle, </em>568 F.2d 1369, 1377 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (\u201cThe wording of the statute, legislative history and precedents are clear: the EPA Administrator does not have authority to except categories of point sources from the permit requirements of \u00a7 [1342]\u201d); <em>Nw.

Defendants\u2019 position that all water transfers between water bodies are exempt from \u00a7 1342 permitting requirements is a substantial exemption that Congress did not create.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">Second, the Act also sets forth a specific plan for individual water bodies. The Act requires States to establish water-quality standards for each distinct water body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>within its borders. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(c)(1), (2)(A). To establish water-quality standards, a State must designate a use for every waterway and establish criteria for \u201cthe amounts of pollutants that may be present in [those] water bodies without impairing\u201d their uses. <em>Upper Blackstone Water Pollution Abatement Dist. v. EPA, </em>690 F.3d 9,14 (1st Cir. 2012) (citing 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(c)(2)(A)). The NPDES permit program- is \u201cthe primary means\u201d by which the Act seeks to achieve its water-protection goals. <em>Arkansas v. Oklahoma, </em>503 U.S. 91, 101-02, 112 S.Ct. 1046, 117 L.Ed.2d 239 (1992). The NPDES program covers all \u201cpoint sources,\u201d including \u201cany pipe, ditch, channel, [or] tunnel,\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(14), and a broad range of pollutants, including chemicals, biological materials, rock, and sand, <em>id, </em>\u00a7 1362(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">This carefully designed plan to fight water pollution would be severely undermined by an EPA-created exception for water transfers. A State\u2019s efforts to control water-quality standards in its individual lakes, rivers, and streams would be disrupted if contaminated water could be transferred from a polluted water body to a pristine one without a NPDES permit. It is hard to imagine that Congress could have intended such a broad and potentially devastating exception. Indeed, exempting water transfers from the NPDES program would undermine the ability of downstream States to protect themselves from the pollution generated by upstream States. The NPDES program provides a procedure for resolving disputes between States over discharges. <em>See Upper Blackstone .Water Pollution Abatement Disk, </em>690 F.3d at 15 (citing <em>City of Milwaukee, </em>451 U.S. at 325-26, 101 S.Ct. 1784). When a State applies for a permit that may affect the water quality of a downstream State, EPA must notify the applying State and the downstream State. If the downstream State determines that the discharge \u201cwill violate its water quality standards, it may submit its objections and request a public hearing.\u201d <em>Id, </em>If water transfers are exempt from NPDES requirements, the ability of downstream States to protect themselves from upstream states sending their pollution across the border will be severely curtailed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">- -The City and certain of the States argue that subjecting water transfers to permitting requirements will be extremely burdensome. As we have repeatedly recognized, however, there is ample flexibility in the NPDES permitting process to address dischargers\u2019 concerns. <em>See Catskill Mountains v. EPA, </em>451 F.3d 77, 85-86 (2d Cir. 2006) <em>(\u201cCatskill II\u201d); see also Nw. Envtl., </em>537 F.3d at 1010 (\u201cObtaining a permit under the CWA need not be an onerous process.\u201d). The draft permit issued in this case allows for variable turbidity level restrictions by season and exemptions from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>the limitations in times of drought to remedy emergency threats or threats to public health or safety. <em>Catsk\u00fcl II, </em>451 F.3d at 86. Point source operators can also seek a variance from limits. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 125.3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">In addition, much of the concern over water transfers involved agricultural use, but water diversions from a \u201cnavigable water\u201d for agricultural use direct water <em>away </em>from a \u201cnavigable water,\u201d and thus do not trigger the need for a \u00a7 402 permit. Waters returning to a \u201cnavigable water\u201d which are \u201cagricultural stormwater discharges\u201d and \u201creturn flows from irrigated agriculture\u201d are specifically exempted from the statutory definition of \u201cpoint source.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(14); <em>see also </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(2) (exempting \u201cdischarges composed entirely of return flows from irrigated agriculture\u201d from permitting requirements). Thus, the catastrophic results of applying NPDES permits to water transfers bemoaned by appellants are exaggerated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Thud, as discussed above, Congress used the phrase \u201cnavigable waters\u201d to refer to individual water bodies in numerous provisions of the Act. Another well-settled rule of statutory interpretation holds that the same words in a statute bear the same meaning. <em>See Sullivan v. Stroop, </em>496 U.S. 478, 483, 110 S.Ct. 2499, 110 L.Ed.2d 438 (1990) (\u201cthe \u2018normal rule of statutory construction [is] that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.\u2019 \u201d (internal citations omitted)); <em>Prus v. Holder, </em>660 F.3d 144, 147 (2d Cir. 2011) (\u201cthe normal rule of statutory construction [is] that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning\u201d). When the Act is read as a whole, it is clear that Congress did not intend the phrase \u201cnavigable waters\u201d to be interpreted as a single water body because that interpretation is \u201cinconsistent] with the design and structure of the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>Utility Air, </em>134 S.Ct. at 2442; <em>see also </em>Scalia &amp; Garner, <em>Reading Law </em>63 (\u201cA textually permissible interpretation that furthers rather than obstructs the document\u2019s purpose should be favored.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">Accordingly, in my opinion, the structure and context of the Act show clearly that Congress did not intend to exempt water transfers from the permitting requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">C. <em>The Purpose of the Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">The Act was passed in 1972 to address environmental harms caused by the discharge of pollutants into water bodies. As the Act itself explains, its purpose was to \u201crestore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a); <em>accord Miccosukee, </em>541 U.S. at 102, 124 S.Ct. 1537; <em>Waterkeeper All., Inc. v. EPA, </em>399 F.3d 486, 490-91 (2d Cir. 2005); <em>see also Catskill I, </em>273 F.3d at 486 (\u201c[T]he Act contains the lofty goal of eliminating water pollution discharges altogether.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">The Water Transfers Rule is simply inconsistent with the purpose of the Act and undermines the NPDES permit program. It creates a broad exemption that will manifestly interfere with Congress\u2019s desire to eliminate water pollution discharges. As the majority acknowledges, water transfers are a real concern. Artificial transfers of contaminated water present substantial risks to water quality, the environment, the economy, and public health. If interba-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>sin transfers are not regulated, there is a substantial risk that industrial waste, toxic algae, invasive species, and human and animal contaminants will flow from one water body to another. Accepting the argument that water transfers are not covered by the Act on the theory that pollutants are not being added but merely moved around surely undermines Congress\u2019s intent to restore and maintain the integrity of our waters. <em>See </em>Robert A. Katzmann, <em>Judging Statutes </em>31 (2014) (\u201cThe task of the judge is to make sense of legislation in a way that is faithful to Congress\u2019s purposes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In sum, based on the plain words of \u00a7\u00a7 1311 and 1362, the structure and design of the Act, and its overall purpose, I would hold that Congress has \u201cunambiguously expressed\u201d its intent to subject water transfers to the Act\u2019s permitting requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">As the majority notes, our Court has twice interpreted these precise provisions of the Act as applied to these very facts. <em>See Catskill I, </em>273 F.3d at 484-85; <em>Catskill II, </em>451 F.3d at 79-80. The decisions are not controlling, however, because EPA had not yet adopted the Water Transfers Rule and we conducted our review under a different deference standard. <em>See Catskill I, </em>273 F.3d at 490 (\u201cIf the EPA\u2019s position had been adopted in a rulemaking or other formal proceeding, <em>[Chevron] </em>deference <em>might </em>be appropriate.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Catskill II, </em>451 F.3d at 82 (\u201cThe City concedes that this EPA interpretation is not entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference.\u201d). Nonetheless, the two decisions are particularly helpful to the analysis at hand. Similarly, Supreme Court decisions have also suggested that EPA\u2019s unitary waters theory is inconsistent with the plain wording of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">A. <em>Catskill I and II</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">In <em>Catskill I </em>and <em>II, </em>we conducted our inquiry under <em>Skidmore v. Sivift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944), and <em>United States v. Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001). <em>See Catskill I, </em>273 F.3d at 491; <em>Catskill II, </em>451 F.3d at 83 n.5.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our application of the <em>Skidmore/Mead </em>framework does not imply that we found the Act to be ambiguous. Rather, to the contrary, we concluded in <em>Catskill I </em>and <em>II </em>that the meaning of the Act was plain and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">1. <em>Skidmore</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">Under <em>Skidmore, </em>the court applies a lower level of deference to certain agency interpretations and considers \u201cthe agency\u2019s expertise, the care it took in reaching its conclusions, the formality with which it promulgates its interpretations, the consistency of its views over time, and the ultimate persuasiveness of its arguments.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number><em>Community Health Ctr. v. Wilson-Coker, </em>311 F.3d 132, 138 (2d Cir. 2002); <em>accord In re New Times Sec. Servs., Inc., </em>371 F.3d 68, 83 (2d Cir. 2004); <em>see Skidmore, </em>323 U.S. at 140, 66 S.Ct. 161. The appropriate level of deference afforded an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute depends on its \u201cpower to persuade.\u201d <em>Christensen v. Harris County, </em>529 U.S. 576, 587, 120 S.Ct. 1655, 146 L.Ed.2d 621 (2000). Unlike <em>Chevron, </em>however, <em>Skidmore </em>does not require a court to make a threshold finding that the statute is ambiguous before considering the persuasiveness of the agency\u2019s interpretation. Instead, <em>Skidmore </em>merely supplies the appropriate framework for reviewing agency interpretations that \u201clack the force of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">As the majority notes, the Supreme Court has never explicitly held that courts must find ambiguity before applying the <em>Skidmore </em>framework. While there is some scholarly authority for the proposition that \u201c\u2018the <em>Skidmore </em>standard implicitly replicates <em>Chevron\u2019s </em>first step,\u2019\u201d Op. at 510 (quoting Kristin E. Hickman &amp; Matthew D. Krueger, <em>In Search of the Modem Skidmore Standard, </em>107 Colum. L. Rev. 1235, 1247 (2007)), the Supreme Court has decided numerous cases under <em>Skidmore </em>without finding that a statute\u2019s language was ambiguous, <em>see, e.g., EEOC v. Arabian American Oil, </em>499 U.S. 244, 257, 111 S.Ct. 1227, 113 L.Ed.2d 274 (1991) (applying <em>Skidmore </em>without finding ambiguity in statute and noting that agency\u2019s interpretation \u201clacks support in the plain language of the statute\u201d); <em>Whirlpool Corp. v. Marshall, </em>445 U.S. 1, 11, 100 S.Ct. 883, 63 L.Ed.2d 154 (1980) (applying <em>Skidmore </em>without finding ambiguity in statute and holding that regulation was permissible after considering statute\u2019s \u201clanguage, structure and legislative history\u201d); <em>see generally </em>Richard J. Pierce, Jr., I <em>Admin. L. Treatise </em>\u00a7 6.4 (5th ed. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"ARdd\">Of course, the Supreme Court did not hold, in either <em>Skidmore </em>or <em>Mead, </em>that ambiguity was a threshold requirement to applying the framework. <em>See Mead, </em>533 U.S. at 235, 121 S.Ct. 2164 (An agency ruling is entitled to \u201crespect proportional to its \u2018power to persuade,\u2019.... Such a ruling may surely claim the merit of its writer\u2019s thoroughness, logic, and expertness, and any other sources of weight.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>Skidmore, </em>323 U.S. at 164, 65 S.Ct. 161 (\u201cThe weight of [an agency\u2019s] judgment in a particular ease will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\u201d). Rather, the <em>Skidmore/Mead </em>framework adopts a less rigid, more flexible approach, <em>see U.S. Freightways Corp. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>270 F.3d 1137, 1142 (7th Cir. 2001) (referring to \u201cthe flexible approach <em>Mead </em>described, relying on ... <em>Skid-more\u201d), </em>as it presents \u201ca more nuanced, context-sensitive rubric\u201d for determining the level of deference a court will give to an agency interpretation, Thomas W. Merrill and Kristin E. Hickman, <em>Chevron\u2019s Domain, </em>89 Geo. L.J. 833, 836 (2001); <em>see also </em>Pierce, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6.4, at 444 (\u201cThe Court has referred to a variety of factors that can give an agency statement \u2018power to persuade.\u2019 ... [N]o single factor is disposi-tive -\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Ambiguity in a statute, of course, can be a factor, and in the sliding-scale analysis of the <em>Skidmore/Mead </em>framework, the \u201cpower to persuade\u201d of an agency determination can be affected by the clarity\u2014or lack thereof\u2014of the statute it is interpreting. Indeed, upon applying the <em>Skidmore/Mead </em>framework, a court may uphold\u2014or reject\u2014an agency interpretation because the interpretation is consistent with\u2014or contradicts\u2014a statute whose meaning is clear. <em>See </em>Pierce, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6.4, at 443. Here, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>did not defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the Act in <em>Catskill I </em>and <em>II, </em>precisely because the Water Transfers Rule contravened the plain meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">2. <em>The Plain Meaning of the Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The majority dismisses the notion that we ruled on the plain meaning of the Act in <em>Catskill I </em>and <em>II, </em>asserting that there were only a \u201cfew references to \u2018plain meaning1 \u201d in our decisions. Op. at 510. To the contrary, through both our words and our reasoning, we made clear repeatedly in <em>Catskill I </em>and <em>II </em>that the agency\u2019s unitary waters theory was inconsistent with the unambiguous plain meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">In <em>Catskill I, </em>we held that defendants\u2019 interpretation was \u201cinconsistent with the <em>ordinary meaning </em>of the word \u2018addition.\u2019 \u201d 273 F.3d at 493 (emphasis added). Specifically, we held that there is an \u201caddition\u201d of a pollutant into navigable water from the \u201coutside world\u201d\u2014thus triggering the permitting requirement\u2014any time such an \u201caddition\u201d is from <em>\u201cany place </em>outside the particular water body to which pollutants are introduced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491 (emphasis added). We reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">Given the <em>ordinary meaning </em>of the [Actj\u2019s text and our holding in <em>Dague, </em>we cannot accept the <em>Gorsuch </em>and <em>Consumers Poiver </em>courts\u2019 understanding of \u201caddition,\u201d at least insofar as it implies acceptance of what the <em>Dubois </em>court called a \u201csingular entity\u201d theory of navigable waters, in which an addition to one water body is deemed an addition to all of the waters of the United States.... We properly rejected that approach in <em>Dague. Such a theory would mean that movement of water from one discrete water body to another would not be an addition even if it involved a transfer of water from a water body contaminated with myriad pollutants to a pristine water body containing few or no pollutants. </em>Such an interpretation is <em>inconsistent with the ordinary meaning </em>of the word \u201caddition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 493 (emphases added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a result, we held that \u201cthe transfer of water containing pollutants from one body of water to another, distinct body of water is <em>plainly </em>an addition and thus a \u2018discharge\u2019 that demands an NPDES permit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491 (emphasis added). Accordingly, we clearly were relying on the plain meaning of the Act in reaching our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">We also noted that \u201c[e]ven if we were to conclude that the proper application of the statutory text to the present facts was sufficiently ambiguous to justify reliance on the legislative history of the statute, ... that source of legislative intent would not help the City.\u201d 273 F.3d at 493. That language certainly makes clear we concluded the statutory text was <em>not </em>ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-14\">Finally, in the penultimate paragraph of <em>Catskill I, </em>we made absolutely clear that our holding was based on the plain meaning of the statutory text. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-15\">In any event, none of the statute\u2019s broad purposes sways us from what we find to be the <em>plain meaning of its </em>text.... Where a statute seeks to balance competing policies, congressional intent is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>not served by elevating one policy above the others, particularly where the balance struck <em>in the text </em>is <em>sufficiently clear to point to an answer. </em>We find that the <em>textual </em>requirements of the discharge prohibition in \u00a7 1331(a) and the definition of \u201cdischarge of a pollutant\u201d in \u00a7 1362(12) are met here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 494 (emphases added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Our analysis in <em>Catskill II </em>was similar, as we dismissed defendants\u2019 arguments as merely \u201cwarmed-up\u201d versions of those rejected in <em>Catskill I, </em>made no more compelling by EPA\u2019s new \u201cholistic\u201d interpretation of the statute. 451 F.3d at 82. We rejected New York City\u2019s \u201c \u2018holistic arguments about the allocation of state and federal rights, said to be rooted in the structure of the statute,\u2019 \u201d because, we concluded, they \u201csimply overlook its <em>plain language.\u201d Id. </em>at 84. (emphasis added). We noted our dismissal of the unitary waters theory in <em>Catskill I </em>based on the ordinary meaning of the word \u201caddition\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">We also rejected the City\u2019s \u201cunitary water\u201d theory of navigable waters, which posits that all of the navigable waters of the United States constitute a single water body, such that the transfer of water from any body of water that is part of the navigable waters to any other could never be an addition. We pointed out that this theory would lead to the <em>absurd result </em>that the transfer of water from a heavily polluted, even toxic, water body to one that was pristine via a point source would not constitute an \u201caddition\u201d of pollutants and would not be subject to the [Actj\u2019s NPDES permit requirements. <em>Catskills I </em>rejected the \u201cunitary water\u201d theory as inconsistent with the <em>ordinary meaning </em>of the word \u201caddition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 81 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). Again, we considered the very interpretation of \u201cnavigable waters\u201d proffered in the current appeal and rejected it based on \u201cthe plain meaning\u201d of the Act\u2019s text. <em>Id. </em>at 82.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">I do not suggest that we are bound by our prior decisions. But in both decisions, we carefully considered the statutory language, and in both decisions, based on the plain wording of the text, we rejected an interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 1311 and 1362 that construes \u201cnavigable waters\u201d and \u201cthe waters of the United States\u201d to mean a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>water body. Hence, we have twice rejected the theory based on the plain language of the Act. That plain language has not changed, and neither should our conclusion as to its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">B. <em>The Supreme Court Precedents</em></p>\n<p id=\"ANc\">Finally, although the Supreme Court has not explicitly ruled on the validity of EPA\u2019s \u201cunitary waters\u201d theory, it has expressed serious reservations. In <em>South Florida Water Management District v. Miccosukee Tribe of Indians, </em>541 U.S. 95, 124 S.Ct. 1537, 158 L.Ed.2d 264 (2004), the Court strongly suggested that the theory is not reasonable. First, the Court remanded for fact-finding on whether the two water bodies at issue were \u201cmeaningfully distinct water bodies.\u201d 541 U.S. at 112,124 S.Ct. 1537. That disposition follows from Judge Walker\u2019s soup ladle analogy in <em>Catskill I: </em>\u201cIf one takes a ladle of soup from a pot, lifts it above the pot, and pours it back into the pot, one has not \u2018added\u2019 soup or anything else to the pot (beyond, perhaps, a <em>de minimis </em>quantity of airborne dust that fell into the ladle).\u201d 273 F.3d at 492. In <em>Catskill II, </em>we noted that such a transfer would be an intrabasin transfer, from one water body back into the same water body, and we then applied the analogy to the facts of this case: \u201cThe Tunnel\u2019s discharge ... was like scooping soup from one pot and depositing it in another pot, thereby adding soup to the second pot, an interbasin transfer.\u201d 451 F.3d at 81. In <em>Miceosukee, </em>the Supreme Court cited the \u201csoup ladle\u201d analogy with approval, and remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the water bodies in question were \u201ctwo pots of soup, not one.\u201d 541 U.S. at 109-10, 124 S.Ct. 1537; <em>see also id. </em>at 112, 124 S.Ct. 1537. If the \u201cunitary waters\u201d theory were valid, however, there would have been no need to resolve this factual question. If all the navigable waters of the United States were deemed one collective national body, there would be no need to consider whether individual water bodies were distinct\u2014there would be no need to determine whether there were two pots of soup or one.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Second, as previously discussed, the Court observed that \u201cseveral NPDES provisions might be read to suggest a view contrary to the unitary waters approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107,124 S.Ct. 1537. The Court noted that under the Act, states \u201cmay set individualized ambient water quality standards by taking into consideration \u2018the designated uses of the navigable waters involved,\u2019 \u201d thereby affecting local NPDES permits. <em>Id. </em>(quoting 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(c)(2)(A)). \u201cThis approach,\u201d the Court wrote, \u201csuggests that the Act protects individual water bodies as well as the \u2018waters of the United States\u2019 as a whole.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Subsequent Supreme Court decisions support this reading of <em>Miceosukee. </em>In <em>Los Angeles County Flood Control District v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>the Supreme Court held that a water transfer between one portion of a river through a concrete channel to a lower portion of the same river did not trigger a NPDES permit requirement. \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 710, 184 L.Ed.2d 547 (2013). The Court observed that \u201c[w]e held [in <em>Miceosukee] </em>that th[e] water transfer would count as a discharge of pollutants under the CWA <em>only if </em>the canal and the reservoir were \u2018meaningfully distinct water bodies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). In holding that \u201cthe flow of water from an improved portion of a navigable waterway into an unimproved portion of the very same waterway does not qualify as a discharge of pollutants under the CWA,\u201d <em>id, </em>the Court again suggested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>that it <em>would </em>be a discharge of pollutants if the transfer were between two <em>different </em>water bodies.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">In <em>Miccosukee, </em>the Supreme Court acknowledged the concerns that have been raised about the burdens of permitting, but also observed that \u201cit may be that such permitting authority is <em>necessary to protect water quality, </em>and that the States or EPA could control regulatory costs by issuing general permits to point sources associated with water distribution programs.\u201d 541 U.S. at 108, 124 S.Ct. 1537 (emphasis added). Indeed, recognizing the importance of safeguarding drinking water, Congress created an extensive system to protect this precious resource, a system that would be undermined by exempting interbasin water transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Hence, the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Miccosukee </em>and <em>Los Angeles County </em>support the conclusion that water transfers between two distinct water bodies are not exempt from the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">In my view, then, Congress has \u201cunambiguously expressed\u201d its intent to subject interbasin water transfers to the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1311 and 1362 of the Act. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the district court based on step one of <em>Chevron. </em>Even assuming, however, that the statutory text is ambiguous, I agree with the district court that the Water Transfers Rule also fails at <em>Chevron </em>step two because it is an unreasonable and manifestly contrary interpretation of the Act, largely for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s thorough and carefully-reasoned decision. I add the following:</p>\n<p id=\"AnFi\">First, <em>Chevron </em>deference has its limits. \u201cDeference does not mean acquiescence,\u201d <em>Presley v. Etowah County Comm\u2019n, </em>502 U.S. 491, 508, 112 S.Ct. 820, 117 L.Ed.2d 51 (1992), and \u201ccourts retain a role, and an important one, in ensuring that agencies have engaged in reasoned decisionmak-ing,\u201d <em>Judulang v. Holder, </em>565 U.S. 42, 132 S.Ct. 476, 484-85, 181 L.Ed.2d 449 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Second, an agency\u2019s interpretation of an ambiguous statute is not entitled to deference where the interpretation is \u201cat odds\u201d with the statute\u2019s \u201cmanifest purpose,\u201d <em>Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, </em>531 U.S. 457, 487, 121 S.Ct. 903,149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001), or the agency\u2019s actions \u201c\u2018deviate from or ignore the ascertainable legislative intent,\u2019\u201d <em>Chem. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, </em>217 F.3d 861, 867 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting <em>Small Refiner Lead Phase-Down Task Force v. EPA, </em>705 F.2d 506, 520 (D.C. Cir. 1983)). <em>See </em>Katzmann, <em>Judging Statutes </em>31 (\u201cThe task of the judge is to make sense of legislation in a way that is faithful to Congress\u2019s purposes. When the text is ambiguous, a court is to provide the meaning that the legislature intended. In that circumstance, the judge gleans the purpose and policy underlying the legislation and deduces the outcome most consistent with those purposes.\u201d). As discussed above, in my view the Water Transfers Rule is manifestly at odds with Congress\u2019s clear intent in passing the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">Third, the Water Transfers Rule is not entitled to deference because it will lead to absurd results. <em>See Michigan v. EPA, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2699, 2707, 192 L.Ed.2d 674 (2015) (\u201cNo regulation is \u2018appropriate\u2019 if it does \u2018significantly more harm than good.\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also </em>Scalia &amp; Garner, <em>Reading Law </em>234 (\u201cA provision may be either disregarded or judicially corrected as an error (when the correction is textually simple) if failing to do so would result in a disposition that no reasonable person could approve.\u201d). Indeed, this Court has already held\u2014twice\u2014that the \u201cunitary waters\u201d theory would lead to absurd results. In <em>Catskill I, </em>we concluded that \u201c[n]o one can <em>reasonably </em>argue that the water in the Reservoir and the Esopus are in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>sense the \u2018same,\u2019 such that \u2018addition\u2019 of one to the other is a logical impossibility.\u201d 273 F.3d at 492 (emphasis added). In <em>Catsldll II, </em>we rejected the \u201cunitary water\u201d theory for a second time, observing that it \u201cwould lead to the <em>absurd </em>result that the transfer of water from a heavily polluted, even toxic, water body to one that was pristine via a point source would not constitute an \u2018addition\u2019 of pollutants.\u201d 451 F.3d at 81 (emphasis added). It would be an absurd result indeed for the Act to be read to allow the unlimited transfer of polluted water to clean water. Clean drinking water is a precious resource, and Congress painstakingly created an elaborate permitting system to protect it. Deference has its limits; I would not defer to an agency interpretation that threatens to undermine that entire system.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">I would affirm the judgment of the district court, and, accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-9\">. The term \u201cinterbasin transfer\u201d refers to an artificial or man-made conveyance of water between two distinct water bodies that would not otherwise be connected. <em>See Catskill Mountains Chapter of Trout Unlimited, Inc. v.

While <em>Rapanos </em>may not \u201ccompel\u201d that conclusion, it certainly supports it. In <em>Rapanos, </em>the Supreme Court was interpreting the same definition of \u201cnavigable waters\u201d in operation here, \u00a7 1362(7), which defines \"navigable waters\u201d as \"the waters of the United States.\u201d The lack of the word \"the\u201d before \"navigable waters\u201d in \u00a7 1362(12)(A) hardly negates the Supreme Court\u2019s holding that the definition of \"navigable waters\u201d as found in \u00a7 1362(7) does not refer to water in general, but water bodies. Moreover, the existence or non-existence of a definite article before a noun, on its own, has no bearing on the plural or singular nature of a noun. \"The\u201d can be used to refer to a particular person or thing or a group. <em>See </em>Bryan A. Garner, <em>Gamer\u2019s Modem American Usage: The Authority on Grammar, Usage and Style, </em>883 (3rd Ed. 2009) (\"The definite article can be used to refer to a group &lt; the basketball team &gt; or, in some circumstances, a plural &lt; The ideas just keep on flowing &gt;.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b558-14\">.

Downstream states would have to resort to common law nuisance suits in the courts of the polluting state, instead of addressing permit violations with EPA.
