The district court calculated Ramirez\u2019s Guidelines range as 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment, and sentenced Ramirez to a term of 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. In 2015, Ramirez moved for a reduction in sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), arguing that Amendments 782 and 788 of the Sentencing Guidelines lowered his applicable Guidelines range. The district court acknowledged that Amendment 782 reduced Ramirez\u2019s Guidelines range to 324 to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment but denied the motion because a 2011 Amendment to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b) prohibited a sentence reduction where the defendant\u2019s initial sentence was below the minimum of the amended Guidelines range. On appeal, Ramirez argues that application of \u00a7 lB1.10(b) to prohibit a sentence reduction violates the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause of the United States Constitution. We affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b638-16\">A. Initial Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b638-17\">On September 16, 2003, Ramirez was charged in a one-count indictment with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine. On May 6, 2004, Ramirez pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement that stipulated to a Guidelines range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. Prior to sentencing, however, Ramirez made a motion to withdraw from his plea agreement in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>that he could argue for a sentence below the range stipulated in the plea agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court granted the motion and held a <em>Fatieo </em>hearing on March 30, 2006, to resolve factual disputes between the parties regarding, <em>inter alia, </em>the amount of drugs involved and Ramirez\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, ultimately concluding that more than 150 kilograms of cocaine were involved in the offense and that Ramirez was not entitled to credit for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The district court proceeded to sentencing on May 25, 2006. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l), the district court calculated a base offense level of 38 based on the quantity of drugs involved in the offense. The district court applied a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 because Ramirez was an organizer, leader, or supervisor of the criminal activity, and another two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 because Ramirez attempted to obstruct justice by influencing a witness. After refusing to grant various downward departures sought by Ramirez, the court calculated his adjusted offense level as 42. Given Ramirez\u2019s criminal history category of II, the district court determined that the applicable Guidelines range was 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The district court noted that the situation was \u201chighly unusual\u201d because the parties had initially stipulated to a 151-to-188-month Guidelines range before Ramirez withdrew from the plea agreement. Joint App\u2019x at 74-75. The court also acknowledged that, despite his withdrawal from the plea agreement, Ramirez\u2019s guilty plea \u201cdid in fact save the government and the public substantial resources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75. After considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court imposed a below-Guidelines sentence of 210 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">Ramirez subsequently appealed his conviction and sentence, arguing that the district court erred in granting his motion to withdraw from the plea agreement and that his counsel was ineffective for advising him to withdraw. We affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment and dismissed Ramirez\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim without prejudice. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>267 Fed.Appx. 11, 11, 13 (2d Cir. 2008) (summary order). On May 6, 2011, the district court denied Ramirez\u2019s motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Ramirez v. United States, </em>No. 09-cv-4397 (S.D.N.Y. May 6, 2011), ECF No. 9. We denied a Certificate of Appealability and dismissed Ramirez\u2019s subsequent appeal. <em>Ramirez v. United States, </em>No. 11-2843 (2d Cir. Feb. 22, 2012), ECF No. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">B. Subsequent Changes in the Sentencing Guidelines</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">Under the 2002 Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of Ramirez\u2019s offense, as well as the 2005 Guidelines in effect when Ramirez was sentenced, district courts could generally reduce sentences in sentence-modification proceedings even where the initial sentence was below the low-end of the amended Guidelines range:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-13\">In determining whether, and to what extent, a reduction in the term of imprisonment is warranted for a defendant eligible for consideration under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the court should consider the term of imprisonment that it would have imposed had the amendments) to the guidelines listed in sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>section (c) been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced, except that in no event may the reduced term of imprisonment be less than the term of imprisonment the defendant has already served.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b) (2002 ed.); <em>accord id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(b) (2005 ed.).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, the Application Notes to that section confirmed that \u201cthe sentencing court has the discretion to determine whether, and to what extent, to reduce a term of imprisonment under this section.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(b) cmt. n.3 (2002 ed.); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(b) cmt. n.3 (2005 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">In 2011, the Sentencing Commission adopted Amendment 759. That amendment prohibited district courts from imposing a reduced sentence that is below the minimum of the amended Guidelines range, unless the Government originally moved for a below-Guidelines sentence due to the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to the authorities under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">(A) Limitation.\u2014Except as provided in subdivision (B), the court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">(B) Exception for Substantial Assistance.\u2014If the term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection may be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-9\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2) (2011 ed.). The Amendment also added Application Note 6, which stated that \u201cthe court shall use the version of this policy statement that is in effect on the date on which the court reduces the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.6 (2011 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">In 2014, the Sentencing Commission issued Amendment 782 to the Guidelines, which reduced offense levels for certain controlled substance offenses by two levels. In addition, the Sentencing Commission adopted Amendment 788, which stated that Amendment 782 should be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">C. Sentence-Reduction Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">On April 30, 2015, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), Ramirez made a <em>pro se </em>motion to the district court for a reduction of his sentence under Amendment 782. In response, the Government pointed out that Amendment 782 only lowered Ramirez\u2019s applicable Guidelines range to 324 to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment, and that Amendment 759 therefore rendered him ineligible for a sentence reduction because his original sentence of 210 months was below the minimum of the amended Guidelines range. Ramirez argued, however, that the district court \u201cshould utilize the language provided by the Sentencing Commission at the time of his original sentencing in 2006.\u201d Joint App\u2019x at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">On July 23, 2015, the district court denied Ramirez\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The district court stated that Ramirez\u2019s amended Guidelines range after application of Amendment 782 was 324 to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court then followed U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A)\u2019s prohibition, ruling that \u201c[b]ecause the Court imposed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>sentence that is below the minimum Guideline of the amended Guidelines Range, and because the Court\u2019s initial variance was not based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to the Government, the defendant is not eligible for a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">On appeal, Ramirez argues that application of Amendment 759 to prohibit his sentence-reduction request violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause of the United States Constitution. We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law regarding a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>732 F.3d 109, 113 (2d Cir. 2013).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Article I of the United States Constitution provides that neither Congress nor any state shall pass an \u201cex post facto Law.\u201d U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 3; <em>id. </em>art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1. The <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause applies, <em>inter alia, </em>to government actions that \u201cmake[] more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission.\u201d <em>Barna v. Travis, </em>239 F.3d 169, 171 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>also Calder v. Bull, </em>3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 390, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798) (stating that the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause applies to laws that \u201cinflict[] a greater punishment! ] than the law annexed to the crime, when committed\u201d). A criminal or penal law is <em>ex post facto </em>when it is: (1) retrospective, and (2) more onerous than the law in effect on the date of the offense. <em>Weaver v. Graham, </em>450 U.S. 24, 30-31, 101 S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">A. Retrospectivity</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">In <em>Weaver, </em>the Supreme Court explained that the \u201ccritical question\u201d in determining whether a law is retrospective is \u201cwhether the law changes the legal consequences of acts completed before its effective date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31, 101 S.Ct. 960. Thus, the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause attaches when a law \u201capplies to prisoners convicted for acts committed before the provision\u2019s effective date.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">Here, the Government does not contest that Amendment 759 applies retrospectively to Ramirez. Indeed, Amendment 759\u2019s change to \u00a7 1B1.10 potentially affects the sentence ultimately served for an offense committed prior to the adoption of the Amendment and is therefore retrospective. <em>See United States v. Kruger, </em>838 F.3d 786, 790 (6th Cir. 2016) (\u201cThere is no question that Amendment 759 applies to prisoners convicted for acts committed before the provision\u2019s effective date\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Even construing this guideline change as retrospective, however, Ramirez\u2019s challenge fails under <em>Weaver\u2019s </em>second prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">B. \u201cMore Onerous Than the Law in Effect on the Date of the Offense\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">Ramirez argues that the 2014 version of \u00a7 lB1.10(b) was more onerous than the law in effect on the date of his offense because it made him ineligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">Analysis of this element focuses on whether the change in law \u201cpresents a \u2018sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>crimes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Peugh v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2072, 2082, 186 L.Ed.2d 84 (2013) (quoting <em>Garner v. Jones, </em>529 U.S. 244, 250, 120 S.Ct. 1362, 146 L.Ed.2d 236 (2000)); <em>see also Cal. Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Morales, </em>514 U.S. 499, 508-09, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 131 L.Ed.2d 588 (1995) (stating that a law creating a mere \u201cspeculative, attenuated risk of affecting a prisoner\u2019s actual term of confinement\u201d does not violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">a. Applicability of the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">The Government asserts that, by their nature, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence-reduction proceedings cannot increase punishment and, therefore, the reduction limit imposed by. amended \u00a7 lB1.10(b) on such proceedings cannot be deemed more onerous than the law on the date of the , offense. Indeed, several of our sister circuits have adopted this position. <em>See infra </em>at Part B.b. Ramirez contends that this conclusion is contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Weaver </em>and <em>Lynce v. Mathis, </em>519 U.S. 433, 117 S.Ct. 891, 137 L.Ed.2d 63 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">In <em>Weaver, </em>the petitioner had pleaded guilty to the state crime of second-degree murder. 450 U.S. at 25, 101 S.Ct. 960. On both the date of the offense and the date of sentencing, there was a state statute in place that provided a formula for deducting \u201cgain-time credits\u201d from the incarcera-tory terms of prisoners who committed no infractions while serving their sentences and faithfully performed tasks assigned to them by prison authorities. <em>Id. </em>at 26, 101 S.Ct. 960. After the petitioner\u2019s sentencing, the state legislature enacted a new formula reducing the gain-time credits that prisoners could receive. <em>Id. </em>When the state applied that formula to the petitioner, he challenged the new law as <em>ex post facto. Id. </em>at 27,101 S.Ct. 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">The Supreme Court concluded that the new gain-time formula was more onerous than the law in effect on the date of the petitioner\u2019s offense and therefore violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 35-36,101 S.Ct. 960. It reasoned that \u201creduction in gain-time accumulation lengthen[ed] the period that someone in petitioner\u2019s position must spend in prison.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33, 101 S.Ct. 960. Because \u201cthe new provision constrict[ed] the inmate\u2019s opportunity to earn early release,\u201d it made more onerous the punishment of crimes committed before its enactment. <em>Id. </em>at 35-36, 101 S.Ct. 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">Similarly, in <em>Lynce, </em>the Supreme Court held that retroactive cancellation of certain state gain-time credits violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. In 1986, the petitioner pleaded guilty to a state charge of attempted murder. 519 U.S. at 435,117 S.Ct. 891. While imprisoned, he accumulated a number of gain-time credits under Florida state law, including 1,860 days in \u201cprovisional credits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435-36,117 S.Ct. 891. As a result, the petitioner was released from prison in 1992. <em>Id. </em>at 435, 117 S.Ct. 891. Shortly after his release, however, the Florida legislature enacted a law that retroactively canceled provisional credits for certain inmates, including the petitioner. <em>Id. </em>at 436, 117 S.Ct. 891. As a result, the petitioner was rearrested and returned to custody to complete his sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">In analyzing whether this retroactive cancellation of provisional credits violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause, the Supreme Court stated that the \u201cessential inquiry\u201d was whether that cancellation \u201chad the effect of lengthening [the] petitioner\u2019s period of incarceration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442-43, 117 S.Ct. 891. The Court cited <em>Weaver, </em>and explained that the removal of early-release provisions \u201ccan constitute an increase in punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445, 117 S.Ct. 891. Thus, even though the cancellation of the provisional credits merely made the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>tioner ineligible for early release, the Court held that the statute violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 447, 117 S.Ct. 891; <em>see also Sash v. Zenk, </em>439 F.3d 61, 65 (2d Cir. 2006) (\u201cThe <em>ex post facto </em>doctrine applies to any penal enactment that retrospectively disadvantages a criminal offender, whether or not it increases a criminal sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In sum, <em>Weaver </em>and <em>Lyme </em>hold that the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause prohibits certain post-sentencing limitations on reductions of sentences. As we discuss in the next section, however, application of the 2014 Guidelines to Ramirez on his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion does not fall into the same category as the laws at issue in <em>Weaver </em>and <em>Lynce </em>because it did not lengthen his prison sentence. Accordingly, Ramirez\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>challenge fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">b. The \u201cOne-Book\u201d Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Ramirez\u2019s argument on appeal necessarily requires the application of provisions from different Guidelines manuals from different years. He claims that the law was made more onerous because the version of \u00a7 IB 1.10(b) contained in the 2005 Guidelines Manual\u2014which permitted district courts to reduce sentences in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings belpw the minimum of the amended range\u2014should have been applied to a sentencing reduction authorized by Amendment 782, which took effect in 2014. Controlling precedent, however, precludes such reasoning. It requires us to compare the entire Guidelines Manual in effect at the time of the initial sentencing\u2014which did not include Amendment 782\u2014to the entire Guidelines Manual in effect at the time of Ramirez\u2019s \u00a7 3582(e)(2) proceeding\u2014in which Amendment 782 authorized a guideline reduction but Amendment 759 limited the extent of such a reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Specifically, in <em>United States v. Keller, </em>58 F.3d 884 (2d Cir. 1995), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Mapp, </em>170 F.3d 328, 338 n.15 (2d Cir. 1999), this court considered Guidelines that at the time of the defendant\u2019s sentencing (the 1993 Guidelines) prescribed a higher offense level for the defendant than the Guidelines at the time of his offense (the 1989 Guidelines). <em>Id. </em>at 893. However, the 1993 Guidelines also allowed the defendant\u2019s term to be adjusted downward for time already served on the instant offense\u2014which more than made up for the defendant\u2019s increased offense level. <em>Id. </em>Such downward adjustments were not permitted under the earlier version of the Guidelines. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">The district court applied the 1989 Guidelines at sentencing and did not adjust for time served. <em>Id. </em>at 888. On appeal, the defendant argued that the district court should have applied the 1993 Guidelines, to the extent they authorized downward adjustment for time served, but not applied those Guidelines\u2019 increase in the defendant\u2019s offense-level.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">We vacated and remanded for resen-tencing under the 1993 Guidelines, but rejected the defendant\u2019s selective application argument. We explained that this court \u201cadhere[s] to the so-called \u2018one-book\u2019 rule that most other circuits use to avoid twisting the guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 890. Under that rule, \u201c[a] sentencing court has no authority to pick and choose, taking one provision from an earlier version of the guidelines and another from a later version.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, \u201c[a] version of the sentencing guidelines is to be applied in its entirety.\u201d <em>Id. Keller </em>applied the \u201cone-book\u201d rule to <em>ex post facto </em>analysis, holding that \u201cthe one-book rule must ... be employed to determine in the first instance whether an <em>ex post facto </em>problem exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201c[wjhat is significant is a comparison of the version of the guidelines in effect at sentencing against the version in effect at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>time the offense was committed.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 891. We concluded that, because the 1993 Guidelines, as a whole, produced a shorter sentence for the defendant than the 1989 Guidelines, there would have been no <em>ex post facto </em>violation in applying the 1993 Guidelines in their entirety. <em>Id. </em>at 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">In <em>Berrios v. United States, </em>126 F.3d 430 (2d Cir. 1997), we applied <em>Keller </em>to the sentence-reduction context. There, the defendant pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. <em>Id. </em>at 431. After the defendant was sentenced, several intervening amendments were made to the Sentencing Guidelines, including an amendment that lowered the base offense level for violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. <em>Id. </em>at 432. Section lB1.10(b) was also amended to provide that, when determining whether and to what extent a sentence reduction is warranted, a court should only consider those amendments specifically deemed retroactive in \u00a7 1B1.10, rather than all subsequent amendments. <em>Id. </em>While the amendment reducing base offense levels for violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 had been deemed retroactive, the change to \u00a7 lB1.10(b) prevented the defendant from taking advantage of several other intervening amendments to the Sen-fencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 432-33. The district court ultimately granted the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on the base offense level amendment regarding 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 crimes, and reduced his sentence from 210 months\u2019 to 168 . months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 433. On appeal, the defendant asserted that the \u00a7 lB1.10(b) amendment rendering him ineligible for other reductions violated the <em>Ex Post Fac-to </em>Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 432-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">We rejected the defendant\u2019s challenge. Citing <em>Keller, </em>we stated that \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry for <em>ex post facto </em>analysis is not whether a particular amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines is detrimental to a defendant, but whether application of the later version of the Sentencing Guidelines, considered as a whole, results in a more onerous penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433. We ruled that \u201c[a]nalogous principles apply to a situation where, as here, an already-sentenced defendant seeks to take advantage of later amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We then held that there was no <em>ex post facto </em>violation because, even if the amendment to \u00a7 lB1.10(b) disadvantaged the defendant by limiting the district court\u2019s consideration to only one of the intervening amendments, the net effect of the amendments favored him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Applying the \u201cone-book\u201d rule here, we conclude that there was no <em>ex post facto </em>violation. At both the date Ramirez\u2019s crime was committed and the date of his initial sentencing, \u00a7 lB1.10(b) did not restrict district courts from imposing a sentence below the amended Guidelines range at a sentence-reduction hearing. However, neither of these Guidelines Manuals included Amendment 782, which is the basis for Ramirez\u2019s eligibility for a sentence reduction. At the time of the sentence-reduction hearing, the Guidelines Manual included Amendment 782, but also the version of \u00a7 IB 1.10(b)\u2014based on Amendment 759\u2014 that prohibited district courts from reducing a sentence below a defendant\u2019s amended guidelines range. Thus, under none of the relevant Guidelines Manuals did Amendment 782 and the prior version of \u00a7 lB1.10(b) <em>both </em>exist. Indeed, the two provisions <em>never </em>coexisted in <em>any </em>Guidelines Manual.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Because Amendment 782 was not a part of the Guidelines at the time of Ramirez\u2019s offense or sentencing and, without Amendment 782, Ramirez would not be entitled to a sentencing reduction even under the 2002 and 2005 versions of \u00a7 1B1.10, it cannot be said that application of the 2014 Guidelines, including the constraint on \u00a7 1B1.10 provided for by Amendment 759, \u201cresult[ed] in a more onerous penalty.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Therefore, we reject Ramirez\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s failure to apply .the prior version of \u00a7 lB1.10(b) in conjunction with Amendment 782 constituted an <em>ex post facto </em>violation. To hold otherwise would allow Ramirez to \u201cpick and choose\u201d provisions from different Guidelines Manuals, in violation of the \u201cone-book\u201d rule. <em>Keller, </em>58 F.3d at 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">Ramirez maintains that he is not \u201cpicking] and choos[ing] the best pieces from different versions of the guidelines\u201d because Amendment 782 was made retroactively applicable. Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 13. The implication is that Amendment 782 should be considered part of the earlier Guidelines Manuals for the purposes of the \u201cone-book\u201d rale. It is true that, under \u00a7 IB 1.10(b)(1), a court determines the defendant\u2019s amended Guidelines range by applying Amendments listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(d) to the Guidelines in effect at the time of initial sentencing. However, Ramirez cites no authority indicating that this determination renders Amendment 782 part of prior Guidelines Manuals, particularly <em>for the purpose of </em>ex post facto <em>analysis, </em>and we decline to so rale here. Notably, in <em>Berrios, </em>we confronted a situation in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>the defendant sought application at sentence-modification proceedings of an earlier version of \u00a7 lB1.10(b) as well as a retroactive Amendment reducing his offense level. <em>See </em>126 F.3d at 432-33. We applied <em>Keller </em>and ruled that there was no <em>ex post facto </em>violation, without finding it significant that one of the provisions the defendant sought to apply was retroactive. <em>Id. </em>at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><em>Keller\u2019s </em>application of the \u201cone-book\u201d rule to an <em>ex post facto </em>challenge still dictates that we compare the version of the Guidelines in effect at a sentencing reduction proceeding against the version in effect at the time of the defendant\u2019s original offense and sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Keller\u2019s </em>articulation and stating that \u201cAnalogous principles apply to a situation where ... an already-sentenced defendant seeks to take advantage of later amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines\u201d). Here, then, we must compare the 2014 Guidelines Manual as a whole to the 2002 and 2005 Guidelines Manuals each as a whole. Under the 2014 Guidelines Manual, Ramirez is entitled to have Amendment 782 applied to his prior Guidelines determination, but subject to the limitation in \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) which ultimately made him ineligible for a reduction. Under the Guidelines Manuals in effect at the time of the offense and initial sentence, Ramirez was not entitled to application of Amendment 782. Thus, Ramirez is not eligible for a sentence reduction under <em>any </em>Guidelines Manual considered as a whole. In these circumstances, we conclude that the 2014 Guidelines are not more onerous on Ramirez than the 2002 or 2005 Guidelines and, thus, there is no <em>ex post facto </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Our holding that there is no <em>ex post facto </em>violation in applying Amendment 759 to limit sentence reductions authorized by a later Amendment\u2014such as Amendment 782\u2014is consistent with the rulings of every other circuit to have addressed this question.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Kruger, </em>838 F.3d at 790-92 (6th Cir.); <em>United States v.

While these other circuits have not explicitly invoked the \u201cone-book\u201d rule in this context, <em>Kruger, Bayatyan, </em>and <em>Colon </em>employed reasoning that implicitly applied it. In both <em>Kruger </em>and <em>Bayatyan, </em>the courts partially based their conclusions on the fact that Amendment 782 did not exist in the Guidelines at the time of initial sentencing. <em>See Kruger, </em>838 F.3d at 791 (\u201c[T]he ... version of \u00a7 1B1.10 [at the time of initial sentencing] didn\u2019t list Amendment 782 (which wouldn\u2019t come into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>existence for several more years) as a covered amendment, and so it could not have afforded [the defendant] any relief on the basis of it.\u201d); <em>Bayatyan, </em>633 Fed.Appx. at 915 (finding no <em>ex post facto </em>violation because \u201cat no point was Amendment 782 covered under the 2010 version of \u00a7 1B1.10,\u201d which defendant claimed applied at his initial sentencing). In making this point, <em>Kruger </em>and <em>Bayatyan </em>both looked to Guidelines Manuals <em>as a </em>whole\u2014 as prescribed by the \u201cone-book\u201d rule\u2014 rather than permitting the application of provisions across different Guidelines Manuals. Similarly, in Colon\u2014which concerned application of Amendment 759 to limit sentencing reduction pursuant to Amendment 750\u2014the court concluded that there was no <em>ex post facto </em>violation because \u201c[t]he net effect of Amendments 750 and 759 was not to increase [defendant\u2019s] range of punishment above what it was at the time she committed her crimes.\u201d 707 F.3d at 1258-59. By comparing the Guidelines range at the time defendant committed her crimes to the Guidelines range at the time of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, the court implicitly engaged in the same analysis called for by the \u201cone-book\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">We hold that Amendment 759\u2019s application prohibiting Ramirez from taking advantage of Amendment 782 does not violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order denying Ramirez\u2019s motion for sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\">.

A district court\u2019s discretion to reduce a sentence is subject to statutory mandatory minimum sentences. See <em>United States v.

In his <em>pro </em>se \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, Ramirez did not expressly invoke the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. However, he did ask the district court to \"utilize the language provided by the Sentencing Commission at the time of his original sentencing in 2006.\u201d Joint App\u2019x at 102. As a result, the Government does not oppose application of <em>de novo </em>review, rather than plain error review. We need not determine whether plain error review applies, because we affirm the district court's ruling even under the less deferential <em>de novo </em>standard,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b644-5\">. <em>Keller\u2019s </em>holding is consistent with the language of the Sentencing Guidelines, which emphasizes that Guidelines Manuals should be applied in their entirety in <em>ex post facto </em>analyses. Specifically, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.11(b)(1) states that \"[i]f the court determines that use of the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced would violate the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution, the court shall use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the offense of conviction was committed.\u201d The Guidelines further clarify that \"[t]he Guidelines Manual in effect on a particular date shall be applied in its entirety.\u201d U.S.S.G, \u00a7 1B1.11(b)(2). \"The court shall not apply, for example, one guideline section from one edition of the Guidelines Manual and another guideline section from a different edition of the Guidelines Manual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Section 1B1.11(b)(2) does add that \"the court shall consider subsequent amendments, to the extent that such amendments are clarifying rather than substantive changes.\u201d However, Ramirez does not contend that Amendment 782\u2014which substantively changed the Guidelines calculation for certain offenses\u2014was merely a clarifying change. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>732 F.3d 148, 150 (2d Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (\"By reducing the base offense levels for certain crack cocaine offenses, Amendments 748 and 750 [earlier versions of Amendments 782 and 788 with similar effect] plainly effected a substantive change in the law rather than merely clarified the Commission\u2019s prior intent.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b645-6\">. Both parties note that <em>Berrios </em>was decided under the \"substantial disadvantage\" test that the Supreme Court has since rejected. <em>See Peugh, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2083 n.4 (acknowledging that the \"substantial disadvantage\u201d test has been abandoned and stating that the \"relevant question is.whether the change in law creates a sufficient or significant risk of increasing the punishment for a given crime\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). However, Berrios\u2019s use of the \"substantial disadvantage\u201d test does not call into question its application of <em>Keller </em>and the \u201cone-book\u201d rule to the sentence-reduction context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b645-7\">. Our conclusion accords with the principle of fair notice that undergirds <em>ex post facto </em>jurisprudence. <em>See Weaver, </em>450 U.S. at 30, 101 S.Ct. 960 (\"Critical to relief under the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause is not an individual's right to less punishment, but the lack of fair notice and governmental restraint when the legislature increases punishment beyond what was prescribed when the crime was consummated.\u201d); <em>see- also Peugh, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2094. Where a Guidelines amendment affording a sentencing reduction did not exist at the time a defendant committed or was sentenced for the crime of conviction, a defendant could have no expectation of such a benefit, so as to require notice at that time of any eligibility limitations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b646-5\">. In light of the fact that \u00a7 IB1.10 did not change between the time of Ramirez\u2019s compassion of the offense and sentencing, we heed not decide which moment serves as the relevant point of comparison.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b646-6\">. Ramirez relies on two district court cases, which come to a contrary conclusion. <em>See Alli-Balogun v. United States, </em>114 F.Supp.3d 4, 49-50 (E.D.N.Y. 2015); <em>United States v.

However, <em>Alli-Balogun </em>addressed a different provision\u2014 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(e)\u2014and involved a defendant who had served more than the maximum sentence of the amended Guidelines range, such that \u00a7 IB 1.10(e) operated to increase his punishment.
