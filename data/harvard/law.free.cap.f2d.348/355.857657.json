At that hearing he refused to answer certain questions, for which he was convicted for contempt of Congress.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That conviction was reversed by the Supreme Court for insufficiency of the indictment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant was then convicted on a new indictment, which alleged refusal to answer six questions asked by the subcommittee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-20\"> Appellant argues that the subcommittee had no proper legislative purpose and that he was not adequately informed by the subcommittee of the legislative pertinency of its questions. These arguments are foreclosed by Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U.S. 109, 79 S.Ct. 1081, 3 L.Ed.2d 1115 (1959). Appellant further contends that the indictment was insufficient because it did not specifically recite the subcommittee\u2019s authority to conduct the investigation here, and that there was no adequate proof at trial of the subcommittee\u2019s authority. We find no merit in these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-21\">There is one serious question presented by this record which appellant has not alleged as grounds for reversal. At the beginning of the February 28 hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel submitted a written motion to the subcommittee contesting its jurisdiction to question appellant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At that time, the subcommittee chairman stated, \u201cYou may file the mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>tion; and then whatever action the committee desires to take upon it, we will take.\u201d No explicit ruling was made on this motion until the conclusion of the March 1 hearing, when the chairman stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">[A]t the beginning of the hearings, counsel for John T. Gojack * * * filed a statement of objections to hearing and a motion to vacate the subpoenas. At that time the members of the subcommittee unanimously voted to overrule the objections and the motion to vacate the subpoenas. Therefore, I want the record to show that at that time, nunc pro tunc, the objections and motion to vacate subpoenas are overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">This ruling was made after appellant\u2019s refusal to answer the questions for which he was here convicted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Although the subcommittee did specifically direct appellant to answer the questions at issue, its failure specifically to overrule appellant\u2019s motion may have left ambiguous whether the subcommittee had considered the objections raised in appellant\u2019s motion or whether it was ignorant of them before it directed an answer. \u201c[A] clear disposition of the witness\u2019 objection is a prerequisite to prosecution for contempt * * Quinn v. United States, 349 U.S. 155, 167, 75 S.Ct. 668, 675, 99 L.Ed. 964 (1955). The subcommittee must \u201cadvise the witness of [its] position as to his objections * * * [to give him] a clear choice between standing on his objection and compliance with a committee ruling.\u201d Bart v. United States, 349 U.S. 219, 223, 75 S.Ct. 712, 714, 99 L.Ed. 1016 (1955).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-19\">On the previous appeal, this court ruled, \u201cThat [appellant\u2019s motion] was in fact denied is clear from the fact that [appellant was] * * * called, sworn and queried.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is not clear whether we are bound by that ruling. But since appellant\u2019s experienced counsel does not challenge that ruling on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>appeal,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we are not disposed to consider the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-9\">. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7192.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b404-10\">. <em>Sub nom. </em>Russell v.

The Committee is not engaged in a legislative investigation for a bona fide legislative purpose. This Committee is limited under Article I, Section 1 of the United States Constitution to the exercise of legislative powers. The Chairman of the Committee has previously announced as is shown by newspaper clippings attached hereto that the purpose of the hearing is to force the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE) \u2018out of business\u2019 and that with respect to the mov-ants Gojack, * * * \u2018to bring out the facts that they are card carrying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Communists. The rest is up to the community\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"ANc\">\u201c2. If the Committee seeks to inquire into activities of a criminal nature, no specific charges have been furnished the movants and no evidence has been offered that they have violated any law.</p>\n<p id=\"AXl\">\u201cIn any event, the power to inquire into crime is one which is confided ex\u2022clusively to courts and grand jurys under Article I Section 3 of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"Abr\">\u201c3. The purpose of breaking a union, is not one which is authorized by the Committee\u2019s basic resolution, Public Law 601.</p>\n<p id=\"AvBJ\">\u201c4. Even if such a purpose were authorized by the Committee\u2019s basic resolution, the resolution as so construed and applied would constitute a violation of the free speech and assembly guarantees of the First Amendment to the 'Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"ajo-dedup-0\">\u201c5. The Committee\u2019s basic resolution is in any event unconstitutional because no person can determine from it the boundaries of the Committee\u2019s power.</p>\n<p id=\"A42\">\u201c6. The Committee intends, as its \u2022chairman has announced, to exa'ct com-ipulsory disclosure of movants\u2019 political beliefs and affiliations. The First Amendment forbids this particularly where as here there is no overriding legislative justification for such inquiry.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b405-22\">. After this ruling, appellant refused to answer several questions. He was not indicted for those refusals. Compare Flaxer v. United States, 358 U.S. 147, 79 S. Ct. 191, 3 L.Ed.2d 183 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b405-24\">. During his testimony, appellant attempted repeatedly to state his objections and he was repeatedly interrupted by subcommittee members on the ground that he was \u201cproceeding again to read that prepared statement.\u201d The basis for these interruptions was apparently the Committee\u2019s rule that \u201ca prepared or written statement\u201d can be read into the record only upon Committee approval at the conclusion of a witness\u2019 testimony. The effect of the interruptions may have been, however, to deprive appellant of any opportunity to determine whether the subcommittee was aware of the basis for his objections and whether it overruled those objections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b405-25\">. 108 U.S.App.D.C. 130, 138, 280 F.2d 678, 685 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b406-11\"><em>. </em>Appellant\u2019s brief, at p. 52, does refer to the \u201cretroactive rejection\u201d of Ms motion, but only to support his argument that the subcommittee did not adequately advise Mm of the legislative pertinency of its questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b406-6\">BURGER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ayp-dedup-2\">(concurring in the result).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">I cannot agree that the issue concerning denial of Appellant\u2019s motion to the Committee is open. The point was not raised to the Committee; it was not raised in the District Court; it was not raised in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The orderly and efficient administration of the business of the courts ought to preclude \u2014 and I think it does preclude \u2014a litigant from ignoring a point which is obvious even though not valid only to have it raised sua sponte by a member of the reviewing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">That the point discussed by the court has no merit is shown by our own holdings that a ruling may be implicit in the conduct of a tribunal. Judge Wright pointed this out in Cooper v. United States, 119 U.S.App.D.C. 142, 143, 337 F.2d 538, 539 (1964), where he articulated the reasons underlying the summary affirmance of the conviction where the District Court proceeded to trial without entering an order or formally ruling on the Defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. \u201cThe court did not in terms hold that Cooper was competent. But its ruling to this effect is clear from its actions [in proceeding to trial].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Appellant here moved to vacate the subpoena and \u201cset aside\u201d the hearing. His objection went to the fact of any \u25a0questioning at all. To suggest that continuance of the hearing did not dispose \u25a0of Appellant\u2019s motion by denying it is to ignore the realities of the situation. Nor is the rule of the <em>Quinn </em>and <em>Bart </em>\u25a0cases, cited by the court, to the contrary. Those cases significantly did not involve express directions to answer such as Gojack here received. See 349 U.S. at 222, 75 S.Ct. at 714. Moreover, we expressly held the <em>Quinn </em>rule unavailable to Appellant on his former appeal. Gojack v. United States, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 130, 139, 280 F.2d 678, 687 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">For these reasons I am bound to express my disagreement with the court\u2019s discussion of this point.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
