The statements to which he refers were, first, a statement to the effect that he might at some indefinite time have handled some cocaine \u201cjust once\u201d and, second, that he remembered an unspecified \u201csomething\u201d about heroin. There is a question as to whether these statements can properly be classified as admissions since they do not appear to be incriminating. But even if they were improperly admitted we do not consider the error sufficient to justify a reversal, especially since the case was tried by a judge sitting without a jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-22\">\u201c[I]n reviewing proceedings before a judge alone, appellate courts may presume that improper evidence and comments have been rejected, at least absent a showing of substantial prejudice.\u201d In re Bonanno, 2d Cir., 344 F.2d 830, April 30, 1965.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-23\">\u201cIt is presumed that in reaching a decision the trial judge has rejected improper evidence. This rule is particularly applicable where the evidence of guilt is strong and convincing, as in the case here.\u201d Teate v. United States, 297 F.2d 120, 122 (5th Cir. 1961).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-24\">Appellant\u2019s other specifications of error are equally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
