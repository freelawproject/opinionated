King, appellant herein, was charged in an indictment returned by the United States Grand Jury for the Southern District of California, Southern Division, in two counts: One, with smuggling approximately 500,000 amphetamine tablets, which merchandise should have been invoiced; and Two, with fraudulently and knowingly receiving and concealing approximately 500,-000 amphetamine tablets which to his knowledge had been imported into the United States contrary to law, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 545.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">After a trial by jury King was convicted on both counts and given concurrent sentences thereon. The following facts were established by the evidence. At approximately 6:30 p. m. on March 6, 1964, United States Customs Agent J. D. Maxcy received information at his home at Chula Vista that appellant had gone to Tijuana, Mexico, to acquire a large quantity of amphetamine pills. The information had originally been received by a Sergeant Goodwin of the Los Angeles sheriff\u2019s office from an informant. Goodwin notified Inspector Larkworthy of the United States Food and Drug Administration, who in turn notified John Blockman, United States Customs Agent in Charge. Blockman then telephoned Agent Maxcy. The information received also disclosed that appellant would be driving one of two automobiles, which were described by model, color and license number and that appellant would cross the border \u201cshortly after the race track or jai alai crowd broke in Mexico, which would be between 11 and 11:30 p. m.\u201d Agent Maxcy was further informed that appellant would probably make three separate trips, and that on the completion of the first trip he might \u201cconceal or stash these pills in the Chula Vista or South bay area.\u201d At approximately 11:30 p. m. Maxcy observed a Cadillac automobile, which was one of the two cars which had been described to him, enter the United States through the port of entry. He did not stop the car at the border,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but followed it for about eight miles until it had passed the \u201cE\u201d Street cutoff in Chula Vista where Maxcy stopped it. Maxcy identified himself as a customs agent and asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>King if he were bringing any contraband from Mexico. When King replied in the negative, Maxcy asked him if he minded if they looked at the vehicle and he again replied in the negative. The vehicle was then searched, and, in a specially-built compartment in the trunk, the amphetamine tablets in question were found. Prior to trial a motion to suppress this evidence was denied by the court. During this motion to suppress, appellant\u2019s counsel requested the identity of the informant. The court ruled that this was a border search and that the identity of the informant was not material to the legality of the seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Appellant makes three specifications of errors: (1) The contraband evidence upon which the conviction is predicated was seized illegally by officers of the United States Government; (2) the court erred in admitting an incriminatory statement by appellant after he had been arrested; and (3) the court erred in failing to grant a short continuance in order for appellant to demonstrate the materiality of the informant\u2019s identity on the question of guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">To establish his first specification of error, appellant contends that there was no probable cause to search his vehicle, and that, therefore, the contraband found in that search should not have been admitted in evidence. Putting aside the fact that there was evidence that appellant consented to the search, we point out that the district court held that this was a border search. We agree. As was stated in Murgia v. United States, 285 F.2d 14 at 16 (9th Cir. 1960), \u201cNo customs search can be made precisely at the border. All must be made somewhere north of the border between Mexico and the United States.\u201d In Marsh v. United States, 344 F.2d 317 at 324 (5th Cir. 1965), the court said, \u201cThe right of border search is indeed broad, and the border itself is elastic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">In this case the Customs Agent had received information that day that appellant was in Tijuana, Mexico, for the purpose of acquiring a vast amount of amphetamine tablets, and that on the same evening appellant, driving a particularly described vehicle, would bring these tablets into the United States from Mexico, probably making three separate trips. The information was further that on completion of the first trip the tablets might be concealed in the Chula Vista or South Bay area. Agent Maxcy followed the car, keeping it in view at all times. When he saw that the vehicle had not made a turn off from the highway into Chula Vista and when it appeared that appellant might be going to Los Angeles, he then stopped the vehicle, questioned the appellant, and thereafter searched the vehicle and found the contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">It thus appeared from the evidence that there had been no change of condition of the auto from the time it crossed the border until it was stopped. Whatever was in the auto when it was stopped was in it when it crossed the border. We hold that where, as here, duly authorized officers receive information that a person or vehicle is about to cross the border with contraband in violation of the laws of the United States, and where shortly thereafter a person or vehicle conforming substantially to the description thereof given to such officers is seen to cross the border, and where such person or vehicle is followed therefrom by said officers and kept under surveillance until stopped and searched, and where there is no reason to believe that there is any change in condition of such person or vehicle from that at the border so that whatever such vehicle contains or such person possesses at the time the search is made is the same as it was at the border, and where no unreasonable time elapses between the border crossing and the search and there is no unreasonable distance between the border and place the search is made, such search may be held to be a border search.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>This being a border search, special rules are applicable. The statutes involved are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As we said in Witt v. United States, 287 F.2d 389 at 391 (9th Cir. 1961):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-4\">\u201cNo question of whether there is probable cause for a search exists when the search is incidental to the crossing of an international border, for there is reason and probable cause to search every person entering the United States from a foreign country, by reason of such entry alone. That the customs authorities do <em>not </em>search every person crossing the border does not mean they have waived their right to do so, when they see fit. Here a precise description of the automobile in which appellant rode across the border (though not of its passengers) had been passed to the border guards as one being a possible bearer of heroin. This it was ultimately found to be. Mere suspicion has been held enough cause for a search at the border. Cervantes v. United States, 9 Cir., 1959, 263 F.2d 800, 803, note 5.\u201d (Emphasis original)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-14\">Similarly, in Murgia, supra 285 F.2d at 17, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-15\">\u201cThe right of border search does not depend on probable cause. Carroll v. United States, 1924, 267 U.S. 132, 154, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543. Cf.: People v. Brown, 1955, 45 Cal.2d 640, 290 P.2d 528; Johnson v. United States, 1948, 333 U.S. 10, 16-17, 68 S.C. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436; People v. Simon, 1955, 45 Cal.2d 645, 290 P.2d 531. \u2018[The] searches of persons entering the United States from a foreign country are in a separate category from searches generally * * * [and] \u201care totally different things from a search for and seizure of a man\u2019s private books and papers * * \u2019 King v. United States, 5 Cir., 1958, 258 F.2d 754, at page 756, certiorari denied 359 U.S. 939, 79 S.Ct. 652, 3 L.Ed.2d 639, quoting Boyd v. United States, 1886, 116 U.S. 616, 623, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746. Cf.: Blackford v. United States, 9 Cir., 1957, 247 F.2d 745, certiorari denied 356 U.S. 914, 78 S.Ct. 672, 2 L.Ed.2d 586; United States v. Yee Ngee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>How, D.C.N.D.Cal., 1952, 105 F.Supp. 517.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">See also Marsh v. United States, supra, 344 F.2d at 324, where it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-5\">\u201cBorder searches are, of course, not exempt from the constitutional test of reasonableness. A true border search, however, is not regarded as unreasonable even though made without probable cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Sound policy considerations support the special treatment accorded border searches. Congress as well as the courts have thus recognized the peculiar and difficult law enforcement problems that necessarily are presented by the effective policing of our extensive national boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\"> Under the above rules we hold that the evidence upon which the conviction in this case was based was not seized illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">The evidence concerning appellant\u2019s second specification of error discloses that after the search of appellant\u2019s automobile, Agent Maxcy talked to appellant in the office of the Customs Agency Service at the port of entry. There, appellant was informed by Agent Maxcy that \u201cwe were going to ask him a few questions pertaining to the contraband found in his vehicle, and that it was my duty to advise him under the Constitution of the United States he was under no duty to answer any questions that we asked him, and that he was entitled to be represented by an attorney should he so desire, and that anything he did say could be used against him should we have any future court proceedings.\u201d Appellant gave his name and occupation, disclosed that he had left his home in Long Beach about six p. m. on March 6th, that he had driven to Tijuana, Mexico, by himself, and that he had gone to the dog races there. When asked questions pertaining to the pills found in the automobile, appellant stated \u201che had no comment to make about the pills at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">About an hour later appellant was taken by Agent Maxcy and another agent in an automobile from the port of entry to San Diego to be booked. During this ride certain questions were asked by Agent Maxcy and certain answers given by appellant. There was also a voluntary statement made by appellant. Upon appellant\u2019s objection to the offer of this evidence, the jury was excused, and in the absence of the jury, Agent Maxcy testified as shown in the footnote.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After hearing appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s objections to the offer of this testimony, the court indicated that he would not admit the two answers to the questions, but that he would admit appellant\u2019s voluntary statement. The jury was then recalled and Maxcy testified before the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-14\">\u201cQ [By Mr. Johnson] Agent Maxcy, in your conversation in the vehicle with the defendant, Mr. King, was the word \u2018bread\u2019 mentioned ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-15\">\u201cA Yes, sir, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-16\">\u201cQ And what was said, and by whom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-17\">\u201cA Mr. King stated to myself and Inspector Addis that the biggest problem was getting them home. However, once you get a taste for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>bread, you can get yourself in a lot of trouble.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">We see no error in the introduction of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\"> Likewise, there is no merit in appellant\u2019s third specification of error for two reasons. First, since the district court properly held that this was a border search, probable cause for the search and demonstration of sufficient reliable information to create probable cause was not required; consequently, appellant was not necessarily entitled to knowledge of the identity of the informer. Secondly, in the course of counsel\u2019s discussion with the court concerning the production of a deputy sheriff of Los Angeles named Burman who knew the identity of the original informer, it was stipulated by both counsel that if the deputy sheriff were called he would refuse to answer questions concerning the identity of the informer or the exact details of the informer\u2019s information or activity. Then, the proceedings as set out in the footnote occurred.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As shown by the record, counsel was offered the opportunity of producing essential evidence and decided that he would not take advantage of that offer. We see no error in the ruling of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-24\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-10\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 545.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-11\">\u201cWhoever knowingly and willfully, with intent to defraud the United States, smuggles, or clandestinely introduces into the United States any merchandise which should have been invoiced ^ &lt; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-12\">\u201cWhoever fraudulently or knowingly imports or brings into the United States, any merchandise contrary to law, or receives, conceals, buys, sells, or in any manner facilitates the transportation, concealment, or sale of such merchandise after importation, knowing the same to have been imported or brought into the United States contrary to law \u2014 \u201d shall be punished as provided by law-</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b863-14\">. \u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Maxcy, what was the reason that you did not stop the defendant at the border?</p>\n<p id=\"b863-16\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: The reason, your Honor, was that we didn\u2019t follow normal procedure and post a look-out in this instance because the information I had in my possession was that Mr. King possibly was going to contact someone else in the Chula Vista or the South Bay area immediately adjacent to the border. For this reason we maintained our own surveillance separate from the inspector for the primary purpose of following him.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: In other words, you didn\u2019t stop him at the border because you wanted to try to make some further arrests in the event he contacted other persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-20\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: That is correct; yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b864-7\">. Appellant\u2019s reliance upon Cervantes v. United States, 263 F.2d 800 (9th Cir. 1959), is misplaced. In Cervantes it was pointed out that the appellant was not stopped in connection with a pursuit, but was stopped on the basis of information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>that some ten weeks before the appellant, Thayer, was supposed to have gone to Tijuana to purchase narcotics, that the government official had no information that the appellant that day was transporting any contraband material, and that the appellant was stopped some seventy miles north of the border on the basis of an alert for \u201cpossible suspects.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b865-7\">. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 482 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">\u201cAny of the officers * * * authorized to board or search vessels may stop, search, and examine, as well without as within their respective districts, any vehicle * * * on which * * * he or they shall suspect there is merchandise which * * * shall have been introduced into the United States in any manner contrary to law, whether by the person in possession or charge, or by, in or upon such vehicle * * * or otherwise, * * * and if any such officer * * * so authorized shall find any merchandise on or about any such vehicle * * * which he shall have reasonable cause to believe * * * to have been unlawfully introduced into the United States, * * * he shall seize and secure the same for trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-19\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b865-20\">\u201c(a) Any officer of the custom may at any time go on board of any * * * vehicle at any place in the United States * * * without as well as within his district * * * and examine, inspect, and search the * * * vehicle and every part thereof * * * and to this end may hail and stop such * * * vehicle, and use all necessary force to compel compliance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-26\">Subdivision (d) requires the driver of such a vehicle, upon direction of such an officer, to come to a stop, and authorizes pursuit if he does not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-27\">Subdivision (e) directs seizure of the vehicle if it shall appear that a breach of the laws of the United States is being or had been committed so as to render the vehicle or the merchandise on board of, or brought into the United States by, such vehicle, liable to forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-28\">Subdivision (f) makes it the duty of the officer to effect the seizure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b866-9\">. \u201cTHE WITNESS: * * * I asked Mm about the compartment in the vehicle, and he said it had been a great deal of work making it, and I carried on the conversation for a period of time, and then I said, \u2018Gee, how were you going to get those pills out of the car?\u2019 He said, \u2018I was going to get them out the same way you fellows got them out.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">\u201cI discontinued the conversation for a short period of time again, and then at this time be stated a casual remark, \u2018Well, the main difficulty is getting these things home,\u2019 and, \u2018Once you get a taste for bread, you get yourself into a lot of trouble.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"A4F\">\u201cTHE COURT: Was that last statement in response to anything that you had said?</p>\n<p id=\"Aih\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: No, the latter one was not.

It may be at some other posture of the ease I would. So let\u2019s call the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-19\">\u201cMR. HUGHES: One minute, your Honor.
