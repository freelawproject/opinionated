The only damage was to ap-pellee\u2019s tug, which sank and became a constructive total loss in the stipulated amount of $16,287. Dividing the damage, the district court entered judgment for the appellee against the appellant in the amount of $8,143.50, with interest from the date of the accident. The ap-pellee has cross-assigned error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-29\"> Five of the witnesses testified orally before the court and three by deposition. We have carefully read and studied all of the testimony in connection with the exhibits, and we cannot set aside the findings of the district court as clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding interest from the date of the collision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-30\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b637-31\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-17\">.
