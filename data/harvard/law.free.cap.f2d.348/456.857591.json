Whether \u201cthe earnings and profits of [the] corporation [were] permitted to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of the business * * * to avoid the income tax with respect to shareholders\u201d was in this case largely a factual determination. The findings of the trial court are certainly not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d and we accept them. Rule 52, F.R.Civ.P. Nor do we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>observe fault in the principles of law the Court stated or as it applied them. We affirm for the reasons given by the District Judge in his written opinion, reported as Fenco, Inc. v. United States of America, 234 F.Supp. 317 (D.C.Md. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
