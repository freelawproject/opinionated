This Court has urged school authorities to grasp the nettle now. We have put them on notice that, \u201cThe rule has become: the later the start, the shorter the time allowed for transition.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AfG\">The leavening principle that schools shall be desegregated with \u201call deliberate speed\u201d was not based on the degree of \u25a0community hostility to the change: \u201cthe vitality of these constitutional principles\u201d, the Supreme Court remarked in Brown, \u201ccannot be allowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It was based on the administrative problems in making the transition from a segregated to an integrated system.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A slow-down now willl only multiply a school board\u2019s administrative difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-17\">The United States Office of Education, Department of Health, Education and Welfare, has fixed minimum standards to be used in determining the qualifications for schools applying for federal financial aid.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThe fall of 1967 is set as the target date for the extension of desegregation to all grades of school systems not fully desegregated in 1965-1966 as a qualification for Federal financial assistance\u201d <em>;</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a good faith start requires designation of at least four grades for the 1965-1966 school year.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number> We attach great weight to the standards established by the Office of Education. The judiciary has of course functions and duties distinct from those of the executive department, but in carrying out a national policy the three departments of government are united by a common objective. There should be a close correlation, therefore, between the judiciary\u2019s standards in enforcing the national policy requiring desegregation of public schools and the executive department\u2019s standards in administering this policy. Absent legal questions, the United States Office of Education is better qualified than the courts and is the more appropriate federal body to weigh administrative difficulties inherent in school desegregation plans. If in some district courts judicial guides for approval of a school desegregation plan are more acceptable to the community or substantially less burdensome than H.E.W. guides, school boards may turn to the federal courts as a means of circumventing the H.E.W. requirements for financial aid. Instead of a uniform policy relatively easy to administer, both the courts and the Office of Education would have to struggle with individual school systems on ad hoc basis. If judicial standards are lower than H.E.W. standards, recalcitrant school boards in effect will receive a premium for recalcitrance; the more the intransigence, the bigger the bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\"> In view of the need for immediate relief if Negro children in Jackson are to receive the benefit of the Office of Education\u2019s 1967 target date for total public school desegregation, the appellant\u2019s motion for injunctive relief pending appeal is granted with directions that the district court order the appellee School District to submit promptly a plan of desegregation extending to at least four grades for the year 1965-1966. In redrawing the plan the appellee should bear in mind that decisions of this Court have directed that desegregation of public schools should extend concurrently from the lower grades up and from the higher grades down.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As to details of the plan, the Board should be guided by the standards and policies announced by the United States Office of Education in establishing standards for compliance with the requirement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">If Selma, Alabama, can commence with desegregation of four grades for 1965-1966, Jackson, Mississippi, can at least catch up.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And indeed in all but the most exceptional cases, all school districts commencing desegregation in fall 1965 should be expected to do as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">The mandate shall be issued forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-12\">. Appellants are Negroes who in March 1963 filed suit on behalf of their children seeking injunctive relief requiring the Jackson Municipal Separate School District to desegregate the public schools of Jackson, Mississippi. The district court dismissed the complaint on the notion that the Negro students had failed to utilize or exhaust available administrative remedies relating to the assignment of pupils to schools. We reversed with directions that the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for injunctive relief be speedily heard and decided. Evers v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District, 5 Cir. 1964, 328 F.2d 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-26\">On remand, the district court, March 4, 1964, ordered the Board to file a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>segregation plan by July 15, 1964, -which would desegregate at least one grade by September 1964. At the trial in April 1964 the Board and white parents who had intervened offered voluminous testimony to support their contention that racial differences justified continued school segregation. The Court made final its March 4, 1964, order. The Board and the intervenors appealed. That appeal is now pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">July 15, 1964, the Board filed a grade-a-year segregation plan offering \u201cfreedom of choice\u201d type assignments to pupils entering the first grade in September 1964. After a hearing July 29, the district court \u201ctentatively approved\u201d the plan and recessed the hearing until February 1965. The court below again approved the Board\u2019s plan as submitted. The appellants appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">On the Attorney General\u2019s certification that \u201cthis case is of general public importance\u201d, raising questions \u201cwhich are bound to affect the resolution of desegregation controversies elsewhere in the State and throughout the South\u201d, the court granted leave to the United States to intervene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b778-9\">.

These \u201cproblems relatfe] to administration, arising from the physical condition of the school plant, the school transportation system, personnel, revision of school districts and attendance areas into compact units to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis, and revision of local laws and regulations which may be necessary in solving the foregoing problems\u201d. Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954, 349 U.S. 294, 299, 75 S.Ct. 753, 756, 99 L.Ed. 1083. In retrospect, the second Brown opinion clearly imposes on public school authorities the duty to provide an integrated school system. Judge Parker\u2019s well-known dictum (\u201cThe Constitution, in other words, does not require integration. It merely forbids discrimination\u201d.) in Briggs v. Elliott, E.D.S.C. 1955, 132 F.Supp. 776, 777, should be laid to rest. It is inconsistent with Brown and the later development of decisional and statutory law in the area of civil rights. This Court has come a long way from Avery v. Wichita Falls Ind. School District, 5 Cir. 1957, 241 F.2d 230, 233, cert. den\u2019d, 353 U.S. 938, 77 S.Ct. 816, 1 L.Ed.2d 761 (1957) and Holland v.
