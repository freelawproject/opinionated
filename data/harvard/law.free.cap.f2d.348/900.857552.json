Appellant is a state prisoner serving a life sentence imposed by the First Judicial District of Nevada (Douglas County) for conviction of the crime of kidnapping in the first degree, i. e., for the purpose of robbery. The petition was denied because of appellant\u2019s failure to exhaust his state remedies. Jurisdiction below rested on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241; here, on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">The appellant is held in California prison by California authorities acting as agents for Nevada under terms (Art. IY(a)) of the \u201cWestern Interstate Corrections Compact.\u201d By its express terms, inmates in California penal institutions held pursuant to the Compact\u2019s terms are \u201cat all times * * * subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state,\u201d and may be transferred to an institution of the sending state \u201cat any time\u201d and \u201cfor any [lawful] purpose.\u201d (Art. IV(e)). Nor is the inmate so- confined \u201cdeprived\u201d of any legal rights which said inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">The clear and unambiguous language of the Compact provides that the sending state, in this case, Nevada, retains jurisdiction over any inmate confined pursuant to its terms. The State of California acts solely as an agent of the State of Nevada for the purposes of the appellant\u2019s incarceration. The prisoner is deprived of no rights he otherwise has by the fact of his transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-16\">Appellant admits that he has not applied for a writ of habeas corpus to the courts of the State of Nevada. He cannot claim that Nevada remedies are ineffective since he has not sought to obtain them. As late as November 27,1964, in Morehead v. State of California, 9 Cir., 339 F.2d 170, 171, this court said that \u201c \u2018Ineffectiveness\u2019 of State relief cannot be established if no attempt is made to obtain that relief.\u201d See also the discussion in Morehead v. State of California, supra; Battista v. Kenton, 312 F.2d 167 (2d Cir. 1963); Eckman v. Byington, 290 F.2d 1 (9th Cir. 1961); and Gidney v. Sterling, 202 F.Supp. 344 (E.D.Ark 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-17\">As the district court here aptly and properly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-18\">\u201cPetitioner alleges that even if a remedy is available in Nevada the circumstances of his incarceration will make it extremely difficult for him to employ counsel and prosecute his case. Presumably the Nevada authorities will undertake to assure him the same access to a post-conviction remedy that he would have if he were incarcerated in the state of Nevada. Any substantial failure to do so might create circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>which would render the state process ineffective to protect petitioner\u2019s rights. If such proves to be the case he would of course not be precluded by the \u2018exhaustion doctrine\u2019 from returning to this court for relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aos-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
