On December 13, 1963, after receiving the report of the penitentiary medical staff, the district court affirmed the sentence originally imposed, but subjecting it to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4208(a) (2). Neither Appellant nor his counsel were present at the time this sentence was imposed. After Appellant alleged that the sentencing without his presence or that of his counsel violated his constitutional rights as stated in United States v. Behrens, 375 U.S. 162, 84 S.Ct. 295, 11 L.Ed.2d 224 (1963) the district court, on April 3, 1964, imposed final sentence in open court with the Appellant and his court-appointed counsel present. This sentence of 49 months allowed Appellant credit for the time spent in prison and the time spent in jail before he entered his plea of guilty. Appellant alleges that the procedure followed denied him due process of law and seeks relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">The district court having corrected Appellant\u2019s sentence pursuant to Rule 35, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, so that its imposition meets the requirements of United States v. Behrens, supra, denial of relief under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 is clearly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-14\">The judgment of the district court must be, and is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
