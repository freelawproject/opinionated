The district court denied the application without granting Warren a hearing. Warren appeals, asserting that the district court erred in not granting him a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">This is the second time Warren has appealed to this court from a district court order denying an application under section 2255. On the previous appeal we affirmed. Warren v. Richardson, 9 Cir., 333 F.2d 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">In his new application, Warren makes allegations not included in his first application. Viewing these allegations as a whole, we think they are of such nature that Warren should have been accorded an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
