We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-14\">Appellant was charged with passing and possessing counterfeit $10 Federal Reserve Notes with intent to defraud. It is conceded that appellant passed and possessed the counterfeit bills. He defended on the theory that he did not know that the bills were counterfeit, a necessary element of the crime. United States v. Carll, 105 U.S. 611, 613, 26 L.Ed. 1135 (1882). The jury resolved this issue against appellant, and we hold that even in light of the strictures of Marson v. United States, 203 F.2d 904, 906 (6 Cir. 1953), and United States v. Forzano, 190 F.2d 687, 688 (2 Cir. 1951) against inferring the guilty knowledge from mere possession of counterfeit money, there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable jury could conclude that the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant knew the bills were counterfeit.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-16\">Appellant claims that certain of this evidence supporting the verdict is hearsay and that the judgment of conviction should be reversed because its admission was erroneous. A prosecution witness, a Mr. Keys, testified that he owned a bar in the same town as where appellant had tried to pass the counterfeit bill, that on the day before the incident alleged in the indictment occurred a man came into his bar and tendered a $10 bill, that he recognized this bill as counterfeit and that he \u201cthrew it back\u201d at the man. Government counsel then asked whether that man was present in the courtroom and the witness replied, much to counsel\u2019s surprise, \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d The witness then testified that on the next night he had been shown a man through a window in a door at the police station, whom he then identified as the man who attempted to pass him the counterfeit bill the night before. Counsel then asked Keys whether the man he identified was present in the courtroom, and the witness replied, \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel did not cross-examine Keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-17\">After this witness was excused, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-18\">Mr. Greenberg [defense counsel]: At this time I wish to strike this last witness\u2019s entire testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-19\">The Court: I deny the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-20\">Mr. Hurwitz [Government counsel] : May we have a side-bar conference at this time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-21\">The Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-22\">(At the side-bar, without the hearing of the jury:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-23\">* * <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-24\">Mr. Hurwitz: * * * As may be apparent, this last witness positively identified Brown on the night of April 4th, and, indeed, had given us the description prior to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-25\">The Court: Why don\u2019t you call in the detective?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Mr. Hurwitz: I want to call the detective right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">The Court: You have established the chain of circumstances. It seems to me, if you don\u2019t do it he might have been right in moving to strike it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">Mr. Hurwitz: I propose to call one of the two detectives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">Mr. Greenberg: I object to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">Mr. Hurwitz: I don\u2019t see anything objectionable about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">The Court: I don\u2019t either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">(In open court.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-11\">Mr. Hurwitz: Your Honor, may I recall Mr. Jerome Rapaport.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-12\">The Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-13\">\n<em>Direct Examination by Mr. Hurwitz:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-14\">Q. Mr. Rapaport, you are still under oath. A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-15\">Q. You testified on previous examination that you were at police headquarters in Port Chester, New York, on the evening of April 4, 1964. A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-16\">Q. Did a Mr. William Keys arrive at police headquarters at Port Chester, New York? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-17\">Q. Do you know who Mr. William Keys is? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-18\">Q. What happened after he arrived? A. Well, Mr. Brown \u2014 he made a positive identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-19\">Mr. Greenberg: I object to that. It is a conclusion of the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-20\">The Court: Yes, sustained. Strike it out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-22\">Just tell us exactly what you saw him do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-23\">Q. Tell us exactly what he did on that evening. A. Brown was in a section of the detectives\u2019 room. Mr. Keys went in there and looked through a two-way mirror glass that we had, and I remember I banged on the door, and Brown looked up, and he made an identification of the person that was in his bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-24\">Q. Of the person that was in whose bar? A. Mr. Keys\u2019 bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-26\">Mr. Hurwitz: I have no further questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-28\">(Witness excused.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-29\">Appellant complains that Officer Rapa-port testified as to hearsay when he testified that the man identified by Keys was the appellant and that this testimony was inadmissible as substantive evidence under the rule of Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135, 65 S.Ct. 1443, 89 L.Ed. 2103 (1945) barring prior unsworn statements of a declarant available at trial for cross-examination. Appellee contends that what Officer Rapaport had testified to was not a statement of Keys, but rather an act of his, identifying a man, who the Officer could now identify, but Keys couldn\u2019t. It is urged that the rule of Bridges v. Wixon applies to testimony of prior statements rather than to prior identifications such as this, and we are referred to 4 Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 1130 (3rd ed. 1940) and United States v. Forzano, 190 F.2d 687, 689 (2 Cir. 1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-30\">It is, however, unnecessary for us to pass on the merits of this controversy, for it appears from the portion of the transcript quoted above, quite contrary to the impression created by appellant\u2019s counsel, with the acquiescence of the Government\u2019s counsel, that no hearsay objection was taken to the Officer\u2019s testimony. As far back as 1912 the Supreme Court declared in Diaz v. United States, 223 U.S. 442, 450, 32 S.Ct. 250, 252, 56 L.Ed. 500, that if hearsay evidence \u201cis admitted without objection, it is to be considered and given its natural probative effect as if it were in law admissible.\u201d Cf. also United States v. Torres, 343 F.2d 750, 752 (2 Cir. 1965) (failure to object to admission of statement allegedly obtained during period of unnecessary delay prior to arraignment).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-31\">When first informed of the prosecutor\u2019s intention to recall Officer Rapaport, appellant\u2019s counsel said, \u201cI object to that.\u201d However, this general objection does not cure the defect noted, especially since both the trial judge and the prosecutor indicated that they did not understand the basis of the objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>and the objection was not renewed at the time Rapaport testified as to Keys\u2019 identification of appellant. Subject to an exception not here applicable, \u201cthe cardinal principle (mr sooner repeated by Courts than ignored by counsel) is that a <em>general objection, if overruled, </em>cannot avail the objector on appeal,\u201d 1 Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 18, at 332 (3rd ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
