The party Taub et al. opposed that Rausser et al. motion on the ground that the compounds defined by the counts were not disclosed in the Rausser et al. parent application, serial No. 673,141. In particular, appellants pointed to the fact that the Rausser et al. parent application discloses the 9-hydrogen but not the 9a-fluoro species. The examiner, in granting the motion to shift stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-17\">* * * Since it is well established that a disclosure of a single species of a generic count is sufficient to determine the issue of priority in an interference proceeding, a finding that Rausser parent application does in fact contain an adequate disclosure of any species within the scope of the present counts would dictate the granting of the motion to shift. Lawson et al v. Bruce et al, 1955 C.D. 205; McBurney v. Jones, 104 U.S.P.Q. 115; Adamson v. Sperber et al, 106 U.S.P.Q. 429.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aps\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-18\">It is the judgment of the Examiner that the prior Rausser application Serial No. 673,141 supports species within the scope of the counts in issue. The 9-hydrogen species, together with an adequate statement of utility and method of preparation, are fully disclosed in said prior application. This constitutes a constructive reduction to practice of such species as of July 22, 1957, the filing date of Serial No. 673,141. Consequently, the reduction to practice of a single species under the generic count entitles the party Rausser to the benefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>his earlier filed application for contesting priority on the present generic counts, in accordance with the established practice as outlined for example, in Lawson et al v. Bruce et al, supra.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The benefit of the date of the parent application accorded Rausser et al. made them senior party. Priority subsequently was awarded Rausser et al, on the basis of that date, Taub v. Rausser, 145 USPQ 497 (Bd.Pat.Intf.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The party Taub et al. moved to declare a new interference on counts A, B and C <em>which exactly correspond to claims 1-8 here on appeal, </em>Rausser et al. opposed, arguing, in the words of the examiner, that the 9a-fluoro compounds are \u201cembraced by count 2 * * and that \u201cwhat differences there are between the fluoro and non-fluoro compounds amount to differences only in degree, since both types of compounds are anti-inflammatory compounds.\u201d The examiner accepted the views of Rausser et al. in his Decision on Motions stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">. It is the decision of the Examiner that the views of the party Rausser must prevail. There can be no quarrel with the position that proposed counts A, B and C read directly on count 2 of the interference and thus it is not seen how a patentable difference can be urged merely on the basis of alleged \u201coutstanding and valuable activities\u201d in the compounds of the proposed counts. Here again the 9a-fluoro compounds of proposed counts A, B and C would not sustain separate patents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Both the decision to grant the motion to shift and the decision to deny the motion to institute another interference on the 9a-fluoro species alone were adhered to by the examiner in a decision on a Taub et al. Petition for Reconsideration (there being no appeal under Rule 244(d)). The examiner stated that it was \u201cimmaterial\u201d that Rausser et al. discloses only the 9-hydrogen species in their parent application, and noted again that \u201cthe 9-fluoro species is within the scope of the generic count.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">The pertinent dates and support in the applications may be summarized thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">Filing Date Serial No. Applicants Disclosure</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A60\">July 22,1957 673,141 Rausser et al. parent 9-hydrogen species <em>only</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aha\">Mar. 19, 1958 722,390 Taub et al. parent 9-hydrogen species <em>and </em>9-halo species including 9a-fluoro</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"as5-dedup-0\">May 8, 1958 733,843 Rausser et al. <em>It</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As5n\">Aug. 5, 1959 831,688 Taub et al. division (on appeal) <em>it</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">Claims 1-4 of the Taub et al. application on appeal were finally rejected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-13\">* * * as being unpatentable over the issue of interference No. 89,880, involving applicants\u2019 [appellants\u2019] parent application Serial No. 722,-390. It is again pointed out that the claims <em>read directly </em>on count 2 of the interference. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-16\">However, it appears from the record that <em>previous </em>rejections had stated that the claims were unpatentable over count 2. That, as we have noted for the past several years, is an ambiguous rejection, a source of much confusion, and may or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>may not, within the context of the particular case, satisfy 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 132. \u2022 In attempting to overcome that rejection appellants stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\">* * * The specific 16|3-methyl-9a-fluoro steroids defined in claims 1-4 possess outstanding activities above that possessed by the generic claim of 16|3-methyl compounds defined in Count 2 of said interference. It is planned to submit an affidavit very shortly setting forth the results of experimental studies demonstrating these outstanding and valuable activities. Upon the submission of this affidavit demonstrating patentable distinction between claims 1-4 and said Count 2 of Interference 89,880 it is planned to prosecute the subject matter of the instant claims in the present application.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In response to that allegation of \u201coutstanding and valuable activities,\u201d the examiner in the final rejection noted first that the affidavit had not been submitted, and then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">* * * the significance of such an affidavit is not seen since <em>regardless </em>of any showing of outstanding activity in the 9a-fluoro compounds, the claims herein are not patentable over the aforesaid interference count which <em>equally embraces </em>the 9a-fluoro compounds. See M.P.E.P. 709.01. * * * [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">As we interpret those comments, the examiner was stating that since the count dominates the fluoro species any affidavits as to properties would be irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Appellants filed notice of appeal and in a subsequent amendment submitted an affidavit of Sanford L. Steelman, which is said to show that the 9a-fluoro species has a \u201crelative systemic cortisone activity * * * \u201d of 3.4 times that of the 9-hydrogen species.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">The examiner\u2019s answer again stated the claims were rejected as \u201cunpaten-entable over the issue of interference No. 89,880 * * since the 9a-fluoro species defined in the appealed claims \u201care within the scope of Count 2 * * * [and] therefore, a patentable distinction is not in evidence.\u201d The examiner <em>noted </em>the affidavit, but considered that the issue in furtherance of which it was presented, i. e. the unpatentability over the count, to have been answered by the inter partes Decision on Motions in the interference. The examiner\u2019s answer reproduced a portion of the Decision which stated, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-12\">* * * the record herein does not establish patentable distinctness between the 9a-fluoro species of the appealed claims and fhe generic count. In this regard the Steelman affidavit, supra, is deemed <em>irrelevant </em>since the invention resides in the introduction of the 16-beta-methyl group and not in the 9 alpha-fluoro group. * * * [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-14\">* * * In the instant case the <em>generic </em>count was first filed while 9-fiuoro species is within the scope of the generic count. Accordingly, the 9a-fluoro species of claims 1-4 and the existing genus will not sustain separate patents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-16\">However, as well as noting that the differences between the 9-fluoro and 9-hydrogen species \u201cappear to amount to differences in degree only * * the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>examiner seemed to require further tests since he quoted that portion of the Decision on Motions which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">* * * It should further be noted that the Steelman affidavit fails to compare the 9a-fluoro species of claims 1-4 with the <em>9a-halo </em>species within the scope of count 2. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Appellants responded by filing two additional affidavits of Steelman, the first of which apparently shows that the 9a-fluoro-16-methyl compound is 3 times more active than the desmethyl compound, 9a-fluoro-16-hydrogen steroid. The second affidavit compared the 9a-fluoro compound with the corresponding <em>bromo </em>compound, and found the fluoro compound to be 255 times more active. On remand, the examiner admitted the affidavits \u201cunder the provisions of Rule 195,\u201d but reaffirmed the rejection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">The newly presented affidavits purportedly \u201cestablish a non-obvious and patentable distinction between the 9a-fluoro species of appealed claims 1-4 and both the prior art 16-desmethyl steriod and other 9-halo species within the scope of count 2\u201d. Appellants therefore urge that under the doctrine of In re Ruff et al, 118 USPQ 340, they should be entitled to the 9a-fluoro species of the appealed claims in view of the Dr. Steelman affidavits and the fact that there was no \u201cart-recognized equivalence\u201d between the previously known 9a-fluoro steroids and their 9-hydrogen counterparts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-11\">The Examiner fails to appreciate the significance of the newly presented affidavits since the primary issue in this appeal is not concerned with equivalency or non-equivalency of members of a Markush group but is rather directed to the fundamental proposition that a <em>reference </em>to a claimed species precludes a separate patent in <em>that </em>species. The In re Ruff decision is not seen to be in point since the present count of Int. No. 89,880 still <em>includes </em>the 9a-fluoro species defined in the appealed claims. Thus, there is no reason for a departure from the position taken in the Examiner\u2019s Answer that the generic count and the 9a-fluoro species within the scope of said count will not sustain separate patents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">To us the foregoing establishes that 1) appellants were faced with a rejection of the claims as \u201cunpatentable over\u201d count 2 of the interference. 2) appellants argued the \u201cunpatentable over\u201d rejection and submitted affidavits in an attempt to establish a \u201cpatentable distinction\u201d based on non-obviousness of the fluoro species over the hydrogen species, but 3) it became clear that the examiner <em>assumed </em>all species <em>within </em>the count to be \u201cprior art\u201d by virtue of the priority award. Although the examiner entered the affidavits, he considered them \u201cirrelevant\u201d and failed, in his own words, to \u201cappreciate the[ir] significance * * <em>The board, </em>in its initial decision and upon reconsideration, although discussing the affidavits<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>did not, as we see it, make </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>any new ground of refection, </em>either express or implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">It is not clear whether the examiner and the board considered that count as \u201cprior art\u201d to be applied against the instant claims in a section 102(a) \u201canticipation\u201d rejection, since the examiner stated that \u201cthe claims read directly on count 2,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or whether, since the claimed species is included within the count, they considered <em>domination </em>by the count to be the equivalent of specific claiming by the prior inventor. Insofar as the former interpretation of the rejection may have been meant, it is not correct, since \u201cprior art\u201d in the sense of section 102(g) cannot here be the basis of a section 102(a) rejection, the invention not being <em>publicly </em>\u201cknown or used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">We also do not agree with the rejection as based on the concept that domination by the count precludes the showing of a patentable distinction thereover. The examiner and the board treated <em>every </em>compound within the scope of count 2 as \u201cprior art,\u201d in the sense of section 102(g) as an \u201cinvention * * made in this country by another,\u201d \u201cbefore the applicant\u2019s invention.\u201d We cannot agree with the assumption that in the factual situation above presented <em>every </em>compound within the count (in the sense that it would infringe the count) is \u201cprior art.\u201d The winning of priority on a broad count was based on evidence of priority with respect to only one species, wherein X was hydrogen, not halo or fluoro.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Both applications initially involved in the interference, the Rausser et al. continuation and the Taub et al. parent application, show adequate support for a generic count inclusive of both halogen and hydrogen at the 9-position The problem arises from the fact that one may establish priority for a generic claim on the basis of a showing that he was prior as to a single species. See In re Kyrides, 159 F.2d 1019, 34 CCPA 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Here Rausser et al. was awarded priority on the basis of the disclosure of the hydrogen species in their parent application, being entitled to its filing date, July 22, 1957, as the date of conception and constructive reduction to practice. Since it has been adjudicated that Taub et al. did not meet their burden of proof showing they were the first inventors of the 9-hydrogen species, they cannot be said to be the first inventors thereof. However, no such determination as to the 9a-fluoro species was made. Since both parties in eifect rest on their filing dates as to the 9a-fluoro species, the record indicates that Taub et al. are prior as to that species, their parent case being earlier than the Rausser et al. continuation case. Thus, <em>within the fact pattern here, </em>logic dictates that <em>count 2 cannot be the prior invention of another applicable against Taub et al. insofar as the 9a-fluoro species is concerned, </em>under section 102(g). Thus the rejection must fall, and it becomes necessary to remand the case for a full consideration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>issue on which appellants <em>attempted to join </em>the Patent Office, the determination of whether the 9a-fluoro species is obvious over the 9-hydrogen species of the count in view of appellants\u2019 affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">We do not read In re Fenn, 50 CCPA 1163, 315 F.2d 949, 137 USPQ 367; In re Boileau, 163 F.2d 562, 35 CCPA 727; In re Cole, 82 F.2d 405, 23 CCPA 1057, or In re Sola, 77 F.2d 627, 22 CCPA 1313 to the contrary. Similarly, since the holding in In re Gregg, 244 F.2d 316, 44 CCPA 904, 907, was founded on the fact that \u201cthere is no evidence to show completion of the invention covered by the appealed claims by appellant at any time prior to Coakwell\u2019s filing date,\u201d that is, \u201cthe Coakwell patent is a reference under Section 102(e) * * we do not find that case to indicate a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">For the foregoing reasons the rejection of the claims on the interference count is <em>reversed </em>and the application is <em>remanded </em>for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">SMITH, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-12\">. A third party, Agnello et al., abandoned their two involved applications and the interference was dissolved as to them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b606-19\">. The Rausser et al. application has issued as U.S. Patent No. 3,164,618 on January 5, 1965.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b607-14\">. The initial Decision on Motions is dated June 30, 1961 and the Decision on Petition for Reconsideration is dated September 5, 1961.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b608-9\">. Those comments are from an amendment dated April 11, 1960. From the record it appears that the motions in the interference had already been filed, a letter from the Patent Interference Examiner, dated April 8, 1959, having set the expiration of the motion period as May 25, 1959. Thus it would appear that appellants, learning from the interference that Rausser et al. planned to rely on their parent case filed July 22, 1959, and that the Rausser et al. parent ease supported only the hydrogen species, did two things. First, in the interference they opposed the motion of Rausser et al. to shift the burden of proof based on the Rausser et al. earlier parent case, and moved to declare a new interference on the 9a-fluoro species alone. Second, appellants filed on August 5, 1959, the instant application dividing out the 9 a-fluoro species.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\">. The board, after affirming the \u201cunpat-entable over\u201d rejection of the examiner, stated that the \u201ccount of interference covers the 9-halo compounds, i. e., the 9a-fluoro * * * which <em>include </em>the claimed compounds.\u201d The board <em>then </em>discussed the \u201chigher potency\u201d shown by the affidavits. The board stated that there was no basis for appellants\u2019 election of the bromo derivative as representative of the halo species, since \u201cchlorine most nearly approaches the fluorine in molecular weight and activity * * Without apparent support the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOa\">* * - the relative activities are not unexpected in view of the relative molecular weights of the bromo and fluoro substituents and the expectation of the art with respect to the relative activities of the various 9a halogen derivatives. <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-15\">In response, appellants filed a request for reconsideration and an affidavit which showed that the 9a-fluoro is 8 times more active than the 9a-chloro derivative. Although the criticism of the bromo affidavit was first made by the board, the appellants\u2019 responding chloro affidavit was deemed by the board on reconsideration to be \u201cbelatedly presented, as Rule 197(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>demonstrates,\u201d and was not accepted. The board\u2019s response to the petition was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aoz-dedup-1\">Appellants\u2019 petition does not challenge our conclusion that the differences in activity between the various 9a-halo compounds represented in the affidavits referred to our decision was not unexpected in view of the relative molecular weights of the 9a-halo substituents and the expectation of the art that the anti-inflammatory activities of these compounds would vary with their molecular weights in the manner shown. Appellants, instead, reiterate their contention, previously advanced, that we should go behind the count of the interference on which the appealed claims are rejected and consider the evidence of priority as to each of the specific compounds included in the interference count. We have discovered no precedent for such a piece-meal determination of priority on an <em>ex parte </em>basis or for the consideration of arguments which appear to be related to the issue of priority over which we have no jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">Appellants subsequently challenged the board\u2019s statements in full.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b610-12\">. Since claims, \u201cread on\u201d things, not other claims, we construe the examiner\u2019s statement as saying the broad <em>count \u201creads on\u201d </em>the claimed <em>species.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
