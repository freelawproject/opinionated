The Government\u2019s principal witness was an admitted accomplice and his testimony was corroborated by one William Weaver. Because the court invited the jury to consider whether the accomplice\u2019s testimony was \u201csubstantially corroborated by independent evidence,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Weaver\u2019s testimony was of great importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-20\">Appellant argues that the trial court improperly permitted the prosecutor to ask leading questions of Weaver. In several instances, defense counsel objected and was peremptorily overruled by the court with no reason given. Counsel at one point asked whether the prosecutor was \u201cannouncing surprise\u201d as a justification for the leading form of the questions. The prosecutor denied this but offered no other justification. The court again overruled counsel\u2019s objections, giving no reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-21\">The trial court may permit leading questions where, for example, the witness has forgotten some events or is ignorant or even reluctant to testify.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But this discretion must be exercised with great caution to avoid the \u201cevil * * * of supplying a false memory for the witness.\u201d United States v. Durham, 319 F.2d 590, 592 (4th Cir. 1963). Where, as here, the court (a) conducted no inquiry to determine why the prosecutor asked the leading questions, and (b) gave no reason for permitting such questions, there is no adequate assurance that the court exercised any discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-23\">It clearly appears, however, that Weaver\u2019s crucial testimony was not elicited by leading questions. He testified that appellant and the accomplice told him they were \u201cgoing down in Virginia * * * to pick up * * * a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>car\u201d which they described to him as a dark blue 1963 model Grand Prix Pontiac.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> None of this vital incriminating information was supplied to Weaver by the prosecutor\u2019s leading questions. In these circumstances, the lack of adequate assurance that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in permitting some leading questions is not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-15\">. The trial court properly instructed the jury that the accomplice\u2019s testimony \u201cshould be received with caution and scrutinized with care.\u201d See McQuaid v. United States, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 229, 230, 198 F.2d 987, 988, cert. denied, 344 U.S. 929, 73 S.Ct. 499, 97 L.Ed. 715 (1953); Bishop v.
