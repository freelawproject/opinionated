BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"abv-dedup-0\">This appeal on behalf of Negro school children questions the District Court\u2019s decision sustaining the adequacy of the Denison, Texas grade-a-year, stair-step plan of desegregation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> voluntarily instituted, without threat of lawsuit, on June 23, 1963. For reasons set forth, we vacate the judgment and remand the case to enable the School Board to submit a substantially stepped-up plan under the guidance of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-16\">Up to spring of 1963 Denison maintained a dual-zoned, totally segregated school system.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 24, 1963, the Board in good faith passed the resolution, and in September the first grade was desegregated. Nine years in the making, the plan would reach the top of the stairs (12th grade) in 1975, two decades after Brown. The following January (1964) the plaintiffs brought a class suit for swift and sweeping relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-17\">The District Judge held in light of all the circumstances that this voluntary plan was a \u201cprompt and reasonable start toward full compliance.\u201d In his memorandum opinion which acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>frankly that constitutional rights of most of the Negro children were being infringed, Judge Sheehy took note of several factors. These included the good faith of the School Board in voluntarily instituting this gradual plan, the fact that several other localities in that same area of the Eastern District of Texas had likewise voluntarily initiated the same stair-step plan and one had done so by court order. And for good reason he pointed to many decisions of this Court, including specifically, Ross v. Dyer, 5 Cir., 1963, 312 F.2d 191, where, dealing with a side issue under the Houston stair-step plan,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we recognized the unusual moratorium on constitutional rights under the \u201cdeliberate speed\u201d concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">Of course, that was a Court-ordered plan instituted in 1960, and many things have happened since then \u2014 not the least of which is that five years have gone by.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And for this constitutional right, time alone is of great moment. Already some of these children have graduated. For them delay has meant denial for all time. The time for reviewing or redeveloping the undulating administra-five doctrines evolved by us for the implementation of Brown is over. The history, mandatory requirements, and increased tempo of judicial action are completely traced in Lockett v. Board of Educ. of Muscogee Cty. School Dist., Ga., 5 Cir., 1965, 342 F.2d 225. This history tells all that \u201c[t]he rule has become: the later the start, the shorter the time allowed for transition.\u201d 342 F.2d at 228.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> From this history all in this Circuit know other specific things. The first is that, if challenged, a grade a year will not pass muster. Second, the process must work simultaneously from both ends \u2014 first grade and last grade. Third, the end is in sight and all grades must be desegregated by the opening of school term fall 1968-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-14\">Moreover, to this rapidly accelerating pace set by judicial action, added impetus has come from the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which declares the strong legislative policy against racial discrimination in public education <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and then in Title VI implements this in a tangible way by conditioning Federal financial assistance on compliance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>was implemented by Department of Health, Education &amp; Welfare (HEW) regulations,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> issued pursuant to \u00a7 602, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000d \u2014 1. These provide that to be eligible for Federal assistance, the applicant must execute an assurance of compliance<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which shows (1) that the school system is subject to a final court order of desegregation, or (2) a desegregation plan, determined to be adequate by the Commissioner of Education. Of great importance to our problem is the General Policy Statement,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> issued by the Commissioner of Education in April 1965, setting forth requirements which plans submitted under (2) must meet. As to the rate of desegregation, the Policy Statement (Part V.E.) sets the fall of 1967 as the target date for total desegregation for applicant school systems, and for those starting in 1965, the normal specification will be four grades for 1965-66.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-4\">In Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School Dist., 5 Cir., 1965, 348 F.2d 729 [June 22, 1965], we accorded these minimum standards a high place in our future handling of school cases totally without regard to whether a school district was seeking (or desired) Federal grants in aid. Judge Wisdom, for the Court, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-5\">\u201cWe attach great weight to the standards established by the Office of Education. The judiciary has of course functions and duties distinct from those of the executive department, but in carrying out a national policy we have the same objective. There should be a close correlation, therefore, between the judiciary\u2019s standards in enforcing the national policy requiring desegregation of public schools and the executive department\u2019s standards in administering this policy. Absent legal questions, the United States Office of Education is better qualified than the courts and is the more appropriate federal body to weigh administrative difficulties inherent in school desegregation plans.\u201d 348 F.2d at 731.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1061-10\">More than that, we put these standards to work. To avoid the temptation to recalcitrant or reluctant school systems to seek judicial approval of a token plan as the basis for Federal aid under alternative (1) for court plans, the Court held the Jackson plan inadequate and directed that a plan modeled after the Commissioner of Education\u2019s requirements (note 11, supra) be submitted for the fall of 1965-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-12\">This signals what will be a frequent approach to these cases as they come to District Courts and thereafter this Court. These executive standards, perhaps long overdue, are welcome. To many, both on and off the bench, there was great anxiety in two major respects with the Brown approach. The first was that probably for the one and only time in American constitutional history, a citizen \u2014 indeed a large group of citizens \u2014was compelled to .postpone the day of effective enjoyment of a constitutional right. In Ross v. Dyer, 5 Cir., 1963, 312 F.2d 191, 194, we recognized that under \u201ca stair-step plan Negroes not in the eligible classes continue to suffer discriminatory treatment.\u201d That there can be a moratorium on the enjoyment of such rights runs counter to our notions of ordered liberty. Second, this inescapably puts the Federal Judge in the middle of school administrative problems for which he was not equipped and tended to dilute local responsibility for the high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>ly local governmental function of running a community\u2019s schools under law and in keeping with the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">By the 1964 Act and the action of HEW, administration is largely where it ought to be \u2014 in the hands of the Executive and its agencies with the function of the Judiciary confined to those rare cases presenting justiciable, not operational, questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">A word is certainly due for Denison\u2019s having initiated its plan voluntarily. Although we conclude that the passage of time and the ceaseless flow of court decisions make the District Judge\u2019s approval of the one grade stair-step plan now unacceptable, it is clear that he was convinced \u2014 as were we on argument \u2014 of the School Board\u2019s good faith desire to do what the law requires. That has much significance in fashioning the time, scope, and nature of the relief. But in the final analysis it has limited bearing on the substantive rights accorded and specifically the speed of the plan. The rights of Negro children come from the Constitution, not the attitude, good or bad, of school administrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">We were impressed with the repeated assurances of the school authorities along two lines. The first was that they mean to comply fully with whatever is required. Second, if we found the present plan inadequate, a peremptory order, either direct or through the District Court, would not be necessary as they desire to submit to the District Court a plan which will meet the standards coming out of this appeal. This is the way it ought to work. We take them at their word. If any differences arise, the District Court can resolve them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">The applicable standard is essentially the HEW formulae for 1965-66, leaving for a later time whether, in this case, the final date is fall 1967-68 or, as in our recent Court decisions, 1968-69.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">This leaves the issue of desegregated teacher assignments.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Judge Sheehy was in error in questioning the standing of these plaintiffs to raise this issue. Board of Public Instruction of Duval Cty., Fla. v. Braxton, 5 Cir., 1964, 326 F.2d 616, 620; Augustus v. Bd. of Public Instruction of Escambia Cty., 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>Cir., 1962, 306 F.2d 862; Lockett v. Bd. of Educ. Muskogee Cty., Ga., 5 Cir., 1965, 342 F.2d 225, 229. But on the merits we think it best for the moment to leave this to the District Court for consideration by and with the Board as the imported HEW standards are applied. The whole matter may become academic in any event. For if the Denison School District obtains Federal financial aid, HEW regulations will require adjustment. (See e. g., General Policy Statement, Appendix, YB.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\">To enable the parties to move with dispatch, the judgment is vacated, the cause remanded for consistent action, the mandate to issue forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">GENERAL STATEMENT OF POLICIES UNDER TITLE VI OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964 RESPECTING DESEGREGATION OF ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">I.

Methods of Compliance \u2014 General</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-11\">Elementary and secondary schools or school systems may qualify for Federal financial assistance by:</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-13\">A. Executing an Assurance of Compliance (HEW Form 441), if the requirements specified in III below are satisfied; or</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-14\">B. Submitting a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of the school or school system which satisfies the requirements specified in IV below, together with an Initial Compliance Report (See VI below); or</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-16\">C. Submitting a plan for the desegregation of the school system which the Commissioner of Education determines is adequate to accomplish the purposes of the Civil Rights Act, as set forth in these policies (see V below) together with an Initial Compliance Report (see VI below) ; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-17\">D. Implementing the Assurance, final court order or desegregation plan in good faith so as to effectuate the basic objective set forth in section 601 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-18\">\u201cNo person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1063-19\">III. Methods of Compliance \u2014 Assurance of Compliance (HEW Form 441)</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-20\">An Assurance of Compliance (HEW Form 441) that will qualify a school system for Federal financial assistance may not be executed by a school system in which:</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-21\">A. The race, color, or national origin of pupils is a factor in their initial assignment, reassignment, or transfer to a particular school or class within a school; or</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-22\">B. Teachers or other staff who serve pupils remain segregated on the basis of race, color, or national origin of the pupils in a school; or</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-23\">C. Any activity, facility or other service, including transportation, provided or sponsored by a school system is segregated on the basis of race, color, or national origin; or</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-24\">D.

Such a good faith start shall normally require provision in the plan that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-14\">(1) Desegregation will be extended to at least four grades for the 1965-1966 school year; the grades covered must include the first and any other lower grade, the first and last high school grades, and the lowest grade of junior high where schools are so organized;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-16\">(2) Any pupil newly enrolled in the school system or in any school within the system (e. g., who has newly established a residence within the district) shall be enrolled in and assigned to a particular school without regard to race, color, or national origin;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-17\">(3) No pupil shall be publicly supported in a school outside the school district unless such support is available without regard to race, color, or national origin to all pupils residing in the school district; and in any case no student shall be required to attend a school outside the school district in order to maintain racial segregation or minimize desegregation in a school within the district;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-18\">(4) Any pupil attending a school to which he was originally assigned on the basis of his race, color, or national origin shall have the right, irrespective of whether or not the grade he is attending has been desegregated, to transfer to another school in order to take a course of study for which he is qualified and which is not available in the school he is attending;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-19\">(5) Any student attending any grade, whether or not fully desegregated, at a school to which he originally was assigned on the basis of his race, color, or national origin shall have an opportunity, subject to the requirements and criteria applicable equally to all students without regard to race, color, or national origin to transfer to any other school in which he originally would have been entitled to enroll but for his race, color, or national origin; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-20\">(6) Steps will be taken for the desegregation of faculty, at least including such actions as joint faculty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>meetings and joint inservice programs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-4\">b. In exceptional cases the Commissioner may, for good cause shown, accept plans which provide for desegregation of fewer or other grades or defer other provisions set out in 4a above for the 1965-1966 school year, provided that desegregation for the 1965-1966 school year shall extend to at least two grades, including the first grade, and provided that the school districts, in such case, shall take into account the steps which would be required to meet the 1967 target date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">VI. Compliance Reports</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">A. <em>General Requirements. </em>All recipients of Federal financial assistance are subject to the requirements respecting compliance information set forth in section 80.6 of the Departmental Title VI Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">B. <em>Initial Compliance Report. </em>If an Initial Compliance Report is required, it shall contain sufficient detailed information to provide an accurate picture of past and present racial conditions in each school district. Precise, up-to-the-minute statistics are not required. The material furnished should be what fair-minded school officials believe to be true and what reasonable men would think necessary for a rational appraisal of racial practices in the system. The following list, not intended to be exclusive, suggests the kinds of information that should be covered by an Initial Compliance Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-8\">1. A racial breakdown of the school-age population residing in the district by attendance zone;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-9\">2. The racial distribution of pupils, by school, throughout the system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-10\">3. The racial distribution of teaching and staff personnel, by school, throughout the system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-11\">4. Maps, which need not be of professional quality, where useful or necessary to demonstrate such things as school locations, attendance zones, or school bus routes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-12\">5. Past and present rules and practices for the initial assignment, reassignment, and transfer of pupils within the system; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-13\">6. The status of appeals or other pending proceedings, if any, if a court order for desegregation is submitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-14\">C. <em>Subsequent Compliance Reports. </em>Subsequently submitted compliance reports may refer to previous reports and should report with the same scope and detail on developments since the last previous report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-16\">VII. Definitions- \u2014 Initial Assignment, Reassignment and Transfer</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-18\">As used herein:</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-19\">A. The term <em>initial assignment </em>means the assignment to a particular school in the school system of any pupil who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-20\">1. Is to attend preschool, kindergarten, or first grade; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-21\">2. For the first time enters a school of higher level (such as junior high or high school) after having completed a school of less advanced level; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-22\">3. For the first time enters the school system at any level; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-23\">4. Becomes eligible, or would become eligible, aside from considerations of race, color, or national origin, to attend some other school in the school system by reason of a change of residence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-24\">B. The term <em>reassignment </em>means the assignment of a pupil to the school he currently attends for an additional period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-25\">C. The term <em>transfer </em>means the assignment of a pupil to a school of the same level other than the one he currently attends (e. g., transfer from one elementary school to another).</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-26\">VIII. Alternative Administrative Procedures</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-27\">If an administrative procedure provided for herein is not administratively feasible in a particular situation, the Commissioner may accept an alternative procedure if he determines that it will accomplish the same purpose.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1059-10\">. The School Board resolved: \u201c[T]hat the Denison Independent School District will integrate the first grade effective September, 1963, progressing an additional grade each year thereafter, until complete. Each first grade child may attend the school of his choice within his attendance area.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1059-12\">. Appellants\u2019 brief describes the school population and facilities as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-13\">\u201cIn February 1964, there were 5,070 students in the District. Only 665 were Negro. Negroes were assigned to three of ten elementary schools and to one each of the system\u2019s two junior and senior high schools. Each of the white elementary schools offer grades 1-6 and enroll from 230 to 400 pupils. But the schools designated for Negroes are generally small, and enroll very few pupils. Langston has 36 students and 2 teachers, Walton has 20 students and 2 teachers, and Wim has 93 students and 4 teachers. The Negro Terrill Junior and Senior High School has 109 students and from 15 to 17 teachers, while the white Denison Junior and Senior High Schools contain a total of 2,100 students and 100 teachers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1059-19\">. Named plaintiffs were 16 Negro children (and their parents), each of whom was in a grade higher than the first so that under the Board\u2019s plan he or she would never attend desegregated schools. The prayer requested that the segregated school system, in all its particulars, be enjoined, or in the alternative, that the Court order the Board to present \u201ca complete plan for desegregation of all grades * * * by the school year 1964-65; including assignment of pupils, teachers, principals, and other school personnel on a non-racial basis; * * * funds, * * * construction, * * * budgets, * * * extra-curricular activities * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">. The Houston plan has now been substantially accelerated by voluntary Board action. See Houston Post and Houston Chronical, June 23, 1965.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">. But in Ross v. Dyer, we sounded a warning that the passage of time would, or might, require a change even for an existing court approved plan. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"auc-dedup-0\">\u201c * * * it is now clear that even though the 1960 order prescribes a plan in specific detail, this is not the end of the matter. The District Court of necessity retains continuing jurisdiction over the cause. That means that it must make such adaptations from time to time as the existing developing situation reasonably requires to give final and effectual voice to the constitutional rights of Negro children.\u201d 312 F.2d at 194.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1060-10\">.

Grade 3, which will be reached on the voluntary stair-step, should be counted as one of the 4. Under our decisions the 12th grade must also be included. As the School District has separate junior and senior high schools, if the HEW plan (Part VE4a(l), note 12, supra) is followed, the remaining two would be grades 7 and 10. Since there can never be any resegregation, if this were followed this would mean that by fall 1967-68, only grade 6 would remain segregated, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-10\">Elementary Junior High
