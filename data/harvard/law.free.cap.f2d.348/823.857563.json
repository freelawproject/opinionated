The parties stipulated \u201cthat the sole question presented * * * is the admissibility, as a matter of law, of the confession introduced against the relator in this cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-26\">Collins was charged with having murdered Mrs. Wilma Selby in her home on November 16, 1959. Several days after the killing, Mr. Selby admitted to the police that he had for some time been attempting to hire someone to kill his wife. He said he did not know who actually did the killing, but he implicated several persons, including Maggie Morgan, who admitted having taken Mr. Selby\u2019s money but denied complicity in the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-27\">Collins was a long-time associate of Maggie Morgan and was at her home on December 12, 1959, when Houston police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>officers arrived to question her. Since the police \u201cwere talking with everybody that was associated with Maggie Morgan,\u201d Collins was placed under arrest. There was no warrant and, admittedly, no probable cause for this arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Collins was questioned at Police Headquarters the night of December 12th and again on the morning of December 14th, at which time he executed an affidavit stating that Maggie Morgan had once asked him whether he wanted to kill someone for a thousand dollars, but that, thinking she was joking, he paid no particular attention to her query. He was given a polygraph test around mid-day and was released at 6 P.M., no charges having been preferred against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Collins\u2019 second encounter with the police resulted in the confession challenged here as inadmissible. On January 19, 1960, E. T. Morgan, a private detective, money-lender, and bondsman, met with representatives of the Houston Police Department, the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s office, and the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s office. With a view toward claiming the reward offered by a Houston newspaper for information leading to the apprehension of Mrs. Selby\u2019s killer, Morgan told the officers that he had information that Collins was the guilty party. He did not elaborate any further.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-20\">After the meeting with Morgan, at around 7:30 P.M. on January 19th, Houston police officers arrested Collins at his home on orders from Captain Waycott. When asked at the State trial why no warrant was obtained for this arrest, Captain Waycott testified, \u201cAll we were working on was the investigation. We didn\u2019t feel justified in charging the man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>with an offense of that kind * * * on the basis of the information we had.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After consulting with representatives from the Sheriff\u2019s and District Attorney\u2019s offices, the police took Collins to Texas Ranger headquarters in Houston. This location was selected because the officers \u201cdidn\u2019t want anyone to know * * * [they] had the subject at the time.\u201d The testimony as to what transpired at Ranger Headquarters on January 19th is in dispute. The district court found that \u201cduring this time, Collins was engaged in conversation \u2018on and off\u2019 by several of the officers who were present in the building, but there appears to have been no serious, pressing questioning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">At approximately midnight, Collins was taken by a Sheriff\u2019s officer, accompanied by E. T. Morgan, to Humble, Texas, a small community on the outskirts of Houston, about ten or twelve miles from the Ranger Headquarters. While Morgan stayed in the Sheriff\u2019s car with Collins, the Sheriff\u2019s officer went before a Justice of the Peace in Humble and swore out a criminal complaint charging the crime of vagrancy and naming the accused as \u201cJoe Smith.\u201d Upon this complaint, the Justice of the Peace issued a warrant for the arrest of \u201cJoe Smith,\u201d on the basis of which Collins was placed in the Humble jail. Police and Sheriff\u2019s officers admitted, in both State and Federal courts, that they had no basis whatsoever for charging Collins with vagrancy and that the Sheriff\u2019s officer knew that Collins\u2019 name was not \u201cJoe Smith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Collins remained overnight in the Humble jail without any further questioning. On the afternoon of January 20, 1960, the officers who had arrested him at his home the night before picked him up from the Humble jail and returned him, after making a few stops for food and personal business, to the Ranger Headquarters in Houston. Beginning around 7 P.M., Collins was questioned by Captain Waycott for approximately 30 minutes and then by the officers who had arrested him for a little more than an hour. Having recalled that one of these officers had previously helped clear him of some false accusation, Collins stated he would tell this officer \u201call about it\u201d and made an oral statement concerning the crime. Police and Sheriff\u2019s officers were then called in and Collins repeated his statement to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">Collins was then left alone with Officer Baker of the Houston Police Department. Baker testified at the State trial that he questioned Collins for about 45 minutes without advising him that he need make no statement. Baker then took about two hours to take down Collins\u2019 statement in writing. The <em>written </em>statement included the formulation of a warning that Collins need make no statement and that a statement, if made, could be used against him. This statement, completed about midnight, recited that Collins had gone to the Selby house the night of the murder with Maggie Morgan and a woman named Johnson. It further stated that Collins remained outside in the car while Maggie Morgan went into the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">Finding this statement unsatisfactory, the officers expressed to Collins their belief that he had not told the entire truth. At around 1:30 A.M. on January 21st, he was given a lie-detector test, which the district court found to be at his own request. He was given a second lie-detector test at around 2 A.M. Questioning recommenced at around 3:15 A.M. Shortly thereafter, Collins confessed to the crime in the presence of Officer Baker, Captain Waycott, and Chief Frazier. After Collins\u2019 oral confession Captain Waycott filed murder charges against him and telephoned a Justice of the Peace in order to obtain an arrest warrant. At the same time, Officer Baker began taking down in writing the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>statement. The three-page statement took almost two and. one-half hours to transcribe and was finally signed by Collins at around 7 A.M., January 21st. Collins was then taken to the Houston Police station where a record of his arrest was made. At about 9 A.M., he was taken before a Justice of the Peace and formally charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Collins objected to the admission into evidence of his January 21st confession on three grounds: (1) that the \u2022confession was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d, (2) that the confession was the \u201cfruit\u201d of an unlawful arrest under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, and (3) that the confession was taken when Collins was without counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. I agree with the conclusion and reasoning in Judge Friendly\u2019s separate opinion that Collins\u2019 confession was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d as a matter of law. I believe, however, that there are more basic, and less nebulous, grounds which require a reversal in this \u2022case and which merit exposition. What is said hereafter, therefore, is my ex- \u25a0 pression alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">The district court recognized that tangible evidence obtained through unconstitutional searches and seizures is inadmissible in a State court. Mapp v. Ohio, 1961, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 681.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the court declined to \u2022construe Wong Sun v. United States, 963, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441, and Gatlin v. United States, 1963, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 123, 326 F.2d 666, holding that statements made following an unlawful arrest were inadmissible as being based, like Mapp, on the Constitution. 'The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-7\">\u201cThe Wong Sun and Gatlin cases did indeed hold inadmissible the incriminating statements obtained from defendants while under illegal arrest, but both cases dealt with federal convictions, and both decisions appear to have been largely, if not entirely, govered [sic] by the federal evidentiary principles which find their genesis in McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819 (1943). * * * [The McNabb] rule has been repeatedly and emphatically characterized as a mere evidentiary rule for the federal courts, drawn under the supervisory powers of the Supreme Court, and of far less than constitutional force. * * \u20225?'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-12\">* * -X- -X- * -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-13\">\u201cThus, assuming the petitioner is correct in alleging that his confession was obtained while he was unlawfully in custody, he has not, without more, established its inadmissibility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">I disagree. Wong Sun\u2019s exclusionary rule is equally applicable in both state and federal courts. If any hint of this were needed outside of the language of the Wong Sun opinion itself, the Supreme Court gave such a hint prior to the decision here under review when it vacated the judgment in State v. Traub, 1962, 150 Conn. 169, 187 A.2d 230, and remanded the case \u201cfor further consideration in light of Wong Sun * * Traub v. Connecticut, 1963, 374 U.S. 493, 83 S.Ct. 1899, 10 L.Ed.2d 1048; cf. Fahy v. State of Connecticut, 1963, 375 U.S. 85, 90-91, 84 S.Ct. 229, 11 L.Ed.2d 171. Also prior to the district court\u2019s decision, this court went on record as finding Wong Sun based, not upon the Supreme Court\u2019s supervisory power, but upon the Constitution. Rogers v. United States, 5 Cir., 1964, 330 F.2d 535, 541 (dictum). I endorse the position stated there, believing it demanded by the Supreme Court\u2019s repeated reference to the Constitution in Wong Sun.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-15\">A threshold question for the applicability of the Wong Sun rule in this case is whether there was an unlawful arrest. An arrest is lawful, absent a warrant, only if the arresting officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect committed a crime. Henry v. United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>1959, 361 U.S. 98, 80 S.Ct. 168, 4 L.Ed.2d 134; Brinegar v. United States, 1949, 338 U.S. 160, 175-176, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879. This rule is applicable to arrests by State as well as Federal officers. Ker v. California, 1963, 374 U.S. 23, 34-35, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 10 L.Ed.2d 726. Although probable cause for arrest may be based on credible hearsay, it clearly cannot be based on information or \u201caffidavits which are purely conclusory, stating only the affiant\u2019s or an informer\u2019s belief that probable cause exists without detailing any of the \u2018underlying circumstances\u2019 upon which that belief is based.\u201d United States v. Ventresca, 1965, 380 U.S. 102, 108-109, 85 S.Ct. 741, 746, 13 L.Ed.2d 684. The only information offered as supporting Collins\u2019 arrest in this case, E. T. Morgan \u201ctip\u201d, clearly does not meet the test,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the State law enforcement officers knew it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Even if Collins was not deprived of his constitutional rights when he was taken into custody at his home on the evening of January 19th, there can be no doubt that he was so deprived when he was locked up in the Humble jail based on a spurious vagrancy warrant in the name of \u201cJoe Smith.\u201d Thus, the necessary predicate for the application of the exclusionary rule of Wong Sun is indisputedly present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">It has been stated that \u201c[i]n Wong Sun, the illegal arrest alone made the post-arrest admissions while still in custody poisonous fruit.\u201d Gatlin v. United States, 1963, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 123, 326 F.2d 666, 672. This view is buttressed by the Supreme Court\u2019s approving citation, 371 U.S. at 486, 83 S.Ct. at 417 n. 12, of Bynum v. United States, 1958, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 368, 262 F.2d 465, which held that \u201cthe fact that an illegal arrest enabled the police to take * * * fingerprints while the suspect was illegally detained is in itself and without more a sufficient ground for excluding them [the fingerprints] from evidence.\u201d 262 F.2d at 466. See also Nues-lien v. District of Columbia, 1940, 73 U.S. App.D.C. 85, 115 F.2d 690, cited in 371 U.S. at 485-486, 83 S.Ct. 407. Whatever standards may be applicable where an arrest is only \u201ctechnically\u201d illegal, I would hold that the evidence as to the manner in which Collins was taken into and held in custody was clearly sufficient to establish the prima facie inadmissibility of his post-arrest statements. Upon a showing of such an illegal arrest as appeared here, the burden fell upon the prosecution <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to show by clear and convincing evidence \u201cthat the connection between the arrest and the statement had \u2018become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint\u2019 \u201d 371 U.S. at 491, 83 S.Ct. at 419, or that the statement was obtained by means \u201cpurged of the primary taint.\u201d 371 U.S. at 488, 83 S.Ct. 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Far from establishing that Collins\u2019 confession was so separated from the arrest as to be unrelated to the \u201ctaint\u201d of his unlawful arrest, the testimony of the State\u2019s law enforcement officers unequivocally demonstrates precisely the sort of connection between Collins\u2019 arrest and confession dealt with in Wong Sun. There the Supreme Court based its application of the exclusionary rule on the need for deterring unlawful police conduct. 371 U.S. at 486, 83 S.Ct. 407. The theory of deterrence operates \u201conly if an excludable piece of evidence is the target of police activity.\u201d Comment, 69 Yale L.J. 432, 436 n. 12.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>the confession obtained on the morning of January 21st was the \u201ctarget\u201d of Collins\u2019 unlawful detention. Collins was kept in custody, not because the police had a legitimate basis for detaining him for as long as they did, but merely because his detention and questioning were aids in their \u201cinvestigation.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nor can the mere passage of time serve to \u201cdissipate the taint\u201d of an unlawful arrest. If this were so, the police would be free simply to keep a suspect \u201con ice\u201d for a day or two before beginning an interrogation. This would postpone the tasting of the fruit but would not diminish its temptation.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Even where, as here, there is a connection between the confessionv and the unlawful arrest, the confession may still be admissible if the State establishes that its officers had \u201cpurged the taint\u201d prior to the time the inculpatory statement was given. The best and perhaps the only way to accomplish this would be to afford the suspect an effective opportunity to obtain the assistance of counsel. See Kamisar, Illegal Searches or Seizures and Contemporaneous Incriminating Statements: A Dialogue on a Neglected Area of Criminal Procedure, 1961 U.Ill. L.F. 78, 139. Compare United States v. Burke, D.Mass.1963, 215 F.Supp. 508, 511, aff\u2019d, 1 Cir., 1964, 328 F.2d 399, cert. denied, 379 U.S. 849, 85 S.Ct. 91, 13 L.Ed.2d 52,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> where the accused was advised of his right to counsel. No such opportunity was afforded here; indeed there is no evidence at all which contradicts Collins\u2019 allegation that he was held incommunicado from the time of his arrest on January 19th until after his confession on January 21st. He was inaccessible to family, friends, and counsel, if he had one.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">The taint of Collins\u2019 unlawful detention could not have been purged by the fact that he might have been warned, <em>after he had completed his oral statement </em>and while Officer Baker was preparing to commit this to writing, that he need make no statement. See Killough v. United States, 1962, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 305, 315 F.2d 241; 74 Harv.L.Rev. 1222-24 (1961). The reaffirmation of Collins\u2019 oral statement cannot be considered independent of that statement. There was neither a sufficient lapse of time, cf. United States v. Bayer, 1947, 331 U.S. 532, 541, 67 S.Ct. 1394, 91 L.Ed. 1654, (six months) nor a significant change in circumstances. Cf. United States v. Morin, 3 Cir., 1959, 265 F.2d 241, 245-246 (appointment of counsel). Nor, I believe, would the taint be purged even if we were to hold that the confession was \u201cvoluntary.\u201d See Wong Sun v. United States, supra, 371 U.S. at 486, 83 S.Ct. at 417 n. 12. The \u201cvoluntariness\u201d test for confessions in general has been subjected to sharp criticism. See Kamisar, What Is An \u201cInvoluntary\u201d Confession? Some Comments on Inbau and Reid\u2019s Criminal Interrogation and Confessions, 70 Rutgers L.Rev. 728 (1963). The test requires a factual inquiry which ordinarily requires the court to weigh the defendant\u2019s testimony against that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>of the police.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That was true in this case. Such an inquiry would practically eviscerate the prophylactic effect of the exclusionary rule. Moreover, if a mere showing that a confession during a period of unlawful detention was- \u201cvoluntary\u201d were sufficient to establish its admissibility, Wong Sun would be an empty promise, for the inadmissibility of \u201cinvoluntary\u201d confessions has long been fully recognized.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See Brown v. Mississippi, 1936, 297 U.S. 278, 56 S.Ct. 461, 80 L.Ed. 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Since the record, without dispute, reveals that Collins\u2019 confession was obtained during a period of detention in violation of his constitutional rights and that nothing occurred to dissipate or purge the taint of his illegal arrest, I would hold that the confession may not be used as evidence against him. Had he been effectively afforded the assistance of counsel before making his inculpatory statement, a different result might well be reached. This is so not only on the theory that the intervention of counsel between the arrest and the statement would have \u201cpurged the taint\u201d of the arrest, but also because I view the decision in Escobedo <em>v. </em>State of Illinois, 1964, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 as a proper alternate ground for granting the relief Collins is seeking here.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">It is argued here that Escobedo was intended to be limited to its own facts. Those facts were summarized by the Supreme Court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-7\">\u201cWe hold * * * that where, as here, the investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but has begun to focus on a particular suspect, the suspect has been taken into police custody, the police carry out a process of interrogations that lends itself to eliciting incriminating statements, the suspect has requested and been denied an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, and the police have not effectively warned him of his absolute constitutional right to remain silent, the accused has been denied \u2018the Assistance of Counsel\u2019 in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution as \u2018made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment,\u2019 * * * and that no statement elicited by the police during the interrogation may be used against him at a criminal trial.\u201d 378 U.S. at 490-491, 84 S.Ct. at 1765.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6A\">Even if the holding is limited, as the state contends, all the enumerated factors are present in the case at bar, except that there is no showing that Collins ever requested the assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But this omission must be viewed as inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">It has been suggested that the court in Escobedo treated the request for counsel merely as evidence that the investigation had begun to focus on the defendant. People v. Dorado, Cal., 1964, 40 Cal.Rptr. 264, 394 P.2d 952, 957; People v. Dorado, Cal., 1965, 42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 176, 398 P.2d 361 (on rehearing en banc) ; Note, The Right to Counsel During Police Interrogation: The Aftermath of Escobedo, 53 Calif.L.Rev. 337, 361. This view finds support in the following passage from the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-13\">\u201cThe interrogation here was conducted before petitioner was formal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>ly indicted. Within the context of this case, that fact should make no difference. When petitioner requested, and was denied, an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, the investigation had ceased to be a general investigation of \u2018an unsolved crime.\u2019 * * * Petitioner had become the accused, and the purpose of the interrogation was to \u2018get him\u2019 to confess his guilt despite his constitutional right not to do so.\u201d 378 U.S. at 485, 84 S.Ct. at 1762.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">It would be disingenous, however, to suggest that there is no unclarity in the opinion on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Be this as it may, \u201cit is settled that where the assistance of counsel is a constitutional requisite, the right to be furnished counsel does not depend on a request.\u201d Carnley v. Cochran, 1962, 369 U.S. 506, 513, 82 S.Ct. 884, 889, 8 L.Ed.2d 70. See also McNeal v. Culver, 1961, 365 U.S. 109, 111, 81 S.Ct. 413, 5 L.Ed. 2d 445 n. 1; Uveges v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 1948, 335 U.S. 437, 441, 69 S.Ct. 184, 93 L.Ed. 127. This principle is fully applicable to the right to counsel during police interrogation. Lee v. United States, 5 Cir., 1963, 322 F.2d 770, 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">In People v. Dorado, Cal., 1964, 40 Cal.Rptr. 264, 268, 394 P.2d 952, 956-957, the Supreme Court of California well expressed the rationale of the rule which makes a request for counsel immaterial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArZr\">\u201cWe find no strength in an artificial requirement that a defendant must specifically request counsel; the test must be a substantive one: whether or not the point of necessary protection for guidance of counsel has been reached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-7\">\u201cThe defendant who does not realize his rights under the law and who therefore does not request counsel is the very defendant who most needs counsel. We should not penalize the defendant who, not understanding his legal rights, does not make the formal request and by such failure demonstrates his helplessness. * * * To require the formal request for counsel for the application of the rule would be to favor the defendant whose sophistication or status had fortuitously prompted him to make the request.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">On rehearing en banc the court reiterated this position. People v. Dorado, 1965, 42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 175-178, 398 P.2d 361. Accord: Wright v. Dickson, 9 Cir., 1964, 336 F.2d 878, 882; State v. Hall, Idaho, 1964, 397 P.2d 261, 268-269. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has recently taken the same view. United States ex rel. Russo v. New Jersey, 351 F.2d 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">There can be no doubt that the investigation had focused on Collins prior to the time he gave his confession. \u201cThe guiding hand of counsel,\u201d Powell v. State of Alabama, 1932, 287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158, was required but was withheld by public officials more concerned with \u201csewing up\u201d a sensitive case than with safeguarding the rights of the individual in their custody. A confession obtained under these circumstances is inadmissible against the party making it.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-13\">Collins\u2019 conviction was affirmed prior to the decision in Escobedo. Collins v. State, 1961, 171 Tex.Cr.R. 585, 352 S.W.2d 841, cert. denied, 1962, 369 U.S. 881, 82 S.Ct. 1152, 8 L.Ed.2d 283. But this would not affect my decision. The question of the retroactivity of the Escobedo rule is settled in this Circuit. See Pate v. Holman, 5 Cir., 1965, 341 F.2d 764, 775-776 (right to counsel on appeal); Williams v. State of Alabama, 5 Cir., 1965, 341 F.2d 777, 781 (right to counsel at arraignment). The rationale of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>cases is applicable here. In this Circuit, the basis for retrospective application of an exclusionary rule has been a finding that the object of the rule is \u201cto provide fairness in the trial itself,\u201d Pate v. Holman, supra, 341 F.2d at 776, or \u201cto provide fairness in procedure.\u201d United States ex rel. Linkletter v. Walker, 5 Cir., 1963, 323 F.2d 11, 19. The Escobedo rule fits into this categorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">In Escobedo the Court noted that the time when police interrogation began to focus upon the accused \u201cwas the \u2018stage when legal aid and advice\u2019 were most critical to petitioner. * * * It was a stage surely as critical as the arraignment in Hamilton v. State of Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114, and the preliminary hearing in White v. State of Maryland, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed.2d 193. What happened at this interrogation could certainly \u2018affect the whole trial\u2019, Hamilton v. State of Alabama, supra, 368 U.S. at 54, 82 S.Ct. at 159 [157,] since rights \u2018may be as irretrievably lost, if not then and there asserted, as they are when an accused represented by counsel waives the right for strategic purposes.\u2019 Ibid.\u201d 378 U.S. at 486, 84 S.Ct. at 1762.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However fallible one\u2019s perception of the purpose of an exclusionary rule may be, if the purpose of Gideon v. Wainwright, 1963, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 1799,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Hamilton v.

Defore, 1926, 242 N.Y. 13, 21, 150 N.E. 585, 587 (Cardozo, J.), cert. denied, 270 U.S. 657, 46 S.Ct. 353, 70 L.Ed. 784, was long the shibboleth of the opponents of the exclusionary rule in a debate which has now been authoritatively resolved. It is indisputably a policy of our society that criminals be speedily apprehended and justly convicted. But in pursuing this aim we must sedulously avoid prejudicing other, and higher, goals. One such goal is certainly a cutting down of the incidence of unlawful conduct against private persons by public officials.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-11\">\u201cIn a government of laws, existence of the government will be imperilled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. Our government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime is contagious. If the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy. To declare that in the administration of the criminal law the end justifies the means\u2014 to declare that the government may commit crimes in order to secure the conviction of a private criminal \u2014 \u25a0 would bring terrible retribution. Against that pernicious doctrine this court should resolutely set its face.\u201d Olmstead v. United States, 1928, 277 U.S. 438, 485, 48 S.Ct. 564, 575, 66 A.L.R. 376 (Brandeis, J., dissenting.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">Public brutality breeds private brutality, and private brutality breeds public brutality; regardless of which is the chicken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>and which the egg, the circle must be broken. The public sector cannot wait for the private sector to take the initiative. So far as the obligation falls to the lot of the federal courts to play a part they must not retreat from the duty of using the only means at their command to bring to an end unlawful arrests and other violations of fundamental rights. This means is to set aside convictions, whether they be by state or federal courts, that are based on such denials on the part of public officials of the constitutional rights of the individual.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">In this case, the State officers acted without regard for the law or for the rights of their prisoner.

Taking that view, I prefer not to decide what to me are more difficult questions whether Collins is also entitled to prevail because of Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963), or Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758,12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">The standard as to review of a lower court judgment varies with the type of issue, and we are instructed that the vol-untariness of a confession involves several inquiries. Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568, 603-606, 81 S.Ct. 1860, 1879, 6 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1961). The first step is to establish \u201cthe crude historical facts * * * surrounding the confession,\u201d 367 U.S. at 603, 81 S.Ct. at 1879. As to these the district judge\u2019s findings control \u201cunless clearly erroneous,\u201d F.R. Civ.P. 52(a). In the light of the lower court\u2019s contrary finding, made after full hearing, we are thus precluded from giving any consideration to Collins\u2019 claim that the police beat him to make him confess. After all the circumstances are established, the court must then decide what impact they had on the mind and will of the individual defendant \u2014 perhaps also a question of \u201cfact\u201d but one of a quite different sort, particularly when, as here, expert psychological testimony in the record somewhat diminishes the advantage of the district judge from seeing the prisoner in the courtroom. Finally, the court must decide the \u201cinextricably interwoven\u201d question of \u201cthe application to this psychological fact of standards for judgment informed by the larger legal conceptions ordinarily characterized as rules of law * * 367 U.S. at 603, 81 S.Ct. at 1879 specifically, whether the totality of the \u201ccrude historical\u201d and \u201cpsychological\u201d facts warrants the legal label \u201ccoercion.\u201d These two later decisions depend very little on the credibility of witnesses, which usually is critical for \u201ccrude historical facts,\u201d and precedents confirm that an appellate court has considerable responsibility to form its own judgment whether a record in a particular case suffices to bespeak coercion. See Culombe v. Connecticut, supra, 367 U.S. at 603-605, 81 S.Ct. 1860; Haynes v. State of Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 515-517, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 10 L.Ed.2d 513 (1963); United States ex rel. Eckwerth v. Denno, 261 F.2d 511, 513 (2 Cir. 1958), cert. denied, 358 U.S. 945, 79 S.Ct. 355, 3 L.Ed.2d 353 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">Chief Judge Tuttle has clearly set out the facts based upon the concessions of both sides and the findings of the district judge. If we disregard the claimed beating as we must, no single circumstance standing alone would characterize the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>statements as involuntary; but when all the elements are taken together, it is not possible for me to feel that Collins\u2019 confessions were \u201cthe expression of free choice,\u201d Watts v. State of Indiana, 338 U.S. 49, 53, 69 S.Ct. 1347, 93 L.Ed. 1801 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">The first step the police took when they picked Collins up was to attempt to isolate him. Instead of taking him to the police station, they drove him ten miles across town to a Ranger headquarters, so that there would be no \u201cinterference\u201d with the questioning. Around midnight, they transported him another ten or twelve miles to a jail in a small community on the outskirts of the city, where he was deliberately lodged under a false name. Picked up the next afternoon, Collins rode around with police officers for two and a half hours and arrived back at Ranger headquarters at 5 o\u2019clock for the evening\u2019s interrogation. Carried to an extreme, the deliberate shuffling of a prisoner from one jail to another outside his community has itself been deemed enough to invalidate a confession. Ward v. State of Texas, 316 U.S. 547, 555, 62 S.Ct. 1139, 86 L.Ed. 1663 (1942). This unwarranted isolation of Collins was compounded, for during the 36-hour period ending in his second confession he saw no relatives, no friends, and no lawyer. Indeed, since he had not been booked at the city police station nor taken before a judicial officer, he might quite reasonably have believed that no one would be able to locate him until the police chose to make his arrest public; and it is not hard to realize the corrosive effect of such fears upon the will of one entirely within the police\u2019s power. Compare Haynes v. State of Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 83 S.Ct. 1336 (1963). At no stage was Collins ever told that he had a right to consult with a lawyer, or even with his family, before making any statement. Such advice offers a prisoner a link with the outside world and a chance to seek guidance other than from those who want him to confess; however Esco-bedo may ultimately be read, the presence or absence of such a warning weighs in measuring the voluntariness of a confession.</p>\n<p id=\"ayg-dedup-0\">Collins\u2019 own mental and emotional makeup indicates that his capacity to resist pressure was strikingly low. The district judge summarized by saying, \u201cA psychiatrist and a psychologist, testifying in Collins\u2019 behalf, stated that he was of low intelligence, although not mentally defective, and that they felt he had a low ability to withstand stress.\u201d Their testimony reveals that Collins\u2019 I.Q. was in the lowest ten percent of the population ; that his judgment was \u201cextremely poor\u201d; that he would \u201crespond abnormally in an attempt to avoid * * * what to him would represent stress\u201d; that his low I.Q. made him a \u201cgreater target for suggestibility\u201d; and that with respect to resisting pressure, Collins\u2019 character was \u201cmore like that found in children between the ages of three and six.\u201d That these special susceptibilities and Collins\u2019 mea-gre education must be given due weight is clear from Haley v. State of Ohio, 332 U.S. 596, 68 S.Ct. 302, 92 L.Ed. 224 (1948), and Spano v. People of State of New York, 360 U.S. 315, 322, 79 S.Ct. 1202, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">The circumstances of the confession itself are also revealing. The questioning took place not during normal hours but late at night after Collins had been up during the day. See Spano v. People of State of New York, supra, 360 U.S. at 322, 79 S.Ct. 1202. He was questioned by changing teams of officers, who presumably had an opportunity to refresh themselves which he lacked. After he gave his midnight confession, which placed him near the crime but denied participation, he discovered that the police were not prepared either to release him or to hold him merely to check out his story, but renewed their questioning at 3:00 A.M. after two lie detector tests. Collins could well have believed there would be no end until he told the police what they wanted to hear. Finally, while early unequivocal advice that no statement was required might have served to alert or reassure Collins as to the choice before him, the warning that he received was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>quite inadequate to that end. At best he was twice told that he need not incriminate himself, in each case <em>after </em>he had made the oral confession and before he began to reiterate it for a formal transcription. See Turner v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 338 U.S. 62, 64, 69 S.Ct. 1352, 93 L.Ed. 1810 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">A concluding word is called for regarding the admitted, deliberate violations of law by the police. The 36-hour detention of Collins on the uncorroborated and conclusory charge of a private bounty hunter was a gross violation of the Fourth Amendment. The police swore to a false charge to obtain a warrant under a false name, failed to take Collins before a magistrate as Texas requires after arrests without warrants, and avoided having a magistrate inform Collins of his right to counsel and right not to incriminate himself. See Vernon\u2019s Ann.Texas Code Crim.Proc. arts. 215, 217, 245, 247 (1948). The law relating to arrest and detention does not always provide bright lines, and minor errors by the police are hardly to be avoided. But when the police operate in calculated and substantial disregard of the applicable rules, they cannot expect the benefit of any doubts as to undue pressure in a truly close case.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Since in my opinion this ground, established as far back as Brown v. State of Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278, 56 S.Ct. 461, 80 L.Ed.2d 682 (1936), requires us to reverse the judgment, I prefer not to attempt resolution of Collins\u2019 claims in regard to Wong Sun and Escobedo. In view of Chief Judge Tuttle\u2019s persuasive exegesis of these cases, it seems desirable that I pinpoint my areas of doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Wong Sun held that statements which were the fruit of a seizure violating the Fourth Amendment stood no differently than its tangible results, 371 U.S. at 484-487, 83 S.Ct. 407. It is true, as the state emphasizes, that Wong Sun was a federal trial and that the Court spoke \u201cin terms of deterring lawless conduct by federal officers\u201d and \u201cof closing the doors of the federal courts to any use of evidence unconstitutionally obtained,\u201d 371 U.S. at 486, 83 S.Ct. at 416. But I perceive no basis for supposing that, having equated verbal with real evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment with respect to exclusion in federal trials, see Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505, 81 S.Ct. 679, 5 L.Ed.2d 734 (1961), the Court that had decided Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 43, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), only two years earlier would distinguish the two sorts of evidence with respect to the necessity for exclusion in state trials. See Rogers v. United States, 330 F.2d 535, 541 (5 Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 916, 85 S.Ct. 265, 13 L.Ed.2d 186 (1964). It is also true that in Wong Sun there had been both an unlawful arrest and an unlawful search, whereas here there was only the former. But that also would seem an unlikely basis for distinction. The Fourth Amendment protects against improper seizure of the person as fully as against unreasonable breaking into the close, see Albrecht v. United States, 273 U.S. 1, 5, 47 S.Ct. 250, 71 L.Ed. 505 (1927); United States ex rel. Potts v. Rabb, 141 F.2d 45 (3 Cir.), cert. denied, 322 U.S. 727, 64 S.Ct. 943, 88 L.Ed. 1563 (1944), and nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s language would warrant a view that the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cabsorbs\u201d the Fourth less in one respect than in the other, see Ker v. State of California, 374 U.S. 23, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 10 L.Ed.2d 726 (1963); compare Cohen v. Norris, 300 F.2d 24, 28 n. 3 (9 Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">I thus follow Chief Judge Tuttle on the general proposition that Wong Sun prohibits the introduction in a state criminal trial of a confession that is the result of an arrest violating the Fourth Amendment, just as Mapp prohibits the reception of an object obtained through an unconstitutional search.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>problems become different is the less clear causal relation between the unconstitutional act and the \u201cfruit.\u201d When the police, by a search violating the Fourth Amendment, seize contraband or overhear a conversation disclosing the location of stolen goods, the connection between the unconstitutional intrusion and the booty offered at trial is so automatic and inevitable that the latter is readily seen as the \u201cfruit\u201d of the unconstitutional act. But when the object improperly seized is a person and the alleged \u201cfruit\u201d is a statement by him, there intervenes the individual\u2019s own decision to speak. In Wong Sun itself the causal problems were at the temporal extremes. Toy\u2019s statement, which the Court required to be excluded along with the narcotics to which it led, came directly after \u201c[s]ix or seven officers had broken the door and followed on Toy\u2019s heels into the bedroom where his wife and child were sleeping\u201d and \u201c[h]e had been almost immediately handcuffed and arrested.\u201d 371 U.S. at 486, 83 S.Ct. at 416. By contrast, Wong Sun\u2019s statement, held to have been properly admitted despite his unlawful arrest, was made after he \u201chad been released on his own recognizance after a lawful arraignment, and had returned voluntarily several days later to make the statement * * *\u201d 371 U.S. at 491, 83 S.Ct. at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">If the objective of obtaining maximum deterrence of arrests by state officers in violation of the Fourth Amendment overrode all other considerations, a narrow test of what breaks the causal chain would be appropriate in every case. But the few courts that have yet had to face the problem have shown reluctance to press Wong Sun so far, placing stress upon the Court\u2019s statement, \u201cWe need not hold that all evidence is \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 simply because it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police.\u201d 371 U.S. at 487-488, 83 S.Ct. at 417. Thus, another panel in this circuit has shrunk from concluding that a possible error by the police in thinking an arrest to be legal must require exclusion of a confession made some hours later in a wholly voluntary manner \u2014 the court saying, \u201cAt first blush * * * [Wong Sun] would appear to require only a passing of sufficient time between the arrest and the statement for the defendant to clear and arrange his mind.\u201d Rogers v. United States, supra, 330 F.2d at 541-542. In State v. Traub, 150 Conn. 169, 187 A.2d 230 (1962), vacated and remanded \u201cfor further consideration in light of Wong Sun * * 374 U.S. 493, 83 S.Ct. 1899, 10 L.Ed.2d 1048 (1963), the Connecticut Supreme Court adhered to its decision admitting the confession, 151 Conn. 246, 196 A.2d 755 (1963), although Traub had no attorney and claimed he had not been warned that he was entitled to remain silent and that anything he said could be used against him, 150 Conn. at 183-187, 187 A.2d at 237-238; and the Supreme Court denied certiorari, 377 U.S. 960, 84 S.Ct. 1637, 12 L.Ed.2d 503 (1964). See also Prescoe v. State, 231 Md. 486, 191 A.2d 226 (1963); State v. Jackson, 43 N.J. 148, 203 A.2d 1 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">Doubtless this judicial reluctance to press Wong Sun to its possible logical limits reflects a realization that interests other than maximum deterrence of unconstitutional arrests are at stake. Also the absence of probable cause or failure to comply with prescribed methods of search or arrest generally has nothing more than a \u201cbut-for\u201d causal relation to a subsequent confession, and sometimes not even that. A good deal might be said for a limiting principle based on the wantonness of the arrest, as one passage in Chief Judge Tuttle\u2019s opinion may intimate. Compare United States v. Kyle, 297 F.2d 507 (2 Cir. 1961). On this view, a flagrantly unlawful violation by the police would require depriving them of every foreseeable benefit that might spur further adventures of the same kind, certainly suppression of all evidence acquired, including confessions given prior to release or in the absence of a lawyer. On the other hand, those errors of judgment inevitable when the Fourth Amendment is being interpreted \u201con the run\u201d would not disqualify the evidence, on the theory that the added margin of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>deterrence and increased security is not worth the added price. Deciding what is flagrant is no harder than appraising probable cause. If I were sure that some such limiting principle was available, I would be less hesitant in joining Chief Judge Tuttle as to Wong Sun, since the police conduct here was as wanton as could be. But as matters stand, I think it undesirable for an inferior court to attempt to predict what terminal, if any, the Supreme Court will put on Wong Sun until it is seized of a case where that task cannot be shirked.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Before leaving this phase of the case, I should make clear that I am not prepared to hold the initial encounter between the police and Collins on the evening of January 19 to have been an illegal arrest. Although Special Investigator Williams, answering a rather leading question by Collins\u2019 counsel, did characterize the episode as such, Detective Ray testified that he didn\u2019t arrest Collins, that Collins \u201cagreed to go along and go with us,\u201d and that Williams had simply told Collins \u201cthat Captain Waycott wanted to see him.\u201d There is no evidence that force was used or threatened, though Collins may have thought it would be if he did not comply. The issue whether the police, though lacking enough evidence to justify arrest and incarceration, may not request or even demand that a person suspected of serious crime accompany them to a suitable place of interview for a reasonable period of investigation is so important and the proper answer so doubtful, see, e. g., Watts v. State of Indiana, 338 U.S. 49, 58, 61-62, 69 S.Ct. 1347, 93 L.Ed. 1801 (1949) (concurring and dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Jackson); Culombe v. Connecticut, supra, 367 U.S. at 576-581, 81 S.Ct. 1860 (opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter); United States ex rel. Corbo v. La Vallee, 270 F.2d 513, 518 (2 Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 950, 80 S.Ct. 403, 4 L.Ed.2d 382 (1960); United States v. Vita, 294 F.2d 524, 528-530 (2 Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 823, 82 S.Ct. 837, 7 L.Ed.2d 788 (1962); United States v. Middleton, 344 F.2d 78 (2 Cir. 1965); United States v. Bonanno, 180 F.Supp. 71 (S.D.N.Y.), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 285 F.2d 408 (2 Cir. 1960); LaFave, Arrest, 300-18, 343-53 (1965), that resolution of that issue also should await a case where the task cannot be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"Ady_\">There has been sharp difference of opinion, see United States ex rel. Russo v. New Jersey, - F.2d - (3 Cir. 1965) and cases there cited, on the highly important question whether Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964), is to be extended beyond what the Court characterized as \u201cthe critical question\u201d in that case, 378 U.S. 479, 84 S.Ct. 1758, and, if so, how far. The testing point is whether the phrase in the holding, 378 U.S. at 490-491, 84 S.Ct. at 1765, \u201cthe suspect has requested and been denied an opportunity to consult with his lawyer,\u201d was intended to set limits on the decision or was merely an accurate description of the facts. A plausible argument can indeed be assembled for the view that Escobedo will not be limited to factual situations like that there presented. The decision, it is said, obliterates the significance of the beginning of judicial proceedings as triggering the right to counsel; the Court considered it enough that Escobe-do \u201chad become the accused\u201d in the eyes of the police. The next proposition is that once that stage has been reached, it can make no difference whether the prospective defendant has sought counsel or not; as to this, reliance is placed on the statement that \u201cthe right to be furnished counsel does not depend on a request.\u201d Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U.S. 506, 513, 82 S.Ct. 884, 8 L.Ed.2d 70 (1962). If the state has not taken the initiative and furnished counsel at this stage, the argument runs, it must at least advise the accused in such a way that he will clearly understand that he has a right to consult with an attorney before responding to interrogation and that he need not answer at all unless he freely chooses. For only if the suspect makes a \u201cconsidered choice,\u201d Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 439, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963), to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>forego the aid to which, <em>ex hypothesi, </em>he is then and there entitled does the Sixth Amendment permit his statements to be used against him. Finally, depending on the rationale thought to underlie an expanded Escobedo doctrine, arguments of some force can be advanced for applying it retroactively. But, as against this chain of quotations from cases presenting quite different problems, there are the many limiting phrases presumably placed in the Escobedo opinion for some purpose \u2014 not only the characterizations of the question and of the holding already mentioned, but further language stressing the frustrated attempts of client and attorney to communicate, 378 U.S. at 481-482, 485, 488, 84 S.Ct. 1758, and the reliance on People v. Donovan, 13 N.Y.2d 148, 151, 243 N.Y.S.2d 841, 843, 193 N.E.2d 628 (1963), 378 U.S. 486-487, 84 S.Ct. 1758. Cases like Carnley and Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938), concerned the right to counsel at trial, where pitting a layman against a trained prosecutor creates a serious risk that an innocent man will go to jail. The police station confession \u2014 itself desirable so far as truly voluntary \u2014 presents a very different problem not only in its legal history but in the practical considerations involved. Strong arguments can be mustered for hedging confessions with further safeguards, but we must beware of treating the \u201cright to counsel,\u201d \u201cwaiver,\u201d or any other concept of law as a Platonic reality without considering the context at hand. Since the expansive reading of Es-cobedo sometimes proposed would take the Court rather far from the historic purpose of the Sixth Amendment, as explained in Powell v. State of Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 60-65, 68-73, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932), and Bute v. People of State of Illinois, 333 U.S. 640, 660-663, 68 S.Ct. 763, 92 L.Ed. 986 (1948), would invalidate numerous state and federal convictions if retroactively applied, and might drastically affect the necessary investigation of crime, I do not wish to essay resolution of these grave problems, even on the tentative basis on which a Court of Appeals necessarily acts on a question of this sort, when, in my view, the relator is entitled to prevail on another ground.
