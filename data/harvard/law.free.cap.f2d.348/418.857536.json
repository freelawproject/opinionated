Judge Wein-feld granted a certificate of probable cause and leave to appeal <em>in forma pau-peris </em>on December 15,1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-24\">Appellant is presently held in custody by the Warden of Green Haven Prison, Stormviile, New York, pursuant to a judgment of conviction for first degree robbery in a state court. Appellant seeks his release on the ground that his conviction was obtained in violation of his right to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, appellant claims that the District Attorney knowingly used perjured testimony and suppressed evidence beneficial to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-25\">The facts are as follows: Edward Daly, the principal prosecution witness, was an accomplice in the crime charged against appellant Fazio and another. The appellant based his petition for a writ on Daly\u2019s denial that his testimony against appellant had been motivated by an expectation of leniency. This denial ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>pellant claims was false to the knowledge of the District Attorney who failed to disclose this to the court and to the appellant. The relevant testimony reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\">\n<em>Cross-Examination of Daly</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">\u201cQ. Now, you were dickering for a plea, weren\u2019t you ? A. I was offered a plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABp\">Q. Eight \u2014 and that plea was to a felony, wasn\u2019t it? A. It was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">Q. Then you decided, did you not, to look for a break \u2014 just yes or no? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">Q. In other words, you were not motivated to implicate persons charging them with crimes, with the hope for any sort of consideration ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">Mr. McCabe: Object to the form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">The Court: Overruled. That is a very vital question in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-11\">\n<em>By Mr. Fischbein:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-12\">Q. What? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-13\">Q. Weren\u2019t you? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-14\">Q. You were not motivated to look for consideration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-15\">A. I had\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-16\">Q. One moment\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-17\">The Court: No, Mr. Fischbein, please. Let us give the witness an opportunity to answer, and you will be given an opportunity to put the next question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-18\">\n<em>By the Court:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-19\">Q. Did you finish your answer? A. No; I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-20\">Q. Finish your answer. A. I had a very good plea. I could have got robbery three and as a third offender only. The one in Federal don\u2019t count, because it don\u2019t come under the statuations [sic] of New York State. I could have got \u2014 I was facing five to twenty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-21\">Q. Five to twenty? A. That is right; for robbery three. And that was \u2014 I don\u2019t think I can get any better break than what I got there; and that is the day I went down there and told them. I knew what I was going to get, and I don\u2019t think I was going to wind up with more the way things looked, than what I was going to get. That ain\u2019t the reason \u2014to get any time off. That was not the reason. They know the reason as well as I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-23\">Mr. Fischbein: Now, your Honor, I move to strike that out as not responsive, an operation of the witness\u2019 mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-25\">*The Witness: You wanted to know the reason. You asked me for the reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-27\">Mr. Fischbein: And at this time I ask the court to admonish the witness not to make any voluntary statements while I am discussing it with the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-28\">The Court: (To the witness) Yes; just pause for a moment. (To Mr. Fischbein and Mr. McCabe.) Come up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-30\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-31\">\n<em>By Mr. Fischbein:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-32\">Q. You have not interposed a plea of guilty to the crime for which you have been indicted, have you? A. Not yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-33\">Q. Are you expecting some consideration as a result of the testimony you are giving here today? A. I don\u2019t know what they are going to do with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-35\">Q. Are you expecting? A. I was told this can get me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-36\">Mr. Fischbein: I submit that was not the answer \u2014 the answer he is about to give\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-37\">The Court: You are quite right. The question is not what is going to happen. The question is what is in your mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-38\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-39\">\n<em>By Mr. Fischbein:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-40\">Q. You don\u2019t expect any consideration at all ? A. None.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-41\">Mr. Fischbein: That is all of this witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-42\">At the conclusion of the case, appellant was found guilty and sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>In 1962, appellant filed a petition for a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>in the Supreme Court, Kings County. This petition was denied after a hearing by Judge Leibowitz. The Appellate Division, Second Department, affirmed in an unanimous <em>per curiam </em>opinion, 19 A.D.2d 640, 242 N.Y.S.2d 607 (1963), and was in turn affirmed by the New York Court of Appeals, 14 N.Y.2d 716, 250 N.Y.S.2d 62, 199 N.E.2d 162 (1964). Appellant then filed the habeas corpus petition which is the subject matter of the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">In the original <em>coram nobis </em>proceeding Judge Leibowitz denied appellant\u2019s motion on two grounds: (1) the evidence failed to establish that Daly\u2019s testimony was perjured testimony knowingly used, and (2) appellant\u2019s own counsel prevented 'disclosure of Daly\u2019s true motives for testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The Appellate Division, the Court of Appeals, and the District Court all reached the same result on the basis of the second ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">We agree with this conclusion and affirm the dismissal of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The sole question presented on this appeal is whether the District Attorney knowingly used perjured testimony and suppressed evidence beneficial to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">The questions asked of Daly by appellant\u2019s counsel at trial did not seek information as to whether anyone had made any promises to Daly. At the hearing before Judge Leibowitz, Miles F. MacDonald, District Attorney at the time of the trial, testified that his only statement to Daly was to the effect that whatever Daly did to cooperate would be called to the attention of the court at the time of sentence. The portion of the record included above reveals that appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s questions were directed to whether Daly was motivated with the hope of any sort of consideration. These questions were purely subjective to Daly and we fail to find any basis for the claim of perjury. The record indicates that Daly had a strong revenge motive for testifying. Furthermore, appellant has offered nothing to show that Daly\u2019s answers were in fact false.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">Finally, we agree with Judge Weinfeld and the other courts which have considered appellant\u2019s writs that it was appellant\u2019s own counsel who, for apparently adequate reasons, prevented disclosure of Daly\u2019s true motives for testifying against him. Appellant should not now be allowed to challenge a legitimate decision made in his interest by counsel of his own choosing. See United States v. Garguilo, 2 Cir., 324 F.2d 795 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
