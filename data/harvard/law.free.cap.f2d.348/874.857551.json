The indictment charged appellant with the concealment and sale of 1.140 grams of heroin on April 24,1964 (Counts 1 and 2) and of 8.800 grams of heroin in a separate transaction on the same day, April 24, 1964 (Counts 3 and 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-19\">Following trial by jury, a verdict of guilty was returned against appellant as to all counts. The appellant was sentenced to the custody of the Attorney General for a period of five years on each count, the sentences to run concurrently. A timely notice of appeal was filed. Appellant requested permission to appeal <em>in forma pauperis, </em>and was granted his request by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-20\">The jurisdiction of the district court rested on Title 18, United States Code, Section 3231 and Title 21, United States Code, Section 174. This court has jurisdiction under Title 28, United States Code, Sections 1291 and 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-21\">We accept appellee\u2019s general statement of the facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-22\">The single issue raised on this appeal is whether defendant was entitled to an instruction on entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-23\">\u201cEntrapment\u201d is a word of art having a precise definition in the law. This definition attempts to delineate what entrap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>ment is as well as what it ordinarily is not. It is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-4\">\u201cthe act of a government officer or agent <em>inducing a person to commit a crime not contemplated by him, </em>for the purpose of instituting a criminal prosecution against him. But the mere act of an officer in furnishing the accused an opportunity to commit the crime when the criminal intent was already present in the accused\u2019s mind is not ordinarily entrapment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 4th ed., p. 627.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">As we said in Ramirez v. United States, 9 Cir., 294 F.2d 277, 283 (1961): \u201c[Ajbsent the commission of a crime, there can be no entrapment.\u201d And see: Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958); Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 53 S.Ct. 210, 77 L.Ed. 413, 86 A.L.R. 249 (1932); Sylvia v. United States, 312 F.2d 145 (1st Cir. 1963); Matthews v. United States, 290 F.2d 198 (9th Cir. 1961); Ware v. United States, 259 F.2d 442, 445 (8th Cir. 1958); Rodriguez v. United States, 227 F.2d 912, 914 (5th Cir. 1905); Hamilton v. United States, 221 F.2d 611 (5th Cir. 1955); Eastman v. United States, 212 F.2d 320, 322 (9th Cir. 1954); Bakotich v. United States, 4 F.2d 386 (9th Cir. 1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Thus, to utilize the entrapment defense, an accused must admit he committed acts which constitute a crime, but assert that those acts he committed were not contemplated by him until he was improperly induced to commit them by a government agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Here the defendant denied the commission of the crime, i. e., denied he sold, or had possession of, or delivered, any narcotics. (R.T. 237-38.) His counsel asserted: \u201cThe defense * * * is this: That Mr. Ortega never sold this officer any narcotics.\u201d (R.T. 114.) Defendant testified he made no sale; the government witnesses testified they saw the sale. This created an issue for the jury\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">Appellant relies heavily on Hansford v. United States, 112 U.S.App.D.C. 359, 303 F.2d 219 (1962). There the jury was instructed on entrapment and the defendant objected. Without the citation of any authority, and considering it (in their words) \u201ca minor matter\u201d, the court <em>en banc </em>held that where the defendant had denied the sale of narcotic drugs, the <em>giving </em>of an instruction on entrapment was proper, because the two-fold defense was not inconsistent. \u201cIt was consistent with defendant\u2019s denial of the transaction to urge that if the jury believed it did occur the government\u2019s evidence as to how it occurred indicated entrapment.\u201d Hansford v. United States, supra at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">We do not agree. Perhaps this is a matter of semantics, but we believe the defense of entrapment (i. e., \u201cI only did it because the government agent induced me to do it\u201d) <em>is </em>inconsistent with the defense \u201cI didn\u2019t do it.\u201d But semantics aside, we do agree that giving of the instruction was not error. \u201cIt cannot be prejudicial to permit him [appellant] an extra defense.\u201d Sylvia v. United States, supra, 312 F.2d at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">The real issue in Hansford, supra (or \u201cthe more serious matter,\u201d as that court stated), was whether the court had so instructed the jury on the defense of entrapment as to make the defense available only to an \u201cinnocent\u201d man, \u201cthat is, a man who has no criminal record, and was enticed.\u201d Hansford not only had a criminal record; he was asked about it on cross-examination, including questions as to three previous convictions of petty larceny and one violation of the Harrison Narcotic Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">The District of Columbia court of appeals held that the failure of the trial court to properly define \u201can innocent man\u201d was error. The court meant, in referring to \u201can innocent man,\u201d one \u201cwho would not have sold narcotics but for the enticement.\u201d Hansford, supra, 303 F.2d at 222. But the jury under the instruction given \u201ccould well believe that the defense of entrapment was available only to an innocent man, that is, a man who has no criminal record, and was not enticed.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>Concededly, that is not the law. Sherman v. United States, supra.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-5\">\u201cIt [entrapment] involves the conduct of law-enforcement officers in leading another to commit an act defined as a criminal offense.\u201d Hans-ford v. United States, supra, 303 F.2d at 222.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-6\">\u201c[I]n such cases two questions of fact arise: (1) did the agent induce the accused to commit the offence charged in the indictment; (2) if so, was the accused ready and willing without persuasion and was he awaiting any propitious opportunity to commit the offence. On the first question the accused has the burden; on the second the prosecution has it.\u201d United States v. Sherman, 200 F.2d 880, 882-883 (2d Cir. 1952).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-7\">\u201cHowever, the fact that government agents \u2018merely afford opportunities or facilities for the commission of the offense does not\u2019 constitute entrapment. Entrapment occurs only when the criminal conduct was \u2018the product of the <em>creative </em>activity\u2019 of law-enforcement officials. [emphasis by the Supreme Court] * * <em>* </em>To determine whether entrapment has been established, a line must be drawn between the trap for the unwary innocent and the trap for the unwary criminal. * * * [A]t trial the accused may examine the conduct of the government agent; and on the other hand, the accused will be subjected to an \u2018appropriate and searching inquiry into his own conduct and predisposition\u2019 as bearing on his claim of innocence.\u201d Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 372-373, 78 S.Ct. 819.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">We must then search the evidence to determine what was the \u201ccreative activity\u201d of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">Here the stool pigeon, Strickland, testified (contrary to a written statement given to the government at an earlier time) that he had merely \u201cplayed a charade,\u201d inducing appellant to pretend to sell Strickland narcotics, and thereby afforded Strickland the opportunity to sell <em>Ms </em>(Strickland\u2019s) narcotics to the government agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-15\">The appellant related no repeated urging on the part of Strickland nor any conduct or series of events that could have broken down Ortega\u2019s resistance \u2014 just that Strickland said, in Ortega\u2019s ambiguous words: \u201cHe says, \u2018You know what?\u2019 he says. He says, T have got a gram. He wants to score a gram,\u2019 he says. He says, <em>\u2018Act like you\u2019re going, </em>you know, <em>to give Mm </em>\u2014 like <em>I\u2019m giving you the gram, and just take the money.\u2019 So I says \u2018All right,\u2019 </em>so like he does it, you know.\u201d (Tr. 234)</p>\n<p id=\"b925-16\">It is unnecessary for us to pass judgment on the truth or falsity of Strickland\u2019s and Ortega\u2019s testimony. The jury has already done that. Strickland, at best, had a very bad memory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>Admittedly, and without dispute, defendant Ortega accepted $20 and $130 from Strickland and Celaya, knowing the money was puchase money for narcotics which he knew Strickland possessed and physically had in his possession in Ortega\u2019s auto which Strickland was to deliver to government agent Celaya as a narcotic sale. (Tr. 242) He aided in and induced the transfer of narcotics for money. We cannot say as a matter of law that Ortega\u2019s admitted actions did not \u201cfacilitate\u201d the concealment and transportation of narcotics; or that it did not \u201cfacilitate\u201d the sale thereof to Celaya. Nor could we say it was not for the jury to decide whether, although the narcotics were on Strickland when he sat in Ortega\u2019s auto, and Ortega handed Strickland the purchase money (as was testified), Ortega did <em>not </em>have a constructive possession of the narcotics Strickland admittedly had in his physical possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">This, then, is not a case where any government agent asked Strickland to perform the alleged treacherous \u201ccharade\u201d. Neither Celaya nor any other government agent had the slightest knowledge that Strickland proposed to \u201cframe\u201d Ortega, if in fact he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">In this connection we feel constrained to consider a recent case from the District of Columbia Circuit. In Smith v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 38, 331 F.2d 784 (1964), a majority of that court held the trial judge erred in refusing to instruct on entrapment. \u201cTo be sure,\u201d the court said, \u201cthe defense had not here alleged resort by the officers to the usual Government stratagem of sending some prospective purchaser to buy narcotics from a known or suspected seller,\u201d which the court reaffirms is a lawful act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-14\">\u201c[note] 16. \u2018It is well settled that the fact that officers or employees of the government merely afford opportunities or facilities for the commission of the offense does not defeat the prosecution. Artifice and stratagem may be employed to catch those engaged in criminal enterprises.\u2019 \u201d Smith v. United States, supra at 789-790, quoting Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 441, 53 S.Ct. 210.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>The Smith case was not a case of entrapment, but of \u201cframe-up,\u201d i. e., had the narcotics been \u201cplanted\u201d on Smith. Smith had perhaps been \u201cset up\u201d by one Paris on previous narcotic convictions. On October 23, 1961, Paris gave defendant the forty-one capsules found on him when he was arrested, to hold \u201cuntil he came back from the barber shop,\u201d for \u201che would be right back.\u201d Forty-five minutes later officers entered Smith\u2019s apartment with a search warrant. Smith was detained on the telephone talking to another officer at the time. When the officers announced their identity and their possession of the search warrant, Smith took the forty-one capsules from his shirt pocket and delivered them to the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Under these particular circumstances, including the <em>express admission by defendant Smith on the stand that he had possession of the narcotics </em>for forty-five minutes (331 F.2d p. 791), the court ruled that the question of whether the admitted possession by defendant was a result of the creative activity of the police, or was a cause of the manufacturing of crime by law enforcement officials, should have been presented to the jury under proper instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Under the peculiar facts of the Smith case, we agree that the issue of a \u201cframe-up\u201d or entrapment was for the jury\u2019s consideration. But those facts are not here present. Here there was no admitted actual possession of the narcotics by the defendant Ortega. Here there is not the slightest indication the police wanted, or knew, that Strickland would do what he now asserts he did \u2014 impose upon Ortega. Not until Strickland contradicted his original signed statement in the courtroom was there any knowledge in the government agents as to what Ortega and Strickland now assert Strickland did. We do not consider the Smith v. United States case, supra, controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b923-14\">. \u201cOn April 24, 1964, at approximately 4:15 p.m., in Los Angeles, under the surveillance of federal agents, appellant sold and delivered ten No. 5 capsules, containing a brownish powder, to an undercover assistant of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. Appellant received $20 in re-, turn for this amount of heroin. The undercover assistant then delivered the capsules to an agent of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. This powder was subsequently identified as being 1.14 grams of heroin. Prior to this sale the undercover assistant had been searched by an agent of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and was found to have no personal property of any sort in his possession other than approximately $1.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-15\">\u201cOn the same date, in Los Angeles, at approximately 5:40 p.m., after lengthy conversation with Federal Narcotics Agent Oelaya, appellant, in return for $130, sold 8.800 grams of heroin to Agent Oelaya.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-16\">* $ $ $ $</p>\n<p id=\"b923-24\">\u201cAfter the Government witnesses had testified to the aforementioned facts, one Roger Strickland, the undercover assistant mentioned in Count 2 of the indictment, was called as a witness for appellant, and testified that appellant had not actually sold the heroin to him (Strickland) but had merely pretended to do so so that Strickland could safely sell the narcotics to the agent of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. Strickland so testified despite the statement he had signed on May 18, 1964 which detailed appellant\u2019s actual involvement in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-25\">\u201cAppellant Ortega then testified that he did not commit the crime charged but rather only acted out a charade as a <em>favor </em>to Strickland, a position maintained by appellant Ortega at the time of sentencing. Appellant at the close of the entire case requested that the trial court instruct the jury on the question of entrapment, which request was denied.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Brief, pp. 3-4.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b925-8\">. At the trial, when he sought to aid Ortega by denying Ortega had sold the heroin to the government agent Oelaya, Strickland could not remember from whom <em>he had </em>bought the narcotics. (R.T. 166) Strickland testified he purchased a half an ounce of heroin for $175 (R.T. 166); and then stated he only put up $15.00. (R.T. 169) After meeting Celaya, Strickland said he was not searched by anyone. (R.T. 143-44; 193-94) Oelaya said he searched Strickland (R.T. 52).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">When the second purchase was made from Ortega, the government agent declined to pay for the heroin before he saw it. Ortega then came over to the agent\u2019s car. The testimony of Strickland reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-17\">\u201cI went back to the car and told him [Oelaya] that the guy \u2014 that Sammy [Ortega] wouldn\u2019t \u2018burn\u2019 him or nothing; give him the <em>money </em>and <em>he </em>would be back with the stuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-18\">\u201cQ.

He said he couldn\u2019t get the stuff without the money and he can\u2019t take him to the connection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-8\">\u201cBY MR. MARCUS: Q. Did you tell Sammy to take the money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-9\">\u201cA. What? Yes. I told him to take the money and go somewheres for a little while and then come back. See, when I talked to him previously I told him that \u2014 I told him, \u2018When he gives you the money, just go like you\u2019re going to score somewhere, and then come back.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Then what happened after you gave him the money? After Mr. Celaya gave the defendant Ortega the money, then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-11\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Then Sammy left, and I told him I would be waiting for him in front of the Market Basket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"abc-dedup-0\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMi\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: So he left, and about 20 minutes later I went out in front of the Market Basket, waited for him to come back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVk4\">He showed up about 10 minutes later and I got in the car. He gave me the money.
