Shell advised them that a refusal to go would result in their discharge. All ten are members of the Association which is their collective bargaining representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The District Court, concluding (1) from an \u201cexamination of the agreement in its entirety\u201d that the dispute was not one within the arbitration provision of the agreement and (2) that, in any event, the grievance procedure provided by the agreement could be invoked only by the individual employees and was not available to the Association, granted Shell\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\"> \u201cThe duty to arbitrate being of contractual origin, a compulsory submission to arbitration cannot precede judicial determination that the collective bargaining agreement does in fact create such a duty.\u201d John Wiley &amp; Sons v. Livingston, 376 U.S. 543, 547, 84 S.Ct. 909, 913, 11 L.Ed.2d 898 (1964). It is true that the bargaining agreement before the court made no mention of geographical transfers (or for that matter the nature or type of any particular complaint) as a subject for discussion and arbitration. But that silence clearly did not justify the entry of summary judgment. Manifestly, the parties entered into the agreement to forestall industrial strife by providing a method to preclude by peaceful means disruptive labor disputes; in the agreement they expressly declared that \u201c[t]here shall be no cessation of work due to strikes or lockouts during the period of this Agreement\u201d; and to that end they not only agreed that employees could present for discussion complaints \u201con any subject\u201d but they also provided grievance procedures with arbitration proceedings as the final stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-15\">The District Court thus should have viewed the agreement as \u201cmore than a contract\u201d [United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Co., 363 U.S. 574, 578, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960)], and proceeded on the assumption that it reflected a bi-partite eifort to erect \u201ca system of industrial self-government,\u201d [Id., at 580, 80 S.Ct. at 1352] with the arbitration machinery \u201cat the very heart.\u201d Id. at 581, 80 S.Ct. at 1351. In determining the scope of the agreement, the court should have commenced with the premise that \u201c[a]part from matters that the parties specifically exclude, all of the questions on which the parties disagree [d] must therefore come within the scope of the grievance and arbitration provisions of the collective agreement.\u201d Id. But this was not the court\u2019s approach. The \u201cfindings of fact\u201d which the court made, preliminary to entry of summary judgment, show that the court held the view that such agreements must be narrowly construed. This was incorrect.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cAn order to ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>bitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute. Doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.\u201d United Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Co., supra, 363 U.S. at 582, 583, 80 S.Ct. at 1353. And no fact or combination of facts appearing in the materials submitted to the court on the motion was sufficient to settle the issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The second ground of decision was one not available to the district court, and accordingly does not afford valid support for the entry of the judgment against the Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The parties\u2019 agreement provided two other procedures to be respectively exhausted before resort could be made to arbitration. \u201cStep 1,\u201d required the employee to \u201cverbally\u201d present his complaint to his immediate supervisor. If the matter still remained unsettled \u201cStep 2\u201d provided for a meeting between Shell\u2019s manager and the Association\u2019s adjustment committee. The meeting would be held upon the Association\u2019s written request, signed by the employee, and setting out a full statement of his complaint. If this meeting failed to satisfactorily settle the complaint, then the Association was entitled to demand arbitration as provided by \u201cStep 3.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">The District Court reasoned that the Association, as the employees\u2019 collective bargaining representative, had no standing to initiate the adjustment proceedings because \u201cthe adjustment procedure set forth in Article IV (of the bargaining agreement) is not susceptible of an interpretation that would cover the complaint presented by the petitioners where the employees to which it relates have not become parties to the complaint by signing the written statement thereof.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>But in making this determination, the District Court usurped a function which the Supreme Court in John Wiley &amp; Sons v. Livingston, supra, 376 U.S. 543, 84 S.Ct. 909 (1964) has squarely held is to be exercised exclusively by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Wiley tells us that procedural questions are for the arbitrator without regard to factual variations from case to case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> First, because as the Supreme Court said, ordinarily a court cannot avoid involvement with the merits of a dispute were it to resolve the issue of procedural arbitrability. John Wiley &amp; Sons v. Livingston, supra, 376 U.S. at 557, 84 S.Ct. 909. (True, the Court went on to acknowledge that this would not always be a consideration and, it might be added, the case before us might well, as a matter of speculation, be among those \u201crare\u201d cases). And second and separately because, as the Court rationalized, \u201cprocedural disagreements\u201d [should be viewed] \u201cnot as separate disputes but as aspects of the dispute which -called the grievance procedures into play.\u201d Id. at 559, 84 S.Ct. at 919. For to leave the determination of procedural arbitrability to a court \u201cwould produce the delay attendant upon judicial proceedings preliminary to arbitration,\u201d [Id. at \u25a0558, 84 S.Ct. at 919] and would \u201centail the fractionating of disputes about subjects which the parties do wish to have \u2022submitted\u201d contrary to \u201cthe usual purposes of an arbitration clause and * * the policy behind federal labor law\u201d favoring speedy settlement of industrial disputes. [Id. at 559, 84 S.Ct. at 919].</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">We think the question, whether a given grievance may be processed by a duly constituted bargaining agent of an employee or by the individual employee, can only be characterized as a procedural matter. Compliance with the grievance procedures bears not at all upon the question of whether the grievance is of a substantive nature embraced by the agreement to arbitrate. Moreover, the proper scope of the agent\u2019s authority and the nature of his role in matters concerning labor disputes would appear to be a question peculiarly within the province of the arbitrator possessing, as he does, \u201cknowledge of the common law of the shop\u201d and the ability to \u201cbring to bear considerations which are not expressed in the contract as criteria for judgment.\u201d United Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Co., supra, 363 U.S. at 582, 80 S.Ct. at 1352. Indeed, \u201c[T]he considerations which help him fashion judgments may * * * be foreign to the competence of courts.\u201d Id. at 581, 80 S.Ct. at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">We add that we are at one with the District Court\u2019s apparent objective of keeping the determination of arbitrability brief and to the point. That course most comports with the policy favoring speedy settlement of industrial disputes. But to rule a controversy not arbitrable on scant evidence falling short of a clear demonstration of that fact would set at naught the equally important policy enunciated in the Steelworkers trilogy <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to arbitrate all disputes not clearly outside the arbitration clause. The District Court must accommodate these conflicting considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">The judgment is vacated and the matter is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-10\">. Jurisdiction of the action was conferred upon the District Court by Sec. 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (61 Stat. 136, 156, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b435-16\">. \u201cWhen, however, an absolute no-strike clause is included in the agreement, then in a very real sense everything that management does is subject to the agreement, for either management is prohibited or limited in the action it takes, or if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>not, it is protected from interference by strikes.\u201d United Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Co., supra, 363 U.S. at 583, 80 S.Ct. at 1353.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b436-8\">. In resolving the issue of arbitrability, a court is, of course, not free to disregard direct proof in favor of presumption. Where the issue is one of intent, the bargaining history may be relevant and of considerable assistance. Communication Workers of America v. Pac. N. W. Bell Tel. Co., 337 F.2d 455 (9th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Here, however, the only showing submitted on Shell\u2019s motion appeared in a stipulation, and reads: \u201cOn September 29, 1961, in the course of negotiations between petitioner (i. e., the Association) and respondent concerning the modification of the collective bargaining agreement then in effect, petitioner proposed the following addition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">\u2018Refusal to accept a transfer from Emeryville to another Shell installation shall not of itself be sufficient cause for dismissal\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">We are at a loss to understand what relevancy this fact would have, for the negotiations referred to were conducted in 1961 and apparently related to a contract other than the one involved in this case which was executed under date of 1963. However, in any event, this fragmentary fact is highly equivocal, especially since the stipulation further recites that \u201cOn Nov. 10, 1961 petitioner withdrew the proposal. Petitioner and respondent are unable to stipulate as to the circumstances of the withdrawal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ath-dedup-0\">Because of our disposition of this appeal, we deem it advisable to point out the admonition of the Supreme Court that in agreements not expressly excluding particular grievances and containing \u201cquite broad\u201d arbitration clauses, \u201conly the most forceful evidence of a purpose to exclude the claim from arbitration can prevail <em>* * </em>We likewise call attention to the Court\u2019s cautionary direction that \u201c[s]ince any attempt by a court to infer such a purpose necessarily comprehends the merits, the court should view with suspicion an attempt to persuade it to become entangled in the construction of the substantive provisions of a labor agreement, even through the back door of interpreting the arbitration clause, when the alternative is to utilize the services of an arbitrator.\u201d United Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Co., supra, 363 U.S. at 585, 80 S.Ct. at 1354.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b436-16\">. Among the materials before the District Court on the motion was a letter from the Association to Shell requesting a meeting pursuant to Step II of the agreement. In the letter, the Association set forth the complaint stating that the complaint was that \u201cof the Association in its own behalf as the collective bargaining agent and on behalf of the ten individual employees\u201d named therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b437-6\">.
