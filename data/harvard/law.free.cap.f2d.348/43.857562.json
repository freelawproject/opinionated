The principal issue on appeal is whether the evidence required the District Court to instruct the jury on criminal responsibility as requested.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The mental condition relied upon by appellant as the basis for the instruction arises out of his addiction to narcotic drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">To raise the issue of criminal responsibility, it must appear from the evidence that the accused, at the time of the alleged criminal act, suffered from some mental disease or defect, which we have defined as meaning an abnormal condition of the mind which substantially impairs capacity to control behavior. McDonald v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 120, 124, 312 F.2d 847, 851 (1962). This mental condition may be shown by observation and opinions of lay witnesses or experts; it does not depend upon psychiatric labels, or medical classifications and terms, although testimony of an expert giving a diagnosis of a mental disease or defect, in those terms, would raise the issue for jury determination. Lay testimony describing significantly bizarre, abnormal conduct also could be sufficient to raise the issue. We have said this must be \u201cmore than a scintilla,\u201d of evidence. McDonald v. United States, <em>supra. </em>In the first instance the question whether the evidence in a particular case constitutes \u201csome evidence\u201d of insanity, like other evidentiary rulings, is a question of law for the court. Of necessity, it is based on the trial judge\u2019s evaluation of the facts before him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">We hold only that a mere showing of narcotics addiction, without more, does not constitute \u201csome evidence\u201d of mental disease or \u201cinsanity\u201d so as to raise the issue of criminal responsibility. This is not to say that evidence that an accused is an addict is without probative value along with other evidence on the issue of responsibility but only that alone it is not sufficient to require giving the Durham-McDonald instruction. Cf. Hightower v. United States, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 43, 325 F.2d 616 (1963). Some mentally ill persons are addicts and some addicts are mentally ill; the two conditions can coincide but we give no more credence to the notion that all addicts are mentally ill than to the converse that all mentally ill persons are addicts. To so hold would make every addict\u2019s case an \u201cinsanity\u201d case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>We have gone to great effort in our <em>McDonald </em>holding to restore the issue of criminal responsibility as one of fact for the jury and to make it clear that the expert\u2019s label is relatively unimportant but that his description and explanation of capacity to control behavior are critical. We have frequently urged that trial counsel and their expert witnesses should seek to avoid being content with mere expert conclusions and should emphasize the reasons, the factors, the symptoms, and the medical reasoning which led to the conclusions so that from the experts the jury will have a psychological profile of the accused and not simply a collection of psychiatric labels and technical jargon. See, e. g., Carter v. United States, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 227, at 236-237, 252 F.2d 608, at 617-618; Blocker v. United States, <em>concurring opinion </em>110 U.S.App.D.C. 41, at 51-52, 288 F.2d 853, at 863-864.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-18\"> The narrow question presented is whether there was sufficient evidence to require the <em>Durham-McDonald </em>instruction. Three experts were called as witnesses in this case. Two testified categorically that appellant was without any mental disease or defect and had no abnormal condition of the mind at the time of the alleged acts. All three psychiatrists testified that deprivation of heroin <em>could </em>to varying degrees impair a heroin addict\u2019s capacity to control his conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The psychiatric testimony upon which appellant chiefly relies concerning capacity for control was premised on hypothetical facts not supported by evidence in this record,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>i. e., </em>evidence of depriva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>tion of heroin at the time of the offense. Had there been evidence that, at the time of the alleged unlawful acts appellant \u201cneed[ed] a fix,\u201d as one expert put it, and that narcotics were then unavailable to him, the hypothetical conditions postulated would find support in the record. But the record contains no suggestion that at the time of the alleged criminal acts appellant did in fact \u201cneed a fix\u201d; to the contrary undisputed affirmative evidence shows that at that very time he possessed large quantities of heroin available for sale. No rational thesis can demonstrate that an addict \u201cin need of a fix\u201d would be in a state of deprivation at the precise time he had an abundant supply of heroin in his possession.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In short, the most favorable interpretation of the medical testimony is that with no heroin available and the need urgent, appellant\u2019s behavior controls <em>might </em>have been affected; but the evidence on this record negates those interdependent factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The conclusion is inescapable, therefore, that with no claim or showing of need for and deprivation of narcotics \u2014the hypothesis on which the most favorable medical testimony was premised \u2014 there was no evidence that appellant\u2019s capacity to control his behavior was impaired. There being an absence of the requisite evidence that at the time of the act charged appellant had an abnormal condition of the mind which substantially impaired his behavior controls, the <em>McDonald </em>standard for submission of the criminal responsibility issue was not met, and the judgment therefore is</p>\n<p id=\"ARF\">Affirmed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-9\">. Appellant also contends that the evidence necessitated an instruction on entrapment. On the circumstances in this case, we cannot conclude that failure to so instruct was reversible error. See Berry v. United States, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 375, 324 F.2d 407 (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 959, 84 S.Ct. 972, 11 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-11\">. The dissent argues that under <em>McDonald </em>only the jurors, not psychiatrists or judg-. es, should pass on criminal responsibility. This oversimplification of the issue overlooks the historic proposition that jurors are not permitted to <em>speculate </em>their way to a verdict; a verdict must rest on <em>evidence </em>and it is the responsibility of the trial judge to decide, first, whether there is sufficient evidence on the issue for submission to the jury. Here there is no evidence either of mental disease or of actual impairment of capacity to control behavior.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b92-16\">. Reference in the dissent to our ambiguous if not misleading statement in Brown v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 76, 331 F.2d 822, 823 (1964), requires that the quotation from <em>Brown </em>and the reli-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>anee on Robinson v. State of Cal., 370 U.S. 660, 667, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962), be scrutinized in context.</p>\n<p id=\"AP\">That portion of the <em>Brown </em>quotation from <em>Robinson </em>which states that narcotics addiction is a <em>mental </em>illness is not the language of the Supreme Court. Rather, that Court quoted from the brief of the appellee in <em>Robinson </em>by way of a footnote to its opinion, only to show that the appellee in <em>Robinson </em>conceded the state of addiction to be an illness. The footnote in <em>Robinson, </em>at page 667, 82 S. Ct. at page 1420, reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8m\">\u201c8 In its brief the appellee stated: \u2018Of course it is generally conceded that a narcotic addict, particularly one addicted to the use of heroin, is in a state of mental and physical illness. So is an alcoholic.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A93\">Compare Castle v. United States, 1964, 120 U.S.App.D.C.-, 347 F.2d 492 (concurring opinion). The quotation from the per curiam opinion in <em>Castle, supra, </em>relied on by the dissent, was unnecessary to our affirmance of the conviction. Obiter dicta cannot be escalated into a holding by reciting it in one case and repeating it in another.</p>\n<p id=\"A71\">Thus the Supreme Court\u2019s footnote in <em>Robinson, </em>which hardly rises to the level of obiter dictum, did not in any sense intimate a view that the Court considered narcotics addiction a <em>mental </em>illness in the criminal-responsibility context. Its holding was merely that the addiction <em>status </em>may not be punished as a crime. If we are to speculate about what that Court meant by quoting from appellee\u2019s brief in <em>Robinson, </em>it would be well to note that the full quotation equated narcotic addiction with alcohol addiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b93-20\">. Dr. Dobbs, the expert whose testimony was the most favorable to appellant\u2019s claim, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-21\">\u201cQ. Doctor, in this condition [addiction described by appellant as use of three or four shots per day and up to eight or nine] would his behavior controls be substantially impaired ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-22\">\u201cA. As a result of the heroin or of the active process of the addiction in which case he might need a fix, to use the slang term, yes, they would be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-23\">\u201cQ. And would his mental or emotional processes be substantially affected?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-24\">\u201cA. For the same reasons, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-25\">\u201cQ. And would you consider this condition to be an abnormal condition of the mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-26\">[Objections intervened.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-27\">\u201cThe Court: I will let her answer. Was it abnormal in the sense it is a mental disease or mental defect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-28\">\u201cThe Witness: Abnormal in that it is not normal. Abnormal in the sense it is a mental disease in and of itself, no, it is not, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-29\">Record, p. 93.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b93-30\">. More often than not expert opinions are based upon assumed facts embraced in hypothetical questions but a hypothetical <em>answer </em>based on facts which are not shown to exist is not evidence. Here the expert said in effect that <em>if </em>appellant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>been deprived of needed narcotics at the time of the offense then his conduct might have been compulsive. But the record is barren of evidence of the very condition upon which the hypothesis was dependent. C<em>f. </em>Hightower v. United States, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 43, 325 F.2d 616 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b94-5\">. The dissent asserts that \u201caddiction, with adequate exposition of cause and effect, is \u2018some evidence\u2019 of mental illness.\u201d With this proposition in the abstract we do not disagree; we note merely that the posited evidence of causality is not present in this record: the hypothetical testimony concerning breakdowns in behavior controls caused by separation of an addict from his drug is meaningless without evidence that <em>this appellant </em>was so deprived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b94-6\">. Since this opinion was filed the court voted to deny Appellant\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc; under our practice individual judges are free to file their comments on the court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Judge Bazelon\u2019s statement seems to add up to the very conclusion reached by the division drawn to hear this case \u2014 namely that submission of an insanity issue to the jury could have resulted in nothing but impermissible speculation. The majority of this court do not, however, share Judge Bazelon\u2019s view that trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">It should be further noted that the journals and other literature cited in Judge Bazelon\u2019s statement were not cited to the court by the litigants and hence have not been subjected to the useful screening afforded by the adversary process. Whether they are fairly representative or reflect simply one point of view we do not know. Discussion of addiction as a mental illness in a broad social context or for treatment purposes is quite a different matter from labeling addiction \u201cmental disease\u201d in the context of determining criminal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"A3T2\">We can all agree generally that society is doing too little with drug addiction but the solution does not lie in excusing all addicts for their crimes, nor in straining the law to acquit all narcotics peddlers, nor in sending all addicts to overcrowded mental institutions. The judicial process is not adapted to accomplish even the most urgently needed social reforms. Such solutions must come from the Legislative and Executive Branches and we do a disservice to the whole structure by trying to use judicial power to these ends. The late Justice Frankfurter often reminded us that courts cannot find judicial remedies for every social, economic or political problem which afflicts Mankind.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"A_K\">J. SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AR-\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">As the court\u2019s opinion indicates, the trial judge was specifically requested to allow the jury to decide the issue of criminal responsibility in this case. Instead, the trial judge decided this issue against the defendant. In my opinion, this ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>tion, and the opinion of the majority here, are based on a misconception of the question of responsibility raised by a defense grounded in drug addiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">The majority here holds that there is no evidence to support the suggestion that at the time of the offense charged appellant was either so under the influence of narcotics or under such compulsion to obtain narcotics that his ability to control his behavior was substantially impaired. But this is not the issue which appellant presents. Appellant argues that his drug addiction reflects an underlying mental illness which has been exacerbated by the long continued use of drugs. It was in speaking of this condition \u2014 this cause and this effect, not the momentary effects of narcotics or the need of them \u2014 that we said in Brown v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 76, 77, 331 F.2d 822, 823 (1964) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">\u201c * * * \u2018[Njarcotic addiction is an illness. * * * \u201cOf course it is generally conceded that a narcotic addict, particularly one addicted to the use of heroin, is in a state of mental and physical illness.\u201d \u2019 Robinson v.

United States, 268 U.S. 5, 18, 45 S.Ct. 446, 449, 69 L.Ed. 819 (1925). The defense of insanity based on drug addiction generally presents a jury issue as to criminal responsibility. Horton v. United States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 184, 317 F.2d 595 (1963); Rivers v. United States, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 375, 330 F.2d 841 1964). The trier of fact must decide whether the defendant had a mental disability and, if so, whether his act was the product thereof. Hightower v. United States, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 43, 45-46, 325 F.2d 616, 618-619 (1963).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">It is true the Government psychiatrists in this case testified that in their opinion Heard, though addicted, was not suffering from a \u201cmental disease or defect.\u201d But, in explaining the cause and effect of narcotics addiction<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in general and in Heard\u2019s case in particular, each of them also testified that Heard\u2019s long addiction would <em>affect his mental and emotional processes as well as his behavior controls. </em>Thus each of them indicated that by our legal definition,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as distinguished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>from their medical opinion, Heard may be suffering from a mental disease. Under the circumstances, it is difficult for me to understand why this is not the \u201csome evidence\u201d required to take the mental issue to the jury. Davis v. United States, 160 U.S. 469, 486-487, 16 S.Ct. 858, 40 L.Ed. 499 (1895).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">With respect to \u201csome evidence,\u201d in McDonald v. United States, <em>supra </em>Note 2, we said:</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u201c * * * The subject matter being what it is, there can be no sharp quantitative or qualitative definition of \u2018some evidence.\u2019 Certainly it means more than a scintilla, yet, of course, the amount need not be so substantial as to require, if un-controverted, a directed verdict of acquittal. The judgment of the trial judge as to the sufficiency of the evidence is entitled to great weight on appeal, but, since the defendant\u2019s burden is merely to raise the issue, <em>any real doubt should be resolved in his favor.\u201d </em>114 U.S.App.D.C. at 122, 312 F.2d at 849.

The addict\u2019s physical dependence is \u2018the development of an altered physiological state which is brought about by the repeated administration of the drug and which necessitates continued administration of the drug to prevent the appearance of the characteristic illness which is termed an abstinence syndrome. * <em>* </em>* [Physical dependence] forces the addict to seek his drugs by any and all means.

The failure to instruct, under the circumstances, was tantamount to an instruction to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Although the insanity charge was not only required but requested, the defense was so poorly presented as to raise fundamental questions about the adequacy of the defense afforded indigent persons. Defense counsel called three psychiatrists. The total time consumed by their testimony, including qualification and cross-examination, cannot have exceeded twenty minutes. Other than reference to Heard\u2019s statement that he had been using drugs since the 1940\u2019s, there was a complete absence of testimony about his personal history. Other than conclusory statements to the effect that he was \u201cwithout mental disease or defect,\u201d there was no testimony about his personality structure or mental condition. There was no explanation of the relationship of drug addiction to mental disease.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, there was no meaningful exploration even of Heard\u2019s addiction process. Had the jury been charged on the question of responsibility, it would not have known what was meant by the statement that Heard was addicted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It would not have known what eifect addiction has on mental processes, except in the situation of deprivation, conceded not to have been present.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It would not have known whether addiction is symptomatic of mental disease, what the nature of that disease might be, or how it would bear on the insanity defense. It could not have assessed the adequacy of the psychiatric examination,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or have understood why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>psychiatrists who in other trials stressed the relationship between chronic addiction and disease<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> stated in this trial, in conclusory terms, that Heard had no mental disease or defect. This state of the record makes the court\u2019s holding a very limited one indeed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">This is emphasized by a comparison with Horton v. United States.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There counsel, supported by a research grant, had spent hours in preparation of the defense. The defendant was examined by psychiatrists from public and private practice. They testified about both his addiction and the disordered personality of which they found it symptomatic. The relationship of addiction and disease was thoroughly explored, and the insanity instruction was given as a matter of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">It might be unfair to blame appointed trial counsel in this and other cases for past inadequacies in the presentation of the insanity defense. We must bear in mind that counsel either volunteers or is drafted to serve without compensation and at great inconvenience and cost to himself. \u201c[I]t is very often necessary to appoint lawyers who understandably know little about [criminal] practice, and even less about the special difficulties of presenting the insanity defense. The Bar has responded beyond the call of duty and good will.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> More important, until relatively recent years it had not been made clear that the insanity defense requires behavioral information in depth, and that defense counsel, prosecutor and court have a duty to insure an adequate presentation for an indigent defendant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> New understanding requires abandonment of old practices. It is not necessarily criticism of those who acted in accordance with prior understandings to say that a great deal more than was offered in this case is now required to maintain the integrity of the adversary system.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-9\">.

That is, it points to a medically established, statistically significant likelihood that disease is present. Like any other symptom, it may be misleading in any given case.

The term \u201caddition\u201d has a variety of connotations in the narcotics context, ranging from a simple habit of personal use to a chronic state of physiological as well as psychological need. Chein, <em>The Status of Sociologieal and Social Psychological Knowledge Concerning Narcotics, </em>in Narcotic Drug Addiction Problems (Livingston, Ed., 1963) at 146, 148-49. Some contend that a person is not an addict until he experiences withdrawal symptoms, or accepts \u201caddiction\u201d as part of his personality structure. Lindesmith, Opiate Addiction 67-112 (1957). A common definition is that of the World Health Organization:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\">\u201cDrug addiction is a state of periodic or chronic intoxication detrimental to the individual and to society, produced by the repeated consumption of a drug (natural or synthetic). Its characteristics include: (1) an overpowering desire or need (compulsion) to continue talcing the drug and to obtain it by any means; (2) a tendency to increase the dose; and (3) a psychic (psycho-logic) and sometimes a physical dependence on the effects of the drug (often called habituation).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-14\">The uncontested claims of appellant are that he has been using drugs since the late 1940\u2019s; the psychiatrists testified at trial that he has been an addict since the mid-50\u2019s. The meaning of the distinction was not explored at trial, so it is not possible to know what meaning the experts attached to \u201caddiction.\u201d The depth of a person\u2019s involvement with drugs would certainly be a relevant inquiry where evidence of \u201caddiction\u201d was preferred as bearing on the insanity defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b98-15\">.
