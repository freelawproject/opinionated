The Board argues that petitioner has standing neither to appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>here nor to protest before it since the order, to which petitioner is not a party, does not impair any formal relationship with the subject employer. But standing to appeal an administrative order as a \u201cperson aggrieved,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(f), arises if there is an adverse effect in fact, and does not, as the Board seems to maintain, require an injury cognizable at law or equity. National Coal Ass\u2019n v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n, 89 U.S.App. D.C. 135, 191 F.2d 462 (1951), following Associated Industries of New York v. Ickes, 134 F.2d 694 (2d Cir. 1943); see also Sen.Doc. 248, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. 212, 276 (1946) (Administrative Procedure Act); Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7\u00a7 22.04,22.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Here, the settlement order required the employer to cease and desist from rendering \u201cunlawful assistance\u201d to petitioner, one of two unions which had been vying for representation of its employees. By specifically naming petitioner, the Board in 'effect branded it a \u201csweetheart union,\u201d and thus impaired its organizational abilities. We do not think this effect unduly speculative, and conclude it gives the union sufficient interest for judicial review. _</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">We also think the union has standing before the Board. Although petitioner is not an indispensable party before the Board, and therefore could not exercise a veto power over the proposed settlement, its practical interest in the proceedings entitled it, at the least, to \u201ceither (1) a reasonable opportunity * * * to be heard on its objections or (2) a presentation on the record of reasons for acceptance of the stipulation as the basis for the order notwithstanding [its] objections * * Textile Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO v. National Labor Relations Board (Rozelle Shoe), 111 U.S.App.D.C. 109, 112, 294 F.2d 738, 741 (1961). Here, however, unlike <em>Textile Workers, </em>petitioner is not a charging party. Therefore, the Board\u2019s consideration of the union\u2019s objections may be limited. In the circumstances of this case, it need consider only the union\u2019s \u00abobjections to being specifically named as a union the employer might not unlawfully assist. We remand for the appropriate Board action, noting that we have been shown no important Board interest, such as the \u201cright to settle\u201d, Local 282, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America v. National Labor Relations Board, 339 F.2d 795 (2d Cir. 1964), to support the Board\u2019s claim of right to impute illegal conduct to petitioner, without affording it a chance to rebut that imputation. <em>Cf. </em>Bland v. Connally, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 375, 381, 293 F.2d 852, 858 (1961).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">WILBUR K. MILLER, Senior Circuit Judge, dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-20\">. Petitioner also challenges a provision directing the employer to bargain with its rival. But this claim encompasses charges identical to those petitioner filed with the General Counsel; the General Counsel refused to issue a complaint. We would not entertain a frontal attempt to review the General Counsel\u2019s decision, Retail Store Employees Union, Local 954 v. Rothman, 112 U.S.App.D.C. 2, 4, 298 F.2d 330, 332 (1962), and have not been convinced to review here, through the back door,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
