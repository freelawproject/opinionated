Limitation of petroleum imports was recommended by a special cabinet committee appointed in 1954; inaugurated in 1957 on a voluntary basis with quotas for qualified importers; and instituted on a mandatory basis by Presidential Proclamation No. 3279 of March 10, 1959,* as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The Proclamation fixed the level of petroleum imports and limited quotas to persons with refinery capacity, based primarily on refinery inputs, with limited and declining continuation of the voluntary quotas that reflected importing history.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Section 4(a) of the Proclamation authorized the Secretary of the Interior to \u2022establish an interdepartmental Appeals Board to consider petitions by persons \u25a0affected by the regulations. Section 4(b) provided that the Appeals Board may be \u25a0empowered \u201c(2) [T]o grant allocations \u25a0of crude oil and unfinished oils in special \u25a0circumstances to persons with importing histories who do not qualify for allocations under such regulations.\u201d Oil Import Regulation 1 was issued March 13, 1959, by the Secretary of the Interior as an implementing regulation. (24 F.R. 1907) It established the Oil Import Appeals Board and contained a provision, Section 21(b) (27), authorizing this Board to grant import allocations to persons affected by the regulations, virtually identical with Section 4(b) (2) of the Proclamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-15\">Appellant, having no refinery, petitioned on the basis of the following alleged \u201cimporting history\u201d: In 1944 Atlantic Refining Company entered into an agreement with a company we shall refer to as appellant (strictly, appellant\u2019s predecessor in interest) to drill oil wells on concessions in Venezuela owned by appellant, with each company paying half the operating costs. Atlantic became the owner of one-half of the oil produced, but under the agreement it was also required to purchase whatever portion of appellant\u2019s share of the oil produced the latter did not choose to take. In practice all the oil was purchased by Atlantic, title passing at the wellhead in Venezuela, and Atlantic transported both its own oil and the share purchased from appellant to its refinery in Philadelphia.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-16\">In its 1963 opinion denying appellant\u2019s petition the Board followed an earlier decision it had rendered in another case and held: The express definition of \u201cimporting\u201d in Section 22 of the regulation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> makes it clear that only the person by or for whose account a domestic entry for consumption is made can have an \u201cimporting\u201d history. Even apart from the definition the completion of a sale of oil in Venezuela can not be equated with the domestic import of such oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-17\">Appellant says the Board\u2019s application of the regulation is excessively narrow and mechanical, that appellant was the effective cause of the import made by Atlantic (by declining to take the oil), appellant\u2019s realization depending on the Philadelphia market price, less cost of transport there, and that hence appellant was \u201ceffectively importing\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>oil to the Philadelphia refinery. Appellant glosses over the fact that fluctuations in market price while the oil was in transit to the United States was solely for the account of Atlantic. Even assuming that appellant\u2019s argument rises to the level of being a possible application of the regulation, it falls far short of meeting the burden facing one who seeks to overturn the interpretation and administrative application accorded by an administrative agency, that the interpretation is not reasonable and the application lacks rational foundation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Indeed appellant has an even greater burden than customarily faces litigants since there is nothing about \u201cimporting history\u201d in the underlying enactment, which might provide a predicate for an argument based on Congressional intent. The law confers discretion on the President in broadest terms. It provides that upon a determination that an article being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security, the President \u201cshall take such action, and for such time, as he deems necessary to adjust the imports of such article and its derivatives so that such imports will not so threaten to impair the national security.\u201d (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1862.) Generally \u201cimporting history\u201d was downgraded by the Proclamation as the basis for a quota, in contrast with other approaches deemed in furtherance of current national interest, such as the basic allocation to refiners on the basis of refinery input. The administrative interpretation here challenged is supported by the general presumption of validity and in particular by the fact that the regulation is being interpreted and applied by a board which is an affiliate of, if not identical with, the officer who fashioned the wording.- Bowles v. Seminole Rock Co., 325 U.S. 410, 413-414, 417, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945), Udall v. Talman, 380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S. Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965). Among the factors supporting the administrative application here is the certainty and clarity of administration provided by the ruling assailed as mechanical.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">The Board was not required to inquire into appellant\u2019s particular transactions but any such inquiry does not advance appellant\u2019s cause. The Board spoke in terms of substance and not mere form when it ruled that appellant\u2019s essential position was that of a foreign producer.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">The clause invoked by appellant was the kind of saving clause that an administrative agency may devise not so much to take care of a known problem area as to safeguard against the possibility that there may arise a special meritorious situation not clearly visualized.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">The fact that the term \u201cimporting\u201d may have broader definitions in other contexts <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> certainly does not preclude a narrow definition in the setting of the oil import program. See Towne v. Eisner, 245 U.S. 418, 425, 38 S.Ct. 158, 62 L.Ed. 372 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b854-8\">. Atlantic Refining Co. v.

That case involved an American purchaser of goods, who was acquiring title and dictating the movement into the United States. Pancoastal is the foreign producer, relinquishing title, without authority to require that movement into the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
