The district court held he was the owner of the bankrupt\u2019s accounts receivable, and any moneys paid thereon, free and clear of any claim of appellant Wilshire Oil Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Bankrupt had assigned these accounts to appellant on November 19, 1959, as security for $100,000 in notes representing an indebtedness to Wilshire. Wilshire collected after default on the notes on February 15, 1961. On March 27, 1961, Elliott Oil filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, one year and four months after assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-17\">The notice of assignment was filed November 30, 1959 with the Recorder of Contra Costa County. It was signed by assignor; not by assignee, as required by California law. The district court held the notice of assignment did not comply with California Civil Code \u00a7 3019.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-18\">Appellant urges error on four grounds, reduced to three in argument:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-19\">(1) The assignment <em>did </em>comply with Cal.Civ.Code \u00a7 3019.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-20\">(2) The requirement of \u00a7 3019 that <em>both </em>assignor and assignee sign the assignment is merely directory, not mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-21\">(3) There was a substantial compliance, if not a complete compliance with \u00a7 3019.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-22\">We cannot agree with appellant. California Civil Code \u00a7 3018 refers to assignments of accounts receivable. Three times it requires that the \u201cnotice\u201d is to be filed \u201cas provided in this chapter.\u201d Section 3019 is in the same chapter, and requires the filing, not of the assignment, but of a notice thereof.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The first two numbered paragraphs refer to the <em>assignment </em>itself; the next paragraph to the <em>notice. </em>Two separate docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>ments are involved. By the provisions of \u00a7 3019, if certain acts are omitted in the notice, such omission invalidates the unrecorded assignment (i. e., the notice \u201cshall not be effective\u201d unless (a) the <em>assignment </em>is in writing; (b) if for future accounts, the \u201cgeneral nature of the business\u201d of the assignor and the address given <em>where such business is carried on, </em>and (c) the <em>notice is signed by assignor and assignee, </em>designated as such, with each party\u2019s chief place of business). Other requirements of the <em>notice </em>are not here material.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\"> It is conceded no rule of thumb exists as to what is merely \u201cdirectory\u201d in a statute, and what is \u201cmandatory.\u201d \u201cThe word \u2018shall\u2019 in a statute may sometimes be directory only, whereas the word \u2018may,\u2019 seemingly much less forceful, may be mandatory. Pulcifer v. County of Alameda, 29 Cal.2d 258, 262, 175 P.2d 1 [(1946)].\u201d' Carter v. Seaboard Pin. Co., 33 Cal.2d 564, 573, 203 P.2d 758, 764 (1949). A statute should not be construed as to be rendered meaningless. Ibid. If such language were merely desirable matter, to be included at the option of one party, then it would not be mandatory. Cf. Carter v. Seaboard Fin. Co., supra, at 573, 203 P.2d at p. 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Is the requirement under consideration material or immaterial? Is it a matter of convenience, or substance?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Appellant urges that because it was designated as assignee, adequate notice was given to assignor\u2019s debtors, and hence a characterization of the signature requirement as \u201cdirectory\u201d only would not render the statute ineffective and meaningless. No cases are cited by appellant on this precise point.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Appellee, on the other hand, points out that the requirement that both assignor and assignee sign was inserted not only in \u00a7 3019, but in the Uniform Trust Receipts Act, the Inventory Lien Law of 1957 and the Commercial Code (\u00a7 9402), and that there must have been some legislative purpose in including the provision for double signing in each such statutory enactment. Appellee also asserts that what constitutes \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d should not be passed upon by the courts each time there has been a failure to follow a specific statutory requirement, for the purpose of the enactment is to establish some definite rule and some certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">Unlike \u00a7 3019 (which has no provision for \u201csubstantial performance\u201d to take the place of actual performance), \u00a7 9402(5) of the Uniform Commercial Code permits \u201cminor errors which are not seriously misleading\u201d to be corrected because there has been \u201csubstantial compliance.\u201d In the Uniform Commercial Code\u2019s official comments, there is reference to General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Haley, 329 Mass. 559, 109 N.E.2d 143 (1952) as an example of what is considered a \u201cminor error.\u201d There the name of the company as signed omitted the word \u201cInc.\u201d; otherwise it was correct. To hold that despite such an error there is a \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d does not subvert the statute; it subserves its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">But can this court say as a matter of law that the state legislature could not conclude there was some value to requiring both signatures ? We think not. We think the hypothetical situation described by appellee has merit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The requirement of the notice here attacked serves two purposes: (a) to give notice to the world of the existence of the assignment of accounts; (b) to demonstrate, through recordation of specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>facts, the authenticity of the underlying transaction. The second purpose requires the signature of the assignee. We hold that the statutory language is mandatory and that there has been no substantial compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Nor are we impressed with the argument that there has been compliance because the document recorded was requested to be recorded by a \u201ccover letter\u201d signed by Wilshire Oil Co. This transmittal letter was not recorded, and it is not the purpose of the statutory recording requirements to require one searching the recorder\u2019s office to also search the recorder\u2019s files for unrecorded transmittal letters, assuming such documents are first, retained, and secondly, available to public examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">We agree the holding in the court below correctly expresses the law; that each party\u2019s signature to the assignment of accounts is required because the words of the statute are \u201cexpress, clear, and couched in mandatory language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-10\">. The fourth ground was that a voidable preference was created by appellant\u2019s collections on the account prior to the petition in bankruptcy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-11\">. \u201c3019. <em>Notice; filing; requisites of assignment</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-12\">Notice of an assignment or of intention to assign an account or accounts may be filed in the office of the filing officer. Such notice shall not be effective unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-13\">1.

It aids authentication of the transaction, inasmuch as one would not assume that an assignor would forge the assignee\u2019s signature although the assignor might go so far as to attempt to create a false impression by filing a false notice without securing the signature of the assignee. Why should a creditor of the assignor levy a garnishment on ae-counts receivable if they have already been assigned. If the notice has not been signed by the assignee, the creditor would not be unreasonable in assuming that the assignor is trying to insulate its accounts from his creditors.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Br. p. 10)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
