We did not hold, and we do not mean to imply, that the refund claimed by the taxpayer is, or is not, due. If the Fort Worth Club is to be taxed as a business enterprise, it is, of course, entitled to all the deductions and tax benefits of such an enterprise. The district court, since it allowed the exemption, did not pass on the losses and financial adjustments that the taxpayer now urges. These matters are for the district court to decide on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">In addition, we wish to make a correction in the original opinion. We strike the second paragraph of Section III reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-12\"><em>\u201cWe </em>begin with the general proposition that tax exemptions, except those of charitable organizations, are to be construed strictly.2 Here the legislative history urges a particularly strict construction for the exemption of social clubs. The Corporation Excise Tax Act of 1909,3 imposing the first modern corporate income tax, exempted from tax religious, charitable, and educational organizations \u2018no part of the profit of which inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual, but all of the profit of which is in good faith devoted to the said religious, charitable, or educational purposes\u2019. It was the uses to which their profits were put that earned exemption for charitable corporations. Trinidad v. Sagrada Orden, 1924, 263 U.S. 578, 44 S.Ct. 204, 68 L.Ed. 458.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-15\">In its place we substitute the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-16\">\u201cWe begin with the general proposition that tax exemptions, except those of charitable corporations, are to be construed strictly.2 Here the legislative history urges a particularly strict construction for the exemption of social clubs. The Corporation Excise Tax Act of 1909,3 imposing the first modern corporate income tax, contained a provision exempting \u2018any corporation or association organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, or educational purposes, no part of the net profit of which inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual.\u2019 The Senate debate over this exemption provision reveals plainly the legislators\u2019 awareness that certain organizations they were exempting carried on highly profitable outside business activities. 44 Cong. Record 4149-4157 (1909). It was the uses to which their profits were put that earned exemption for charitable corporations.
