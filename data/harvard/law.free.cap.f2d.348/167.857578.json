We have reviewed the record with care and find no basis for ruling as matter of law that the evidence required a finding favorable to the defendant\u2019s position. It may be that the government is contending for a somewhat unusual order of events, but matters which defendant freely admits show of themselves an unusual situation. The trial was conducted with great consideration for the defendant, the jury was fairly instructed as to the question involved, and we see no ground for complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In this court the defendant engages in the much too popular pastime of scutinizing the transcript and alleging possible errors that had not been noted before. We have, on a number of occasions, stated that we will not consider such matters unless the error was of great magnitude. See Lash v. United States, 1 Cir., 1955, 221 F.2d 237, cert. den. 350 U.S. 826, 76 S.Ct. 55, 100 L.Ed. 738. We would add that the presentation of routine, previously unobjected to matters, often not error at all, as if we had made no such announcement, unduly burdens the court and serves only to cast unmerited reflection upon trial counsel, who normally is in a better position to appraise the propriety and materiality of the conduct subsequently criticized, and presumably purposely did not object. It is also unfair to the court and the public generally if a defendant can have two bites at the cherry by saying nothing and then coming back and asking for a second chance. Cf. Reiss v. United States, 1 Cir., 1963, 324 F.2d 680, cert. den. Jacobs v. United States, 376 U.S. 911, 84 S.Ct. 667, 11 L.Ed.2d 609. Finally, and by no means unimportantly, unless we take the time to review such subsequently discovered \u201cerrors\u201d on the merits, our refusal doubtless has the effect of causing the defendant to feel, quite improperly, that he has been unjustly treated.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">We believe it high time that the bar- realize that we mean what we say in this regard. \u201cPlain error\u201d means precisely that, and \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d must in fact be exceptional. See Silber v. United States, 1962, 370 U.S. 717, 718, 82 S.Ct. 1287, 8 L.Ed.2d 798. Counsel\u2019s attempt to make plain error from any error that can be shown to be of a prejudicial character would make the rule almost meaningless. Error which is not prejudicial at all is not a ground for reversal even if objection has been fully noted. See F.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
