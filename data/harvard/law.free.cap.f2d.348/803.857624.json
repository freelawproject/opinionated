To conclude that a contract term falling within the letter of \u00a7 8(e) properly falls within its prohibition, there must be either a finding that both parties understood and acquiesced in a secondary object for the term, or a finding that secondary consequences within \u00a7 8(e)\u2019s intendment would probably flow from the clause, in view of the economic history and circumstances of the industry, the locality, and the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-10\">\u201cSince, in deciding this case, the Board did not have the benefit of our recently decided cases on work standards clauses, and since it is uncertain whether it would have concluded as it did had it applied the proper standard, we will remand this issue to the Board for reconsideration in the light of the principles announced in this case and the cases herein relied upon.\u201d Meat and Highway Drivers, Dockmen, etc. v. N. L. R. B., 118 U.S.App.D.C. 287, 294-295, 335 F.2d 709, 716-717 (1964). (Emphasis supplied; footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">The Board\u2019s order reopening the record to receive further evidence concerning the union\u2019s object in securing the union standards clause is not responsive to our remand. The Board gave additional subsidiary reasons for reopening the record which may accord with our remand, but since this matter has been in litigation for several years, during which time operation of the work standards clause of the contract has been suspended, we find that the interests of justice require that the clause be allowed to go into effect so that the Board, in a proper proceeding applying the principles announced in our opinion of June 25, 1964, can determine by its operation whether it violates \u00a7 8 (e).
