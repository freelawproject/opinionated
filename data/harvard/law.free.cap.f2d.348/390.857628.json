(hereafter called \u201cNational\u201d) which seeks an \u201carrangement\u201d of its unsecured debts under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 701-799; and (2) the entitlement of the United States to participate in a Chapter XI proceeding as an unsecured creditor to the extent that the debt owing it exceeds the value of its security.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-15\">The referee in bankruptcy below found as fact that at the time of the arrangement hearing, National had assets to-talling $38,650.00 against liabilities amounting to $52,932.94; that a majority (23) of National\u2019s unsecured creditors had filed claims and voted unanimously in favor of National\u2019s petition for arrangement of these debts; and that the SBA had a fully secured lien on all the assets of National for the outstanding balance of a $25,000.00 promissory note which amounted to $18,810.39, plus interest. He conceded that SBA is a governmental agency qualifying for a priority status under \u00a7 64 of the Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 104.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-16\">However, the referee concluded that because the outstanding balance of the SBA loan was in his opinion fully secured by National\u2019s assets, notwithstanding three additional individual guaranties for the debt, the SBA was thereby prevented from participating in a Chapter XI proceeding which is available only to unsecured creditors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-17\">In confirming the arrangement, the referee under \u00a7 337(2) of the Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 737, allowed a priority only for those debts covering his salair and expense, the salary of the appointed receiver or distributing agent, and state and federal taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-18\">Upon review of the referee\u2019s order, the District Court in its reported decision (230 F.Supp. 130 (W.D.Ark.1964)) adopted his findings of fact and conclusions of law in toto. In addition to af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>firming the finding that SBA as a secured creditor was precluded from attacking a Chapter XI arrangement, the District Court noted that since the debtor had not been adjudicated a bankrupt nor had it been alleged that the debtor had committed an act of bankruptcy, SBA could not assert a claim under 31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 191.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">By definition an \u201c \u2018arrangement\u2019 shall mean any plan of a debtor for the settlement, satisfaction, or extension of the time of payment of his unsecured debts, upon any terms.\u201d 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 706(1). Thus, the referee and District Court quite correctly found that a Chapter XI proceeding pertains exclusively to the arrangement of the unsecured claims of common creditors. SEC v. American Trailer Rentals Co., 379 U.S. 594, 605, 85 S.Ct. 513, 13 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965); SEC v. United States Realty &amp; Improvement Co., 310 U.S. 434, 452, 60 S.Ct. 1044, 84 L.Ed. 1293 (1940); Hallenbeck v. Penn. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 323 F.2d 566, 571 (4th Cir. 1963); Chaffee County Fluorspar Corp. v. Athan, 169 F.2d 448 (10th Cir. 1948); In re Tracy, 194 F.Supp. 293 (N.D.Calif. 1961); In re Herold Radio &amp; Electronics Corp., 191 F.Supp. 780 (S.D.N.Y. 1961); 8 Collier, Bankruptcy \u00b62.07 [3] (14th Ed. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">However, the District Court\u2019s adoption of the finding of fact by the referee that SBA was a fully secured creditor lacks substantial evidentiary support and should have been set aside as clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) and Orders 37, 47, General Orders in Bankruptcy, 11 U.S.C.A. foll. \u00a7 53. The only evidence in the record bearing on this issue is the security agreement which National executed with the SBA in order to procure the $25,000.00 loan. This instrument provided that \u201cDebtor hereby grants to Secured Party [SBA] a security interest in all machinery, equipment, furniture and fixtures now owned and hereafter acquired by Debtor for use in Debtor\u2019s business.\u201d This collateral consisted of two trucks and various pieces of business equipment valued by the referee in the inventory of assets at $2,500.00. The security instrument did not purport to give SBA a lien on National\u2019s inventory of merchandise or accounts receivable which together to-talled $36,000.00 and represented practically all of its assets. Thus, from a mathematical standpoint, based on the record evidence, the referee\u2019s finding that \u201cthere is approximately $38,000.00 worth of collateral against the SBA loan of $18,8.10.39\u201d is clearly in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">And there is respectable authority for the proposition that when there is an excess of indebtedness over the security, the creditor to that extent must be deemed unsecured and capable of participating in a Chapter XI proceeding. In re Everick Art Corp., 39 F.2d 765 (2nd Cir. 1930), involved the analogous common law procedure which permitted an insolvent debtor to make an offer of \u201ccomposition\u201d or settlement with his creditors. (See SEC v. American Trailer Rentals Co., supra, 379 U.S. at 605, 85 S.Ct. 513). There the court held that a bankrupt must be deemed to include a secured creditor in his offer of composition with unsecured creditors to the extent that his schedule of indebtedness indicated that the debt exceeded the value of the security. Relying on Everick, the District Court in Wm. H. Wise &amp; Co. v. Rand McNally &amp; Co., 195 F.Supp. 621 (S.D.N.Y.1961), held that a publisher who held copies of a book as security for a customer\u2019s debt could par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>ticipate in a Chapter XI arrangement to the extent that the unpaid portion of the debt exceeded the value of the security. Accord: 9 Collier, Bankruptcy 1T7.05[4].</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"> The giving of personal guaranties by three individuals as consideration for the loan to the corporate debtor did not overcome the lack of security for the entire debt. A creditor is not secured under the bankruptcy laws unless he has security which consists of property of the bankrupt. In re United Cigar Stores Co., 73 F.2d 296, 298 (2nd Cir. 1934). A person making himself secondarily liable for the bankrupt\u2019s debt must himself have a security interest on the bankrupt\u2019s assets for his accommodation to constitute security in the hands of the creditor. 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1(23); 1 Collier, Bankruptcy \u00b61.28. The record of evidence does not show this to be the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">While it was error for the District Court not to permit SBA to participate in the arrangement proceeding for that amount of its loan which exceeded the value of the security, this is not to say that SBA is entitled to a preferred standing over the other unsecured creditors. The right to a priority in a Chapter XI proceeding is controlled exclusively by \u00a7 64 of the Act. See 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 702; In re Chicago Express, Inc., 332 F.2d 276, 278 (2nd Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 879, 85 S.Ct. 146, 13 L.Ed.2d 86 (1964); American Anthracite &amp; Bituminous Coal Corp. v. Leonardo Arrivabene, S. A., 280 F.2d 119 (2nd Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Section 64a(5), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 104, provides that \u201cdebts owing to any person, including the United States, who by the laws of the United States in [sic\u2014 \u2018is\u2019] entitled to priority.\u201d SBA argues that the nature of the debt owed here is given priority under the laws of the United States by virtue of 31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 191, the general priority statute. But under the terms of that statute, a priority is established in favor of the Government as a creditor when, <em>inter alia, </em>an insolvent debtor makes a voluntary assignment of the debt or commits an act of bankruptcy. See footnote 3, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">SBA submits that National\u2019s petition for a Chapter XI arrangement and acquiescence in the appointment of a receiver satisfied both of the above-mentioned requisites of \u00a7 191. It mistakenly relies on authorities dealing with equity receivership proceedings in which the assignee, trustee or receiver was administering all of the property of the insolvent debtor in liquidation of its assets for the benefit of creditors. See People of State of Illinois ex rel. Gordon v. Campbell, 329 U.S. 362, 67 S.Ct. 340, 91 L.Ed. 348 (1946); United States v. Emory, 314 U. S. 423, 62 S.Ct. 317, 86 L.Ed. 315 (1941); People of State of New York v. Maclay, 288 U.S. 290, 53 S.Ct. 323, 77 L.Ed. 754 (1933); United States v. Butterworth-Judson Corp., 269 U.S. 504, 46 S.Ct. 179, 70 L.Ed. 380 (1926); Bramwell v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 269 U.S. 483, 46 S.Ct. 176, 70 L.Ed. 368 (1926). Of course, court appointment of the official to conserve and manage all the debtor\u2019s property under such circumstances would constitute an \u201cact of bankruptcy.\u201d And the transactions of the debtor in some instances might also be tantamount to a \u201cvoluntary assignment\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 191 so as to entitle the Government to a priority for its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">But as pointed out by Mr. Justice Goldberg in SEC v. American Trailer Rentals Co., supra, 379 U.S. at 606, 85 S.Ct. 513, the nature of a Chapter XI proceeding permits the debtor to remain in possession of his property and operate his business under court supervision. The appointment of a receiver is not required, except when deemed necessary. 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 732. The duties of a receiver in an arrangement proceeding are limited. He is primarily a distributing agent for the stipulated amount which the debtor and the unsecured creditors have agreed will be paid into the court during a fixed period in satisfaction of their claims. It cannot be gainsaid that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>a receiver in a Chapter XI proceeding is not the equivalent of a receiver with plenary power over the debtor\u2019s estate in the equity sense. Therefore, appointment of a receiver under Chapter XI to represent the interests of unsecured creditors only with respect to a designated fund should not constitute an act of bankruptcy. 1 Collier, Bankruptcy \u00b63.502; cf. United States v. Schroeder, 204 F.Supp. 199 (S.D.Iowa 1962). We believe the District Court was correct in its conclusion that National did not commit an act of bankruptcy so as to invoke any preferred treatment of SBA\u2019s claim under \u00a7 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">However, the failure to allow SBA\u2019s participation on a parity with the other unsecured creditors to the extent that the loan exceeded the value of the security necessitates that the cause be reversed and remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-10\">.
