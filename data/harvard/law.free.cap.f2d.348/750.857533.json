Elton Cox, defendant in a criminal cause pending in the 19th Judicial District for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, removed the cause to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, Baton Rouge Division. The district court remanded the cause to the state court. Cox applied to this Court for a stay of the remand order pending his appeal of the order. We find that the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>tion states a good claim for removal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(1). We grant the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The allegations of the petition for removal must be .accepted as true for purposes of determining whether the petition states a good claim for removal. These allegations show a \u201cplanned prosecutorial misuse of a [state criminal] statute\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">In 1961 Cox, a Negro minister active in the civil rights movement, was arrested the day following a civil rights demonstration in Baton Rouge. The State indicted Cox on a number of charges, one of which was that he had obstructed justice by demonstrating near the courthouse in violation of Louisiana law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> LSA-R.S. 14:401. The United States Supreme Court reversed all of the convictions. Cox v. State of Louisiana, 1965, 379 U.S. 559, 575, 85 S.Ct. 476, 486, 13 L.Ed.2d 487, 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">As the petition sets forth, in 1965, shortly after the Supreme Court decided Cox v. State of Louisiana the district attorney for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, filed in the original proceeding a new bill of information against Cox, this time charging him with <em>\u201cattempting\u201d </em>to obstruct justice. The bill is based on the identical conduct that in 1961 led to the arrest and conviction of Cox on the charge of \u201cobstructing justice\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">In Cox v. State of Louisiana, the Supreme Court set aside this conviction on the ground that it violated due process of law. The Court found that the \u201crecord here clearly shows that the [police and city] officials * * * gave permission for the demonstration to take place across the street from the courthouse\u201d. The Court stated emphatically that nothing in its opinion should be \u201cinterpreted as sanctioning riotous conduct in any form\u201d. There \u201ccan be no question that a State has a legitimate interest in protecting its judicial system from the pressures which picketing near a courthouse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>might create.\u201d But, on the merits, \u201cunder circumstances such as those present in this case, appellant\u2019s conviction cannot be sustained\u201d; the police and city officials were guilty of \u201can indefensible sort of entrapment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">In the teeth of this holding, the district attorney is renewing the charges against Cox. The State now seeks to prosecute the petitioner for the alleged crime of \u201cattempting\u201d to do what the Supreme Court, <em>on the merits, </em>decided was not a violation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The second prosecution is without any hope of success. The district attorney\u2019s transparent purpose is to harass and punish the petitioner for his leadership in the civil rights movement, and to deter him and others from exercising rights of free speech and assembly in Louisiana \u2014 in this instance, by advocating integration of public accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">A civil complaint asserting such an abuse of the prosecutorial function would state a claim under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and justify injunctive relief. Dombrowski v. Pfister, 1965, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is not a <em>Douglas v. City of Jeannette, Stefanelli, </em>or <em>Cleary v. Bolger </em>situation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here the State, through the parish district attorney, under the guise of protecting the administration of justice, is challenging the Nation on a national policy expressed in the Constitution, carried out by Congress, and validated by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">The general principle, basic to American Federalism, that United States courts usually should refrain from interfering with state courts\u2019 enforcing local laws is unassailable. But the sharp edge of the Supremacy Clause cuts across all such generalizations. When a State, under the pretext of preserving law and order uses local laws, valid on their face, to harass and punish citizens for the exercise of their constitutional rights or federally protected statutory rights, the general principle must yield to the exception : the federal system is imperiled.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">This Court, in many different contexts, has faced up to the reality that a narrowly drawn, non-discriminatory, apparently constitutional criminal law, or other local law, or rule of court, may have been designed to provide a subtle means of discrimination or may be subverted by being unconstitutionally applied. Prompt access to the federal court may be the only relief that will make meaningful to the individual the rights placed in jeopardy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the effect of arrest and prosecution and perhaps a long sentence unfitted to the crime will extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>far beyond the individual defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In these circumstances there is no basis for the application of comity as a principle of federalism.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And no reason for a court to be bound by obsolete standards for determining discrimination prevailing at the time the early removal cases were decided.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">In the context of the removal statute, Section 1443, two recent decisions of this Court are squarely in point and control the instant case, Rachel v. State of Georgia, 5 Cir. 1965, 342 F.2d 336, and Peacock v. City of Greenwood, 5 Cir. 1965, 347 F.2d 679 (June 22, 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Rachel involved prosecutions of sit-in demonstrators under a Georgia anti-trespass statute. The statue was valid on its face and there was no showing that the defendant would not have a fair trial in the Georgia courts. Relying on Hamm v. City of Rock Hill, 1964, 379 U.S. 306, 85 S.Ct. 384, 13 L.Ed.2d 300, we allowed removal under Section 1443(1) on the ground that the effect of prosecuting the demonstrators under the statute would be to deny their civil rights, contrary to a congressional statute, the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Their conduct was federally protected. Judge Tuttle, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-7\">\u201cCongress, while carving out rights and immunities in the area of civil rights, has provided a jurisdictional basis for efficiently and appropriately protecting those rights and immunities in a federal forum. The provision of this protective forum is not limited by the States\u2019 obligation, under the Supremacy Clause, to protect federally guaranteed civil rights as zealously as would a federal court. That there is such an obligation on State tribunals is true, and vital, but it is irrelevant here. Theoretically, there is no need for any federal jurisdiction at all \u2014 except that of the Supreme Court \u2014 because State courts are required to protect federally created rights. Nevertheless, the power of Congress to provide a federal forum also to protect such rights is undoubted. Such power was exercised in enacting \u00a7 1443(1).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-12\"><em>Peacock </em>extended the <em>Rachel </em>principle to a state statute discriminatorily applied, contrary to the United States Constitution. In <em>Peacock </em>the defendants were charged with obstructing public streets in violation of a narrowly drawn Mississippi statute valid on its face. We held that the petition stated a good claim for removal on the ground that if the statute were being applied as alleged, convictions under the statute would violate the equal protection clause. Judge Bell, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-13\">\u201cThe rationale of <em>Rachel </em>is inescapably applicable here, since both cases involve the denial of equal rights through statutory applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>tion, rather than through some infirmity appearing on the face of the state statute. * * * In short, we do not read [Kentucky v. Powers and other early] cases as establishing that the denial of equal civil rights must appear on the face of the state constitution or statute rather than in its application where the alleged denial of rights, as here, had its inception in the arrest and charge. They dealt only with the systematic exclusion question, a question which in turn goes to the very heart of the state judicial process, and federalism may have indicated that the remedy in such situations in the first instance should be left to the state courts. We would not expand the teaching of these cases to include state denials of equal civil rights through the unconstitutional application of a statute in situations which are not a part of the state judicial system but which, on the contrary, arise in the administration of a statute in the arresting and charging process. * * * We therefore hold that a good claim for removal under \u00a7 1443 (1) is stated by allegations <em>that a state statute has been applied prior to trial so as to deprive an accused of his equal civil rights in that the arrest and charge under the statute were effected for reasons of racial discrimination. </em>* * * However, we deal here only with what allegations are sufficient to prevent remand without a hearing. * * * It follows that the District Court erred in remanding these cases to the state court without a hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-13\">Cox\u2019s petition presents a strong case for removal. Once Cox was over the hurdle of the city and police officials\u2019 approval of the location of the demonstration, Cox\u2019s conduct was protected by the Civil Rights Act, as was Rachel\u2019s conduct, and by the equal protection clause of the Constitution, as was Peacock\u2019s conduct. What makes Cox\u2019s petition particularly strong is that apparently the parish district attorney is deliberately attempting to frustrate the protective mandate of the United States Supreme Court. This case therefore presents a sharper challenge to the Supremacy Clause than <em>Rachel </em>and <em>Peacock </em>presented. In addition, in the Georgia cases there was no indication of a prosecution in bad faith and no assertion that the defendants would be unable, as Cox alleges, to vindicate their rights in the state courts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-14\">There is a common denominator in <em>Rachel, Peacock, </em>and <em>Cox: </em>the defec-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>ants, as a result of their actions in advocating civil rights, are being prosecuted under statutes, valid on their face, for conduct protected by federal constitutional guarantees or by federal statutes or by both constitutional and statutory guarantees.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In essence, these guarantees rest on <em>national </em>citizenship, as opposed to <em>state </em>citizenship, not expressly recognized until the three Civil War amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In <em>Rachel, Peacock, </em>and <em>Cox, </em>and in similar cases, there is no federal invasion of states\u2019 rights. Instead, there is rightful federal interposition under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution to protect the individual citizen against state invasion of federal rights.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-8\">. So Justice White describes another groundless prosecution \u2014 Dombrowski v. Pfister, 1965, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22. Cameron v. Johnson, 1965, 381 U.S. 741, 755, 85 S.Ct. 1751, 1759, 14 L.Ed.2d 715, 721. (Dissenting opinion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b799-10\">. The Reverend B. Elton Cox led a civil rights demonstration in Baton Rouge in December 1961 to protest the arrest of 23 students who had picketed stores maintaining segregated lunch counters. In Cox v. State of Louisiana, 1965, 379 U.S. 559, 85 S.Ct. 476, 13 L.Ed.2d 487, the Supreme Court described the. demonstration as \u201can orderly and peaceful march\u201d to a street across from the courthouse in Baton Rouge. The Court noted that the city officials gave permission for the demonstration. When Cox started to make a speech, however, the Chief of Police, considering the speech inflammatory, ordered the demonstrators to disperse. When the crowd did not disperse quickly enough, the police exploded tear gas bombs. The Supreme Court noted that the demonstration was orderly until the police exploded the tear gas bombs. None of the demonstrators were arrested at the time but the next day Cox was arrested and charged with criminal conspiracy, disturbing the peace, obstructing public passages, picketing before a courthouse, and obstructing the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-14\">Cox was tried before a judge without a jury. He was convicted of all but the criminal conspiracy charge. The Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed. 245 La. 303, 158 So.2d 172. The United States Supreme Court set aside the convictions, principally on the ground that the convictions infringed Cox\u2019s rights of free speech and assembly. The Court held that Cox did not, in fact, engage in any conduct which the State could prohibit as a breach of the peace. Cox v. State of Louisiana, 1965, 379 U.S. 559, 85 S.Ct. 476, 13 L.Ed.2d 471, 487 (two cases). Second, the breach of peace statute, on its face, was \u201cunconditionally vague in its overly broad scope.\u201d As to the conviction for obstructing public passages, the Court held that an appropriate statute giving officials a limited discretion would have been proper, but it was \u201cclearly unconstitutional\u201d to allow \u201cunfettered discretion in local officials\u201d. The Court held that the convictions for obstructing justice violated the due process clause because the \u201cuncontradicted evidence\u201d showed that the city officials were guilty of \u201can indefensible sort of entrapment\u201d in that they told the demonstrators that they could meet where they did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b800-7\">. Justice White, commenting on Dombrow-ski, has said: \u201cWhere threats of enforcement are without any expectation of conviction and are \u2018part of a plan to employ arrests, seizures, and threats of prosecution under color of statutes to harass,\u2019 it is obvious that defense in a state criminal prosecution will not suffice to avoid irreparable injury. The very prosecution is said to be a part of the unconstitutional scheme and the scheme, including future use of the statutes, are quite irrelevant to the prosecution in the state courts.\u201d Cameron v. Johnson, 1965, per curiam, 381 U.S. 741, 755, 85 S.Ct. 1751, 1759, 14 L.Ed.2d 715, 721 (dissenting opinion). Justice Black, who also dissented, observed: \u201cDombrowski also indicates to me that there might be cases in which state or federal officers, acting under color of a law which is valid, could be enjoined from engaging in unlawful conduct which deprives persons of their federally guaranteed statutory or constitutional rights.
