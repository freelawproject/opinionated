From an adverse summary judgment he appeals. We affirm upon the third defense pleaded in the Board\u2019s answer, viz., the failure of the complaint to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. F.R.Civ.P. 12(b) (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-17\">We need not pass on the merits of the Fifth, Fourteenth and First Amendment deprivations and abridgement asserted by the appellant, consisting of the Board\u2019s termination of his employment (1.) without a hearing and (2.) because of his instruction from a book which he said had been proscribed by the Board in violation of freedom of speech. Our decision rests entirely on the contract. By its terms Parker was only employed provisionally and wholly without academic tenure, express or implied. The agreement was that his engagement was simply probationary and \u201cthat either of the parties to this contract may terminate it at the end of the first or second school year by giving thirty days\u2019 notice in writing to the other during the month of June or July\u201d. Concededly, the termination complied with this stipulation. We join the District Judge in upholding the Board\u2019s action on this ground. Parker v. Board of Education, 237 F.Supp. 222 (D.C.Md.1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-18\"> Summary judgment, we think . too, was appropriate because the premises underlying the decision were without genuine controversy; they appeared in the contract and other supporting papers with the motion. These included the school statutes of Maryland and by-laws of the State Board of Education as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>as \u201ccertain letters and other documents\u201d submitted by agreement. All of this evidence was proper for consideration on the motion. F.R.Civ.P. 56,12(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
