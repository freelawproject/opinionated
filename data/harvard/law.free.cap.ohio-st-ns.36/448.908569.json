The <em>assent </em>of the shipper to conditions in a bill of lading, or other contract for the carriage of goods, limiting the carrier\u2019s liability, is binding upon him, when the loss happens without fault \u00f3r negligence of the carrier; but such assent will not be <em>\u2022implied </em>or <em>presumed </em>from facts and circumstances which do not clearly show an assent to such conditions in the contract on which the action is founded.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b469-9\">4 In the absence of satisfactory proof, showing that the shipper has, by assent and acquiescence, or otherwise, agreed to limit the liability of the carrier, the presumption is that he intended to insist on his common law rights.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b469-10\">5. Neither usage nor custom, though known to the shipper, which he has not clearly assented to as a condition of the contract of shipment, can be set up to absolve a carrier from his common law liability.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-11\">Error to tbe District Court of Greene County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-12\">This was an action below, by Barrett and Walton, to recover tbe value of lard and meat, wliicb wTas destroyed by fire, while in tbe custody of plaintiff in error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-13\">Only so much of tbe facts as relate to tbe lard need now be stated, as tbe action for tbe meat is not before the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-14\">On February 22, and March 5, 1873, Barrett and Walton delivered to plaintiff in error, a common carrier by rail, one hundred and forty tierces of lard, to be shipped to Colgate <em>&amp; </em>Co., New York, to whom it bad been sold, deliverable on tbe cars at Spring Yalley station, on tbe lino of defendant\u2019s road. On tbe night of March 14, while tbe lard was stored in defendant\u2019s warehouse, awaiting shipment, it was destroyed by an accidental fire, which originated in a drug store adjoining tbe warehouse, and which, without fault or negligence of plaintiff in error, communicated to and destroyed the warehouse and all its contents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-15\">The lard was delivered with instructions for immediate shipment. Nothing remained to be done to it by the shippers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>before being loaded into the cars and sent forward. This was to be done by the railroad company, without any further orders or directions from the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-5\">The claim is, that by this delivery to the carrier at the station, the liability of a common carrier attached, and covered this loss by accidental fire, while the lard was stored in the warehouse awaiting shipment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-6\">There is no complaint that the defendant was guilty of any neglect or default in not forwarding the goods before the fire occurred. It appears that this delay was occasioned by inability of the company, owing to a press of business at that season of the year, to furnish the necessary cars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-7\">' The answer of the company admits its character as a public \u2022carrier of goods, and the receipt, storage and destruction of the lard; but avers that, ever since its road was opened and oper-ated, some twenty-five to thirty years, to the present time, it had been its constant usage and custom, known to plaintiffs, to receive goods for carriage at this and all its other stations, upon the condition alone, that it would not be held to have received the goods until they were actually put on board the cars, and that it would not be liable for loss by fire, not the result of its own or its servants\u2019 or agents\u2019 neglect or default.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-8\">It is averred that, with knowledge of all these things, the lard was delivered and stored in said warehouse <em>\u201c </em>upon the agreement and understanding that defendant should be liable \u25a0only on said conditions,\u201d and that when the goods were loaded upon the cars, a bill of lading was to be issued therefor, in ac\u25a0cordance with said custom, and containing said provisions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-9\">Those conditions material to the case are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-10\">2. \u201c Freight carried by this company must be removed from \"the station during business hours on the day of its arrival, or it will be stored at the owner\u2019s risk and expense; and in the \u2022event of its destruction, or damage from any cause, while in the depot of the company, it is agreed that said company shall not be liable to pay any damage therefor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-11\">3. <em>u </em>It is agreed and is part of the consideration of this contract that the company will not be responsible for .... loss or damage to goods occasioned by providential causes or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>by fire, from any canse whatever, while in transit or at stations.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-5\">7. <em>\u201c </em>The company will not be responsible for accidents or delays from unavoidable causes. The responsibility of this company as a common carrier, under this bill of lading, to commence on the removal of the goods from the depot in the cars of the company, and to terminate when unloaded from the cars at the place of delivery.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-6\">The reply denies such a usage or custom, or knowledge thereof, or that there was an agreement or understanding as alleged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-7\">Upon a trial, there was a verdict for plaintiff, a motion for a new trial, which was overruled, a bill of exceptions taken by defendant, and a judgment which, on error, was affirmed by the district court. It is now sought to reverse these judgments, on the ground that they are contrary to the law and the evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b471-8\"><em>J. J.

Upon a delivery and acceptance of goods, under .the circumstances stated, the common law liability of a common carrier immediately attaches, and if they are lost by fire, while awaiting shipment, the carrier is liable to the same extent as if the goods were in transit, unless his liability has been modified, limited or restricted with the consent of the shipper or owner of the goods. <em>Miriam </em>v. Hartford <em>&amp; New Haven R. R. Co., </em>20 Conn. 354; <em>Trowbridge </em>v. <em>Ghapin, </em>23 Conn. 595; 2 Redfield on Railways, 63, \u00a7 174; <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>21 Ind. 54; <em>Gleason </em>v. <em>Transportation Co., </em>32 Wisc. 85 ; <em>O'Bannon </em>v. <em>Southern Express Co., </em>51 Ala. 481; <em>Grosvenor </em>v. <em>New York Central R. R. Co., </em>39 N. Y. 34; <em>Illinois Central R. R. Co., </em>v. <em>Smyser, </em>38 Ill. 354 ; <em>Burrell </em>v. <em>North, </em>2 Car. <em>&amp; </em>Kir. 680 ; Schouler on Bailments, 381, ch. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">2. But if anything remained to be done to the goods by the shipper before they are ready for transportation, or if any orders,* directions or instructions were to be given before they were to be forwarded, such liability does not attach. <em>Judson </em>v. <em>Western R. R. Co., </em>4 Allen, 520; <em>Moses </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine R. R. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>4 Foster (32 N. H.) 71; <em>Blossom </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>3 Kernan, 573; <em>Michigan Southern R. R. </em>v. <em>Schurtz, </em>7 Mich. 515 ; <em>St. Louis, &amp;c. R. R. </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>39 Ill. 335 ; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>W. &amp; St. R. Railway, </em>15 Minn. 390; <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Lowell R. R., </em>106 Mass. 466 ; <em>Bannon </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>100 Mass. 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">3. The carrier may limit his common law liability for losses happening without his fault or negligence, by a contract, either verbal or in writing. In an action against him as srich carrier, when he has received and undertaken to carry goods, the burden is upon him to establish such modified or limited liability, and to show, that the loss falls within the terms of the agreement. <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>4 Ohio St. 362; <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Union Transportation Co., </em>28 Ohio St. 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">4. The <em>assent </em>of the shipper or owner of goods, to conditions limiting common law liability, is not to be <em>implied </em>or <em>presumed, </em>but in each case of an action for a loss the assent must be shown by competent evidence, as in other cases of contracts. As the carrier is bound to receive and transport all goods offered for a reasonable compensation, subject to all the responsibility incident to the employment, the presumption is, in the absence of proof sufficient to remove it and to fix a different liability, that the shipper intended to insist on his common law right. <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>Merchant Bank, </em>6 How. U. S. 344; <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>4 Ohio St. 376; <em>Adams Express </em>v. <em>Noch, </em>2 Duval, 563; <em>Railroad </em>v. <em>Man. Co., </em>16 Wall. 329.</p>\n<p id=\"Aej\">5. In each case the question is, what are the terms of the contract of shipment ? Are they such as the law prescribes, or such as the parties agreed to ? This being a question of fact, usage or custom cannot be set up to absolve the carrier from his ordinary duties, which public policy, his general undertaking, or his special promise may have bound him to do. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Hiesley, </em>19 Penn. St. 243; <em>McMasters </em>v. <em>Penn. R. R. Co., </em>69 Penn. St. 374; <em>The Sultana </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>5 Wis. 454; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>30 Ala. 608 ; Schouler on Bail. 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">Upon a careful review of the testimony, which consists mainly of the evidence by the plaintiffs themselves, one of whom had for many years been, and was at the time this lard was received, also the agent for the carrier, who received and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>stored the same, and was diligent as such, agent in trying to procure cars for shipping it, we think the allegation in the answer, to the effect that said goods put in said warehouse upon the agreement and understanding that the defendant should not be liable for a loss by accidental fire, was clearly made out. Such being the case, the common law liability is limited by this special agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Where such is the case, there is no rule of law, nor principle of public policy, that forbids the enforcement of the restricted liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\n<em>Judgment of the common fleas &lt;md district court reversed, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
