Tindall, charging a violation of section 33, chapter 8,\u201e title 1, of the crimes act of May 5,1877. This section provides: \u201c Whoever, having received verbal or written notice from any owner of inclosed and improved lands, or any lands the boundaries of which are defined by stakes, posts, water-courses, ditches or marked trees, his agent, or a person in charge thereof, not to hunt thereon, shoots at, kills or pursues with such intent on such lands, any of the birds or game mentioned in sections .twenty-seven, twenty-eight and thirty of this chapter, and whoever shoots at, kills or pursues with such intent any of such birds or game on the lands of another upon which there is set up in some conspicuous place, a board inscribed in legible English characters thus, \u00a3No shooting or hunting allowed on these premises,\u2019 or pulls down or defaces any such board, or the letters thereon, shall be fined,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-5\">Among the birds or game mentioned in said section.28, are \u00a3\u00a3 wild ducks,\u201d and the complaint charged Shannon with shooting and killing wild ducks on the land of Tindall, situate in \u25a0said county, &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-6\">Shannon, having been bound to appear and answer said charge in the probate court, was there tided, convicted and sentenced. On the trial, a bill of exceptions, containing all the testimony, was taken, and upon proceedings in error, in the court of common pleas, said judgment was reversed. To this judgment of reversal, the prosecuting attorney, under sections 38 and 39, chapter 5, title 2, of said act, took exceptions, and the same are now submitted to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-7\">The uncontradicted facts appearing in the bill of exceptions are, in brief: That Tindall was the owner and in possession of a tract of land in said county, bounded on one side by the Sandusky river \u2014 a navigable stream; that Shannon, on October 29, 1877, when the killing of wild ducks was not prohibited by the statute, was in a skiff on the Sandusky river, between the middle thereof and the shore owned by said Tindall, from which position he shot and killed wild ducks swimming in, and flying over the water- between said shore and the middle of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>river; that boards incribed in legible English characters, \u201cNo shooting or limiting allowed on these premises,\u201d were set up in conspicuous places on said shore; and that Shannon had been duly notified by Tindall not to shoot or hunt on his lands. It also appears that the position occupied by Shannon on \u25a0the river was within the limits of navigation as used by boats and other water craft engaged in commerce; and also, that the public generally had been accustomed to fish, and kill wild ducks, in the same location, in and upon the river.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-5\">Upon this state of facts, the state of Ohio seeks the opinion \u2022of this court.

He was in a public highway, made so by law, which the state cannot annul or repeal. The ordinance of 1787 provides that, \u201c the navigable waters leading into the Mississippi and St. Lawrence rivers shall be a common highway, and forever free,\u201d &amp;c. Shannon, then, had a right to be where he was. The ducks were wild, and therefore the property of no person, until captured. Tindall had no property in the ducks. Shannon was not on Tindall\u2019s land nor did any of his acts, in any way, affect the land or property of Tindall. Then where is the violation of the law, or any right of Tindall ? Tindall did not own to the center or middle thread of the stream. <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Shusemire, </em>7 Wall. 272; <em>McManus </em>v. <em>Carmickal, </em>3 Iowa, 38, 39 ; 12 How. Pr. 443.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b446-7\">McIlvatne, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay_\">This cause, and <em>June </em>v. <em>Purcell, </em>decided at this term and reported <em>ante, </em>396, having a question in common, were considered together. In that case it was-held, that the title of a riparian owner of land bounded by a navigable stream in this state, extended to the middle or thread of the stream. It follows, upon the principle announced in that case, that the <em>locus </em>of the offense alleged in this, though upon the surface of a navigable stream, was within the boundaries of Tindall\u2019s land, and was embraced within the literal meaning of the notice, \u201cNo shooting or1 hunting allowed on these premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">It is true, however, that the right of Tindall to so much of his lands as was covered by the waters of the Sandusky river, the same being a navigable stream, was not exclusive, but. subject to the right of the public to use the same as a highway, so that the entry of Shannon within the boundaries of Tindall\u2019s premises, to wit, within the limits of this public highway, did not, <em>per se, </em>make him a trespasser; and clearly, an action against him for trespass <em>guare clausum fregit, </em>could not be maintained.' Hence, it was claimed by defendant, that his conviction was wrong, because, as is claimed, this-section of the statute applies only to persons who wrongfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>break and enter tbe close of another contrary to his expressed will.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The provisions of the statute were not intended to punish trespassers <em>guare elcvusum fregit, </em>merely because they may have been guilty of a trespass ; but were intended to punish the act of killing, shooting at, or pursuing game on the lands of another, against which notice may have been given as provided in the statute; so that a person rightfully on the premises of another may commit the unlawful act, as well as one who commits a trespass by entering upon the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">It seems to us, that whatever change this statute may have made in respect to the law in relation to trespass on real property, the main purpose of the legislature was to confer upon the owner of lands within this state the exclusive right to hunt and kill the designated game upon his own premises, and to protect him in such right, provided- he complies with the prescribed conditions in regard to notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">And with regard to notice, if the lands be \u201c inclosed and improved,\u201d or if the boundaries be \u201c defined by stakes, posts, water-courses, ditches or marked trees,\u201d verbal or written notice \u201c not to hunt thereon,\u201d will bring the offender within the operation of the statute. And where a water-course, for instance, a navigable stream, constitutes a boundary, it is the opinion of a majority of the court, that all persons who have received verbal or written notice not to Imnt upon the lands of the owner, are bound to take notice that his lands extend to the middle of the water-course, if such be the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">But if the lands be not <em>\u201c </em>inclosed and improved,\u201d or if they be not \u201c defined by stakes, posts, water-courses, ditches or marked trees,\u201d as well as where they are so defined, the owner may bring himself and his lands within the protection of the statute by setting up, in some conspicuous place thereon, \u201c a board inscribed in legible English characters thus, No shooting or hunting allowed on these premises.\u201d And in such case, all persons engaged in shooting at, killing or pursuing the designated game, must take notice, not only of the statute, but of the setting up of such board, and also of the extent or boundary of the lands on which the same is set up. And in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>respect to this notice, it makes no difference whether the lands \u25a0or any part thereof be covered by water or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">It is claimed,' however\u2019, that this statute was not intended to protect lands covered by the waters of a navigable river. A majority of the court can see no grounds upon which lands covered by navigable streams should be excluded. They are as much the subject of private ownership as unnavigable streams. There is no distinction between them made by the terms of the'statute. True, navigable streams, in this state, are \u25a0declared to be public highways ; but the right to use a public, highway is not abridged by protecting the owner of the fee in the exclusive right of killing game therein. Travel and commerce are not thereby hindered. And as the power of the legislature to protect game, or the exclusive right of the owner \u2022of\u2019land to kill the same on his own. premises, is as ample over land covered by water, whether navigable or innavigable, as it is over dry land, and as there is no attempt to distinguish between them in this statute, we must hold that all alike are within the protection of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustamed.</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b448-7\">White, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AXC\">did not concur. He was of opinion that the .statute, being penal, must be strictly construed, and that it did not embrace game found upon the open public highways.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
