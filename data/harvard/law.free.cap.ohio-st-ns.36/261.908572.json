Where the property of a firm, including the good-will, was purchased by one of the members for a gross sum, the consideration named in a deed for the couveyance of the real estate, which was inserted by counsel for the mere purpose of determining the revenue stamp required, does not destroy or sever the entirety of the consideration for the purchase, as fixed by the contract of sale.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b281-8\">'2. In an action by the purchaser of the good-will of a firm, for a breach of the contract of sale, the measure of damages is not the amount of improper solicitation of the customers of the old firm, irrespective of its effect upon the business of the purchaser.

And the plaintiff says that the said business had\u2019 grown up and become extensive, and the name of said firm had. 'become favorably and well known in the community. And the said firm had trade-marks and brands, that lia'd become-well known in the trade, and had a line of consignors of\u2019 petroleum and coal oils, who relied upon the business reputation and standing of said firm as an inducement for consignment to said firm for sale of large amounts of petroleum and coal oils manufactured by said consignors. And the said firm had introduced into the market and had made known the oils-so consigned to them by the brands and names of the manufacturers, and had built up a large and extensive and profitable-trade in, and market for said oils, as well as for the stearine- and lard oils manufactured by the said firm of Burckhardt &lt;&amp;: Co. And the said firm had employed and instructed divers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>persons who had become skilled and experienced in the different departments of the business conducted by the said firm,, and had acquired the good-will and favor of shippers and con-' signors of said merchandise, and the confidence and custom of consumers and dealers therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\">\u201c The plaintiff further says that the said -business was carried on in premises owned by said firm, to wit: lots Nos. 224, 225, 226, and 227, being eighty feet in front on the west side of Sycamore street, between Third and Fourth streets, and running back to-Hammond street, in said city of Cincinnati, with the buildings thereon, and with the furniture, fixtures, machinery, and utensils used in said business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-6\">\u201c The plaintiff further says, that about the 16th day of October, 1871, the defendant and this plaintiff mutually agreed to dissolve the said partnership, and thereupon the said defendant, Leopold Burckhardt, in consideration of the sum of forty-five thousand dollars, sold and conveyed his interest in the said premises and real estate to this plaintiff, and in consideration of the further sum of thirty-three hundred and forty and 13-100 dollars, sold and conveyed his interest in the merchandise belonging to the said firm to this plaintiff. And in consideration of the further sum of thirty-eight thousand dollars, he sold and conveyed to this plaintiff the good-will of the said business theretofore done and carried on by said firm in said firm name, and stipulated and agreed with this plaintiff that he, the defendant, should not thereafter do business by or under the name of Burckhardt &amp; Co. in the city of Cincinnati aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-7\">\u201c And the plaintiff further says, that at the time aforesaid, in part payment of the said consideration, he, the said plaintiff, executed and delivered to the defendant his two negotiable promissory notes, dated October 28, 1871, payable respectively in one and two years from the date thereof, each of said notes for the sum of twenty-nine thousand three hundred and forty and 50-100 dollars ($29,340.50), and on the same day this plaintiff executed and delivered to the defendant a mortgage upon the real estate and premises hereinbefore described, to secure the payment of said notes. And the balance of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>purchase-money this plaintiff then and there paid to the defendant in cash. And this plaintiff has ever since continued to carry on the said business at the same place and under the said firm name of Burckhardt <em>&amp; </em>Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">\u201c And the plaintiff further says, that immediately thereafter, the defendant, in' violation of his said agreement and of the terms of said sale to this plaintiff, and for the purpose of injuring this plaintiff, entered into the business of receiving and selling petroleum and coal oils and of stearine and lard oils in the city of Cincinnati, under the name and style of \u2018L. Burckhardt &amp; Co.,\u2019 and has ever since continued the same, and held himself out -to the community, and to the persons engaged in trade with the said original firm of Burckhardt &amp; Co., as the successor to said firm. And the defendant has caused bill-heads, cards, circulars and brands to be made and printed in imitation of the bill-heads, cards, circulars and brands of the said original firm of Burckhardt &amp; Co., that were calculated and intended to deceive the public and the customers and consignors, and those who had theretofore dealt with the said firm of Burckhardt &amp; Co., and to induce them to believe that he was carrying on and continuing the business of said original firm of \u2018 Burckhardt and Co.,\u2019 and the defendant, by promise of reward and otherwise, enticed away the employees of said firm, who were employed and instructed by said firm and acquainted with their customers and trade, and held out and represented to the consignors of oils to said firm and to the customers thereof, that he wras entitled to do the said business, and in every possible manner attacked, injured and destroyed the good-will of the business that he had so sold and conveyed to this plaintiff, whereby the good-will of said business was wholly destroyed and rendered of little or no value to tiie plaintiff. And the plaintiff avers that the consideration of said sale and of said promissory notes to the extent of the sum paid for the good-will of said business, and the exclusive right to said firm name, has thereby wholly failed and been lost to this plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-6\">\u201c The plaintiff therefore prays that the defendant may be restrained from negotiating or .transferring the said promissory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>notes and mortgage. That they may be required to be brought into court, and, to the extent of the sum paid for the good-will \u25a0of said business and the exclusive right to said firm name, that they may be adjudged to be canceled by the court, and ordered to be so far satisfied; and for all other proper relief in the premises to which the court may find this plaintiff \u2022entitled.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-5\">To this pleading the plaintiff, Leopold, filed the following reply:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-6\">\u201c The plaintiff, for reply to the petition filed in another action by the defendant against him in this court, No. 29,017, and which by order of the court, he is required to take as the defendant\u2019s answer in this action, says it is true that the firm of Burckhardt &amp; Co., therein mentioned, did receive and deal in con\u25a0signments of refined petroleum and carbon and lubricating \u25a0oils, but that their principal business, from which their profits and good-will were mainly derived, was the manufacture and \u25a0sale of lard oil and stearine. And it is true that in the dissolution of said firm and the sale by him to the defendant of their stores and factory and the chattel property used therein, the good-will and exclusive use of their firm name was also included, but it was with the reservation, clearly expressed in .said agreement and sale, that plaintiff should have the right to \u2022carry on the same business in the city of Cincinnati, either in his own name or in any name and style other than that of Burckhardt &amp; Co.,\u2019 and the true agreement in that respect is not set forth in the defendant\u2019s said petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-7\">\u201c Plaintiff denies that the good-will and use of the firm name was sold and conveyed by him to the defendant for the consideration of $38,000, or for any specific or several consideration, .and denies that the two promissory notes and mortgage, which were made to him by the defendant and referred to in his said petition, were made upon any such agreement, intent or understanding. But on the contrary he alleges, and the defendant well knows, that the said two notes, which are for the sum of $27,666.66 each, and not $29,340.50 as stated in said petition of defendant, and are dated October 25th and not October 28th, were executed and delivered to him by \u00bbthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>defendant as part of the price of $83,000, then agreed to-be paid by the defendant as the consideration for the sale and conveyance to him, in gross, of the plaintiff\u2019s share or half of the said stores and factory, and the machinery, utensijs, furniture, packages and chattels used by said firm in carrying on their business, it being also agreed that in the conveyance-thereof the good-will and exclusive use of the name of said firm, subject to the right of plaintiff, as already stated, to do business in his own name or in any other than the name of Burckhardt <em>&amp; </em>Co., should be included therein; and the said price of $83,000-was paid by the defendant, one-third in cash, and the other two-thirds by his said two notes for $21,666.66 each, made to .the plaintiff, and payable with interest in one and two years from, their date respectively.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-5\">\u201c Plaintiff further replying, says, that some months after the-said dissolution and sale he entered into and is still engaged in business as a commission merchant in said city of Cincinnati, dealing chiefly in refined petroleum and carbon and lubricating-oils, and although he had full right to use the name and style-of L. Burckhardt <em>&amp; </em>Co., if he had chosen so to do, in carrying on said business, yet he has purposely refrained from so doing, and has conducted his business under the name and style Of Leopold Burckhardt <em>&amp; </em>Co. He denies that he has enticed away any employee of said firm, or used the name and style of Burckhardt &amp; 'Co., or used or imitated the bill-heads, cards, circulars or brands of said firm, or in any manner held himself out to the community or to.persons formerly dealing with said-firm of Burckhardt <em>&amp; </em>Co., as the successor of said firm, or committed or used either or any of the acts or practices alleged, in the defendant\u2019s said petition, or has been guilty of any act. or conduct, as therein charged, calculated or intended to deceive the public and the customers^ and consignors, and those-who had previously dealt with said firm. He denies the pretense in the defendant\u2019s said petition, that he, the plaintiff, is-not entitled to carry on or compete with the defendant in the same business in which the said firm of Burckhardt <em>&amp; </em>Co. had previously been engaged; and that he entered into business for th^ purpose of injuring the defendant. He denies that he has, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>at any tim'e or in any manner, as charged by the defendant,, violated the stipulations or articles of his said agreement with, the defendant, or either or any of said articles and stipulations, lie alleges that he has not since their dissolution been engaged in the manufacture of lard oil and stearine, although fully entitled so to do, and has left all advantage thereof thus far to the-defendant; and the defendant\u2019s charge that he, the plaintiff, has- \u2018 wholly destroyed and rendered of little or no value \u2019 the goodwill so sold and conveyed by him to the defendant is wholly unfounded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-5\">\u201c Plaintiff denies each and all charges alleged against him in the defendant\u2019s petition and not herein otherwise answered,, and prays judgment against the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-6\">On the trial, at the January term, 1875, the following findings and decree were entered:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-7\">\u201c This cause coming on to be heard upon the pleadings and! the testimony, as certified by the judge at special term, and the argument of counsel, and the court being fully advised in. the premises, finds the issues joined for the defendant, and further finds that, on the 16th day of October, 1871, the plaintiff and the defendant made the following agreement in writing,, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-8\">\u201c \u2018Whereas, Leopold Burekhardt and Frederick' Burekhardt. are partners as Burekhardt &amp; Co., now, therefore, they mutually agree, each with the other, to dissolve the said partnership, upon the following terms and conditions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-9\">\u2018\u201c1.

The italicizing above indicated being as in the original.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-6\">\u201cThe court further finds that, on the 26th day of October, 1871, Frederick Burckhardt bid $166,000 for the property, under such agreement, and became the purchaser, and liable to pay Leopold therefor $83,000, as stipulated in the agree: ment. Leopold, by a general warranty deed, conveyed his undivided half of the real estate to Frederick for the consideration expressed in the deed, of $45,000, which would make the entire realty $90,000. This value was fixed, in order to affix the proper revenue stamp upon the deed \u2014 the federal law, at that time, requiring a deed for real estate to be stamped according to the actual value of such realty. This, as there is no evidence of a greater value, must be taken as the true value of Leopold\u2019s half of the real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-7\">\u201cThefixtures, machinery, &amp;c., were invoiced (valued) by the parties at $5,800, and the furniture at $200, making $6,000 for them, or $38,000 for Leopold\u2019s half of all the partnership property, other than the real estate proper, sold by him to Frederick under the agreement, which left $35,000 for \u2018 the good-will of the business\u2019 theretofore \u2018done and canned on by said firm in said firm-name,\u2019 and for Frederick\u2019s right thereafter to the exclusive use of the old firm-name of Burckhardt. <em>&amp; Go. </em>Leopold\u2019s half of such good-will and interest in the old firm-name, and his half of such fixtures, machinery, &amp;c., he, for the sum of $38,000, conveyed to Frederick, by another writing, bearing date October 25, 1871. It reads:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-8\">\u201c\u2018Be it remembered, that in consideration of thirty-eight thousand dollars ($38,000) to me paid by Frederick Burckhardt, in pursuance of the agreement between us, dated October 16, 1871, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, I, Leopold Burckhardt, do hereby sell, assign and set over to the said Frederick Burckhardt, my moiety, and all the right, title and interest to me belonging, of, and in all the fixtures, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>machinery, utensils, furniture, packages, and chattels heretofore used by us, as partners, under the style and firm of Burckhardt <em>&amp; </em>Co.; also, the good-will of said partnership and business, subject to the reservation in that behalf stipulated in said \u2022agreement.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-5\">\u201c There can be no doubt, then, that the value fixed by the parties, themselves, upon the good-will and the right to use 'the old firm-name of Burckhardt <em>&amp; </em>Co., was $70,000, for the half of which, $35,000, Frederick agreed to pay Leopold. We find that was the amount. We further find that the notes \u2022and mortgage set forth in the petition and supplemental petition were executed in pursuance of said agreement, for two-thirds of the purchase price of said property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The court further find and hold :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-7\"><em>\u201cFirst. </em>That Frederick purchased from Leopold the latter\u2019s half of the real estate, fixtures, machinery, &amp;c., the good-will \u2022of <em>the business </em>theretofore carried on by the old firm, in the name of Brrrckhardt <em>&amp; </em>Co. (and not merely the good-will attaching to the premises upon which such business had been so \u2022carried on), and the exclusive right thereafter to the use of the.name of <em>\u2018 </em>Burckhardt &amp; Co.\u2019 as his trade-mark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-8\">\u201c <em>Second. </em>That he bid for and purchased them all for $83,000, and that Leopold has failed to give him, or has daprived him of the exclusive benefit, use and enjoyment \u2022of such good-will and such firm-name of Burckhardt &amp; Co.; that the real estate sold by Leopold was only of the value \u2022of $45,000, the fixtures, machinery, furniture, &amp;c., $3,000, \u25a0and that $35,000 was the value of such good-will and firm-name as a trade-mark, as fixed by the parties in this transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-9\">\u201c <em>Third. </em>Whether, in point of fact, Leopold is entitled to recover from Frederick no part of such sum of $35,000, or whether he is entitled to recover part of it, and, if so, what part, we do not now undertake to' determine.

The motion was overruled and a bill of exceptions taken embodying all the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-6\">The way $15,000 came to be inserted in the deed as the \u25a0consideration for the real estate, appears from the following statement of Rufus King, which was received on the trial as \u25a0evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The bidding, which took place October 25, 1871, at the \u2022office of Messrs.

When drawing the conveyance of their factory and stores, I suggested to Mr. Kittredge that Leopold Burekhardt ought not to be required to pay the stamp tax upon this entire sum, and suggested that the land and buildings be estimated at $90,-000, and with his consent, I put the consideration of the deed at half that sum, viz., $15,000. Subsequently, in drawing the transfer of the fixtures, machinery, chattels, good-will, &amp;c., by another instrument, I assumed the remainder of the entire price, viz., .$38,000, as the consideration. There was no apportionment or estimate as to the value of the good-will. Nothing was said about it in this division of the price of $83,000. This severance was entirely my own suggestion, and merely for the purpose of \u25a0avoiding the unnecessary excess of stamps to be put upon the deed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-8\">The following order was also entered for the government of the master:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>\u201c In the matter of the application of the master, to whom this case was referred for instructions, he is instructed to admit and receive such testimony upon the questions referred tollina as he may find to be competent, and to j&gt;ermit the parties to take exceptions to his rulings thereon, as they may be advised.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-5\">Among other findings of fact not necessary to be noticed,, the master\u2019s report shows the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-6\">\u201c 1.

It. cannot be cut up into fragments. It is not susceptible \u00f3f division or apportionment. It is all there or it is all gone. We do not claim that the solicitation of one or two or five of the old customers, or engaging in competition for their trade, is a destruction of the good-will. We are referring to open, general, active competition, such as Leopold engaged in. There-is no such thing as parceling out or dividing up the good-will, in that case. It is not a case for arithmetical or mathematical computation. A court of equity will look at all the circumstances, and decree accordingly. Upon the findings by the court, or upon the findings by the master, the equity of this-case is, we confidently submit, that Leopold is not entitled to-recover any part of the compensation he was to receive for his interest in the good-will. <em>Foulke </em>v. <em>Harding, </em>13 Pa.

Whether the plaintiffs interest in the firm, including the good-will, was sold to the defendant as an entirety ?</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">2. Whether the court erred in overruling the exceptions to the report of the master ?</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">3. Whether the petition of the defendant, which the court ordered to stand as his answer and counter-claim in this case, is available as a counter-claim ?</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">As to the first question. We think this must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">By the agreement the property, including the good-will, was required to be put up, bid for and sold as <em>\u201c </em>a going concern\u201d to the highest bidder. The party buying was to pay one-half of the price bid, to his copartner, one-third cash, and the balance in equal notes bearing six per cent, interest, payable in one and two years, secured by mortgage upon the real estate-. The defendant became the purchaser, and performed the agreement on Ms part by the payment of the cash and the execution of the notes and mortgage to the plaintiff, for one-half of the purchase-money. The plaintiff gave the defendant the exclusive possession of the concern and conveyed and transferred to him the property purchased. The consideration was entire for all that was purchased ; and there was no separation, in the contemplation of the parties, of the good-will from the other property.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">The execution of the deed was not intended to vary the contract of sale. The consideration named in the deed was inserted by counsel, in order to satisfy the revenue laws in regard to stamps, and for no other purpose. It did not operate to destroy or sever the entirety of the consideration for the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>chase, as fixed by the contract. The court,- therefore, erred in regarding the sum named in the deed as- an apportionment by the parties of the consideration received by the vendor; and in making it the basis from which to infer that they also agreed upon a separate value for the good-will.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">As to the second question. The court erred in sustaining the report of the master. The master ruled that the measure of damages was the actual <em>amoimi of improper soUoitation </em>of customers of the old house, and not the loss of business caused by such solicitation. Hence, he excluded all testimony offered to prove the extent of the loss of business from that cause. Upon the theory adopted by the master ineffectual solicitation was as injurious and as much the basis of recovery as that which was effectual; and consequently that the damages would be the same where there had been improper solicitation and no change in the business, as it would be where the business had been destroyed. The damages should be measured by the injury sustained, and not by the ineffectual attempts to injure.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">As to the third question. The pleading ordered by the court to stand as an answer and counter-claim, was not, originally, intended as a counter-claim. It was drawn as a petition in another action, and was founded upon the alleged right to have a cancellation of the notes to the extent of $35,000. In our view no such right existed; but if it had it might have been asserted by way of counter-claim in the action brought to foreclose the mortgage. The counter-claim to which the defendant was entitled was one for damages only. There was no failure of consideration, in the proper sense of the term, which could be available as a <em>mere </em>defense. The defendant\u2019s claim for damages might have been enforced in an independent action; or he might assert it by way of counterclaim in the action brought against him. The claim was founded on the contract in part performance of which the mortgage was given, and was thus connected with the subject -of the action. But in whichever form of proceeding the claim is sought to be'enforced the measure' of damages would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>he tlie same; nor would the defendant\u2019s measure of redress have been varied if the consideration for the purchase had been fully paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Time, the pleading does not state any specific sum as the' \u25a0damages sustained. It does state the facts constituting a cause \u2022of action for which damages are recoverable, and asks that the notes be satisfied and canceled to a specified extent, and \u201c for .all other proper relief in the premises to which the court may find\u201d the party entitled. .After issue and trial, we do not think the informalities in the pleading as a counter-claim constitute grounds for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The difficulty arose from the improper consolidation of the .actions, and making the petition in one the substitute for a counter-claim in the other. The provision, of the code in regard to the consolidation of actions applies only where they .are prosecuted on behalf of the same plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">We see no objection to the account being taken before a master, if the court so orders. The action was an equitable \u2022one, brought solely to foreclose a mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The defendant, under the code, was authorized to set up in his answer a counter-claim, whether it was of a legal or an \u2022equitable nature. By setting it up in an equitable action, it became the subject of equitable jurisdiction. And it is a principle of equity that when the jurisdiction of the court attaches, it is authorized to go on-and do complete justice between the parties, although in accomplishing this result it may decree on matters cognizable at law. <em>Buckner </em>v.
