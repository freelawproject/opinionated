But it is not necessary to the existence of intemperate habits, that the excessive use of intoxicating liquor should be continuous and <em>daily, </em>and an instruction to the jury, that a continuous and daily use of intoxicating liquor is necessary to constitute such a habit, is erroneous.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-6\">Error to the Superior Court of Cincinnati.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-7\">The action below was founded upon a policy of insurance upon the life of Charles Reif, who died October 19, 1872. The policy was dated July 22, 1872, and was for the sole and separate use of the mother of the insured, who is the plaintiff in the action, in case she survived him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-8\">Several defenses were specially pleaded, upon which issue was joined and evidence submitted, one only of which is noticed by the court in its opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-9\">One of the conditions upon which said policy was issued was, that:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-10\">\u201c <em>Sixth. </em>The apjilication herefor shall form and be a part of this policy; and if any statement made therein, or in the medical examiner\u2019s certificate accompanying it, by the applicant, or the person whose life was to be insured, <em>shall be found witr\u00fae, in any respect, </em>then this policy shall be null and void.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-11\">It is averred that the following answers made by Charles Reif in his application, were false and untrue:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-12\">\u201c Has the party whose life is to be insured ever been intemperate?\u201d Answer: \u201cNo.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-13\">\u201cIs the party now of* correct and temperate habits?\u201d Answer: \u201cYes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Appended to said application was an agreement of the applicant, that if there was any untrue or fraudulent allegation contained therein, which application it was also agreed should form and be a part of the policy, or if anything material or important affecting the risk applied for, which the company ought to know, has been concealed, withheld or omitted, the policy and all moneys paid thereon were to be forfeited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-5\">Evidence was offered in support of this defense. This evidence tended strongly to prove that prior to and at the date of said application the applicant was in the habit, of being intemperate \u2014 of periodically getting drunk, though there were times and occasions of longer or shorter duration during which he was duly sober.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-6\">In view of this testimony counsel for plaintiff in error requested the court to charge as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-7\">\u201c 9. The court charges you, that if Charles Reif was <em>addicted, </em>before July 16, 1872, to <em>periodical spreeing or getbmg drxmh, </em>and the insurance company, its agents, and examining physician were ignorant of, such fact when the insurance was effected and the premium paid, the policy is void, and your verdict must be for the defendant, even though there were periods of longer or shorter duration in which he was duly sober.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-8\">Also: \u201c 11. The court charges you, that Charles Reif was not of correct and temperate habits, if, at said time (the 16th day of July, 1872), and for a period before that sufficiently long to <em>beget a, habit, he was in the h\u00e1bil of period/icalby getting drxmh, even though there were times and occasions of longer or shorter duration'in which he was duly sober.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-9\">Each of the foregoing requests were offered separately and refused, and exceptions taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-10\">Upon this subject the court charged as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-11\">\u201c The first and second of these answers which, it is claimed, avoids the policy, are given- to question 5 in said application. Said question is as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-12\">\u201c Has the party whose life is to be insured ever been intemperate? To which Charles Reif answered, \u2018No.\u2019 And also, Is the party now of <em>correct </em>and temperate habits. To which said Charles Reif answered, \u2018 Yes.\u2019 It is obvious that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>these inquiries are not whether the person whose life is to be insured was ever drunk, or whether he ever used intoxicating drinks; but whether he has ever been intemperate, <em>that is, whether, at any period of his Ufe, his usual and daily habits were such as to constitute and render him what is hnown as an intemperate mam, </em>\u2014 a <em>man habitually under the influence of too great an amount of intoxicating liquor. </em>They do not relate to the question whether the applicant habitually uses intoxicating drinks, for he may do this and yet be1 a temperate man; but whether, at any period, or at present, he habitually used, or now uses, intoxicating drinks to such excess as to make him an intemperate man. If you find, <em>from </em>the testimony^ that Charles Reif did so <em>habitually </em>use intoxicating drinks to excess, then the plaintiff cannot recover in this case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-5\">The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff below. A motion for a new trial was overruled and after a judgment was rendered it was affirmed in general term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-6\">A reversal is now sought on several grounds, and among them for error, in charging and refusing to charge as above stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b618-7\"><em>Sayler ds Sayler, </em>for plaintiff in error :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-8\">The charges requested and refused by the court on the subject of intemperance were correct propositions and charges, and should have been given as requested.'

Nelson, </em>for defend- and in error, claimed that the charge of the court on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>subject of intemperance was correct, and cited <em>Insurance Co. v. Holterhoff, </em>4 Bigelow, 377; <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>4 Bigelow, 461; <em>Van Valkenburg v. Ins. Co., </em>70 N. Y. 606; <em>Mowry v. Ins. Co., </em>9 R.

Erom it the jury might well understand, and in view of the whole evidence, we think, may reasonably have understood, that Charles Rief was of correct and temperate habits, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>although it was his habit to get drunk periodically and frequently, with sober intervals of longer or shorter duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The habit of using intoxicating liquors to excess is the result of indulging a natural or acquired appetite, by continued use, until it becomes a customary practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">This habit may manifest itself in practice by daily or periodical intoxication or drunkenness.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Within the purview of these questions it must have existed at some previous time, or at the date of the application, but it is not essential to its existence that it should be continuously practiced, or that the insured should be daily and habitually under the influence of liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Where the general habits of a man are either abstemious or temperate, an occasional indulgence to excess does not make him a man of intemperate habits. But if the habit is formed of drinking to excess, and the appetite for liquor is indulged to intoxication, either constantly or periodically, no one will claim that his habits are temperate, though he may be duly sober for longer or shorter periods in the intervals between the times of his debauches.</p>\n<p id=\"A_T\">In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Mutual Benefit Ins. Co., </em>34 Iowa, 222, the insured was shown to be a man who indulged in a periodical habit of driuking to excess, and protracting these debauches until liis strength was exhausted. These excesses were not of long duration, and were followed by seasons of sobriety which would last for mouths. In one of these debauches, he died of <em>delirium tremens. </em>It was held he died from intemperance. Who would say that such a man wras of temperate habits? Such a habit of intemperance is quite as material to the risk, and equally as much within the terms of this policy, as the habit, of daily intoxication. Indeed, high medical authority is not wanting to show that periodical drunkenness, the result of an uncontrollable appetite, is generally much more excessive, and therefore more dangerous, than daily habitual intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">But it is claimed that the latter part of this charge cures any error that may exist, caused by the use of the word \u201c daily,\u201d in the first part. We think not. The concluding sentence: \u201cIf you find from the evidence that Charles Reif did <em>so habitually </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>use intoxicating drinks to excess, then the pla\u2019ntiff cannot recover,\u201d referred the jury back to the definition, wherein they are told that if his usual <em>cmd daily </em>habits were to be under the influence of liquor, he could not recover, and was not a modification, but a? reiteration of the error.</p>\n<p id=\"AbR\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause rema/ndedfor a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
