The \u2022defendant set up title acquired by purchase and adverse enjoyment to the interest claimed by the plaintiff, alleged actual possession in himself, and prayed to have his title quieted. 'The reply admitted possession in the defendant, but denied the remaining allegations of, the answer. In the common pleas the plaintiff had judgment, from which the defendant, Heffner, appealed to the district court, where the cause was reserved for decision here on the following agreed statement of facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-10\">\u201cJames II.

Barton and James IT. thus-became the sole owners of said one hundred and forty acres, in the proportions of five-sevenths owned by Barton, and two-sevenths by James H., they holding it as tenants in common,, and being in possession thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-5\">\u201cIn 1835 James H. went to Texas, leaving his brother Barton in possession of the whole one hundred and forty acres, under an arrangement by which Barton, as tenant of James H., controlled and farmed his share of said land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-6\">\u201cIn 1854 Barton Youngs died, leaving his family in possession of said land, and they, or some of them, retained their interest in the same and possession thereof until 1863, at which time Henry Heffner, the defendant, became the owner of the part belonging to Barton Youngs\u2019 heirs, and went into-possession of the whole tract. Thereupon, in December, 1863, Joseph and William Youngs, brothers of James H. (this-plaintiff), filed their petition in the court of common \u00a1deas of Miami county, Ohio, wherein they represented that James BL had been absent and unheard from for about thirty years, and as heirs-at-law of James Harvey Youngs they were entitled to-the one-fifth of two-sevenths of said land, and that his-other-brothers and sisters, with the heirs of Barton Youngs, and Henry Heffner (this defendant)., were entitled to the residue of said land in the several proportions in said petition named, and that they were all tenants in common in said land, and for that reason they pray partition of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-7\">\u201c In accordance with the prayer of this petition and on the-issue joined, partition was ordered, and neither party electing-to take the same at the appraisement, such further proceedings-were had that a sale was ordered by the court, and the premises were by the sheriff sold to defendant Heffner in August,. 1865, for the sum of $5,320. .

B. 414; 6 Mass. 277.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-5\">It seems to us that it is clear that the court in the partition \u2022suit had jurisdiction of the subject-matter, the land; that the estate, under the sale, passed to the purchaser by operation of law. <em>Sheldon </em>v. Newton, 3 Ohio St. 494; <em>Ewing </em>v. Higby, 7 Ohio, pt. 1, 198 ; <em>Robb </em>v. Irwin, 15 Ohio, 689 ; <em>Snudy v. Lowe, </em>18 Ohio, 368; <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Celluy, </em>8 Ohio St. 604.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-6\">It may be claimed, however, that the maxim, <em>eaveat emjotor, </em>applies to judicial sales, on the authority of <em>Vattier </em>v. Lytle, 6 Ohio, 478; <em>McLouth </em>v. <em>Rathbone, </em>19 Ohio, 21; <em>Corwin Lessees </em>v. Benham, 20 Ohio St. 36. This, we apprehend, is true, when properly applied, that the purchaser takes the property subject to every lien, either by judgment or levy, that \u2022could be asserted against the creditors before whose judgment the land is sold. It can have no application in cases where the allegations, of petition are such as to require proof thereof, as jurisdictional facts.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Al6\">Boynton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aha\">We think the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. The premises were occupied by Barton Youngs from 1835 until his death, which occurred in 1854. From 1854 until 1863 the premises remained in the occupancy of the family and heirs of Barton, who, while he lived, occupied the undivided interest of the plaintiff as his tenant. From the death \u2022of Barton until the defendant, Heffner, took possession in 1863, there was no adverse enjoyment by any one. The brothers and sisters of the plaintiff, under whom the defendant claims, were not in possession. It does not appear that Barton ever \u2022claimed to have acquired any title to the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the. premises by adverse enjoyment. The occupancy by one tenant of the common premises, however long continued, is no \u2022evidence of the .ouster of a co-tenant. To constitute disseizin, there must be an overt and notorious act of an unequivocal \u25a0character, clearly indicating an assertion of ownership of the \u2022entire premises, to the denial and exclusion of the right of the \u2022co-tenant. Freeman on Co-tenancy &amp; Par. \u00a7 230, <em>et seq. </em>Noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>mg of the kind appealing in respect to the possession of Barton or his heirs, the statute of limitations did not commence to run against the plaintiff\u2019s title until 1803, from which time until the commencement of the proceedings below, but twelve years elapsed. The plaintiff\u2019s right in the premises, therefore, was not affected by the running of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Nor was his title at all affected by the proceedings in partition, instituted by his brothers Joseph and William in 1863. Heffner acquired no further or greater interest in the property alleged to have been purchased at the partition sale, than he would have acquired by a conveyance from the plaintiff\u2019s brothers and sisters, who, it was supposed, had succeeded to the ownership of the premises as his heirs. A proceeding in partition, in its effect, dissolves or severs the tenancy in common, and locates the rights or interests of the parties, respectively, in distinct parts of the premises, and extinguishes their title in all others. <em>Tabler </em>v. <em>Wiseman, </em>2 Ohio St. 208. But it creates no new title, and operates only on the title or rights of the parties brought before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The plaintiff was not, and from the nature of the case could not have been, a party to the proceedings for partition instituted by two of his brothers in 1863, as those proceedings and the lights therein asserted, were founded, and for their validity depended, on the assumption of his death. The alleged title or interest of his brothers and sister, which was purchased by the defendant Heffner, rested wholly on the presumption that the plaintiff was d\u00e9ad, such presumption being founded on the fact that the plaintiff had been absent and unheard of, for the period of seven years. Whether or not, the circumstances under which the plaintiff left his home, and remained away, as disclosed in the agreed statement of facts, were such as to authorize the presumption of his death at the expiration of seven yearn, we need not inquire, as the presumption, whenever it arises from any length of time, is but <em>prima </em>facie, and is wholly rebutted whenever it is made to appear that the person whose death is thus presumed, is still living. Such presumption may always be shown to be ill-founded by counter evidence (Lor<em>ing </em>v. Steineman, 2 Metc. 211; 2 Best on Ev. \u00a7 408, <em>et </em>seq.); or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>by a conflicting presumption. <em>King </em>v. Twining, 2 Barn. &amp; Ald. 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">It necessarily follows that tire sale under the proceedings in partition iu 1863, as respects the plaintiff\u2019s right or title in the land, was void. His brothers and sisters were not his heirs, \u2022and in no event could have been, until his death. <em>Nemo est Aceres woentis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The principle asserted by counsel for the defendant, that a judgment of a domestic court of record, of competent jurisdiction, is conclusive of the facts or question therein determined, between the parties and their privies, until reversed or vacated, is a correct rule of law, but entirely misapplied when used to estop one from disputing the validity of the judgment, 'who was wholly a stranger to the cause or proceeding in which the judgment was rendered, and whose rights are sought to be \u2022concluded thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">So, too, the principle, that courts of equity will not favor \u2022stale demands, would seem to be misapplied, when invoked against a party possessed of the legal title, and who is only asserting his legal rights. <em>Larrowe </em>V. <em>Beam, </em>10 Ohio, 498; <em>Williams </em>v. Lambe, 3 Bro. Ch. C. 264; <em>Collins </em>v. Archer, 1 Russ. &amp; Mylne, 284; <em>Snelgrove </em>v. Snelgrove, 4 Dess. 288; 1 Story Eq. Jur. \u00a7 64, c, note; Bispham\u2019s Eq. \u00a7\u00a7 39, 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\u2022 The improvements made by the defendant Heffner, since going into possession, should be taken into account in the partition to be made of the premises. The plaintiff should derive no benefit therefrom. To the extent that they enhance the present value of the premises, Heffner should be allowed therefor in the j&gt;artition to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
