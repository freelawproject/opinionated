A passenger by railroad train, as soon as practicable after its arrival at the place of destination, presented to the agent in charge of the baggage-room a check for his baggage and\u2019demanded the same, which baggage he had delivered to the carrier when he took passage on tne train. The agent being unable to find the baggage, took the number of the check, and requested the passenger to call again. On the same evening the passenger returned to the depot, but the agent informed him that he had made further search and the baggage could not be found : <em>Held, </em>that such acts and declarations of the agent were competent evidence for the passenger in his action against the carrier for loss of such baggage.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-10\">Error to tbe District Court of Guernsey County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-11\">Martha Campbell and James \"W. Campbell, her husband, \u25a0 brought suit in the court of common pleas of Guernsey county, against the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, to recover the value of baggage belonging to Mrs. Campbell, which is said to have been lost by the company, a common carrier.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-13\">A verdict was found in favor of the plaintiffs for $973.55 ; judgment was rendered thereon at the November term, 1876 ; the judgment was affirmed in the district court, and on application of the company, leave was granted to file in this court a petition in error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-14\">In the petition of the plaintiffs below, it is alleged, that on December 8, 1874, at the city of New York, the company, in consideration of $17.50, then and there paid to it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>by Mrs. Campbell, agreed with her to safely carry herself and child and their baggage from the city of Now York to Columbus, Ohio, by way of the New York and Philadelphia Railroad, and the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, and the roads of the defendant; that she delivered her baggage at the city of New York to the defendant, and received from it a check for the carriage of such baggage over said roads to Washington, D. 0., where the company, -by the agreement aforesaid, was to re-check said baggage to Columbus ; that the baggage consisted of her trunk, containing the wearing apparel and ordinary appendages (stated in detail in the petition) incident to herself and child as such travelers; that on arriving at Washington, D. C., she presented the check to the proper agents of the company and demanded the baggage, but they neglected and refused to deliver the same or any part thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-5\">The company, by its answer, admitted the sale of a ticket for the transportation of Mrs. Campbell and her baggage from the city of New York to Columbus, Ohio, for the price and at the time stated in the petition, and that the plaintiffs had demanded the baggage as stated ; but the defendant denied the other allegations in the petitiou, and further answered as follows : \u201c The defendant further says that in the sale of said ticket for the transportation of said plaintiff and her baggage fi\u2019om the city of New York to Baltimore, Md., it acted as the agent only of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Company, owning and operating the linos of railroad between said points, and for her transportation with her baggage from Baltimore, Md., to Columbus, Ohio, for itself, owning and operating the residue of said route; that by the terms and conditions of said ticket, issued to and accepted by said plaintiff, each company representing said route was to be responsible only for the safety of passengers, or the loss of their baggage on its line of road, and not each for the others, and for the loss of baggage not exceeding in value $100, unless by special contract; and the defendant denies that said trunk and its contents were delivered to, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>or received by it from said company, nor was it lost upon its said line of railroad.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-5\">In their reply, the plaintiffs say, \u201c that it is not true that the said defendant, in the sale of said ticket for the transportation of said plaintiff and her baggage, from the city of New York to Baltimore, lid., acted as the agent of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and the Philadelphia, \"Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Company ; nor is it true that by the terms and condition of said ticket issued to and accepted by said plaintiff, each company representing said route was \u2022 to be responsible offiy for the safety of passengers or the loss of their baggage on its line of road <em>; </em>nor is it true that said plaintiff received and accepted a ticket for her transportation, with her baggage, by the terms and conditions of which each company named in said answer, as representing said route, was to be responsible only for the safety of passengers or the loss of their baggage on its line of road and not each for the others, and for the loss of baggage not exceeding in value $100, unless by special con-, tract.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-6\">The record does not purport to contain all the evidence or all of the charge to the jury. The errors relied on are, that the court erred in admitting certain evidence, in refusing to charge the jury as requested by the company, and in the charge given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-7\">Evidence was offered to show the following facts: Mrs. Campbell, with her infant child, and father, mother and aunt, all residents of Cambridge, Ohio, were at the home of W. J. Hendricks, in Bond street, Brooklyn, N. Y., during parts of November and December, 1874, where Mrs. Campbell was receiving medical treatment. Desiring to return home by way of Washington, D. C., Mr. White, father of Mrs. Campbell, on December 8, 1874, on behalf of himself and his wife, daughter and her aunt, gave to Mr. Hendricks $70, and directed him to go to the office of the defendant, in New York city, and buy four ti ckets for the persons nam ed, from New York city to Columbus, Ohio, by way of Washington, D. C. Mr. Hendricks, on the same day, went to the office of the company, on Broadway, and procured the railroad tickets, \"and also ferry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>tickets, in envelopes, each of the four envelopes containing a-railroad and ferry ticket, and having printed thereon the words: \u201c Office Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R. Tickets to all points west, south and south-west, 229 Broadway, corner Barclay street, New York. Pullman palace cars on all trains. Baggage checked through from hotels and residences. J. T. Bullock, Ticket Agent.\u201d At the time Mr. Hendricks purchased the tickets, ho obtained of the agent of the defendant a time card, containing, among others, the following words: \u201cSave time by taking the Balto. <em>&amp; </em>Ohio. Quickest route west . ... Great through route . . . All trains run via Washington. Call at company\u2019s offices, 315 and 261 Broadway.\u201d On the same day, at his residence, he delivered the tickets and time card to the persons for whom they were intended. Mr. White and Mrs. Campbell then went to .Dodds\u2019 Express Office' in Brooklyn, to have the baggage of the party, consisting of their trunks, checked. The agents in charge of the office required them to produce their railroad tickets and to pay $1.50. On that evening a driver from the express company went to Mr. Hendricks\u2019 house and obtained the baggage and furnished the owners metal checks. The check of Mrs. Campbell had on one side of it the words \u201c New York, 357, to Washington ; \u201d on the other side: \u201c Dodds\u2019 Express, N. Y. &amp; Phila. R. R. \u2014 \u25a0 P. W. &amp; B. \u2014 B. <em>&amp; </em>0. \u2014 Liability limited to $100.\u201d The evidence tended to show that in receiving the baggage the express company acted as agent of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-6\">On the morning of December 9, Mrs. Campbell and those in company with her went to the railroad depot in Jersey City, where some person pointed out to them their coach in the railroad train of the defendant, which coach they entered, and they rode without change of cars to Washington, D. C., where they arrived the same evening. On the following morning, Mr. White went to the proper office of the defendant, saw its agent in charge of the baggage-room, and demanded for the party their baggage. Two of the trunks were found and rechecked, but Mrs. Campbell\u2019s baggage could not he found, and it has never been delivered. Neither she nor those in company with her have seen or heard of it since it was delivered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>to the driver of the express company on the night of December 8, 1871. In the conversation between Mr. White and the agent, above referred to, the agent said Mrs. Campbell\u2019s baggage might have gone over to the other depot of the company. He took a memorandum of her <em>check </em>and requested Mr. White to call again. He did call in the evening of the same day, but the agent informed him the baggage could not be found. The company objected to the admission of these acts and declarations of the agent as evidence, but the court overruled the objection, and the company excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-5\">On the trial the evidence of one of the defendant\u2019s agents was offered, tending to show that the railroad tickets so sold by the defendant were issued by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company in the following form :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-6\">\u201c Pennsylvania Rail Road Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A5T\">\u201c This ticket entitles the bearer \u201c To one first-class passage to '\u201c Columbus.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-8\">. \u201c This ticket is not good unless each check is officially stamped and dated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-10\">\u201c In selling this ticket for passage over other roads, the Pennsylvania Rail Road Company acts only as agent for them, and assumes no responsibility beyond its own line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-11\">\u201cThe Pennsylvania Rail Road Co. will not assume any risk on baggage, except for wearing apparel, and limit their responsibility to $100 in value. All baggage exceeding that amount in value will be at the risk of the owner, unless taken by special contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-12\">\u201c The checks belonging to this ticket will not be received for passage if detached.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-13\">\u201c D.

nor had either of them noticed any limitation with respect to baggage on the railroad tickets which they purchased of the defendant; nor had the attention of either of them been called to any such limitation on either the checks or railroad tickets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-6\">After the close of the evidence and arguments of counsel, the defendant requested the court to charge the jury as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-7\">First. \u201c If the jury shall find from the testimony that the ticket sold by the defendant to Mrs. Campbell, at its office in New Yorlc city in December, 1S74, for her transportation from said city or Jersey City to Columbus, Ohio, was issued by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, that the trunk was checked at Brooklyn, witli a check issued by said Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and that the defendant acted as the agent only of the said Pennsylvania Railroad Company in the sale of said ticket, and if the jury shall further find that the defendant had no interest in'the price of said ticket other than the proportion it would be entitled to for the distance traveled upon the line of road of defendant from Baltimore westwardly, and if the jury shall further find that the trunk was not received into custody of the defendant orits agents at Baltimore, or some other place on its line of road, the plaintiffs in such case arc not entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>'Which charge the court refused to give, except as qualified in the charge of the court as hereinafter set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-5\">And the defendant thereupon also further asked the court to charge the jury as follows: Second. \u201c If the jury shall find from the testimony that the ticket sold by the defendant to Mrs. Campbell, the plaintiff, about the 8th or 9th day of December, 1814, at the office of the defendant in the city of New York, for her transportation from said city or Jersey City to Columbus, Ohio, was issued by the defendant or was the ticket of the defendant, and not that of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and the plaintiff had the time or opportunity before having her baggage checked to examine said ticket, and there was no'fraud or deceit practiced by the company or its agent in the sale of the ticket, that would have misled her, she is presumed to know the contents of said ticket; and if the jury shall further find that the ticket then sold to and received by her was of the form and contained the stipulations of the ticket, [hereinbefore set forth] attached to the deposition of Mr. McCarthy, they, the plaintiffs, would be bound by such stipulations, and would not in such case be entitled to recover more than \u00a7100, including interest thereon from the time of the loss of said trunk.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-6\">Which charge the court refused to give ; and thereupon the court did charge the jury in these regards as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-7\">\u201c A railroad company may become liable as a common carrier by contract for transportation of passengers and baggage over other railroads forming with their own a continuous lino; and where they do so contract, their liability is the same for losses occasioned by negligence or fault while the baggage is upon such other road as while it is upon their own road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-8\">\u201cThe first question in this case is, what was the contract between the parties? Did the defendant agree to carry the plaintiff and her baggage all the way from New York, or only from Baltimore ? and in selling the ticket to carry plaintiff and her baggage from New York to Baltimore did it act only as the agent of the other roads named ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-9\">\u201c If the contract of the defendant was only to carry plaintiff and her baggage from Baltimore, then it would not be liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>unless the baggage came into the possession or custody of some agent or employee of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-5\">l\u00a3 If the jury find from the testimony, that the ticket sold by the defendant to Mrs. Campbell, at its office in New York city, in December, 1874, for her transportation from said city, or J ersey City, to Columbus, Ohio, was issued by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, that the trunk was checked at Brooklyn, with a check issued by said Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and that the defendant acted as the agent only of the said Pennsylvania Railroad Company in the sale of said ticket, and the defendant, with a knowledge thereof, acquiesced therein, and if the jury shall further find that the defendant has no interest in the price of said ticket other than the proportion it would be entitled to for the distance traveled upon the line of road of defendant from Baltimore westwardly, and if the jury shall further find that the trunk was not received into the' custody of the defendant or its agents at Baltimore or some other place on its line of road, the plaintiffs in such case are not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-6\">\u201c On the other hand, if you find the contract was an undertaking on the part of the defendant to carry plaintiff, Martha, and her baggage, frcpi New York to 'Washington, and thence westwardly over its road to Columbus, Ohio, and the baggage was delivered to an agent of the defendant, then the defendant would be liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-7\">\u201c If the baggage was delivered to Dodds\u2019 Express Company and Dodds\u2019 Express Company was the agent of the defendant for receiving baggage, then the receipt of the baggage by said company would be a delivery to the defendant. And if Dodds\u2019 Express Company was in fact the agent of the defendant in the receipt of plaintiff\u2019s baggage, then it would make no difference as to the defendant\u2019s liability, whether it over went from the possesssion of Dodds\u2019 Express or not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-8\">Second. And the court further charged the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-9\">\u201c In the absence of special contract limiting the liability of defendant, if you find it is liable for the loss of plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>baggage, you will assess as her damages the value of her trunk and such of its contents as you find was the wearing apparel of herself or her child, or their necessary and usual appendages or accompaniments of herself and child as a traveler, with interest from the time demanded to the first day of the present term, November 14th, 1876. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b675-5\">\u201c A carrier may restrict or limit the amount of its liability by a special contract accepted on the part of the owner of the baggage; and this may be done by notices brought home to the owner of the baggage before or at. the delivery to .the carrier-;' if assented to by the owner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b675-6\">\u201c The onus of proving any qualification of the liability of the defendant as a carrier, rests upon it. The notice, to be of any force, must amount to actual notice. At all events, to exonerate the defendant as a carrier from its general liability, it must be shown, at least, by the evidence, that the plaintiff, or those acting for her, assented to the demands of the notice, or, with a knowledge of it, acquiesced in it, by making no remonstrance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b675-7\">\u201c And in determining whether or not the conditions -or limitations were brought to the notice of plaintiff and those acting for her, you will look to all the evidence in this case; as to the manner of the delivery of the ticket and the check; whether anything Avas said or done calling the attention to them or not; Avhetlier they were or were not read at the time of or before their receipt.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b675-8\"><em>H.

The admission as evidence for plaintiffs on the trial, of statements of agents and employees of the railroad company, Avas erroneous. Statements thus admitted were not part of the <em>res gestae. </em>Declarations, admissions and statements of an agent, to bind the principal, must bo made at the time of the principal transaction. 1 Greenleaf, \u00a7 113 ; <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>O. &amp; L.

Those deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>of sufficient importance to call for a report will be briefly considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">1. Where it is necessary for a traveler, in going from one place to another, to pass over the connecting lines of several railroad companies, it is competent for either company to contract with him for the transportation of himself and his baggage the whole distance, whether such lines are confined to one state or extend through several states. Connecting carriers, in such case, recognizing such contract, become the agents of the contracting carriel-, and their negligence is its negligence. And the collection, by such contracting carrier, of fare in advance for the entire journey, without an agreement as to risks, renders it liable, on receipt of the traveler\u2019s baggage, to transport it safely to the end of the route, and there deliver it, on demand, to such owner. Schouler on Bailments, 336 ; Thompson on Carriers, 431; Lawson on Carriers, \u00a7 235 ; Hutchinson on Carriers, \u00a7 145. Of course the carrier selling such ticket may lawfully agree with the passenger that it shall not be liable except for loss or damage occurring on its own road. <em>Ib.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">2. A common carrier cannot restrict his \u00bfability for loss of baggage by notice, even when such notice is brought to the knowledge of the passenger. Such restriction can only be made by agreement of the parties, and the burden is on the carrier to show such agreement. <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>2 Ohio St. 131; <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>4 Ohio St. 362 ; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>4 Ohio St. 722, 740 ; <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>Pittsburgh, &amp;c. R. Co., </em>10 Ohio St. 65 ; <em>Cleveland, &amp;c. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Curran, 19 </em>Ohio St. 1; <em>Cincinnati, &amp;c. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Pontius, </em>19 Ohio St. 221; <em>Union Express Co. </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>26 Ohio St. 595; <em>United S. Ex. Co. </em>v. <em>Backman, </em>28 Ohio St. 144 ; <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Union T. &amp; I. Co., </em>28 Ohio St. 418 ; <em>Pittsburyh, &amp;c. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Barrett, ante, </em>448. A railroad ticket is not such an agreement. 'It is simply a voucher that the person in whose possession it is, has paid his fare. The same principle applies to baggage checks. Lawson on Carriers, \u00a7\u00a7 106, 107. An attempt by words on such ticket or check to limit the carrier\u2019s liability for loss of baggage will be wholly unavailing, unless the carrier shows that the passenger, with knowledge of such limitation, agreed that it might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>be made. Elsewhere the cases on this subject are not in harmony <em>(Burke v. South E. Ry. Co., </em>L. R. 5 C. P. Div. 1; Lawson on Carriers, 455, 460 ; Thompson on Carriers, 432, 437); but our own cases, to which reference has been made, fully support this view of the law, and such is the clear weight of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">3. Application for the baggage was made to the agent in charge of the baggage-room as soon as practicable after Mrs. Campbell and her friends reached Washington. What the agent said and did, with respect to the baggage, were clearly competent evidence for the plaintiffs on the trial. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Conn. River R. Co., </em>6 Gray, 450 ; <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Boston </em>&amp; <em>A. R. Co., </em>112 Mass. 455 ; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; L. R. Co., </em>128 Mass. 221; <em>Dilleber v. Knickerbocker Ins. Co., </em>76 N. Y. 567, 572; <em>Pierson </em>v. <em>Atlantic Nat. Bank, </em>77 N. Y. 304; <em>Kirkstall Brew. Co. </em>v. <em>Furness R. Co., </em>L. R. 9 Q. B. 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">4. The plaintiff in error, as it was required to do, caused parts of the record to be printed, but failed to insert in such printed matter certain letters to the president of the company, written by Mr. White on behalf of plaintiffs, and the president\u2019s replies thereto, which letters and replies were offered in evidence and incorporated in the bill of exceptions ; nor was any order of this court made or applied for exonerating the plaintiff in error from such printing. Under such circumstances, we will assume that the plaintiff in error caused to be printed all .of the record which its counsel deemed material, and hence we have determined the ease from the printed matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">There is no error in the record to the prejudice of the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
