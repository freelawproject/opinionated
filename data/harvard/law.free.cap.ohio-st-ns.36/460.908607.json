Cooper, who was then a resident of said county, an infant, and (as the plaintiff is informed and believes) a person of unsound mind; that the entry of said appointment, made upon the records of said probate court, did not contain any express adjudication that the said Caroline was then a minor or of unsound mind ; but stated that said Bell was appointed guardian of Caroline E. Coojier, aged seven years, heir-at-law of Elijah Cooper: that the said Bell then gave bond according to law, and entered upon the discharge of his duties as such guardian; tliat the said Caroline became eighteen years old on or about the 20th day of April, a. d. 1867, and at the time of arriving at that age she was and has ever since then been a person of unsound mind, and incapable of managing her business affairs; that the said Bell, from that time until the 16th day of September, A. d. 1874, acted as her guardian, and from time to time, and in the years of 1867, 1869 and 1871, filed his accounts as such guardian, in the said probate court, in which accounts he asserted himself to be such guardian; and his said accounts were passed upon and settled by said court accordingly; that on or about the 3d day of April, a.d. 1871, the said Bell appeared in and before the said probate court, and represented to the same that Justin Morrison and Alexander Morrison, his sureties on his bond, as such guardian, theretofore given in said court, were non-residents of Licking comity; thereupon, upon the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>of said Bell, the following order or judgment was made by said court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-5\">\u201c <em>1 </em>IN THE MATTER OF THE GUARDIANSHIP OF CAROLINE F.

He is not a party to this proceeding in error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b484-12\"><em>I. </em>Buchingham, for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-13\">I. We insist that when Bell was appointed in 1856 he became guardian in respect of all the disabilities his ward was subject to, unsoundness of mind and infancy, and continued guardian as long as either disability continued, unless terminated by death, resignation, or removal. The object of his appointment was that under the direction of the court he might take care of the person and property of his ward, and the office or duty should continue as long as the necessity should exist. Morally the duty would continue, and it would be very technical if, in law, also, it would not continue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-14\">II. The probate court, in 1871, had the jurisdiction and power to determine whether Bell was still the guardian of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Caroline Cooper as a person of unsound mind; that court did tben decide that he was still her guardian, and Bell and his sureties acquiesced in the decision; unsoundness of mind was then her only disability. ' It will be presumed that the court had the proper evidence and found all the facts necessary to sustain its action, and its action cannot be impeached in this way. <em>Shroyer </em>v. Richmond, 16 Ohio St. 455, 465.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-5\">III. In case the court is of opinion that Bell had ceased to be the'guardian of his ward, as a minor, we still insist that what was done by the probate court in 1871 was tantamount to an appointment of him to be guardian in respect of her unsoundness of mind. The court had jurisdiction to do it; the person was imbecile ; the power of the court to protect the person and property was invoked ; the court acted, and its record declares that he was guardian, and, for one cause named, and other causes, ordered'him to give the bond nowin suit; thereupon he accepted; and the record and the bond both declare he gave the bond as guardian. The matter may be informal, but, certainly, we think the action of the court may fairly be regarded as a new appointment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-6\">IY. But, if all the foregoing positions are deemed by the court untenable, we say that Bell and his sureties are estopped by the bond to deny that Bell was guardian. <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>State, </em>25 Ohio St. 566-577; Bigelow on Estoppel, 244, 267, 268, 272; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>17 How.

Flory, </em>for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-8\">The probate courts have no powers or jurisdiction except what is conferred upon them by statute. Const, of Ohio, art. 4, \u00a7 8. Probate courts as created by statute are of special and limited jurisdiction, and can only do such acts as are specifically prescribed by statute. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>11 Ohio St. 391; <em>Gilliland </em>v. <em>Sellers, </em>2 Ohio St. 223; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>4 <em>W. </em>L.

When a court transcends the limits prescribed for it, by law and assumes to act where it has no jurisdiction, its adjudications and acts are utterly void and of no effect either as an estoppel or otherwise. Herman on Estoppel, \u00a7 52; <em>Adams </em>v. Jefferies, 12 Ohio, 271, and cases there cited ; <em>Gilliland </em>v. <em>Sellers, </em>2 Ohio St. 223 ; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>4 W. L. Mo. 32; <em>Maxson </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>12 Ohio, 195, 208.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-5\">The bond upon its face shows that the probate court had no authority to require, accept, approve or receive the bond. The conditions of the bond are as follows: \u201c That, whereas the said Samuel S. Bell has been heretofore appointed guardian of Caroline F. Cooper, heir-at-law and child of Elijah Cooper, deceased, &amp;c.\u201d The bond does not say Bell has been appointed guardian of a lunatic or a minor, but only as guardian of \u201c Caroline F. Cooper, heir-at-law and child of Elijah Cooper, deceased.\u201d Sureties are only bound by the strict letter of the bond. <em>State </em>v. <em>Medary, </em>17 Ohio, 565 ; see <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>6 Ohio St. 503; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>9 Ohio St. 22; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cutting, </em>2 Ohio St. 2 ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Corey, 16 </em>Ohio St. 19; <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Sloan, </em>20 Ohio, 331, 332; <em>Fosdict </em>v. <em>Green, </em>27 Ohio St. 498; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Huesman, </em>30 Ohio St. 662. It certainly will not be claimed that there ever was any law in force in Ohio authorizing the probate court to require, accept, \u25a0approve or receive any bond in the name of the state of Ohio, \u25a0or any other name of any other person as \u201cguardian of \u00abCaroline F. Cooper, heir-at-law and child of Elijah Cooper, deceased ; \u201d and therefore the action of the probate court was null and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-6\">A person is only guardian until the ward arrives at the age \u25a0of majority. IS. <em>&amp; </em>C. 671, \u00a7 5. Which was in this case eighteen years of age. 1 S. <em>&amp; </em>C. 694, \u00a7 1; <em>Cambell </em>v. <em>English, </em>Wright, 119 ; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Bairnand, </em>11 Ohio, 444; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>4 W. L. Mo. 32. The probate court had no power to require a person to give a new or additional bond, \u25a0or to accept, approve or receive any bond in the name of the state of Ohio, or any other name, from such person unless such person was at the time a guardian. 1 S. &amp; C. 672, \u00a7 8. The probate court, in requiring, accepting, approving or receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>the bond in suit, acted wholly without jurisdiction, and all its acts were <em>coram non </em>judice, and void. <em>Gilland </em>v.

In no event can these defendants be held liable for money received by Bell while he was acting as guardian, unless the money was received by him as guardian while he in fact and in law was her guardian. <em>Walker </em>v.

Bell is a necessary party to the proceedings in error, and this court has no jurisdiction until the case is finally disposed of in the court of common pleas as to Bell, and he is properly made a party to this petition in error. <em>Jones </em>v. Marsh, 30 Ohio St. 20.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b487-9\">Johnson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6E\">It is claimed that said petition does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the sureties on said bond: 1st. Because the probate court had no au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>thority to require, receive or accept the same ; 2d. There is no breach alleged; 3d. It is void for want of a consideration; and, 4th. The bond was not delivered. It is further insisted, that as Bell is not a party to this proceeding in error, this court has no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">1. The point is made, that Bell, who is the principal on the bond and a defendant in the original action, is a necessary party in this proceeding in error. <em>Smethers </em>v. <em>Rainey </em>(14 Ohio St.) 287, and <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Marsh </em>(30 Ohio St. 20), hold that all parties to a joint judgment should be parties in error. Here the final judgment was in favor of Flory and Shields, and against plaintiff, and the case stands undisposed of as to Bell on the common pleas\u2019 docket. This is authorized by section 371 of the Code, the action being upon a joint and several cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">All the parties to this final judgment are before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">2. The petition alleges a delivery of the bond and its approval by the court, as in all like cases. Hence the claim that there was no delivery of the bond is not well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">3. Neither is the claim that there is a want of consideration for the bond, if it is otherwise valid. If the court had the power to take and approve this bond, the consideration is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">4. The principal, and, indeed, the only question of difficulty in the case, is as to the authority of the court to take this bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Bell was appointed guardian, February 4,1856. The statute vested in the probate court exclusive jurisdiction to appoint and remove guardians, to direct and control their conduct, and to settle their accounts. Swan R. S. 1854, 753, a. This power embraced the appointment of guardians for minors (Swran R, S. 1854, p. 444), and idiots and lunatics. S. &amp; C. 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">In the appointment of guardians for lunatics, all laws relating to guardians for minors and their wards, and pointing out the duties, rights, and liabilities of such guardians and <em>their </em>sureties, in force <em>for the time </em>being, are made applicable to guardians for idiots and lunatics, and their children, so far as the same are\u2019in conformity with the provisions of the act relating to lunatic asylums. S. &amp; 0. 840, \u00a7 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">The law in force <em>\u201c </em>for the time being,\u201d when the bond in suit was apjaroved and filed, relating to guardians of minors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>was the act of 1858. S. &amp; C. 670. By section 8 full power is given the court over the bonds of guardians on exceptions thereto, and upon its own motion it may require guardians to give additional bonds, whenever the interest of the ward shall demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Section 9 provides that \u201c No bond executed by a guardian' after this act shall take effect\u201d (July 1, 1858), \u201c-shall be void or held invalid on account of any informality in the same, <em>nor am, aoGOwnt of an%y i/i%formali1nj or illegality in the ayypoimlment of such </em>guardiam,/ but such bond shall have the same force and effect as if such appointment had been legally made and such bond executed in proper form.\u201d The bond in suit is subject to the provisions of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The facts admitted by the demurrer are:</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">1. That in 1856, Bell was duly appointed and qualified as guardian of Caroline E. Cooper, who was then - both an infant and a person of unsound mind, and entered upon the discharge of his duties as such guardian, and so continued to act until his resignation, which was accepted by the court September 16, 1874, and the present plaintiff was appointed his successor as guardian of said Caroline, a lunatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">2. That at her arrival of age, April 20, 1867, she was still of unsound mind, and without any further action of the court, so far as the record shows, Bell continued as guardian, and in 1867, 1869 and 1871, filed his accounts as such with the court, which were audited and settled; the court in all respects recognizing and treating him as the legal guardian, as well after as before her majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">3. That in April, 1871, nearly four years after her coming of age, Bell represented to the court that his sureties had removed from the county, and on his application and upon an order of the court requiring it, he and the present defendants executed and delivered the bond in suit, which was on his motion approved and filed, whereupon he was permitted by the court to continue his guardianship until his resignation and the appointment of his successor.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">4. October 14, 1874, in pursuance of the order of court, he filed his final account, which was audited and settled Novem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>ber 24, 1874, showing a balance due his ward of $4,126.84, which he was ordered to pay over to plaintiff, but has failed so to doj except a small amount stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">5. That prior to the giving of the present bond, April 8, 1871, he had received $5,000 or more of his ward\u2019s moneys, and had in liis hands, in fact, said sum of $4,126.84 at the date of his final settlement, which, on demand, he refused to pay over.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\"><em>We </em>have not been furnished with a copy of the judgment of the court, making the appointment of Bell in 1856, but it is averred that Bell was then appointed guardian of said Caroline F. Cooper, who was then an infant, and (as the plaintiff was informed and believes) a person of unsound mind; and it is averred there was no express adjudication by the court, upon what grounds the appointment was made; that is, whether she was a minor, or of unsound mind, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The court having jurisdiction on either or on both grounds, to make the appointment, its validity cannot be inquired into collaterally, though the record is silent, as to the particular ground upon which the appointment was made. <em>Shroyer </em>v. Richmond, 16 Ohio St. 455. Neither upon this state of facts does the presumption arise, that the appointment was made solely on the ground of infancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">For over seven years after the ward\u2019s majority, Bell acted as guardian of a lunatic. The court so recognized him as her legal guardian by receiving and settling his accounts, by ordering and approving a new bond and allowing him to continue to act, though the record showed she was over age, by accepting his resignation and appointing his successor as guardian of a lunatic. All this is utterly inconsistent with the presumption that the appointment was made on the ground of infancy alone, but is in harmony with the presumption that the judgment of the court, by which he was appointed,.was either based on the unsoundness of mind, or of that, as well as infancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">In the absence of an express adjudication of the grounds for this appointment to the contrary, and in view of the fact that, after the ward arrived of age, the court continued for several years to judicially recognize him as the legal guardian, we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>authorized to presume that this appointment covered both disabilities, the lunacy as well as the infancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">This being so, the court was authorized by section 8 of the guardian act to order and approve this bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The condition being for the faithful discharge by Bell of his duties as such guardian, as required by law, his sureties are liable thereon for a breach of the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\n<em>Judgments of the district court cmd of the court of common fleas reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
