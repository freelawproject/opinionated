Plaintiffs brought the complaint as a summary action \u201cto enforce agency orders\u201d under <em>Rule </em>4:67-6(a)(2). Plaintiffs sought to compel defendant New Jersey State Department of Education (the Department) to provide \u201cthe funding and high quality preschool provided by the School Funding Reform Act of 2008 [SFRA], along with facilities improvements and other measures.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">The trial judge ruled that plaintiffs could not pursue the summary action under <em>Rule </em>4:67-6(a)(2) because the district-specific needs assessments which they sought to enforce did not require the Department to fully fund the districts under the SFRA or otherwise provide for specific relief and, therefore, there were no orders capable of being enforced under the rule. Having carefully reviewed the record and arguments on appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">In December 1997, twenty school districts, known as the \u201cBacon districts,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a complaint in the Chancery Division against the Department, the Commissioner of the Department (the Commissioner), and several State officials. <em>Bacon v. N.J. State Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>398 <em>N.J.Super. </em>600, 606, 942 A.2d 827 (App.Div.2008), <em>certif. denied, </em>210 <em>N.J. </em>218, 42 A.3d 890 (2012). The districts were \u201crural and property-poor\u201d and sought a declaratory judgment that the Comprehensive Educational Improvement and Financing Act of 1996, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:7F-1 to -42 (CEIFA), failed to provide a thorough and efficient education to their students, in violation of the New Jersey Constitution. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">In their complaint, the Bacon districts sought State \u201cfunding equivalent to that provided to the State\u2019s richest school districts.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Essentially, the Bacon districts wanted to be funded in the same manner as their urban counterparts, the Abbott districts. <em>Id. </em>at 606-07, 942 A.2d 827. Under CEIFA, all districts with concentrations of impoverished students received State aid to address the unique educational difficulties that face such students. <em>Id. </em>at 605, 942 A.2d 827. All districts classified as Abbott districts received an additional type of aid, known as parity aid, which was \u201cintended to support the per pupil expenditure level of the Abbott [districts at the level of\u2019 New Jersey\u2019s wealthiest districts. <em>Ibid. </em>(citing <em>Abbott v. Burke, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>480, 567, 710 A.2d 450 (1998) <em>(Abbott </em>V)).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">In February 1998, the parties entered into a consent order and jurisdiction was transferred to the Commissioner, who transmitted the matters to the Office of Administrative Law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 607, 942 A.2d 827. A bifurcated hearing was held before an Administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Law Judge (ALJ). <em>Ibid. </em>At the first phase of the hearings, the ALJ determined that the districts had been using their \u201cCEIFA funding appropriately.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608, 942 A.2d 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">During the second phase of the hearings, the districts needed to show \u201cthat educational deficiencies existed and the deficiencies could not be remedied, under current law and funding levels, by different programmatic and fiscal choices.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The ALJ determined that five districts needed additional funding; however, the Commissioner subsequently found that only one district needed additional funding and that CEIFA funding was sufficient with respect to the other districts. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Eight districts ultimately appealed the Commissioner\u2019s decision to the State Board of Education (the Board). <em>Id. </em>at 608-09, 942 A.2d 827. The Board issued its final decision on January 4, 2006. <em>Id. </em>at 609, 942 A.2d 827. Overall, the Board found that Bacon district students were \u201cnot being afforded a thorough and efficient education.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Additionally, the Board determined that \u201cthe children in [the Bacon districts] had \u2018special needs arising from the socioeconomic conditions in the districts[,]\u2019 \u201d which were not being addressed by the available programming. <em>Ibid. </em>The Board \u201creeognize[d] that CEIFA has provided these districts with more fiscal resources than ha[d] been available to them previously\u201d and that \u201cprogress ha[d] been made under CEIFA to improve the quality of the education\u201d in the Bacon districts. In spite of those gains, the Board still concluded that the students were being deprived of a thorough and efficient education. The Board also determined that CEIFA had created a fragmented funding system that failed students statewide, not just in the Abbott and Bacon districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">After determining that there were constitutional violations in the Bacon districts, the Board examined the remedies that would best address the specific needs of those districts. Significantly, the Board rejected the idea</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">that merely providing the [Bacon] districts with the same fiscal resources that are provided to the Abbott [districts will ensure that the students of these districts are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>in fact afforded the educational opportunity to which they are entitled. While poor, the districts involved here are not identical to the districts that have been classified as Abbott [districts. The very fact that they are not urban means that they face a unique set of circumstances that are different from those confronting the poor urban districts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">As an alternative to providing the Bacon districts with the same funding as Abbott districts, the Board directed the Commissioner to supervise the Department in \u201cdevelop[ing] a design for a needs assessment to be performed in\u201d the Bacon districts that would focus on the unique problems that confronted the individual districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">In response, the Commissioner \u201crecommended awaiting executive and legislative action on a new funding formula\u201d then being considered by the Governor and the Legislature. <em>Bacon, supra, </em>398 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 613, 942 A.2d 827. The new funding formula was enacted in 2008 as the SFRA, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:7F-43 to -63. <em>Ibid. </em>Whereas CEIFA created a fragmented funding system, SFRA removed references to Abbott districts, <em>id. </em>at 613, n. 10, 942 A.2d 827, and applied one uniform funding formula to all 618 school districts in New Jersey. <em>Id. </em>at 615, 942 A.2d 827. Under SFRA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">[T]he Department [would] calculate how much it costs to meet the constitutional mandate of affording every student in this [s]tate a thorough and efficient education. The State then [would] base[] its share of the requirement by the wealth of a district; poorer districts [would] get a higher percentage of then-educational budget from the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">\n<em>Ubid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">Before SFRA was enacted, the Bacon districts appealed the Board\u2019s 2006 decision to this court. <em>Id. </em>at 612, 942 A.2d 827. Plaintiffs requested that the court \u201cgrant them status comparable to Abbott districts and awarding] them the same financial resources provided to their urban counterparts....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615, 942 A.2d 827. We declined to provide such relief. Instead, we deferred to the Board\u2019s approach of individualized needs assessments, referring to interim judicial funding as \u201ca last resort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616-17, 942 A.2d 827. We felt it particularly appropriate to avoid a judicially-compelled funding remedy given the recent enactment of SFRA. <em>Id. </em>at 617, 942 A.2d 827. As a result, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u201cdirect[ed] the Commissioner to comply with the Board\u2019s final decision and proceed forthwith to design and perform a needs assessment of each of the Bacon districts ... and ... to farther determine whether ... [SFRA\u2019s] remedial measures afford students in the Bacon districts\u201d a thorough and efficient education. <em>Id. </em>at 618, 942 A.2d 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In compliance with our directive, the Department designed and implemented a comprehensive, multi-phased needs assessment in 2008. The needs assessments culminated in a report issued by the Commissioner on September 14, 2009. The report consisted of sixteen individualized assessments of each of the Bacon districts that summarized the results of site visits, evaluated the adequacy of the facilities, evaluated the effect of SFRA on the district\u2019s funding, and provided conclusions and recommendations for each district.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">As directed by the Board, the needs assessments focused on the unique issues that affected each individual district at that time. With respect to SFRA, the assessments detailed the amount of aid that each district actually received for fiscal year (FY) 08-09, the anticipated level of funding for FY 09-10, and how the districts intended to use the funding. Notably, the needs assessment lacked a global statement about all of the Bacon districts or whether fully funding SFRA would provide the Bacon district students with a thorough and efficient education.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Pursuant to <em>Rule </em>2:4-l(b) and <em>Bacon, supra, </em>398 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 619, 942 A.2d 827, plaintiffs could have appealed the needs assessments. However, no appeal was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">The State reduced SFRA funding for the 2011 fiscal year. <em>Abbott v. Burke, </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>332, 344-46, 20 A.3d 1018 (2011) <em>(Abbott XXI). </em>On September 2, 2011, the districts that had appealed the Board\u2019s decision to this court filed a motion to enforce litigants\u2019 rights pursuant to <em>Rule </em>1:10-3, seeking an order directing that the Bacon districts receive full funding under SFRA. In a January 12, 2012 order, we denied the motion because \u201c[t]he specific relief requested on this motion to enforce litigant\u2019s rights ... [was] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>neither encompassed nor contemplated in our [previous] decision____\u201d We further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">To the extent movants\u2019 instant application seeks redress from the September 14, 2009 final administrative decisions of the Commissioner ... as inconsistent with, or violative of, the <em>Bacon </em>holding, their recourse was a direct appeal therefrom____ To the extent movants seek[ ] to enforce, or compel compliance with, any aspect of the September 14, 2009 administrative agency determinations, their recourse is by way of summary proceeding pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:67-6.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Plaintiffs took no further action until approximately September 8, 2014 when fifteen of the original twenty Bacon districts filed a verified complaint and order to show cause under <em>Rule </em>4:67-6 in the Law Division. Plaintiffs framed the complaint as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF\">an action to enforce final determinations by [the Department] ... that the funding and high quality preschool provided by [SFRA], along with facilities improvements and other measures, will afford students in [Bacon] districts a thorough and efficient education ... remediating the constitutional violation found by [the Board] and upheld by the Superior Court, Appellate Division____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The relief sought by plaintiffs was broad. Plaintiffs requested an order directing the Department to (1) calculate the aid that would be provided to the Bacon districts under SFRA for the 2014-15 school year and subsequent years, send those calculations to the Legislature, \u201cand seek supplemental appropriations as may be necessary to ensure the provision of necessary funding\u201d; (2) calculate the preschool aid that the Bacon districts would receive under SFRA to allow them \u201cto implement high quality preschool for all three- and four-year olds ... no later than the 2019-20 school year\u201d; (3) \u201c[d]evelop and implement district-specific plans for facilities improvements and financing as may be necessary and consistent with the Educational Facilities Construction and Financing Act (EFCFA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:7G-1 <em>et seq., </em>commencing in the 2015-16 school year\u201d; (4) \u201c[undertake such other district-specific remedial measures as identified in the 2009 assessments or as otherwise necessary to ensure the effective and efficient use of funds in the districts\u2019 budgets;\u201d (5) \u201c[a]ward attorneys\u2019 fees to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>[plaintiffs] pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:6-2 [(f)]\u201d; and (6) grant plaintiffs \u201c[s]ueh other relief as the [e]ourt may deem appropriate and necessary to ensure remediation of the constitutional violation found in this litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">On November 7, 2014, the Department filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. The trial judge granted the Department\u2019s motion on December 15, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">In her oral decision, the judge focused on whether plaintiffs could use a <em>Rule </em>4:67-6 summary proceeding to obtain their requested relief. She characterized plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief as \u201csweeping,\u201d and expressed concern about the limited record in this case compared to the records before the Supreme Court in the Abbott eases, specifically <em>Abbott XXL</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">With respect to the procedural issue, the judge noted that <em>Rule </em>4:67-6 is a \u201cvery narrow rule\u201d that was \u201cnever intended to supplant other jurisdictional exercises by [S]tate agencies.\u201d Specifically, the judge highlighted that \u201cthere was never any finding as to what level of funding under SFRA was essential to provide a [thorough and efficient education] in [the Bacon] districts\u201d in the 2009 needs assessments. The judge further noted that the needs assessments lacked \u201cdirectory language,\u201d an \u201comnibus order,\u201d or a global conclusion \u201cthat full funding of SFRA is necessary for a thorough and efficient education in each one of the Bacon districts.\u201d As a result, the judge determined that a summary proceeding under <em>Rule </em>4:67-6 was not an appropriate vehicle to obtain plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief and granted the Department\u2019s motion to dismiss. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">We employ a plenary standard of review over a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>Rezem Family Associates, L.P. v. Borough of Millstone, </em>423 <em>N.J.Super. </em>103, 114, 30 A.3d 1061 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>366, 29 A.3d 739 (2011). The narrow issue presented in this case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>whether plaintiffs properly brought this action under <em>Rule </em>4:67-6(a)(2). For the following reasons, we conclude they did not and that therefore the trial judge properly dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Under <em>Rule </em>4:67-6, an administrative agency or a non-agency party can institute a summary proceeding in Superior Court to enforce an agency order. If the plaintiff is a non-agency party, then the rule applies to \u201call such enforcement actions brought by a party to the administrative proceeding in whose favor <em>a written order or determination </em>was entered affording that party <em>specific relief.\u201d R. </em>4:67-6(a)(2). (emphasis added). <em>Rule </em>4:67-6 exists \u201cto provide judicial remedies in aid of agency orders where necessary.\u201d <em>In re A-1 Jersey Moving &amp; Storage, Inc., </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>33, 40, 706 A.2d 752 (App.Div.1998). Additionally, parties cannot challenge the validity of an administrative order collaterally in a <em>Rule </em>4:67-6 proceeding. <em>State Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. v. Mazza &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>406 <em>N.J.Super. </em>13, 23, 966 A.2d 82 (App.Div.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">We have observed that <em>Rule </em>4:67-6 enforcement actions are analogous to \u201ca motion for enforcement of litigant\u2019s rights under <em>Rule </em>1:10-3 in a judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Mazza, supra, </em>406 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 29, 966 A.2d 82 (citing <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. State of N.J., Dep\u2019t of Pub. Advocate, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>336, 344, 571 A.2d 957 (1990)). \u201cThe scope of relief in a motion in aid of litigants\u2019 rights is limited to remediation of the violation of a court order.\u201d <em>Abbott XXI, supra, </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>at 371, 20 A.3d 1018. Because <em>Rule </em>4:67-6 is the administrative counterpart to <em>Rule </em>1:10-3, the scope of relief that can be afforded to a party instituting a summary enforcement action is similarly limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">To be successful in pursuing a summary action under <em>Rule </em>4:67-6, a litigant must show that there is a \u201cspecific and unequivocal\u201d order in place. <em>Abbott v. Burke, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>537, 565, 790 A.2d 842 (2002) <em>(Abbott VII) </em>(LaVecchia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The order must afford the enforcing party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>\u201cspecific relief.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:67-6(a)(2). The litigant must also show that the State agency \u201chas failed to comply with the order and that the court\u2019s assistance is necessary to secure compliance.\u201d <em>Mazza, supra, </em>406 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 29, 966 A.2d 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Applying these principles, we conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted in a summary proceeding under <em>Rule </em>4:67-6(a)(2). No \u201cwritten order or determination\u201d was entered in their favor that afforded them the \u201cspecific relief\u2019 they sought in their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">In their complaint, plaintiffs described the individual September 14, 2009 needs assessments as \u201cfinal determinations\u201d by the Department</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">that the funding and high quality preschool provided by [SFRA], along with facilities improvements and other measures, will afford students in [the Bacon] districts a thorough and efficient education ... thereby remediating the constitutional violation found by [the Board] and upheld by the Superior Court, Appellate Division____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">However, the structure of the needs assessments themselves belie plaintiffs\u2019 arguments. The needs assessments consist of sixteen distinct reports that focus on sixteen individual districts. There is no overall report that draws conclusions about the state of the Bacon districts as a group. To the contrary, as the Board directed, the needs assessments attempt to identify the unique issues that each district faced back in 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">The following examples illustrate the point. In the Lawrence School District Needs Assessment, the Department focused on the issues presented by that district\u2019s small size and recommended that the district pursue regionalization. On the other hand, the Lakewood School District Needs Assessment addressed the effect that the district\u2019s policy of courtesy busing non-public school students had on its finances and recommended that the policy be reconsidered. In the Buena Regional Needs Assessment, the Department stated that the district \u201cmust address the high personnel costs and loss of productivity that results from teachers spending so little time on instructional activities____\u201d The needs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>assessments for the remaining districts set forth other district-specific recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In spite of the fact that the sixteen needs assessments sought individualized solutions to each district\u2019s unique issues, plaintiffs requested sweeping, identical relief for all of the Bacon districts. It is undisputed that the needs assessments evaluated the effect of SFRA. However, plaintiffs mischaracterize the import of those recommendations. In some of the assessments, the Department identified that SFRA funding would have a positive effect on the district. For example, in the Lawrence School District Assessment, the Department noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN\">although the SFRA and complementary legislation ... provide the tools that will permit [the district] to improve educational opportunities for its students and address its identified needs, the extremely small size of the school district poses significant challenges____Regionalization ... will be critical to addressing those challenges in this district.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">On appeal, plaintiffs attempt to extrapolate this statement to apply to all the Bacon districts. However, the Department did not reach similar conclusions for all of the Bacon districts. Thus, there was no \u201cspecific order\u201d that could be enforced for all of the Bacon districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">In the needs assessments, the Department\u2019s final conclusions can be roughly grouped into three general categories: (1) SFRA funding will continue to improve educational opportunities; (2) SFRA funding will continue to improve educational opportunities but regionalization may be necessary; or (3) the district needs to better utilize available funds. The recommendations of the needs assessments follow the Board\u2019s original conclusion that the Bacon districts have different needs and will ultimately require different solutions than the Abbott districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">Significantly, none of the needs assessments concluded that fully funding the SFRA is necessary to ensure that students in the Bacon districts receive a thorough and efficient education. The needs assessments do not require the Department or the Legislature to fully fund the districts under SFRA, or institute specific pre-school programs or building projects in the districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Plaintiffs argue that the needs assessments are enforceable because in <em>Bacon, supra, </em>398 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 618, 942 A.2d 827, we instructed the Department \u201cto further determine whether, in light of the proven educational deficits already found by the Board, the [SFRA\u2019s] remedial measures afford students in the Bacon districts the thorough and efficient education to which they are constitutionally entitled.\u201d According to plaintiffs, because the Department was instructed on remand to use the needs assessments to determine whether SFRA would remediate the constitutional violation, the conclusions and recommendations in the needs assessments are enforceable as an agency order.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">However, as noted above, the needs assessments lack clear findings about the remedial effect of the SFRA on the constitutional violations that the Board originally identified. If the Department failed to comply with our directive in <em>Bacon, supra, </em>that the Commissioner determine whether SFRA provided the Bacon districts with a thorough and efficient education, plaintiffs\u2019 appropriate recourse was an appeal of the needs assessments. While plaintiffs assert that \u201c[i]n plain and unequivocal language, [the Department] determined that the SFRA provides adequate funding ... to ensure the Bacon students [receive] a thorough and efficient education,\u201d that language is not found in the needs assessments. The plain language of the needs assessments cannot be construed as an administrative order in plaintiffs\u2019 favor entitling them to full SFRA funding or any of the broad relief sought in their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Furthermore, the needs assessments contain no directives. As noted by the trial judge, the needs assessments lack an \u201comnibus order.\u201d In a <em>Rule </em>4:67-6 proceeding, the trial court\u2019s powers are strictly limited to <em>enforcement </em>of an order. <em>See Mazza, supra, </em>406 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 23, 966 A.2d 82 (trial court cannot rule on the validity of an agency order in a <em>Rule </em>4:67-6 proceeding). Without any directives or an omnibus order, there was nothing for the trial court to enforce and plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was therefore properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Plaintiffs make two additional arguments. First, they assert their complaint was properly filed under <em>Rule </em>4:67-6 because, in our January 12, 2012 order, we \u201cinstuctfed]\u201d them to proceed in this fashion. We disagree. Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, the January 12, 2012 order was not an \u201cinstruction\u201d by this court to file a summary action under <em>Rule </em>4:67-6, nor a guarantee that any such action, if pursued, would be successful. Instead, we simply made clear that plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an order in aid of litigants\u2019 rights lacked merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Plaintiffs also argue for the first time in their reply brief that we should exercise our original jurisdiction in this matter pursuant to <em>Rule </em>2:10-5; declare that the Department has violated New Jersey\u2019s Constitution by failing to ensure that plaintiffs all receive full SFRA funding; and implement specific remedies concerning future funding. We again disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">We generally decline to consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>L.J. Zucca, Inc. v. Allen Bros. Wholesale Distribs.

By failing to raise their original jurisdiction argument in their initial brief, plaintiffs have waived this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Moreover, we exercise our original factfinding authority under <em>Rule </em>2:10-5 only \u201cwith great frugality and in none but a case free of doubt.\u201d <em>Tomaino v.
