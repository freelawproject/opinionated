They instituted this action against various defendants seeking damages to remediate the resultant environmental contamination. The asserted violations under the Act pertain to two alleged fraudulent transfers of a residence originally owned by defendant Stephan Musey, located on Geissinger Avenue (the Geissinger property).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">In 2006, Musey sold the Geissinger property to his daughter, Haynes, for $1 (the 2006 transfer), and retained a life estate for himself until his death in June 2008. In 2012, Haynes, after holding title for approximately six years, sold the Geissinger property to the Goldstines (the 2012 transfer), who are the in-laws of the grandson.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">Plaintiffs contended that the transfers were designed to avoid collection on any potential judgment against the Estate following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Musey\u2019s death. The judge denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion to assert new claims under the Act, finding the new claims time barred under either the four-year statute of limitations (SOL) or one-year tolling period contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-31(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Plaintiffs, who have characterized the underlying environmental dispute as a tort case, urge us to conclude that the commencement of the SOL under the Act runs from a different date than in commercial contract transaction cases. Plaintiffs admit that in commercial contract transaction cases, the SOL under the Act runs from the date of the transfer. They maintain, however, that in tort cases, the SOL is triggered once they obtain a judgment. Haynes and the Goldstines assert that the SOL under the Act is triggered on the date of the alleged fraudulent transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Applying the plain text of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-31, we hold that the commencement of the SOL for claims under the Act in an underlying tort case is not contingent on obtaining a judgment. Thus, the SOL for causes of action under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-25(a), regardless of whether the claimant has become a judgment creditor, expires four years from the date the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred or, if later, one year after the transfer or obligation was discovered by the claimant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We decline to draw the distinction requested by plaintiffs that the commencement of the SOL under the Act runs from a different date in tort disputes than in commercial contract transaction cases. We conclude that the proposed claims under the Act are barred and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Musey owned property comprising three separate but adjacent lots located in Vineland (the property). Between 1972 and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>1980s, Musey and his son, defendant William Musey (the son), operated an auto body and repair shop on the property. By 2003, Musey admitted to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) that the property contained contaminated soil. The NJDEP required Musey to remediate the property, which he never did.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Without resolving the environmental issues, Musey and defendant Marco Construction and Management, Inc. (Marco Construction) entered into a joint venture agreement to build and sell two residential homes on a portion of the property. Marco Construction took title to the property, built the houses, and listed them for sale using defendant Balsley/Losco Real Estate (Balsley/Losco). Plaintiffs then purchased the homes without knowledge of the environmental problems. Soon after, Musey made the 2006 transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">In January 2008, plaintiffs filed their complaint against Marco Construction, Stephan Musey, the son, Dominic Antonini (owner of Marco Construction), and Balsley/Losco.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After Musey passed away, plaintiffs named the Estate as a party, which defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">The Estate was probated in July 2008. As to the probate matter, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel indicated generally in his merits brief that plaintiffs \u201cwere claimants in the [Ejstate, however, their claims were never addressed.\u201d There is no evidence in this record plaintiffs contended in the probate matter that the Geissinger property constituted an asset of the Estate. By the time the Estate was probated, Haynes had title to the Geissinger property, which had been publicly recorded in the county clerk\u2019s office for approximately one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>In March 2011, more than four years after the 2006 transfer, the son filed an individual petition in bankruptcy. As a result, this matter was stayed until March 2012. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel indicated in his merits brief that plaintiffs were \u201ccreditors\u201d in the bankruptcy proceedings. There is no evidence in this record that plaintiffs questioned the propriety of the 2006 transfer, or that they argued in the bankruptcy matter the son played any role in the 2006 transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">In 2012, Haynes sold the Geissinger property to the Goldstines for $110,000. Plaintiffs speculate the Geissinger property is worth more than the sale price. The grandson and his wife, the Goldstines\u2019 daughter, then occupied the Geissinger property. On December 6, 2013, the court entered default judgment against the Estate and awarded plaintiffs $1,843,210.07 on their CFA claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Plaintiffs then filed their motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint, asserting claims under the Act. In February 2014, the judge conducted oral argument and on March 11, 2014, the judge denied the motion, issuing a written opinion and entering the order under review.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The judge concluded the four-year SOL contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-31(a) barred plaintiffs from bringing a claim under the Act as to the 2006 transfer. The judge also addressed whether the one-year tolling period contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-31(a) saved plaintiffs\u2019 claim as to the 2006 transfer. He found, based on a letter from plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, plaintiffs knew about the 2006 transfer in May 2012. As a result, the judge concluded that the one-year tolling period expired in May 2013. Consequently, he determined plaintiffs\u2019 claim as to the 2006 transfer was time barred. The judge did not reach the claim related to the 2012 transfer because barring the 2006 claim broke the chain of title and precluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>plaintiffs from arguing the Geissinger property was an asset of the Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">In 2014, the judge conducted a bench trial as to the remaining defendants. In September 2014, the judge rendered a thirty-five page written opinion expressing his findings of fact and conclusions of law. On October 16, 2014, the judge entered a final judgment in plaintiffs\u2019 favor against Marco Construction on Count One (CFA),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Count Two (breach of contract), Count Three (misrepresentation), and Count Six (Spill Act).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge dismissed Count Four (negligence) and Count Five (equitable fraud).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The remaining parties either settled or were dismissed from the case and have not participated in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">On appeal, plaintiffs argue that (1) the commencement of the SOL for their claims under the Act was triggered by obtaining final judgment on October 16, 2014; (2) their claims under the Act should have been tolled under the adverse domination rule; (3) the remedies under the Act are \u201ccumulative not exclusive\u201d and are therefore \u201cnot [ijntended to [displace [cjommon [l]aw [ajctions\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>and (4) their claims under the Act relate back to the filing of the complaint in January 2008, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:9-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The question as to what date triggers the SOL under the Act is a legal one. \u2018When deciding a purely legal issue, review is de novo.\u201d <em>Kaye v. Rosefielde, </em>223 <em>N.J. </em>218, 229, 121 A.3d 862 (2015) (quoting <em>Fair Share Hous. Ctr., Inc. v. N.J. State League of Muns., </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>489, 493 n. 1, 25 A.3d 1063 (2011)). Here, the judge properly concluded that the SOL is triggered by the date of the 2006 transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\"><em>Rule </em>4:9-1 governs motions to amend pleadings. Motions for leave to amend are granted liberally, \u201ceven if the ultimate merits of the amendment are uncertain.\u201d <em>Prime Accounting Dep\u2019t v. Twp. of Carney\u2019s Point, </em>212 <em>N.J. </em>493, 511, 58 A.3d 690 (2013). Nonetheless,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">[o]ne exception to that rule arises when the amendment would be \u201cfutile,\u201d because \u201cthe amended claim will nonetheless fail and, hence, allowing the amendment would be a useless endeavor.\u201d <em>Notts v. Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>490, 501 [888 A.2d 464] (2006). \u201c \u2018[C]ourts are free to refuse leave to amend when the newly asserted claim is not sustainable as a matter of law____ [T]here is no point to permitting the filing of an amended pleading when a subsequent motion to dismiss must be granted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Interchange State Bank v. Rinaldi, </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>239, 256-57 [696 A.2d 744] (App.Div.1997)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(alterations in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">We conclude that the proposed amendment asserting claims under the Act would be futile because the SOL expired. As a result, the judge did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">We reject plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the commencement of the SOL under the Act should be analyzed differently in tort and commercial contract transaction cases. Specifically, plaintiffs maintain the SOL under the Act, in tort cases, is triggered only after a party obtains final judgment. The premise of this contention, which is indubitably incorrect, is that the transfers of the Geissinger property amounted to claims under the Act only after plaintiffs became judgment creditors in the underlying tort case.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Plaintiffs focus primarily on the \u201cright to payment\u201d language contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-21, asserting that in an underlying tort case, a claimant enjoys that right only after obtaining a judgment. To address plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, we must interpret the text of the SOL under the Act. Our paramount goal in interpreting a statute is to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent, and \u201cgenerally[ ] the best indicator of that intent is the statutory language.\u201d <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005). When interpreting a statute, we give words \u201ctheir ordinary meaning and significance.\u201d <em>Tumpson v. Farina, </em>218 <em>N.J. </em>450, 467, 95 A.3d 210 (2014) (quoting <em>DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 492, 874 A.2d 1039).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The plain language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-31(a) clearly provides that the triggering date for calculating the SOL under the Act is the transfer or the date when the obligation was incurred. The text of the SOL does not differentiate between tort and commercial contract transaction cases. It is clear that becoming a judgment creditor is not a precondition to the commencement of the SOL related to underlying tort eases.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">A cause of action with respect to a fraudulent transfer or obligation under this article is extinguished unless action is brought:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6z\">a. Under subsection a. of R.S. 25:2-25, within four years <em>after the transfer </em>was made or the obligation was incurred or, if later, within one year <em>after the transfer </em>or obligation was discovered by the elaimant[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-31(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The Act addresses fraudulent transfers, not solely as to present creditors, but also as to future creditors\u2014i.e., creditors whose claims arose after the transfer was made but not necessarily before judgment in an underlying matter is entered. N.J.S.A \u2022 25:2-25 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor, whether the creditor\u2019s claim arose before or after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2K\">a. With actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">The Act provides precise definitions of the terms used. A \u201ctransfer\u201d is defined as \u201cevery mode, direct or indirect, absolute or conditional, voluntary or involuntary, of disposing of or parting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>with an asset or an interest in an asset, and includes payment of money, release, lease, and creation of a lien or other encumbrance.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-22. For cases involving real property, \u201ctransfer\u201d has been defined as the date real property is recorded. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>25:2\u201428(a)(1); <em>Boardwalk Regency Corp. v. Burd, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>162, 165, 620 A.2d 448 (App.Div.1993). A \u201cdebtor\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who is liable on a claim.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-21. A \u201c \u2018claim\u2019 means a right to payment, whether or not the right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>A \u201ccreditor\u201d is \u201ca person who has a claim.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Importantly, a claim, as that term is defined in the Act, need not be reduced to a judgment. Consequently, a \u201ccreditor\u201d may include \u201cthe holder of an unliquidated tort claim or a contingent claim.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also SASCO, supra, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>at 588, 767 A.2d 469 (stating the clear language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-31 reveals \u201cthe Legislature concluded that the date of judgment was not determinative of the timeliness of claims under the [Act]\u201d); <em>Flood v. Caro Corp., </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>398, 405, 640 A.2d 306 (App.Div.1994) (stating \u201c[a]ny creditor, with or without a judgment, may prosecute a suit\u201d under the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">As a result, the \u201cright to payment\u201d of a claim, referenced in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-21, is not dependent on obtaining a judgment because the Act refers to claims \u201cwhether or not the right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Because \u201c \u2018[t]he [Act] does not prevent a present or future \u201ccreditor\u201d from seeking a remedy prior to judgment[,]\u2019 \u201d <em>SASCO, supra, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>at 586-87, 767 A.2d 469 (quoting <em>Intili v. DiGiorgio, </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>652, 659, 693 A.2d 573 (Ch.Div.1997)), it is logical to conclude in all eases that the SOL provided in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-31(a) commences from the date of the transfer or the date the transfer is discovered. Under the Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u201c[a]ny creditor, with or without a judgment, may prosecute a suit.\u201d <em>Flood, supra, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 405, 640 A.2d 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Granting plaintiffs\u2019 request to use a different triggering SOL date depending on the nature of the claim\u2014commercial contract transaction or tort cases\u2014would require us to rewrite an enactment of the Legislature or presume that the Legislature intended something other than what it clearly expressed in the plain language of the statute. It is well settled that \u201c[a] court may neither rewrite a plainly-written enactment of the Legislature nor presume that the Legislature intended something other than that expressed by way of the plain language.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connell v. State, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>484, 488, 795 A.2d 857 (2002). As a result, we will not do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Although the plain language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-31 is clear, the purpose and history of the Act, as well as New Jersey Supreme Court precedent, provide conclusive support for our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">New Jersey adopted the Act in 1988 to replace the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, which had been in effect since 1919. <em>SASCO, supra, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>at 584, 767 A.2d 469. \u201cThe Act modernizes the law respecting the rights and remedies of creditors in eases of transfers of assets by debtors[,] the design or effect of which is to prevent or impede satisfaction of claims out of the debtor\u2019s assets, or to prefer favored claimants.\u201d <em>Flood, supra, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 403, 640 A.2d 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">\u201cThe purpose of the [Act] is to prevent a debtor from placing his or her property beyond a creditor\u2019s reach.\u201d <em>Gilchinsky v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank N.J., </em>159 <em>N.J. </em>463, 475, 732 A.2d 482 (1999). \u201cUnderlying the Act is the notion that a debtor cannot deliberately cheat a creditor by removing his property from the \u2018jaws of execution.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cFraudulent conveyance claims thus allow the creditor to undo the \u25a0wrongful transaction so as to bring the property within the ambit of collection.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>prohibits any transfer intended \u201cto hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-25(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The definition of claim contained within <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-21 is derived from Section 101(4) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 101(4). 7A <em>Uniform Laws Annotated, Business and, Financial Laws </em>(Master ed. 2006) 16. \u201cSince the purpose of the [Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act] is primarily to protect unsecured creditors against transfers and obligations injurious to their rights, the words \u2018claim\u2019 and \u2018debt\u2019 ... generally have reference to an unsecured claim and debt.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Indeed, \u201c[u]nder the Bankruptcy Code, the courts have noted that the term \u2018claim\u2019 has been defined as broadly as possible.\u201d <em>Tronox Inc. v. Kerr McGee Corp. (In re Tronox Inc.), </em>503 <em>B.R. </em>239, 309 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.2013). Other courts have adopted this same principle in cases interpreting then-state\u2019s Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act. <em>See, e.g., ibid. </em>(referencing the same definition of \u201cclaim\u201d in both Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act); <em>Skyline Potato Co. v.

Markal Sales Corp., </em>311 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>552, 244 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>120, 724 <em>N.E.2d </em>1008, 1010 (stating that \u201cthe clear and unambiguous wording of the Act demonstrates!; ] the four-year limitation period begins to run on the date the challenged transfer was made\u201d), <em>appeal denied by, </em>189 <em>Ill.2d </em>660, 246 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>915, 731 <em>N.E.2d </em>764 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">We now apply these legal principles to the facts of this case. As to the 2006 transfer, it is undisputed the four-year SOL expired in 2010. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel admitted before us plaintiffs knew about the 2006 transfer in May 2012. Thus, the one-year tolling provision under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-31(a) expired in May 2013. Plaintiffs filed their motion for leave to amend in December 2013. As a result, the claim related to the 2006 transfer is time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">As to the 2012 transfer, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel conceded at oral argument that if the 2006 transfer was untimely under the Act, then the purported claim as to the 2012 transfer would be barred as well. The claim as to the 2012 transfer, that Haynes fraudulently transferred property that belonged to the Estate, is dependent on the Geissinger property being part of the Estate. If plaintiffs are barred by the SOL from pursuing the allegation that the 2006 transfer was fraudulent, then what Haynes did with the Geissinger property six years later is irrelevant. We emphasize that in the probate matter, and even in the bankruptcy proceedings, plaintiffs did not fully pursue any argument that the Geis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>singer property constituted an asset of the Estate, or that the co-executors wrongfully retained assets of the Estate. If plaintiffs are precluded from challenging Musey\u2019s transfer to Haynes of the Geissinger property in 2006, then plaintiffs cannot now argue that Haynes, six years later, fraudulently transferred that property to the Goldstines. The practical effect of barring plaintiffs from raising claims under the Act as to the 2006 transfer means that by the time of the 2012 transfer, the Geissinger property was neither Musey\u2019s nor the Estate\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">After reviewing the record and the briefs, we conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 remaining arguments are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E). We add the following brief remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Plaintiffs rely on the non-precedential opinion of <em>Wing v. Dockstader, </em>482 <em>Fed.Appx. </em>361 (10th Cir.2012). In that matter, the court concluded Utah\u2019s Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act supported the plaintiffs contention his claims should have been tolled under the doctrine of adverse domination, a corporate law equitable tolling doctrine applicable where wrongdoers control or dominate a corporation and are unlikely to bring claims in the name of the corporation against themselves. Plaintiffs offer no reasonable explanation for how such a doctrine would be applicable in this setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-12\"> Although \"Goldstine\" is also spelled \"Goldstein\" in the record, we adopt the judge's spelling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b377-13\"> We adopt the judge's finding at the motion hearing that the transfer was made in 2012.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b378-8\"> Although our Supreme Court refers to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-31 as a statute of limitations, <em>SASCO 1997 NI, LLC v.
