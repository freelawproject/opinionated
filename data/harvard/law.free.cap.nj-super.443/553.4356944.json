The jury acquitted defendant of the remaining counts of the indictment, including burglary, robbery, murder, felony-murder and related weapons offenses. The judge granted the State\u2019s motion to sentence defendant as a persistent offender, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3(a), and imposed the maximum extended term of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment, with an eighty-five percent period of parole ineligibility pursuant to the No Early Release Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-7.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">Defendant raises the following issues for our consideration on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-11\">\n<em>POINT i</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-12\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED PREJUDICIALLY IN RULING THAT UNDER <em>[RULE] </em>3:17 THE POLICE WERE NOT REQUIRED TO RECORD THE QUESTIONING OF DEFENDANT BETWEEN HIS ARREST AND HIS STATEMENT THAT \u201cPIPE MADE ME DO IT\u201d BECAUSE THEY VIEWED HIM AS A WITNESS RATHER THAN A SUSPECT FOR THE CRIMINAL ACTS COMMITTED AGAINST [THE VICTIM],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-13\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-14\">DEFENDANT\u2019S SENTENCE IS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE AND UNDULY PUNITIVE BECAUSE IT IS FOUNDED ON IMPROPER FINDINGS REGARDING AGGRAVATING FACTORS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>We have considered these arguments in light of the record and applicable legal standards. We affirm defendant\u2019s conviction and remand the matter for reconsideration of the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">A pre-trial evidentiary hearing was held regarding the admissibility of defendant\u2019s statement to investigators.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lieutenant Thomas J. Kelly of the Essex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office Homicide Squad testified that on Thursday, April 15, 2010, he responded to a single-family home in Essex Fells to investigate a homicide. The ninety-one-year-old victim was found dead in his home office with his hands and feet bound. The home was in disarray, and the victim\u2019s body bore \u201cdefensive type wounds\u201d on his forearms as well as a laceration to his neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Kelly learned that the victim\u2019s wife last had contact with him at approximately 7:00 p.m. the night before. She told detectives that the couple regularly used a car service to drive to New York City where they had an apartment. On April 13, she went to New York alone. The driver was not her usual driver but someone \u201cwith the name Reggie.\u201d According to Kelly, using several \u201cdatabases,\u201d police were able to identify \u201cReggie\u201d as defendant, and they located his possible residence in East Orange. Defendant was the subject of an open arrest warrant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Detectives arrived at the East Orange address and took defendant into custody on the active warrant. Kelly advised defendant of his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights by reading from a card Kelly kept in his wallet. At approximately 8:30 p.m., after being transported to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, defendant agreed to speak with detectives. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>We quote extensively from Kelly\u2019s testimony which sets forth in detail the foreknowledge detectives possessed at this point in the investigation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">At this point[,] we ... believed [defendant] possibly was the last person to have contact with our victim. We questioned him about ... his Aunt ... Sheila Humphreys ... who either owns or operates the company that the [victim and his wife] utilize when they travel back and forth from the City____Mrs. Humphreys ... had asked [defendant] to make the pickup____[T]his wasn\u2019t the first time. He had done it one other time he told us in that initial interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">[Defendant] reported that he went to the location on [April 13], picked up [the victim\u2019s wife]. He advised us that [the victim] did not make the trip with her, and ... he noted that____[H]e drove her into the City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-11\">[Defendant] explained ... that the normal procedure ... is the driver goes to the person\u2019s house in their own car, and then you pick up the person\u2019s car, make the transport to and from in that vehicle, and return the vehicle to the person\u2019s house and then get in your own vehicle and go about your business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-12\">[Defendant] advised us that on [April 13] that\u2019s not what he did. He told us that he came back from the City and instead of going back to ... the [victim\u2019s] residence, he took their car for a ride. In the course of doing that, ... he ... met up with a friend of his named Pipe____[H]e believed his first name [w]as Shaun and that he was from East Orange____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-15\">[Defendant] told us that at some point he received a phone call from his aunt making sure that he was back with the transport____[H]e went back up with the [victim\u2019s] ca\u00ed- and returned it to [the victim\u2019s] home____[P]ipe was with him when he returned the car----[T]hey parked the car the way they\u2019re supposed to, and they got back into the car that [defendant] drove to get up there and they left Essex Pells.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-20\">Defendant denied ever returning to the Essex Fells house.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-21\">At approximately 2:45 a.m., detectives applied for and obtained a communication data warrant (CDW) to \u201cplot out [defendant\u2019s] cell phone to see if his movements as ... described ... in his interview were accurate.\u201d While this occurred, defendant remained in custody in the interrogation room on the active warrant, but was not questioned further.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-22\">By 9:00 a.m., records secured through the CDW revealed that defendant\u2019s cellphone had \u201chit off a cell tower\u201d near the victim\u2019s home at approximately 8:00 p.m. on April 14. This was contrary to defendant\u2019s claim that he had never returned to the victim\u2019s home after leaving there the prior evening. Confronted with this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>information, defendant asked to speak to Kelly alone and told Mm, \u201cPipe made me take him back up there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">At this point, Kelly had another detective \u201cstart the video camera so we could start recording anything that was said ... from that point forward.\u201d Kelly re-administered <em>Miranda </em>warnings to defendant, who executed a waiver of rights form and agreed to provide a statement to detectives, but that process was not recorded. The video recording, approximately thirty-eight minutes in length, was played for the judge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Kelly denied that defendant suffered any injuries while in custody, or that defendant ever asked to speak to an attorney. On cross-examination, Kelly acknowledged the \u201cAttorney General Guidelines\u201d regarding the recordation of statements, but asserted that \u201c[t]he [Guidelines don\u2019t require that the <em>Miranda </em>itself [be] recorded.\u201d Kelly stated that defendant first became a suspect in the homicide \u201cwhen I knew his cell phone was up in th[e] area\u201d of the victim\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Detective Philip Gregory testified as a defense witness. He accompanied Kelly during defendant\u2019s arrest, corroborated that <em>Miranda </em>rights were read to defendant in the police vehicle, and started the video recording machine outside of the mterview room. Gregory believed that the re-administration of <em>Miranda </em>rights to defendant was recorded. Gregory also denied that any officer used physical force against defendant, or that defendant was injured in any way during the time he was in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Defendant\u2019s girlfriend testified that, when defendant drove her to work during the afternoon hours on the date of his arrest, he bore no signs of physical injury. Defendant testified that he was treated harshly when arrested, and detectives neither read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights nor told him why he was arrested. Defendant claimed that in the interrogation room, detectives made him \u201cfeel\u201d like he was in custody for the homicide and denied defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>request for an attorney. Defendant testified that Gregory and other officers physically assaulted him. He acknowledged initialing the <em>Miranda </em>waiver form for Kelly, but he only did so after first refusing because he feared additional physical abuse. Defendant further testified that Kelly told him what to say prior to recording the statement. Defendant was in pain upon his arrival at the county jail, and sheriffs officers transported him to the hospital where he was diagnosed with contusions and a \u201cruptured eardrum.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">On cross-examination, defendant admitted familiarity with the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, as evidenced by three waiver forms defendant admittedly executed following prior arrests, and also acknowledged his prior criminal convictions. Although initially claiming that he had never given a statement to police in the past, the prosecutor confronted defendant with a signed statement from one of his prior arrests. Defendant had forgotten because it occurred long ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">After argument by the attorneys, the judge orally explained his decision to admit defendant\u2019s statement into evidence. In a written opinion that followed, the judge specifically credited Kelly\u2019s testimony and discredited defendant\u2019s. The judge made various observations from the video recording that belied defendant\u2019s assertions of maltreatment and physical abuse, and noted that medical notes did not support a conclusion that defendant\u2019s ear had been injured seven hours earlier, as defendant claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Addressing the salient issue on appeal, the judge wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxQ\">[Defendant was ... read his <em>Miranda </em>warnings at the time he was taken into custody. Further, while defendant argues that the <em>Miranda </em>waiver should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>been electronically recorded pursuant to <em>[Rule] </em>3:17(a), the rule requires only that \u201ccustodial interrogations conducted in a place of detention must be electronically recorded when the person being interrogated is charged.\u201d Moreover, \u201cthe failure to electronically record a defendant\u2019s custodial interrogation ... shall be a factor for consideration by the trial court in determining the admissibility of a statement.\u201d <em>R. </em>3:17(d). Here, <em>as both officers testified, </em>defendant was a witness because he was possibly the last person to see [the] victim alive and did not become a suspect until he indicated he wanted to talk, when he was again issued the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and given a waiver form to sign before providing an electronically recorded statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The judge concluded that the \u201ccustodial interrogation was properly conducted[,] ... the requisite warnings [were] given[,] ... [and] the State ha[d] proven beyond a reasonable doubt that ... defendant knowingly and intelligently waived each and every one of those rights ... and that ... defendant neither invoked nor attempted to invoke any of those rights thereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The State introduced defendant\u2019s statement at trial. It suffices to say that defendant claimed Woodson demanded that they return to the victim\u2019s home on the night of April 14, and told defendant he wanted to \u201crob[ ]\u201d the place. Defendant reluctantly drove there and waited in the car as Woodson entered through the front door of the home. Defendant never knew the victim had been murdered until his aunt told him.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Defendant testified before the jury and gave a similar account of events, admitting that he agreed to drive Woodson to the home with the intention that Woodson enter to burglarize the house if no one was at home. He also testified regarding the physical abuse he sustained during interrogation by police. As noted, the jury convicted defendant of conspiracy to commit burglary but acquitted him of all other charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">Before us, defendant contends that the judge erred by concluding the interrogation did not need to be recorded pursuant to <em>Rule </em>3:17 (the <em>Rule) </em>until defendant uttered the phrase, \u201cPipe made me take him back up there.\u201d Defendant contends that the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>erred as a matter of law by concluding the officers\u2019 subjective belief controlled, and he argues we should review de novo the judge\u2019s conclusion that defendant was not a suspect until that point. He urges \u201can objective standard\u201d should apply, i.e., application of the <em>Rule </em>should turn on whether a defendant is a \u201csuspect\u201d based upon \u201cobjective rather than subjective circumstances.\u201d Defendant argues that, although the <em>Rule </em>does not mandate suppression of his statement if violated, the error nevertheless requires reversal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The State argues that the detectives were not required to record their initial interview with defendant because he was not arrested for any of the crimes listed in the <em>Rule </em>which trigger law enforcement\u2019s obligation to record the interrogation. Alternatively, the State argues that objectively looking at the facts known to Kelly, defendant was not a suspect in the murder until Kelly confronted him with the CDW information, and defendant blurted out, \u201cPipe made me take him back up there.\u201d From that point, the State argues investigators complied with the <em>Rule. </em>Lastly, the State contends that any error was harmless, because the jury obviously believed defendant\u2019s version of events and acquitted him of all but the conspiracy count at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The <em>Rule </em>is relatively new, having been adopted by the Court in 2005, following its decision in <em>State v. Cook, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>533, 847 A.2d 530 (2004), the formation of a special committee, <em>id. </em>at 562, 847 A.2d 530, and receipt of the committee\u2019s report. No reported decision has fully construed the <em>Rule\u2019s </em>somewhat ambiguous provisions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We begin by clarifying our standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">As the Court most recently said, \u201c[a]ppellate courts reviewing a grant or denial of a motion to suppress must defer to the factual findings of the trial court so long as those findings are supported by sufficient evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Hubbard, supra, </em>222 <em>N.J. </em>at 262, 118 A.3d 314. \u201cWe defer to those findings of fact because they \u2018are substantially influenced by [an] opportunity to hear and see the witnesses and to have the \u201cfeel\u201d of the case, which a reviewing court cannot enjoy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 161, 199 A.2d 809 (1964)). We do not, however, defer to the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions, which we review de novo. <em>Id. </em>at 263, 118 A.3d 314. \u201cAnd for mixed questions of law and fact, we give deference ... to the supported factual findings of the trial court, but review de novo the lower court\u2019s application of any legal rules to such factual findings.\u201d <em>State v. Harris, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>391, 416, 859 A.2d 364 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Because interpretation of a court rule is a legal issue, our review is de novo. <em>State v. Tate, </em>220 <em>N.J. </em>393, 405, 106 A.3d 1195 (2015). \u201cThe approach taken in respect of the construction of court rules is the same as that for the construction of statutes.\u201d <em>State v. Clark, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>503, 508, 924 A.2d 542 (2007) (citing <em>Wiese v. Dedhia, 188 N.J. 587, </em>592, 911 A.2d 479 (2006)). \u201c[W]e typically begin by examining the plain language of a court rule, and give the words their ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Wiese, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>at 592, 911 A.2d 479). \u2018We turn to extrinsic materials when the language of the rule is ambiguous and lends itself to more than one plausible interpretation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508-09, 924 A.2d 542 (citing <em>Wiese, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>at 592, 911 A.2d 479).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">In <em>Cook, supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 542-46, 847 A.2d 530, the defendant was arrested on outstanding municipal warrants and interrogated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>on four separate occasions over two days; the sessions were not electronically recorded. The Court rejected defendant\u2019s claim that his due process rights were violated by the State\u2019s failure to record the interrogations, but it concluded \u201c[t]he proverbial \u2018time has arrived\u2019 ... to evaluate fully the protections that electronic recordation affords to both the State and to criminal defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562, 847 A.2d 530. The Court \u201cestablish[ed] a committee to study and make recommendations on the use of electronic recordation of custodial interrogations.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The Supreme Court Special Committee on Recordation of Custodial Interrogations (the Committee) issued its report on April 15, 2005. The report included a comprehensive analysis of the different recordation requirements adopted throughout the United States, as well as statutes and case law from sister states where policies had already been enacted. <em>Report of the Special Committee on Recordation of Custodial Interrogations, </em>at 6 (Apr. 15, 2005) (the <em>Committee </em>Report). The Committee made a series of recommendations including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">RECOMMENDATION 3: Electronic recording should occur when a custodial interrogation is being conducted in a place of detention and should begin at, and include, the point at which <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required to be given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">RECOMMENDATION 4: Electronic recording of custodial interrogations occurring in a place of detention should occur when the adult or juvenile being interrogated is charged with an offense requiring the use of a warrant pursuant to <em>[Buie] </em>3:3-lc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">RECOMMENDATION 5. The requirement for electronic recordation of custodial interrogations occurring in a place of detention should not apply in circumstances where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">(f) a statement is given at a time when the accused is not a suspect for the crime to which that statement relates while the accused is being interrogated for a different crime that does not require recordation! ]____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-12\"><em>[Committee Report </em>at 37-40.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">The rule proposed by the Committee included recommendation four and five but did not explicitly include the requirement in recommendation three, i.e., that recordation \u201cbegin at, and in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>elude, the point at which <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required to be given.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">On October 14, 2005, the Court ordered implementation of the <em>Rule, </em>effective January 1, 2006, in respect of all homicide offenses and January 1, 2007, for all other offenses specified in paragraph (a) of the <em>Rule. </em>The <em>Rule </em>as adopted mirrored the Committee\u2019s proposed rule and provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">a) Unless one of the exceptions set forth in paragraph (b) are present, <em>all custodial interrogations </em>conducted in a place of detention <em>must be electronically recorded when the person being interrogated is charged with murder, ... aggravated manslaughter, manslaughter, robbery, ... </em>burglary, ... any crime involving the possession or use of a firearm, or conspiracies or attempts to commit such crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">(b) <em>Electronic recordation pursuant to paragraph (a) must occur unless:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">(vi) <em>a statement is given at a time when the accused is not a suspect for the crime to which that statement relates while the accused is being interrogated for a different calme that does not require recordation,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">The State shall bear the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that one of the exceptions is applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">[R. 3:17 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">The failure to record the interrogation does not require suppression of a defendant\u2019s statement, but it \u201cshall be a factor for consideration by the trial court in determining the admissibility of a statement, and by the jury in determining whether the statement was made, and if so, what weight, if any, to give to the statement.\u201d <em>R. </em>3:17(d). Further, in the absence of recordation, the court \u201cshall, upon request of the defendant, provide the jury with a cautionary instruction.\u201d <em>R. </em>3:17(e); <em>see Model Jury Charge (Criminal), </em>\u201cStatements of Defendant (When Court finds Police Inexcusably Failed to Electronically Record Statement),\u201d (Approved 11/7/05).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">With this background in mind, we return to the arguments advanced on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The State contends that the detectives were under no obligation to record their initial interview with defendant because he was in custody on municipal warrants and had not been \u201ccharged with\u201d the homicide or any other crime listed in subsection (a) of the <em>Rule. </em>Defendant counters by arguing such an interpretation would permit police to question suspects in homicides without recording the interrogation, thereby defeating the prophylactic purposes of the <em>Rule. </em>Defendant also argues that the State\u2019s interpretation is inconsistent with the exception provided by subsection (b)(vi). We agree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Although subsection (a) is triggered when the person in custody is \u201cbeing interrogated\u201d and \u201ccharged with\u201d one of the listed offenses, subsection (b)(vi) excepts from the Rule\u2019s requirements the need to record a statement if <em>\u201cthe accused is not a suspect for the crime to which that statement relates </em>while the accused is being interrogated for a different crime that does not require recordation.\u201d <em>R. </em>3:17 (emphasis added). The State concedes the ambiguity of the operative terms used in the <em>Rule, </em>i.e., \u201ccharged with\u201d versus \u201cnot a suspect.\u201d Under the State\u2019s rationale, the <em>Rule </em>does not require recordation of a statement made by a defendant who is not charged with a listed crime, even if he is a suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The construction urged by the State would render exception (b)(vi) superfluous, a circumstance we seek to avoid in interpreting a statute or court rule. <em>See, e.g., In re N.B., </em>222 <em>N.J. </em>87, 101, 117 A.3d 1196 (2015) (\u201cSuch an interpretation would contravene the canon of statutory construction that directs courts to interpret laws so as to give meaning to all of the ... text.\u201d). Instead, \u201c[t]he Court must \u2018seek an interpretation that will make the most consistent whole of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Sutton, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>471, 479, 625 A.2d 1132 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">A more consistent interpretation, and one that supports the policy of the <em>Rule, </em>is that urged by defendant. Law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>officials must record custodial interrogations of those who are suspected of committing, and will be questioned about, any crime listed in subsection (a) of the <em>Rule. </em>This interpretation is supported by other provisions in the <em>Rule. </em>For example, subsection (b)(iv) excepts from the recordation requirements statements made <em>\u201cby a suspect </em>who indicated, prior to making the statement, that he/she would participate in the interrogation only if it were not recorded; provided however, that the agreement to participate under that condition is itself recorded.\u201d <em>R. </em>3:17(b)(iv) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">This interpretation finds support in the <em>Committee Report, </em>which examined existing laws and case law in Alaska, Minnesota, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia. In each instance, the Committee noted the procedures enacted or contemplated in those states expressly applied to \u201csuspects\u201d or to the \u201caccused\u201d at trial. <em>Committee Report, supra, </em>at 6-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The State argues that the Court\u2019s adoption of the \u201ccharged with\u201d language in subsection (a) was a conscious decision to depart not only from the direction charted by other states, but also from the path plotted by, and being voluntarily implemented by, New Jersey\u2019s law enforcement community when the <em>Rule </em>was adopted. The State cites to the Committee\u2019s review of the <em>Interim Policy Statement of the New Jersey Attorney General and the New Jersey County Prosecutors\u2019 Association </em>(Apr. 13, 2004), and the <em>Amended Policy Statement </em>(Dec. 17, 2004), which provided for electronic recording of \u201ca person who is suspected of committing\u201d certain crimes. The State contends the Court intended to limit the Rule\u2019s application to only those instances where the person \u201cbeing interrogated\u201d was already \u201ccharged with\u201d certain crimes. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">First and foremost, the defendant in <em>Cook, </em>the decision which spawned enactment of the <em>Rule, </em>was not \u201ccharged with\u201d the homicide or any other enumerated offense when questioned by police, although he was surely a suspect at the time. <em>Cook, supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 541-43, 847 A.2d 530. Like defendant in this case, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>was arrested on municipal court warrants. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court\u2019s charge to the Committee was \u201cto study and make recommendations on the use of electronic recordation of custodial interrogations[,]\u201d without limiting consideration to interrogations of only those \u201ccharged with\u201d certain offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 562, 847 A.2d 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Additionally, although not precisely on point with the issue here, the Court has considered whether a defendant\u2019s statement should be suppressed in a variety of circumstances where the defendant was not fully appraised of his status as a suspect prior to receiving or waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights. For example, in <em>State v. A.G.D., </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>56, 68, 835 A.2d 291 (2003), the Court held that a suspect was deprived of \u201cinformation indispensable to a knowing and intelligent waiver of [Miranda] rights\u201d when the detectives interrogating him failed to advise that they already possessed a warrant for his arrest. The Court concluded that \u201c[wjithout advising the suspect of his true status when he does not otherwise know it, the State cannot sustain its burden ... that the suspect has exercised an informed waiver of rights, regardless of other factors that might support his confession\u2019s admission.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">In <em>State v. O\u2019Neill, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>148, 180, 936 A.2d 438 (2007), the Court concluded that \u201c[t]he two-step, \u2018question-first, warn-later\u2019 interrogation is a technique devised to undermine both the efficacy of <em>Miranda </em>and our state law privilege.\u201d The Court held that \u201cas a matter of state law, ... when <em>Miranda </em>warnings are given <em>after </em>a custodial interrogation has already produced incriminating statements, the admissibility of post-warning statements will turn on whether the warnings functioned effectively in providing the defendant the ability to exercise his state law privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180-81, 936 A.2d 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">In <em>State v. Nyhammer, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>383, 406, 963 A.2d 316 (2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>558 <em>U.S. </em>831, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>65, 175 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>48 (2009), the Court made clear that failing to inform a person of his \u201csuspect status\u201d does not necessarily vitiate the voluntary waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights \u201cor ... require[ ] automatic suppression of a statement.\u201d \u201c[T]he failure to be told of one\u2019s suspect status still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>would be only one of many factors to be considered in the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407, 963 A.2d 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Even though suppression of a defendant\u2019s statement is not <em>a fait accompli </em>if the <em>Rule </em>is violated, the cited cases reflect the Court\u2019s concern that a defendant\u2019s status as a suspect be part of the calculus in determining the voluntary nature of any waiver of the right to remain silent. Additionally, the Court in <em>Cook </em>cited its historical concern \u201cfor the reliability and trustworthiness of confessions as a prerequisite for their use.\u201d <em>Cook, supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 560, 847 A.2d 530; <em>see also N.J.R.E. </em>104(c) (requiring the judge to preliminarily determine the admissibility of any statement by a defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The critical role of the jury in evaluating the truthfulness of a defendant\u2019s statement has been long-recognized by our courts. <em>See State v. Hampton, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>250, 272, 294 A.2d 23 (1972) (jury must \u201cdecide whether in view of all the ... circumstances the defendant\u2019s confession is true\u201d); <em>State v. Kociolek, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>400, 421-22, 129 A.2d 417 (1957) (requiring jury to be charged on factors affecting accuracy of extra-judicial oral statements); <em>see also Model Jury Charge (Criminal), </em>\u201cStatements of Defendant,\u201d (revised June 14, 2010). The model jury charge approved to implement the <em>Rule </em>further convinces us that defendant\u2019s interpretation is correct. The charge provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkW\">Our Rules require the electronic recording of interrogations by law enforcement officers when a defendant is charged with [insert applicable offenses] <em>so as to ensure that you will have before you a complete picture of all circumstances under which an alleged statement of a defendant was given, </em>so that you may determine whether a statement was in fact made and, if so, whether it was accurately reported by State\u2019s witnesses and whether it was made voluntarily or is otherwise reliable or trustworthy. <em>Where there is a failure to electronically record an inten-ogation, you have not been provided with a complete picture of all of the facts surrounding the defendant\u2019s alleged statement and the precise details of that statement. </em>By way of example, you cannot hear the tone or inflection of the defendant\u2019s or interrogator\u2019s voices, or hear firsthand the interrogation, both questions and responses, in its entirety. Instead you have been presented with a summary based upon the recollections of law enforcement personnel. Therefore, you should weigh the evidence of the defendant\u2019s alleged statement with great caution and care as you determine whether or not the statement was in fact made and if so, whether what was said was accurately reported by State\u2019s witnesses, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>what weight, if any, it should be given in your deliberations. The absence of an electronic recording permits but does not compel you to conclude that the State has failed to prove that a statement was in fact given and if so, was accurately reported by State\u2019s witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\"><em>[Model Jury Charge (Criminal), supra </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">If we accepted the State\u2019s rationale\u2014only interrogations of those \u201ccharged with\u201d enumerated crimes need be recorded\u2014portions of a defendant\u2019s statement, unrecorded through conscious decision of his interrogators, would be unavailable to the jury, depriving it of \u201ca complete picture of all of the facts surrounding the defendant\u2019s alleged statement and the precise details of that statement.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">In sum, we conclude that 1) the <em>Rule </em>requires electronic recordation of \u201call custodial interrogations\u201d if the person is suspected of having committed one of the enumerated crimes contained in subsection (a) and is ultimately charged with one of those crimes; and 2) law enforcement authorities need not record the interrogation if at the time \u201cthe accused is not a suspect for the crime to which that statement relates.\u201d <em>R. </em>3:17(b)(vi).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">We must still address how the trial judge should consider whether a defendant was \u201ca suspect for the crime to which th[e] statement relates,\u201d so as to trigger the recordation requirement. We agree with defendant that the judge cannot simply accept the interrogators\u2019 subjective belief that defendant was not a suspect. <em>See, e.g., State v. O\u2019Neal, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>601, 615-16, 921 A.2d 1079 (2007) (\u201cThe determination whether a suspect is in \u2018custody depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation, not on the subjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Stansbury v. California, </em>511 <em>U.S. </em>318, 323, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>1526, 1529, 128 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>293, 298 (1994)); <em>State v. Pineiro, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>13, 27, 853 A.2d 887 (2004) (an investigative detention and any seizure that results \u201ccannot ... be justified merely by a police officer\u2019s subjective hunch\u201d) (quoting <em>State v. Davis, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>490, 505, 517 A.2d 859 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Defendant posits that the standard should be whether a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s situation believed he was a suspect. We reject the contention, if for no other reason than \u201cthat the <em>Miranda </em>warnings themselves strongly suggest, if not scream out, that a person is a suspect.\u201d <em>Nyhammer, supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 407, 963 A.2d 316. Certainly, any person being interrogated who actually committed the crime would reasonably conclude he was a suspect, regardless of what law enforcement actually knew at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Instead, we believe the judge must apply an objective standard that takes into account the totality of the circumstances then known to the interrogator, and decide whether a reasonable police officer in those circumstances had a reasonable basis to believe a defendant was a \u201csuspect\u201d in the crime about which he was being questioned. That standard mirrors the one we apply in many other police-citizen encounters. <em>See, e.g., State v. Mann, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>328, 338, 2 A.3d 379 (2010) (\u201c[A] reviewing court must assess whether \u2018the facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure or the search warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the action taken was appropriate.\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Pineiro, supra, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>at 21, 853 A.2d 887); <em>O\u2019Neal, supra, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>at 615-16, 921 A.2d 1079; <em>State v. Moore, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>40, 46, 853 A.2d 903 (2004) (noting that probable cause to arrest or search \u201cexists where the facts and circumstances within ... [the officers\u2019] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient ... to warrant a [person] of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed\u201d) (quoting <em>Schneider v. Simonini, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>336, 361, 749 A.2d 336 (2000)). Under this standard, the State must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant was not a suspect for the crime to which the statement relates at the time of the interrogation. <em>R. </em>3:17(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">We recognize that this standard does not draw a \u201cbright-line\u201d demarking interrogations that must be recorded versus those that need not, and that the judgment officers exercise in the moment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>may subsequently be questioned and scrutinized well after the fact. Of course, an easy answer to that problem is that all custodial interrogations conducted during investigations of crimes listed in the <em>Rule </em>should be recorded, and, indeed, at least one of our sister states has adopted that practice. <em>See Committee Report, supra, </em>at 7 (describing practice in Alaska). Moreover, as already noted, practices in those states examined by the Committee explicitly required law enforcement officers to record interrogations of \u201csuspects,\u201d not just defendants charged with predicate crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">In this case, although the judge did not expressly apply the objective standard we have now defined, we conclude that he did so implicitly. Defendant seizes on a snippet of the judge\u2019s written opinion in which he wrote, \u201cboth officers testified, defendant was a witness\u201d when interrogated, and argues the judge applied a purely subjective test. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Kelly explained that they knew defendant had been to the victim\u2019s house two evenings before his body was found, surmising defendant might have been the last person to have seen the victim alive, other than the victim\u2019s wife, who had, additionally, spoken to the victim the night before the body was found. The judge found that testimony to be believable, and, the testimony did not demonstrate that Kelly possessed other information pointing to defendant as a suspect. Kelly explained that only after the CDW reports indicated defendant had lied did defendant become a suspect. The judge credited this testimony, too, and concluded that defendant only became a suspect when \u201che indicated he wanted to talk\u201d to Kelly. Notably, Kelly started the recording immediately thereafter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>It is easy in hindsight to say that defendant was an obvious suspect in the murder. But, the record reveals that', at the time defendant was arrested on municipal warrants, police only knew that he drove the victim\u2019s wife from her house to New York, and returned the family\u2019s car, two nights before the victim\u2019s body was found. Under these circumstances, the interrogators\u2019 belief that defendant was not a suspect in the murder was reasonable, and therefore there was no violation of the <em>Rule.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Having reached that conclusion, we leave for another day consideration of what would be the appropriate remedy if the <em>Rule </em>was violated, and the judge failed to properly find a violation or charge the jury appropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">At sentencing, the judge stated that he did \u201cnot intend to consider any other charge ... than the charge that [defendant] was found guilty of____\u201d Citing defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history that included four prior indictable convictions, the judge found defendant was a \u201cpersistent offender.\u201d Focusing on the \u201cviolence ... perpetrated,\u201d the judge found aggravating factor one. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(a)(1) (\u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He also found aggravating factor two, stating that defendant \u201cknew or should have known that the victim of the offense was particularly vulnerable.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(a)(2) (\u201c[t]he gravity and seriousness of harm inflicted on the victim, including whether or not the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the victim of the offense was particularly vulnerable or incapable of resistance due to advanced age\u201d). Citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>defendant\u2019s recidivism, the judge found aggravating factors three, six and nine. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(a)(3) (the risk of re-offense); (a)(6) (extent and seriousness of prior record); (a)(9) (the need to deter defendant and others). Again citing the victim\u2019s age, the judge found aggravating factor twelve. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(a)(12) (offense committed against a person sixty years of age or older). The judge found no mitigating factors and imposed the sentence referenced above.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Defendant argues the judge mistakenly found aggravating factors one and two by relying \u201cheavily on the facts of the very offenses that defendant was acquitted on.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">We begin by noting that \u201c[a]ppellate review of the length of a sentence is limited.\u201d <em>State v. Miller, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>109, 127, 13 A.3d 873 (2011). As the Court has recently reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">The appellate court must affirm the sentence unless (1) the sentencing guidelines were violated; (2) the aggravating and mitigating factors found by the sentencing court were not based upon competent and credible evidence in the record; or (3) \u201cthe application of the guidelines to the facts of [the] case makes the sentence clearly unreasonable so as to shock the judicial conscience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\"><em>[State v.

The jury only found defendant responsible for the criminal agreement to commit the burglary, rejecting the claim, despite being appropriately charged, that defendant was legally responsible for Wood-son\u2019s conduct either as an accomplice or co-conspirator. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6(b)(3) and (4) (making one \u201clegally accountable for the conduct of another\u201d if an accomplice of the other person or \u201cengaged in a conspiracy\u201d with the other person).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">As a general proposition, \u201c[although a defendant may be vicariously accountable for the crimes his accomplice commits, he is not vicariously accountable for aggravating factors that are not personal to him.\u201d <em>State v.

In this case, defendant was not found vicariously culpable for the crimes of his co-defendant. Respecting that verdict as we must, the judge erred in attributing the violent, heinous acts of defendant\u2019s co-defendant to defendant, and, while there is certainly support in the record for the judge\u2019s conclusion that defendant knew the victim was very old, the jury concluded he did not know that Woodson would do personal violence to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">We conclude it was error to find aggravating factors one and two on this record.
