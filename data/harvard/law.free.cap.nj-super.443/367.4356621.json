We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">The facts are not in dispute. Welsh first enrolled in the Public Employee\u2019s Retirement System (PERS) on November 1, 1997 when he was working as a security guard with Passaic County. On October 1, 1999, Welsh\u2019s job title changed to corrections officer, and his membership in PERS was transferred to PFRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">In March 2003, Welsh and another corrections officer were accused of assaulting an inmate. After a hearing, Welsh was suspended without pay. In April 2004, Welsh was charged with third-degree aggravated assault. He resigned by letter dated April 6, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-15\">Welsh maintained that the Passaic County Sheriff (Sheriff) and County Prosecutor (Prosecutor) agreed to resolve the criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>matter with Welsh being admitted into a pre-trial intervention program without having to make any admission of wrongdoing. Welsh further claimed that he received assurances that he would eventually be allowed to return to serve as a sheriffs officer if he successfully completed the pre-trial intervention program.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">On April 7, 2004, a consent order was entered into with the Prosecutor, admitting Welsh in the pre-trial intervention program for a period of six months. The criminal matter was dismissed at the conclusion of the six-month period, on November 10, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">On December 12, 2004, the Sheriff wrote a letter to the Prosecutor inquiring as to Welsh\u2019s reinstatement. On December 16, 2004, the Prosecutor advised the Sheriff that he did not recommend Welsh being considered for a position in Passaic County law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Welsh\u2019s last PFRS pension contribution before he resigned was on March 31, 2003. On December 15, 2004, the New Jersey Division of Pensions and Benefits (Division) sent a letter to Welsh explaining that his PFRS account would expire two years after his last pension contribution, and noting an \u201cAccount Expiration Date\u201d of March 31, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">In January 2005, Welsh filed an application with the New Jersey Department of Personnel (DOP) seeking reemployment with the Sheriffs Office, and was advised that his name had been certified to the Sheriff by the DOP as being eligible for reemployment as a corrections officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">On June 17, 2005, the Sheriff advised the DOP that the Sheriffs Office had submitted Welsh\u2019s recommendation in error. The Sheriff stated that he did not sign the application, but instead, a facsimile stamp had been used without his approval. He also requested the application be rescinded due to the fact that Welsh voluntarily resigned for disciplinary reasons. On July 12, 2005, the DOP approved the Sheriffs request and rescinded Welsh\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Welsh appealed to the DOP, and, on December 23, 2005, the DOP issued a final administrative determination upholding the removal of Welsh\u2019s name from the reemployment list. Welsh appealed to this court, and we affirmed. We noted that \u201cthere is nothing in the record that disputes the Sheriffs representation that the submission was not authorized by him, nor is there anything in the record that would question the fact that the Sheriff stated that it was not in the best interest of the Department to re-employ the appellant.\u201d <em>In re Varcadipane and Welsh, </em>No. A-3148-05, 2007 <em>WL </em>715757 (App.Div. Mar. 12, 2007) (slip op. at 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Welsh filed a complaint alleging breach of contract and breach of an implied covenant of good faith against the Sheriffs Office. On August 13, 2007, Welsh entered into a settlement agreement with the Sheriffs Office, which provided that, upon passing a fitness for duty examination, he would be reemployed as a corrections officer at the same pay rate he held prior to his resignation. Welsh executed a release that provided \u201call of [Welsh\u2019s] monetary claims for back pay, pension credits, health benefits, and/or monetary damages as alleged, are hereby dismissed with prejudice.\u201d The agreement further stated that \u201c[t]here \"will be no monetary contributions, payments, or settlement payments to [Welsh], as such [Welsh] will not receive back pay; pension credits; outstanding medical bills, or the like.\u201d The agreement was filed with the Law Division on October 16, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">On October 29, 2007, Welsh returned to work and was re-enrolled in a new PFRS pension account, effective November 1, 2007. On June 9, 2008, the County Pension Administrator inquired of the Division whether Welsh\u2019s former PFRS account could be reinstated. The Division responded that Welsh\u2019s former PFRS account could not be reinstated because it expired on March 31, 2005, two years after his last pension contribution on March 31,2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">On November 1, 2010, Welsh and the Sheriffs Office executed a rider to the settlement agreement, which amended Welsh\u2019s \u201cdate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>of reinstatement\u201d from October 29, 2007 to January 28, 2005. On August 1, 2011, the Civil Service Commission<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Commission) granted the Sheriffs Office\u2019s request to change Welsh\u2019s reinstatement date to January 28, 2005, but with the caveat that it was \u201cfor salary step placement and seniority-based purposes only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In March 2013, the Sheriffs Office requested that the Division combine Welsh\u2019s former and current PFRS accounts, \u201cthereby recording his service from November 1, 1997 to present with a break of service between April 6, 2004 [and] January 28, 2005.\u201d The County Pension Administrator joined in the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">On November 7, 2013, the Division denied the request, concluding that Welsh\u2019s prior PFRS account expired on March 31, 2005. The Division noted that Welsh\u2019s last pension contribution was March 31, 2003; he formally resigned on April 6, 2004; and despite the amended re-hire date, the settlement agreement did not award any back pay or pension credits between April 3, 2003 and October 29, 2007. The Division advised that Welsh could withdraw the prior account\u2019s funds and \u201cpurchase all, or a portion of, the prior [PFRS] membership under his current PFRS membership[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Welsh appealed the Division\u2019s decision to the Board, arguing that the Division erred because: (1) he was not seeking pension credit for the period of the amended reinstatement date (January 28, 2005) to the day he began working again (October 29, 2007); (2) he never withdrew funds from his former PFRS account; (3) he was only seeking to have the PFRS accounts merged; and (4) that the Division mistakenly denied his request because it believed that he was re-hired on October 29,2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">After meeting to consider Welsh\u2019s appeal, the Board denied Welsh\u2019s request, concluding that he was not reinstated with back pay and did not receive any service credit between April 1, 2003 and October 29, 2007. Welsh appealed and, on August 5, 2014, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Board issued a final administrative determination denying the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">On appeal, Welsh claims that he should be permitted reinstatement of his original pension account because the Board failed to recognize that it is permitted to consider equitable factors to craft a just remedy in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">We begin by noting the well-established principles that guide our review. Our review of an administrative agency determination is limited. <em>Mazza v. Bd. of Trs., </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>22, 25, 667 A.2d 1052 (1995). We will not upset an agency\u2019s factual findings unless they are \u201carbitrary, capricious or unreasonable, or ... lacked fair support in the evidence^]\u201d <em>Campbell v. Dep\u2019t of Civil Serv., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>556, 562, 189 A.2d 712 (1963). We are not bound by an agency\u2019s legal conclusions or its interpretation of a statute. <em>Mayflower Sec. Co. v. Bureau of Sec., </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>85, 93, 312 A.2d 497 (1973). The party challenging the administrative determination bears the burden of proof. <em>Boyle v. Riti, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. 158, </em>166, 417 A.2d 1091 (App.Div.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Welsh claims that because the rider to his settlement agreement amended his reinstatement date to January 28, 2005, his current PFRS account should be merged with his former PFRS account, which expired on March 31, 2005. Welsh further argues that the nunc pro tunc amendment had the effect of reversing the expiration of his former PFRS account because it resulted in shortening his absence from employment to less than two years. In the alternative, Welsh argues that the Division erred because it \u201cfailed to recognize that it is permitted to consider equitable factors to craft a just remedy in these circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">The termination of a PFRS account is governed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">(3) Should any member withdraw his aggregate contributions, or become a beneficiary or die, or <em>if more than % years have elapsed from the date of his last contributions to the system, he shall thereupon cease to be a member.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>(4) <em>Should any member resign </em>or be dismissed from the police or fire service of the employing agency and not make application for the return of his aggregate contributions, <em>the retirement system shall upon receiving conclusive advice of such separation, teminate the </em>membership____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">It is not disputed that Welsh resigned on April 6, 2004, after being charged with aggravated assault of an inmate and his employer agreeing that he could leave in good standing. We are satisfied that his resignation resulted in a termination of the former PFRS membership under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">In addition, Welsh\u2019s last pension contribution to his former PFRS account was made on March 31, 2003, and there were no contributions made between that time and March 31, 2005. Welsh received notice that his former PFRS account would expire on March 31, 2005. After more than two years elapsed with no pension contributions, his former PFRS account expired pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3(3). <em>See Cologna v. Bd. of Trs., Police and Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>430 <em>N.J.Super. </em>362, 375, 64 A.3d 995 (App.Div.2013) (analyzing the legislative history of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3, which was adopted after a conditional veto rejecting a proposed amendment that would have extended the return to service period from two to three years because the amendment was unnecessarily broad and would lead to a sharp rise in costs).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">There are narrow exceptions to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3 where a PFRS account will not terminate. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:1-2.18 is entitled \u201cService and salary credit: award of back pay,\u201d and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">(a) A member who appeals the suspension or termination of the member\u2019s employment and who, by award or settlement, becomes entitled to full pay for all or a portion of that employment for the period of such suspension or termination shall receive service credit for the period covered by the award or settlement provided a full normal pension and, if applicable, the contributory group life insurance contribution is received from the member or is deducted from the value of the award. The member must receive full back pay, including normal salary increases before mitigation and the contributions will be computed on the base salaries that the employee would have earned for the reinstated suspended or terminated period. In the event that the amount of back payment, after mitigation, is insufficient to deduct the value of the normal pension contributions and, if applicable, the contributory group life insurance due, such contribution shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>paid by the member to the respective retirement system by certified check or money order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">(b) If a member waives an award of back pay, then the member cannot receive service or salary credit for the period of the award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">(f) For those defined contribution retirement programs administered by the Division, the member is not entitled to the employer contributions for the period of the award unless the member receives an award equal to full back pay pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:1-2.18.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>17:1-2.18.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Here, the settlement agreement between Welsh and the Sheriffs Office, and its attached rider altering Welsh\u2019s reinstatement date to January 28, 2005, do not prevent the former PFRS account from expiring. Welsh\u2019s argument that his \u201cabsence from employment was for less than two years, from April 6, 2004 to January 28, 2005\u201d focuses on his adjusted resignation and reinstatement dates, rather than the date of his last pension contribution. As we have explained, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3(3) is unequivocal that the relevant date for purposes of the two-year expiration period is the \u201cdate of [the member\u2019s] last contributions to the system.\u201d Because Welsh failed to make any contributions to his former PFRS account within two years of his last contribution date, March 31, 2003, his PFRS membership expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">Moreover, Welsh does not qualify for an exception under <em>N.J.AC. </em>17:1-2.18. As noted, the regulation requires that a \u201cfull normal pension ... contribution is received from the member or is deducted from the value of the award.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>17:l-2.18(a). Here, Welsh\u2019s settlement agreement expressly prohibited any back pay or pension credit, and provided that \u201call of [Welsh\u2019s] monetary claims for back pay, pension credits, health benefits, and/or monetary damages ... are hereby dismissed with prejudice.\u201d The terms of the agreement provided that there \u201cwill be no monetary contributions, payments, or settlement payments to [Welsh]\u201d and he \u201cwill not receive back pay; pension credits; outstanding medical bills, or the like.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">The 2010 rider did not alter Welsh\u2019s disentitlement to back pay, pension credit, or service credit under the agreement. The rider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>only requested that Welsh\u2019s date of reinstatement be changed to January 28, 2005. Further, when the Commission granted the Sheriffs Office\u2019s request to change Welsh\u2019s reinstatement date, it expressly limited the application of the rider to apply to \u201csalary step placement and seniority-based purposes only.\u201d Therefore, neither the settlement agreement nor its attached rider prevented the termination of Welsh\u2019s former PFRS account.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Despite the clear intent of the controlling statute and regulation, Welsh maintains that the Board has \u201cstymied what Welsh and his employer intended\u201d in the settlement agreement, and argues that we should disregard these provisions and remand because the Board should exercise its equitable powers, namely equitable estoppel, to craft an appropriate remedy in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The doctrine of equitable estoppel is \u201crarely invoked against a governmental entity.\u201d <em>Middletown Twp. Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Ass\u2019n Local No. 124 v. Twp. of Middletown, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>361, 367, 744 A.2d 649 (2000) (quoting <em>Wood v. Borough of Wildwood Crest, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>650, 656, 726 A.2d 310 (App.Div.1999)). The doctrine can be invoked \u201cwhere interests of justice, morality and common fairness clearly dictate that course.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Gruber v. Mayor &amp; Twp. Comm. of Raritan, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>1, 13, 186 A.2d 489 (1962)). In <em>Middletown, </em>the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">The essential principle of the policy of estoppel here invoked is that one may, by voluntary conduct, be precluded from taking a course of action that would work injustice and wrong to one who with good reason and in good faith has relied upon such conduct. An estoppel ... may arise by silence or omission where one is under a duty to speak or act. It has to do with the inducement of conduct to action or nonaction____The repudiation of one\u2019s act done or position assumed is not permissible where that course would work injustice to another who, having the right to do so, has relied thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\"><em>[Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Summer Cottagers\u2019 Ass\u2019n of Cape May v. City of Cape May, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>493, 503-04, 117 A.2d 585 (1955)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Welsh relies on our opinions in <em>Sellers v. Board of Trustees of the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System, </em>399 <em>N.J.Super. </em>51, 942 A.2d 870 (App.Div.2008), and <em>Francois v. Board of Trustees, Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, </em>415 <em>N.J.Super. </em>335, 1 A.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>843 (App.Div.2010), in arguing that an equitable remedy is appropriate in this case. In both eases, we applied the doctrine of equitable estoppel to the actions of New Jersey pension boards. However, contrary to Welsh\u2019s arguments, both cases are significantly distinguishable because the petitioners in those eases were able to show detrimental reliance on either their employer\u2019s or the pension board\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">In <em>Sellers, supra, </em>a thirty-eight-year old dispatcher with Essex County College left his job in order to take a position as a firefighter with Bloomfield Township under the mistaken belief that credit for prior service would exempt him from the prohibitions in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-2.5, and a prohibition against hiring and enrolling in PFRS any officer over thirty-five-years old. 399 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 52-55, 942 A.2d 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">We noted that changes in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 623(a), triggered the development of a practice \u201cwhereby the Board ha[d] exercised equitable powers to waive the age requirement on a case-by-case basis[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 55, 942 A.2d 870, and that, several years before, the Board permitted \u201cat least nine individuals to enroll in PFRS ... despite the fact they exceeded the maximum age requirement!;,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 57, 942 A.2d 870. We also noted the unique overlap of the statutory scheme at issue, which required the petitioner to be enrolled in PFRS in order to be a firefighter, and therefore made the Township\u2019s decision to hire him dependent on the Board\u2019s PFRS determination. <em>Id. </em>at 60-61, 942 A.2d 870. We stated \u201c[a] problem arises in a case, such as this one, where the municipality believes that the age requirement is met and the Board determines, after the employee has been permanently hired, that the age requirement has not been met.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 942 A.2d 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Given that the petitioner left his job to be a firefighter, and that he was hired and initially approved by the Board, we remanded the case so that the Board could consider crafting a solution that took into account the equities of the situation, including whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>\u201cthe government failed to \u2018turn square corners\u2019 with [the petitioner].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 942 A.2d 870. We noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">People accepting the firefighter positions in good faith should not be putting their careers and the financial well-being of their families in jeopardy by giving up their current jobs and accepting public employment only to find out later that they do not meet the age requirements for the positions, particularly when all of the relevant information was available to the State and municipality before the commencement of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Our decision in <em>Francois </em>is similar. There, the petitioner was an employee of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA), and served on \u201cmobility assignment\u201d for a two-year period as director of the real estate department of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (Port Authority). <em>Francois, supra, </em>415 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 338, 1 A.3d 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">When initially accepting the mobility assignment, and when it was extended, the petitioner was sent memoranda from the NJE-DA that advised that he \u201cmay continue to accrue service credit with the New Jersey State Pension System ... for retirement purposes during the term of this assignment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341, 343, 1 A.3d 843. The facts were \u201cclear that ... at age fifty-three and after approximately twenty-seven years of creditable service ... [the petitioner] did not want to jeopardize or sacrifice his pension benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343, 1 A.3d 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">The petitioner eventually advised the NJEDA that he intended to retire and join the Port Authority. <em>Id. </em>at 344, 1 A.3d 843. When applying for retirement, the Division did not credit the petitioner\u2019s time on mobility assignment. <em>Id. </em>at 345, 1 A.3d 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">In reversing the Division\u2019s decision, we cited <em>Sellers </em>and explained that the petitioner received written assurances from the NJEDA before taking the assignment, and that he was \u201centitled to presume that he would not be penalized by accepting the mobility assignment while remaining on the [NJEDA] payroll and being paid by it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353, 1 A.3d 843. We explained that there was no authority that required an agency to obtain the approval of the Division before making assignments, or gave the Division the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>authority to monitor the work assignments of State employees. <em>Id. </em>at 354, 1 A.3d 843. Although we limited the wages eligible for the petitioner\u2019s pension benefits, we concluded that equitable considerations entitled him to service credit for the time spent on the mobility assignment. <em>Id. </em>at 355-56, 1 A.3d 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The petitioners in <em>Sellers </em>and <em>Francois </em>both demonstrated detrimental reliance on express assurances of employment qualification or pension credit either by their employers or the pension boards. In this case, however, Welsh has not shown detrimental reliance, the essential principle undergirding equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Welsh asserts that he and the Sheriffs Office \u201centered into a settlement agreement which both believed would result in Welsh receiving pension credit for his prior service from November 1, 1997 to August 6, 2004.\u201d The express terms of the agreement, which Welsh and the Sheriff both signed, contradict this claim. It was an express term of Welsh\u2019s release of his lawsuit against the Sheriffs Office, and of his reemployment with them, that he \u201cwill not receive ... pension credits[.]\u201d There is no evidence that Welsh accepted his reinstatement in reliance on receiving pension credit or that his former PFRS account remain active.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Welsh also argues that the 2010 rider amending his reinstatement date to January 28, 2005 permitted reinstatement of his former PFRS account. Again, there is no evidence that the rider was executed in reliance on receiving pension credit, or that the rider was meant to change the express terms of the settlement agreement, which prohibited Welsh from receiving such credit. There are no assurances in this case that Welsh would continue receiving pension credit, or that his account would remain active, after he resigned.
