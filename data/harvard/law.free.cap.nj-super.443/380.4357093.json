On appeal, NJLESA contends that PERC erred in affirming the arbitrator\u2019s acceptance of the scattergram and methodology offered by respondent State of New Jersey (State) to calculate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>salary award within the confines of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16.7(b), commonly known as \u201cthe 2% salary cap.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">We begin with a review of the pertinent authority.

Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>322, 328, 561 A.2d 597 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The record in this case reveals that NJLESA represents 665 primary-level law enforcement supervisors in several negotiation units. NJLESA and the State were parties to a collective negotiations agreement (CNA) that expired on June 30, 2011. Following unsuccessful negotiations and mediation, on September 16, 2013, NJLESA filed a petition with PERC seeking compulsory interest arbitration pursuant to the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Regarding the salary award, the arbitrator first determined that $56,945,856.70 was total base-year salary in the final twelve months of the CNA. The arbitrator then multiplied two percent of the total base-year salary ($1,138,917) by four and determined that $4,555,668 was the amount of money available under the 2% salary cap for the four-year successor CNA. The arbitrator next determined the amount the State would expend during the successor CNA based on each NJLESA member being moved through the salary schedule over the four years by achieving annual step movement, or annual increments, pursuant to the salary schedule regardless of whether they continued to be employed beyond the date the monies were projected to be spent. Using the State\u2019s scattergram, the arbitrator determined the cost of the step movement alone to be $3,734,295 or 6.56% of the original base salary amount. The arbitrator concluded that $821,373 remained to be awarded under the 2% salary cap, and ultimately granted a total salary award of $757,833, which was within the 2% salary cap. The arbitrator found that although $821,373 was available to be awarded, there was \u201cno basis for the expenditure or that requires any additional amounts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>NJLESA did not claim that the arbitrator failed to comply with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16(g) or violated the standards in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:24-8 and -9, and agreed that $56,945,856.70 was the total base-year salary in the final twelve months of the CNA. Instead, NJLESA challenged the arbitrator\u2019s acceptance of the State\u2019s scattergram and methodology to calculate the costs of the salary award to establish that the award would not violate the 2% salary cap. NJLESA asserted that its scattergram provided a more accurate \u201ccost out\u201d of the salary award because it contained the actual salary expenditures for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, the first two years of the successor CNA, which reflected savings the State realized in those fiscal years from retirements and attrition. In contrast, the State\u2019s scattergram contained projected salary figures for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, and moved all NJLESA members through the salary guide regardless of whether they retired after fiscal year 2011 or new members joined the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">PERC determined that the arbitrator\u2019s acceptance of the State\u2019s scattergram was consistent with <em>New Milford, </em>and rejected NJLESA\u2019s argument that the savings the State realized in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 should be credited. Citing <em>Borough of Ramsey and Ramsey PBA Local No. 155, </em>P.E.R.C. No. 2012-60, 39 <em>N.J.P.E.R. </em>\u00b6 17 (2012), PERC held that \u201c[wjhether speculative or known, ... any changes in financial circumstances benefitting the employer or majority representative [were] not contemplated by the statute or to be considered by the arbitrator.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">On appeal, NJLESA argues that the arbitrator\u2019s decision to accept the State\u2019s scattergram and methodology, and PERC\u2019s affirmance of that decision, contravened PERC\u2019s prior decisions in <em>New Milford, supra, </em>and <em>City of Atlantic City and Atlantic City PBA Local 24, </em>P.E.R.C. No. 2013-82, 39 <em>N.J.P.E.R. </em>\u00b6 161, 2013 <em>N.J. PERC LEXIS </em>38 (2013), which compelled the arbitrator to adopt NJLESA\u2019s scattergram and methodology. In particular, NJLESA emphasizes a passage in <em>New Milford, </em>where PERC said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Since an arbitrator, under the new law, is required to project costs for the entirety of the duration of the award, calculation of purported savings resulting from anticipated retirements, and for that matter added costs due to replacement by hiring new staff or promoting existing staff are all too speculative to be calculated at the time of the award. The Commission believes that the better model to achieve compliance with <em>P.L. </em>2010 <em>c. </em>105 is to utilize the scattergram demonstrating the placement on the guide of all of the employees in the bargaining unit as of the end of the year preceding the initiation of the new contract, and to simply move those employees forward through the newly awarded salary scales and longevity entitlements. Thus, both reductions in costs resulting from retirements or otherwise, as well as any increases in costs stemming from promotions or additional new hires would not effect [sic] the costing out of the award required by the new amendments to the Interest Arbitration Reform Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\"><em>[New Milford, supra, </em>P.E.R.C. No. 2012-53, 38 <em>N.J.P.E.R. </em>\u00b6 340, 2012 <em>N.J. PERC LEXIS </em>18 at 15.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">NJLESA argues that this passage prevents an arbitrator from adopting a scattergram that contains \u201cspeculative\u201d figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">NJLESA also points to a passage in <em>City of Atlantic City, </em>where PERC said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">We further clarify that the above information must be included for officers who retire in the last year' of the expired agreement. For such officers, the information should be prorated for what was actually paid for the base salary items. Our guidance in <em>New Milford </em>for avoiding speculation for retirements was applicable to future retirements only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\"><em>[City of Atlantic City, supra, </em>P.E.R.C. No. 2013-82, 39 <em>N.J.P.E.R. </em>\u00b6 161, 2013 <em>N.J. PERC LEXIS </em>38 at 10.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">NJLESA argues that this passage requires an arbitrator to use actual paid salary when that data is available. NJLESA notes that the retirements in fiscal years 2012 and 2013, which enabled the State to realize savings, were not speculative because they actually occurred. NJLESA, thus, argues that the arbitrator should have used its scattergram, which reflected the State\u2019s savings from those retirements, and thus showed more salary available for distribution to NJLESA members under the 2% salary cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">NJLESA\u2019s argument fails for two reasons. First, PERC specifically rejected it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-12\">We note that <em>the cap on salary awards in the new legislation does not provide for the PBA to be credited with savings that the Borough receives from retirements or any other legislation that may reduce the employer\u2019s costs. </em>It is an affirmative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>calculation based on the total 2011 base salary costs regardless of any changes in 2012. Likewise, the PBA will not be debited for any increased costs the employer assumes for promotions or other costs associated with maintaining its workforce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACb\"><em>[New Milford, supra, </em>P.E.R.C. No. 2012-53, 38 <em>N.J.P.E.R. </em>V 340, 2012 <em>N.J. PERC LEXIS </em>18 at 16 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Since <em>New Milford, </em>PERC has consistently maintained that the State\u2019s savings on salary expenditures may not be considered when calculating a salary award under the 2% salary cap, and PERC has never suggested otherwise. For example, immediately after <em>New Milford, </em>PERC explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\"><em>[t]he statute does not provide for a majority representative to be credited with savings that a public employer receives from any reduction in costs, </em>nor does it provide for the majority representative to be debited for any increased costs the public employer assumes for promotions or other costs associated with maintaining its workforce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\"><em>[Borough of Ramsey, supra, </em>P.E.R.C. No. 2012-60, 39 <em>N.J.P.E.R. </em>\u00b6 17 at 9 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">More recently, PERC reiterated its guidance in <em>New Milford, </em>and rejected essentially the same argument advanced by NJLESA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-10\">Additionally, the [union] asserts that the arbitrator miscalculated longevity in 2014 because she failed to deduct the \u201coffsetting decreased cost in longevity from employees who left the bargaining unit due to retirements, promotions and terminations from the base year 2013.\u201d We squarely addressed this issue in <em>New Milford </em>wherein we stated as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">Based on the clear guidance we provided in <em>New Milford, we reject the union\u2019s argument that the arbitrator miscalculated longevity for S01I because she did not offset costs resulting from retirements.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\"><em>[City of Camden and IAFF Local 788, </em>P.E.R.C. No. 2014-95 (2014) at 8-9 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">A fair reading of <em>Atlantic City </em>does not change the analysis. That case involved a dispute over the base salary calculation for the twelve months preceding the expiration of the collective bargain agreement. <em>City of Atlantic City, supra, </em>P.E.R.C. No. 2013-82, 39 <em>N.J.P.E.R. </em>\u00b6161, 2013 <em>N.J. PERC LEXIS </em>38 at 2. It did not purport to change the <em>New Milford </em>analysis, but instead reiterated it. <em>Id. </em>at 6-7. Accordingly, PERC\u2019s decision in this ease was not arbitrary, capricious, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>unreasonable because it conformed to <em>New Milford </em>and subsequent decisions by refusing to credit NJLESA with savings from retirements or attrition.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Second, NJLESA misreads <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16.7(b) and ignores our standard of review. The language of the 2% salary cap provision prohibits an interest arbitrator from rendering an award that \u201cincreases base salary items by more than 2.0 percent of the aggregate amount expended by the public employer on base salary items for the members of the affected employee organization in the twelve months immediately preceding the expiration of the collective negotiation agreement subject to arbitration.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16.7(b). The statute sets a maximum salary award, but does not require the arbitrator to award any specified amount or prescribe the methodology for calculating the salary award. As PERC recognized in <em>New Milford:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">Arriving at an economic award is not a precise mathematical process. Given that the statute sets forth general criteria rather than a formula, except as set forth [in the two percent salary cap provision, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16.7(b),l the treatment of the parties\u2019 proposals involves judgment and discretion and an arbitrator will rarely be able to demonstrate that an award is the only \u201ccorrect\u201d one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\"><em>[New Milford, supra, </em>P.E.R.C. No. 2012-53, 38 <em>N.J.P.E.R. </em>\u00b6 340, 2012 <em>N.J. PERC LEXIS </em>18 at 11.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Thus, except for failure to comply with the 2% salary cap provision, we will not set aside an interest arbitration award for failure to apply a specific methodology. However, NJLESA does not suggest that the arbitrator\u2019s salary award exceeded the <em>2% </em>salary cap. Instead, it argues that the arbitrator should have used its methodology and awarded a credit for the State\u2019s savings from retirements and attrition in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. NJLESA cites to no authority that required the arbitrator or PERC to do so. Rather, the relevant authority requires us to defer to PERC\u2019s decision to affirm the arbitrator\u2019s exercise of discretion, which was based on his special expertise in labor relations. <em>See State v. Prof'l Ass\u2019n of N.J. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>231, 259, 315 A.2d 1 (1974). Stated differently, the deferential standard of review for interest arbitration awards does not permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>us to substitute our judgment for PERC\u2019s judgment by requiring the arbitrator to adopt NJLESA\u2019s methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">In sum, contrary to NJLESA\u2019s argument, PERC\u2019s decision was not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. The decision fully comported with <em>New Milford </em>and its progeny, and the award complied with the 2% salary cap provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\"> We decline to address NJLESA's additional contention, raised for the first time on appeal, that PERC's and the arbitrator's failure to consider its unique status as an intermediary, transitional bargaining unit led to an improper determination of the amount of monies available for distribution in a salary award rendered under the 2% salary cap. <em>See Bryan v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>546, 548, 610 A.2d 889 (App.Div.1992) (citing <em>Nieder v. Royal Indent. Ins.
