Because the employee handbook, which contains an arbitration clause and a purported waiver of plaintiffs right to sue, clearly conveyed that its \u201crules, regulations, procedures and benefits ... are not promissory or contractual in nature and are subject to change by the company,\u201d we agree with the motion judge that plaintiff did not clearly and unambiguously waive his right to sue defendants in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-15\">On September 19, 2014, plaintiff Grant W. Morgan commenced this action against his former employer, defendant Raymours Furniture Company, and two Raymours representatives, alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>a violation of the Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to - 49, wrongful termination, and other similar causes of action. After unsuccessfully moving for a change of venue\u2014an application that might fairly suggest a waiver of the right to arbitrate<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2014 defendants moved to compel arbitration. That motion was denied as well, and defendants appeal, as is their right despite the interlocutory nature of the order in question. <em>See R. </em>2:2-3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">In appealing, defendants present the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY FAILING TO ENFORCE THE PARTIES\u2019 AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, WHICH SATISFIES ALL OF THE CUSTOMARY CONTRACT FORMATION ELEMENTS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">A. The FAA[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] Requires Application of Ordinary State-Law Principles Governing The Formation Of Contracts in Determining Whether Parties Have Agreed to Arbitrate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">B.

THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BECAUSE IT APPLIED HEIGHTENED, ARBITRATION SPECIFIC STANDARDS TO THE EAP.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-15\">V. IN THE EVENT THE COURT FINDS GENUINE DISPUTES OF MATERIAL FACT REMAIN, DEFENDANTS REQUEST THAT THE ACTION BE REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO CONDUCT AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING (Not Raised Below).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Akj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>In light of well-established legal principles governing the availability of arbitration in this and similar settings, reiterated in a number of recent cases, <em>see, e.g., Atalese v. U.S. Legal Servs. Grp., L.P., </em>219 <em>N.J. </em>430, 444-45, 99 A.3d 306 (2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 <em>S.Ct. </em>2804, 192 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>847 (2015); <em>Barr v. Bishop Rosen &amp; Co., </em>442 <em>N.J.Super. </em>599, 605-609, 126 A.3d 328 (App.Div.2015),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we find insufficient merit in defendants\u2019 arguments to warrant further discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11\u2014 3(e)(1)(E). We add only the following brief comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The circumstances at hand are relatively simple. Plaintiff contends that upon complaining of age discrimination in the workplace, defendants confronted him with an ultimatum\u2014that he either sign a stand-alone arbitration agreement or defendants would terminate his employment. Plaintiff refused to sign the agreement and defendants carried out their threat. Plaintiff was terminated and this suit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Despite plaintiffs refusal to sign an arbitration agreement, defendants moved to compel arbitration on the basis of the company handbook. Although plaintiff disputes that he actually read or acknowledged receipt of the handbook, he consented to the trial court\u2019s consideration of these issues on the assumption that he acknowledged receipt of the handbook and EAP in August 2011, February 2012, and April 2013<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; like the trial judge, we find these circumstances unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">For example, the handbook is prefaced with the employer\u2019s disclaimer as to the nature of the parties\u2019 undertaking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number><em>Nothing in this Handbook or any other Company practice or communication or document, </em>including benefit plan descriptions, <em>creates </em>a promise of continued employment, <em>[an </em>] <em>employment contract, </em>term or obligation of any kind on the part of the Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In addition, when electronically acknowledging receipt of this documentation, an employee signifies only that he or she <em>\u201creceived </em>a copy of the Associate Handbook\u201d (emphasis added), and, further, that he or she</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\"><em>understand^ </em>] that the rules, regulations, procedures and benefits contained therein are <em>not promissory or contractual </em>in nature and are subject to change by the company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">These disclaimers were likely included because of <em>Woolley v. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>284, 309, 491 A.2d 1257, <em>modified, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>10, 499 A.2d 515 (1985), where the Court determined that company manuals may create implied contractual rights and duties, but that employers\u2014to avoid this possibility\u2014could include a prominent disclaimer of the contractual nature of a handbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Here, the employer would seek both the benefit of its disclaimer in most instances, while insisting that the handbook was contractual when it suits its purposes\u2014a proposition to be rejected if for no other reason than it runs counter to the ancient English proverb: \u201cwolde ye bothe eate your cake, and haue your cake?\u201d John Heywood, <em>Dialogue of Proverbs </em>(1546), as well as its corollary, which may have originated with Aesop, \u201csauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.\u201d Of course, our decisions are not governed by clich\u00e9s, but these in particular can be found at the root of the court\u2019s equity jurisdiction. For example, estoppel principles preclude a party from disavowing a previous position <em>if </em>repudiation violates the demands of justice and good conscience. <em>Carlsen v. Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots Pension Plan Tr., </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>334, 339, 403 A.2d 880 (1979); <em>Connell v. Am. Funding, Ltd., </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>409, 416, 555 A.2d 745 (Ch.Div.1987), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>202, 555 A.2d 638 (App.Div.1989). In this setting, it is simply inequitable for an employer to assert that, during its dealings with its employee, its written rules and regulations were not contractual and then argue, through reference to the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>materials, that the employee contracted away a particular right. <em>See also </em>2 <em>Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence </em>\u00a7 385, at 52 (5th ed. 1941) (recognizing \u201cthat whatever be the nature of the controversy between two definite parties, and whatever be the nature of the remedy demanded, the court will not confer its equitable relief upon the party seeking its interposition and aid, unless he had acknowledged and conceded, or will admit and provide for, all the equitable rights, claims and demands justly belonging to the adversary party, and growing out of or necessarily involved in the subject matter of the controversy\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In any event, our Supreme Court has made clear that an employee in this circumstance must \u201cclearly and unambiguously\u201d agree to a waiver of the right to sue. <em>Atalese, supra, </em>219 <em>N.J. </em>at 443, 99 A.3d 306. By inserting such a waiver provision in a company handbook, which, at the time, the employer insisted was not \u201cpromissory or contractual,\u201d an employer cannot expect\u2014and a court, in good conscience, will not conclude\u2014that the employee clearly and unambiguously agreed to waive the valued right to sue. And, by the same token, in obtaining the employee\u2019s signature on a rider, which stated only that the employee \u201creceived\u201d and \u201cunderst[ood]\u201d the contents of the company handbook or rules and regulations, the employer cannot fairly contend the employee \u201cagreed\u201d to a waiver of the right to sue that might be found within those materials. <em>Leodori v. CIGNA Corp., </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>293, 307, 814 A.2d 1098, <em>cert. denied, </em>540 <em>U.S. </em>938, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>74, 157 L.Ed.2d 250 (2003); <em>Barr, supra, </em>442 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 609 n. 5, 126 A.3d 328. These principles preclude enforcement of the arbitration provision and waiver of the right to sue contained within Raymours\u2019 company handbook and related documents.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>We also reject defendants\u2019 forceful argument that such a determination conflicts with federal law. We disagree on the strength of our Supreme Court\u2019s own prior rulings, cited above, regarding the relationship between federal and state law in such matters. We also note that one week after we heard argument in this case, a federal court of appeals came to the same conclusion that we now reach in nearly identical circumstances. <em>Lorenzo v. Prime Commc\u2019ns, L.P., </em>806 F.3d 777 (4th Cir.2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">We lastly recognize that had plaintiff executed the stand-alone arbitration agreement presented to him when a rift formed in the parties\u2019 relationship, a different outcome would likely have followed. To that we only need say, \u201cif my grandmother had wheels, she\u2019d be a bicycle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-16\"> Such an argument was not raised on appeal and we, therefore, offer no further view on the impact of that circumstance on the arbitration issue presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b370-17\"> Federal Arbitration Act, 9 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1-16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b371-11\"> These are but a few and only two of the most recent; our jurisprudence suffers no shortage of case law on this subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b371-12\"> Plaintiff allegedly signed in December 2013 another document relating to the commission rate by which he would be compensated; in signing, plaintiff expressed that he \u201cagree[d]\" disputes would be subject to the EAP. We agree with the trial judge that this document, if actually signed, would only give rise to the possibility that a dispute about commissions\u2014not discrimination or wrongful termination claims\u2014would be arbitrable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\"> Make no mistake, although the dispute about the parties' transactions evoke questions of law, defendants seek a mandatory injunction\u2014a stay of this lawsuit and an order compelling of arbitration\u2014that triggers the court's equity jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\"> In <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Raymours Furniture Co., </em>436 <em>N.J.Super. </em>305, 93 A.3d 760 (App.Div.2014), the plaintiff's execution of a job application\u2014and its incorporat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>ed \"agreement\u201d to limit to six months the applicant's time for filing any future lawsuit against Raymours\u2014was found enforceable. The Supreme Court granted certification, 220 <em>N.J. </em>100, 103 A.3d 267 (2014), heard oral argument on December 1, 2015, and has yet to file an opinion. Although our colleagues' published opinion in <em>Rodriguez </em>was filed eight months before this appeal was filed, neither plaintiff nor defendants\u2014nor able amici\u2014referred to <em>Rodriguez </em>in any of their written or oral submissions. Consequently, we invited and have received the parties\u2019 letters explaining their thoughts on <em>Rodriguez. </em>We agree with plaintiff that the many distinguishing features between this case and <em>Rodriguez </em>demonstrate its inapplicability here. We also take\u2014with more than a modicum of salt\u2014defendants\u2019 sudden contention that <em>Rodriguez </em>is supportive of the arguments they pose here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
