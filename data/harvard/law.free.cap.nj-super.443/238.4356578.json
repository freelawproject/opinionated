We must resolve two principal issues affecting the public\u2019s right to access government records.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">First, we must decide, as a procedural matter, whether a government records custodian\u2014in this case, the Association\u2014may bring an action pursuant to the DJA to secure a declaratory judgment that it properly denied access to a record under OPRA and the common law right of access. With respect to OPRA, we conclude that a records custodian may not bring a declaratory judgment action against a record requestor to enforce its right to withhold records, because OPRA does not provide the records custodian an independent right of action. As to both OPRA and the common law, declaratory relief was inappropriate in this case because the declaratory judgment action was essentially an effort to preempt an imminent claim by the records requestor; and allowing a declaratory judgment action solely with respect to the common law would unnecessarily fragment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Second, we are asked to determine, as a substantive matter, whether the requestor in this case, under OPRA or the common law, has a right to access records pertaining to a relief award made by the Association. We conclude that both OPRA and the common law require disclosure of documents containing the name of the applicant and the amount of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">This dispute arose out of the records request of defendant Jeff Carter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On July 15, 2013, Carter electronically filed a request, under OPRA and the common law, for records pertaining to an application for relief by John Doe,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a man associated with the Millstone Valley Fire Department. Carter sought the following documents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">1. Copies of record(s) (including attachments) <em>submitted by </em>[John Doe], Local 501 agent(s), and/or NJSFA agent(s) <em>seeking </em>financial benefits described in the \u201cBACKGROUND\u201d section above from January 1, 2008 through July 15, 2013.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">2. Copies of record(s) (including attachments) <em>sent to </em>[John Doe], Local 501 agent(s), and/or NJSFA agent(s) <em>disbursing </em>financial benefits described in the \u201cBACKGROUND\u201d section above from January 1, 2008 through July 15, 2013.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-10\">3. If no record(s) are responsive to Items No. 1 or 2 above, then copies of the <em>front </em>and <em>back </em>of every check providing relief and/or similar benefits, both State and Local, paid to [John Doe] between January 1, 2008 through July 15, 2013. (Note that checks are <em>not </em>required <em>if </em>responsive records are provided for Items No. 1 <em>and </em>2 above.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">Association vice president Frank Gunson denied Carter\u2019s request in a July 22, 2013 email. Gunson stated that applicants for relief through a local firemen\u2019s relief association or the Association \u201chave a reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d; release would constitute an \u201cunwarranted invasion\u201d of those rights; and \u201c[according<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>ly, the New Jersey State Firemen\u2019s Association cannot release those documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">On August 3, 2013, Carter responded that he did \u201cnot seek any legitimately defined privileged or exempt information,\u201d but he insisted that \u201ccertain records regarding financial matters (e.g., payroll records) <em>must </em>be provided with appropriate redactions.\u201d He asked for an index of any withheld or redacted documents, with explanations. Carter also stated, \u201cBecause I was unable to respond sooner, I understand that the timeframe for my original request will <em>resume </em>on the next business day (i.e. August 5, 2013).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Carter included an additional document request. He sought \u201ca copy of the policy and/or procedures governing how \u2018relief applications/requests are processed by the State and local associations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">On August 15, 2013, the Association filed its verified complaint for declaratory judgment, along with a proposed order to show cause, to compel Carter to show cause why the final relief sought in the verified complaint should not be entered. Although served only upon Carter, the Association sought an order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">a. Declaring that individual relief applications are of such a private nature that the New Jersey State Firemen\u2019s Association or the local relief association shall be prevented from acknowledging the existence of individual applications and prohibited from releasing the same under ... the Open Public Records Act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">b. Declaring that a Requestor, in order to determine whether the New Jersey State Firemen\u2019s Association or the local relief association is performing its duties appropriately, may request a series or date range of applications, but said applications may only be released upon the redaction of all personal information including the requestors\u2019 names, addresses, account numbers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">The Association sought identical relief with respect to the common law right of access.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">The Association argued that under OPRA the information Carter requested should not be subject to disclosure under OPRA because it would violate an applicant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy under N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1. The Association asserted that upon applying the factors in <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 88, 662 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>367 (1995), disclosure of applicant-specific documents should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The Association disclosed documents entitled \u201cRules and Guidelines Governing Relief Form 101\u201d; \u201cInstruction for Investigation of Relief Applicants by Local Relief Boards\u201d; \u201cApplication for Local Relief!\u2014]New Jersey State Firemen\u2019s Association\u201d; and \u201cInstructions for the Board of Trustees and Board of Representatives for Review of Relief Application.\u201d Although there is no competent evidence before us authenticating or explaining the documents, we assume for the sake of the appeal that the Association uses these documents when reviewing applications for relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The application forms generally require the submission of detailed personal financial information, and a personal statement of the applicant, to demonstrate the need for financial assistance from a local association or the Association. The \u201cRules and Guidelines\u201d document, and the respective instructions to the apparent decision-makers, do not include detailed criteria for determining whether to award relief and for what amount. The \u201cRules and Guidelines\u201d document describes the information applicants must submit. It states, \u201cRelief Assistance is <em>not automatic </em>and will only be considered on merit, documentation and determination by the local association.\u201d The instructions to the local relief boards state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">The intended use of this form, is to provide the respective boards with information pertaining to the applicant\u2019s request for supplementary financial assistance, and in determining the \u201cNEED.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">\n<em>WHAT IS \u201cNEED\"</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">\u201cNEED\u201d IS: Imperative Demand ***** Time of great difficulty * 4 * * * Crisis ***** Urgency</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-11\">\u201cNEED\u201d is a state of circumstances requiring something!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>It is important to remember, while a financial loss may be shown, there may not be the \u201cNEED.\u201d \u201cNEED\u201d and financial loss do not necessarily go hand in hand. (Example: The person may have a financial loss, but have financial means and can afford to cover the financial loss without the use of local relief, thus no \u201cNEED\u201d would then exist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Apparently, there are other rules or regulations not in the record before us, as the \u201cRules and Guidelines\u201d document includes a paragraph authorizing and consenting to the release of financial documents to the local association and the Association \u201cfor the purpose of determining eligibility for relief benefits ... in accordance with the requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:17-24 and <em>Article VII of the General Relief Fund Rules.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The documents indicate that the application process is intended to be confidential. The instructions to local relief boards include the statement: \u201cAll information given must be held in strict confidence.\u201d The Rules and Guidelines Document states, \u201cThe New Jersey State Firemen\u2019s Association is required to protect the confidentiality of information. All Officers are required to comply with our policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The trial court entered the order to show cause, required Carter to file a response to the order by September 16, 2013, and set a return date of September 27, 2013. The order also advised Carter that he was required to answer the verified complaint within thirty-five days.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Carter retained counsel and timely filed a verified answer and counterclaim, a third-party complaint against John Doe, and a letter brief in opposition to the Association\u2019s application for declaratory relief. Carter narrowed his document request, stating he only sought disclosure of the cheeks paid to John Doe and did not seek the applications Doe may have filed. He argued he was entitled to the checks under both OPRA and the common law. He sought dismissal of the Association\u2019s verified complaint and an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">In a supporting certification, Carter asserted that John Doe served as an elected fire commissioner and volunteer firefighter in Franklin Township. Carter stated that Doe was also a full-time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>municipal employee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Carter alleged that John Doe was found to have viewed pornographic images on a fire district computer. Although criminal charges were filed, a grand jury returned a no-bill, according to Carter. However, Doe was later discharged from his public employment for conduct unbecoming of a township employee. Carter attached newspaper articles to support his assertions. Carter also discussed a suit, filed by his sister and later settled, alleging a violation of the Law Against Discrimination by the fire district and Doe. Carter maintained that there was a public interest in learning whether a person who was discharged under the circumstances Carter described had received financial assistance through the Association. He disputed the Association\u2019s claim that Doe in particular had an expectation of privacy, given past publicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In a responsive certification, Gunson explained that members are often eligible for financial assistance from local associations; and if this assistance \u201cis not adequate to address that member\u2019s needs, the member can then approach the ... Association, which can award up[] to three (3) times the amount of the local contribution.\u201d Gunson did not disclose the criteria utilized for the financial assistance decisions, nor did he disclose the rules or regulations governing the decision process. However, he stated that the Association and local associations have specific procedures to treat members\u2019 applications anonymously, ehminating the possibility of discrimination in responding to the request for financial relief. These procedures include converting the applicant\u2019s name to a control number.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">In its answer to Carter\u2019s counterclaim, the Association asserted, among other defenses, that Carter\u2019s counterclaim was time-barred as it was filed more than forty-five days after the Association\u2019s denial of his document request.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The trial court heard argument on the return date in September 2013. The court also reviewed in camera Doe\u2019s application for assistance, which apparently had been submitted to the court in August, but was later sealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In an order filed January 15, 2014, the court denied Carter\u2019s requests for dismissal of the verified complaint, disclosure of the checks paid to Doe, and attorney\u2019s fees. The court did not enter a separate order granting declaratory relief to the Association. However, in an accompanying letter opinion, the court found that the names of relief recipients, the amounts paid through the Association\u2019s financial assistance programs, and their applications need not be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The court addressed the subject of applications, notwithstanding that Carter had limited his request to checks paid to John Doe and expressly stated he was not seeking information in the relief applications. The court applied the seven factors outlined in <em>Doe, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">(1) the type of record requested; (2) the information it does or might contain; (3) the potential for harm in any subsequent nonconsensual disclosure; (4) the injury from disclosure to the relationship in which the record was generated; (5) the adequacy of safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure; (6) the degree of need for access; and (7) whether there is an express statutory mandate, articulated public policy, or other recognized public interest militating toward access.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">[142 <em>N.J. </em>at 88, 662 A.2d 367 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">Based on that analysis, the court held that OPRA\u2019s privacy clause, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1, barred release;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">Applying the <em>Doe </em>factors to the present case, the application is a public record as a document kept, made or maintained in the course of official business of the Association. The second factor weighs in favor of non-disclosure because the information is an individual\u2019s complete and personal financial history, including but not limited to tax returns, credit card bills, mortgage payments and, hospital bills. Applying the third factor, revealing this information has the potential to lead to great harm created by the release of said information because it has the potential to lead to identity theft and public embarrassment. Defendant\u2019s argument that John Doe has already sustained great public embarrassment is not without merit being that the incident for which he was fired was disclosed in the newspaper. A significant harm exists if individual relief applications are released. Applying the fourth factor, the release of the information may cause an applicant to hesitate before [he or she] seeks assistance and may chill the disclosure of critical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>information regarding the need for assistance for fear that the knowledge will be subject to public scrutiny. The fifth factor, speaks to the adequacy of safeguards to prevent disclosure. The Association has established a system to convert the individual\u2019s name into a unique identification number for each applicant to ensure the confidentiality of the information and to protect the interests of the applicant. While the Association has not directed this Court towards a statute mandating nondisclosure the seventh factor weighs in favor of non-disclosure because there is no policy or statute which mandates access.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Citing <em>Loigman v. Kimmelman, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>98, 113, 505 A.2d 958 (1986), the trial court concluded that the common law did not require disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">This appeal followed. Carter now represents himself pro se. He renews his argument that the Association should not have been permitted to seek a declaratory judgment. Although he limited his request before the trial court to the checks paid to John Doe, he now renews his request for John Doe\u2019s applications, redacted as appropriate. We subsequently granted permission to the New Jersey Press Association (NJPA) to appear as amicus curiae. NJPA participates solely to argue that a records custodian may not seek a declaratory judgment under OPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">We turn first to defendant\u2019s argument that the Association was not entitled to seek a declaratory judgment confirming its denial of access under both OPRA and the common law right of access. We begin with an overview of the law on declaratory judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">The DJA is based on the 1922 Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act. 12 <em>U.L.A. </em>331 (2008). The DJA provides that \u201ca person ... whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a statute ... may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under the ... statute ... and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:16-53. <em>See Williams v. Borough of Clayton, </em>442 <em>N.J.Super. </em>583, 590-92, 126 A.3d 319, 2015 <em>WL </em>7357306, at **3-4 (App.Div.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>2015) (approving resort to declaratory relief regarding interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-129 and -130). The purpose of the Act \u201cis to settle and afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status and other legal relations.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:16-51; <em>N.J. Ass\u2019n for Retarded Citizens v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>234, 242, 445 A.2d 704 (1982) (\u201c[The purpose of the Act] is to end uncertainty about the legal rights and duties of the parties to litigation in controversies which have not yet reached the stage at which the parties seek a coercive remedy.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The DJA constitutes \u201cremedial legislation entitled to liberal construction and administration.\u201d <em>N.J. Ass\u2019n for Retarded Citizens, supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 241-42, 445 A.2d 704; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:16-51. The DJA must be \u201cinterpreted and construed as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law of those states which enact it, and to harmonize, as far as possible, with federal laws, rules and regulations on the subject of declaratory judgments.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:16-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The decision to grant or deny declaratory relief lies within the court\u2019s discretion. <em>See In re Resolution of State Comm. of Investigation, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>35, 46, 527 A.2d 851 (1987); <em>see also State v. Eatontown Borough, </em>366 <em>N.J.Super. </em>626, 637, 841 A.2d 990 (App.Div.2004) (\u201cGenerally, it rests in the sound discretion of the trial court whether declaratory relief under the Act should be granted.\u201d). \u201cDeclaratory relief is not to be denied simply because other relief is available.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l-Ben Franklin Fire Ins. Co. v. Camden Trust Co., </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>16, 22, 120 A.2d 754 (1956); <em>see also R. </em>4:42-3 (\u201cA judgment for declaratory relief, if appropriate, is not precluded by the existence of another appropriate remedy.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">On the other hand, \u201ca court might in the proper exercise of its discretion, deny such [declaratory] relief if it satisfactorily appeared that the other relief would be <em>more </em>effective.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l-Ben Franklin Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>at 22, 120 A.2d 754. For example, a court may decline to award relief \u201cwhere only fragmentary redress will be awarded____\u201d <em>Utility Blade &amp; Razor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>Co. v. Donovan, </em>33 <em>N.J.Super. </em>566, 572, 111 A.2d 300 (App.Div.1955). \u201cThe court may refuse to render or enter a declaratory judgment, when, if rendered or entered, it would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:16-61; <em>see also Nat\u2019l-Ben Franklin Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>at 23, 120 A.2d 754. A court may also decline to render a declaratory judgment if \u201cconvinced that the public interest and an enlightened use of the judicial function\u201d require restraint. <em>The Proprietary Ass\u2019n v. Bd. of Pharmacy, </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>62, 71, 106 A.2d 272 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The right to relief under the DJA is procedural in nature; it does not create substantive rights to relief. \u201cA declaratory judgment act merely provides a procedural device to accelerate the resolution of a dispute; the procedural right does not alter the substance of the dispute.\u201d <em>Ciba-Geigy Corp. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>278, 302, 693 A.2d 844 (1997) (O\u2019Hern, J., dissenting); <em>see Labor Ready Northeast, Inc. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>25 <em>N.J.Tax </em>607, 621 (Tax 2011). The United States Supreme Court has adopted a similar view of the federal Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2201. <em>See Schilling v. Rogers, </em>363 <em>U.S. </em>666, 677, 80 <em>S.Ct. </em>1288, 1296, 4 L.Ed.2d 1478, 1485-86 (1960) (stating that the availability of relief under the federal Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2201, \u201cpresupposes the existence of a judicially remediable right\u201d); <em>Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>339 <em>U.S. </em>667, 671, 70 <em>S.Ct. </em>876, 879, 94 <em>L.Ed. </em>1194, 1199 (1950) (\u201cThe operation of the Declaratory Judgment Act is procedural only. Congress enlarged the range of remedies available in the federal courts but did not extend their jurisdiction.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Put another way, if there is no private right of action under a particular statute, a party may not secure a declaration of its statutory rights by seeking relief under the DJA. This general principle is implied by the Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Resolution of State Comm. of Investigation, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 46, 527 A.2d 851. The Court declined to render a declaratory judgment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>question whether the State Commission on Investigation (SCI) unlawfully disclosed information about the plaintiffs. The Court held that plaintiffs lacked a private right of action to secure injunctive relief against the SCI arising out of the alleged disclosures. <em>Ibid. </em>(\u201c[0]ur decision that the plaintiffs may not obtain the injunctive relief they sought undermines their need for a declaratory judgment.\u201d); <em>see also In re A.N., </em>430 <em>N.J.Super. </em>235, 244-45, 63 A.3d 764 (App.Div.2013) (holding that the Chancery Division lacked jurisdiction under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:16-55 to determine Medicaid eligibility, where the authority to do so was vested in the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services); <em>Med. Soc. of N.J. v. AmeriHealth HMO, Inc., </em>376 <em>N.J.Super. </em>48, 59, 868 A.2d 1162 (App.Div.2005) (denying Medical Society\u2019s claim for declaratory and injunctive relief under <em>L. </em>1989, c. 154, as it lacked a private right of action).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Courts in other jurisdictions applying comparable provisions of their declaratory judgment acts have clearly stated the principle that declaratory relief is unavailable when there is no private right of action. <em>See Pono v. Molokai Ranch, Ltd., </em>119 <em>Hawai'i </em>164, 194 P.3d 1126, 1148 (Ct.App.2008) (\u201c[I]n order for a private citizen to seek a declaratory judgment that a statute has been violated, the private citizen must, as a threshold matter, have a private right of action to enforce the statute.\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>2008 <em>WL </em>5392320, 208 <em>Haw.

Aransas Cty., </em>805 F.Supp.2d 322, 339 (S.D.Tex.2011) (noting that because the federal act does not create a substantive cause of action, but can only be invoked to address a controversy arising under other substantive law, plaintiff could not seek relief to which he would otherwise not be entitled); <em>Jones v.

We construe our DJA in harmony with the foregoing state and federal decisions. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:16-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">As the federal court in <em>Jones </em>observed, where enforcement of a law is vested solely in the executive branch, allowing declaratory relief \u201cwould circumvent the discretion entrusted to the executive branch in deciding how and when to enforce those statutes.\u201d <em>Jones, supra, </em>745 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 893. Likewise, where no private right of action exists, allowing parties to obtain declaratory relief would \u201cevade the intent of Congress not to create private rights of action.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">A related principle of the law of declaratory judgments is that \u201cwhere a special <em>statutory </em>procedure has been provided as an exclusive remedy for a particular type of case in hand ... that specific recourse must be followed,\u201d to the exclusion of declaratory relief. Edwin Borchard, <em>Declaratory Judgments </em>(2d ed.1941) at 342. \u201cSo, when the statute provides that an appeal from an administrative determination may be taken only in a certain way and to a certain court ... it would have been wrong for another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>court ... to interfere and entertain a suit for a declaration____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">We adopt the same reasoning here. To do otherwise would allow records custodians to evade the Legislature\u2019s intent with respect to enforcement of rights under OPRA, which we discuss below. We recognize that the phrase \u201cprivate right of action\u201d may appear to be a misnomer when used to define the rights of the Association, which is a public agency under OPRA. Yet, the governing principle is the same. A party that lacks a statutory right of action under OPRA may not obtain declaratory relief regarding its rights or obligations under OPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">We conclude that OPRA does not vest a right of action in a records custodian. Consequently, a records custodian has no right to declaratory relief. Put another way, the Legislature intended that only requestors may seek review of OPRA decisions, by resort to the Government Records Council (GRC) or the court. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:lA-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">OPRA expressly grants a right of action exclusively to requestors. A requestor may elect to bring an action in Superior Court, or before the GRC, to challenge a denial of access:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-11\"><em>A person who is denied access to a government record by the custodian of the record, at the option of the requestor, </em>may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-12\">institute a proceeding to challenge the custodian\u2019s decision by filing an action in Superior Court which shall be heard in the vicinage where it is filed by a Superior Court Judge who has been designated to hear such cases because of that judge\u2019s knowledge and expertise in matters relating to access to government records; or in lieu of filing an action in Superior Court, file a complaint with the Government Records Council established pursuant to section 8 of P.L.2001, c. 404 (C. 47:lA-7). <em>The right to institute any proceeding under this section shall be solely that of the requestor. </em>Any such proceeding shall proceed in a summary or expedited manner. The public agency shall have the burden of proving that the denial of access is authorized by law. If it is determined that access has been improperly denied, the court or agency head shall order that access be allowed. A requestor who prevails in any proceeding shall be entitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-13\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-6 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Even assuming for argument\u2019s sake that N.J.S.A 47:lA-6 does not grant a right of action exclusively to a requestor,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> any other party\u2019s right of action would have to be inferred, given the absence of an explicit grant. However, our courts \u201chave been reluctant to infer a statutory private right of action where the Legislature has not expressly provided for such action.\u201d <em>R.J. Gaydos Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Consumer Ins. Co., </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>255, 271, 773 A.2d 1132 (2001). The Court has adopted a three-part test for determining whether a statute implies a private right of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">To determine if a statute confers an implied private right of action, courts consider whether: (1) plaintiff is a member of the class for whose special benefit the statute was enacted; (2) there is any evidence that the Legislature intended to create a private right of action under the statute; and (3) it is consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to infer the existence of such a remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 272, 773 A.2d 1132.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">A court\u2019s primary mission is to determine legislative intent. <em>Id. </em>at 272-73, 773 A.2d 1132.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Applying this test, we conclude the Legislature did not intend for records custodians to bring actions against record requestors to enforce their asserted right to withhold records. OPRA was enacted to promote the public\u2019s right of access to government records, and to enable the public to monitor the activities of government. <em>See, e.g., Educ. Law Ctr. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>274, 284, 966 A.2d 1054 (2009) (\u201cOPRA\u2019s clear purpose ... is \u2018to maximize public knowledge about public affairs in order to ensure an informed citizenry and to minimize the evils inherent in a secluded process.\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Mason v. City of Hoboken, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>51, 64, 951 A.2d 1017 (2008)). Having reviewed OPRA\u2019s legislative history, we find no evidence of legislative intent to grant a right of action to records custodians. OPRA provides a broad right of access to government records. The statute \u201cshall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>be construed in favor of the public\u2019s right of access.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>47:1A-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Recognizing such a right of action would be contrary to legislative design. A right of action would enable records custodians to hale into court requestors who have no interest in pursuing any review of a records custodian\u2019s denial, subjecting requestors to the emotional turmoil and burdens attendant to being sued. Such a right of action would also undermine requestors\u2019 express right under OPRA to choose whether to challenge the denial of access before the GRC or in court, by empowering records custodians to choose the forum. Just the threat of suit may deter some citizens from exercising their rights under OPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Although the foregoing analysis does not address the right to declaratory relief regarding the Association\u2019s obligations under the common law right of access, we conclude that such relief would have been inappropriate in this case. We do so for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">First, the Association\u2019s evident intent was to preempt an action by Carter. We long ago held that judicial discretion to grant relief under the declaratory judgment statute should be withheld from a party whose clear purpose was \u201cto have the court adjudicate in advance the validity of its possible defense to defendants\u2019 imminent law suit.\u201d <em>Rego Indus., Inc. v. Am. Modern Metals Corp., </em>91 <em>N.J.Super. </em>447, 453, 221 A.2d 35 (App.Div.1966); <em>see also Donadio v. Cunningham, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>309, 325, 277 A.2d 375 (1971) (stating that \u201crelief by way of a declaratory judgment should be withheld, when the request is in effect an attempt to have the court adjudicate in advance the validity of a possible defense in some expected future law suit\u201d); <em>Utility Blade &amp; Razor, supra, </em>33 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 572-73, 111 A.2d 300 (\u201cIn the usual case where an action by one party is imminent, it would serve no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>sensible purpose to permit his adversary to sue first for a declaration that he has a good defense to the action.\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Second, allowing a declaratory judgment action to proceed to clarify duties under the common law right of access, when relief under OPRA is precluded, would result in \u201cfragmentary redress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571, 111 A.2d 300. As noted above, a court is empowered to refuse declaratory relief when it \u201cwould not terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:16-61.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In sum, we conclude that the court erred in granting the Association declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">We turn to the issue whether Carter was entitled under OPRA to obtain access to records of relief payments to John Doe.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Before doing so, we review briefly the role of the Association and local relief associations.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">We have previously discussed at some length the history of the Association, the local relief associations, and their statutory authority to grant relief payments and burial benefits to their members and members\u2019 families. <em>Paff v. N.J. State Firemen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>431 <em>N.J.Super. </em>278, 69 A.3d 118 (App.Div.2013). Among their purposes, local relief associations shall maintain a fund for the relief, support or burial of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">(1) needy firefighters and their families;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">(2) any persons and the families of any persons who are injured or die in the course of doing public fire duty, or who may become needy or disabled or die as the result of doing such duty or be prevented by the injury or by illness arising from doing such duty, from attending to their usual occupation or calling; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">(3) the families of any persons doing public fire duty who die as the result of an act of terrorism committed against the United States of America while such persons were serving as federal, State or local law enforcement officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>43:17-3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">The Association \u201cshall have the same rights, powers and privileges as the local firemen\u2019s relief associations, including providing for the distribution of any fund for the relief of disabled or needy firefighters and their families.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:17-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">Awards of relief shall be made pursuant to rules and regulations adopted by the Association. <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:17-3(c) (\u201cThe relief, support or burial benefit shall be granted in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by the New Jersey State Firemen\u2019s Association.\u201d); see <em>also N.J.S.A. </em>43:17-24, -35. However, the Association\u2019s rules and regulations have not been promulgated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>with notice and allowing comment. <em>See N.J. Const. </em>Art. V, \u00a7 4, para. 6; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The statute also authorizes consideration of why a person is in need.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">No person shall be given assistance if the cause of the need or the reason for the disability or the nature or cause of the injury or sickness is not in the opinion of the board of representatives such as to entitle the applicant to assistance, or if the applicant is deemed financially unworthy of assistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>43:17-24.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The Department of Banking and Insurance (DOBI) requires local relief associations to file annual reports including the names of relief beneficiaries and the amounts paid.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The applicable regulations provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">(a) All local relief associations shall file with the Commissioner, the Secretary of State, and the secretary of the State Association, no later than April 1 of each year, a sworn statement, which shall contain the following information:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">1.

We have previously determined that the Association is a public agency subject to OPRA. <em>Paff, supra, </em>431 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 279, 69 A.3d 118. Also, it is undisputed that relief payment records are government records. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1. Although numerous categories of documents are exempt from the definition of government records, <em>see Educ. Law Ctr., supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 284, 966 A.2d 1054 (\u201cOPRA excludes twenty-one categories of information, making the public right of access not absolute\u201d) (citation omitted), none of the exemptions apply here. Furthermore, the Association does not invoke any regulation or executive order that arguably removes the payment records from the scope of its disclosure obligations under OPRA.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The privacy clause is a substantive counterweight to the right to access under OPRA. <em>Burnett v. Cty. of Bergen, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>408, 422-23, 968 A.2d 1151 (2009). Courts must balance OPRA\u2019s mandate of disclosure with its protection of privacy. <em>Id. </em>at 425-26, 968 A.2d 1151. To do so, the Court determined it was appropriate to consider the seven factors identified in <em>Doe, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AON\">(1) the type of record requested; (2) the information it does or might contain; (3) the potential for harm in any subsequent nonconsensual disclosure; (4) the injury from disclosure to the relationship in which the record was generated; (5) the adequacy of safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure; (6) the degree of need for access; and (7) whether there is an express statutory mandate, articulated public policy, or other recognized public interest militating toward access.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>[Id. </em>at 427, 968 A.2d 1151 (quoting <em>Doe, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 88, 662 A.2d 367).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeQ\">A court must engage in a case-specific analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 437, 968 A.2d 1151 (\u201cThis balancing of interests must be applied ease by case, and under different facts, another result might be proper.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Although the trial court applied the <em>Doe </em>factors, we consider them de novo. <em>See K.L. v. Evesham Twp. Bd. of Educ., </em>423 <em>N.J.Super. </em>337, 349, 32 A.3d 1136 (App.Div.2011) (stating that an appellate court exercises de novo review of a trial court decision regarding whether OPRA requires disclosure of publicly held records), <em>certif. denied, </em>210 <em>N.J. </em>108, 40 A.3d 732 (2012). In so doing, we part company with the trial court, given its determination that the privacy clause shields relief payment records.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">We consider together the first two factors\u2014the record type and information contained. Carter seeks copies of checks, which would confirm the identity of a relief applicant, state the amounts of relief received, and state when they were received from a public agency empowered to make discretionary relief decisions. However, if Carter is able to confirm that Doe received relief, additional information may be inferred; even without his application documents, Carter may infer that Doe was in financial distress, although cause and extent were not disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Personal financial information in the possession of public agencies\u2014which is what Carter seeks\u2014has not been treated uniformly under OPRA and implementing regulations and executive orders. OPRA exempts \u201cthe pension or personnel records of any individual in the possession of a public agency\u201d from the definition of government records, but does not exempt a public employee\u2019s \u201cname, title, position, salary, payroll record,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> length of service, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>date of separation and the reason therefor, and the amount and type of any pension received.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-10. Aso, Executive Order No. 26 (McGreevey), \u00b6 4(b)(3) (2002) exempts \u201cinformation describing a natural person\u2019s finances, income, assets, liabilities, net worth, bank balances, financial history or activities, or creditworthiness, except as otherwise required by law to be disclosed.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">None of these sources directly address Association relief payments, although both parties seek support from <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1-10. The payments are not salary or remuneration for employment, although they are a benefit for qualified firefighters\u2014including, notably, volunteer firefighters\u2014in return for service. Relief payments are discretionary, like bonuses and gifts that are reported on payroll records, but relief recipients are not on the Association\u2019s payroll. The Association argues the payments should be withheld as a \u201cpension record\u201d exempt under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-10, and Carter argues the payments should be disclosed as \u201cthe amount and type of any pension received,\u201d which are not exempt under <em>N.J.S.A </em>47:1A-10. In our view, neither interpretation is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Athough one might argue that a relief award is \u201cinformation describing a natural person\u2019s ... income\u201d under Executive Order No. 26,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the Order was apparently intended to address personal financial information that a citizen entrusts to the government. <em>See </em>Executive Order No. 21 (McGreevey) \u00b64 (which Executive Order No. 26 was intended to clarify). It was not intended to bar release of records pertaining to outlays by a public agency to a citizen. Further, any ambiguity in the Executive Order should be resolved in favor of disclosure. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1 (\u201c[L]imita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>tions on the right of access accorded by [OPRA] ... shall be construed in favor of the public\u2019s right of access.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Although the relief payments do not fall neatly into the statutory categories found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1-10, their similarity to forms of payment that are subject to disclosure arguably strengthens the case for access. However, there is an important difference between relief awards and salary, pension payments, or even bonuses and gifts reported in payroll records. Bonuses are awarded generally for a job well done\u2014which is unlikely to embarrass the recipient. Relief benefits are awarded upon proof that someone is in financial distress, which may subject the recipient to embarrassment. A similar distinction can be drawn between disability insurance payments, which the GRC has found to be disclosable, <em>see, e.g., Gordon v. City of Orange, </em>GRC Complaint No. 2013-255 (2014), and relief benefits. We conclude factors one and two weigh slightly in favor of non-disclosure based on this distinction between relief awards and other forms of remuneration or compensation that are subject to disclosure under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\"><em>Doe </em>factors three and four relate to the potential for harm. The Association\u2019s vice president asserts that John Doe, and other beneficiaries whose records would be released, will suffer public embarrassment. The Association also speculates that future applicants for relief would be deterred from seeking benefits to avoid public embarrassment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We note that release would also arguably have the effect of upsetting the reasonable expectations of applicants, inasmuch as the application forms state that the \u201cAssociation is required to protect the confidentiality of information.\u201d While that may be read to refer only to an applicant\u2019s submission, it would be reasonable for an applicant to expect that any benefits received would also be confidential. Upsetting these expectations may affect \u201cthe relationship in which the record was generated.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>On the other hand, disclosure may empower Association members to assess the Association\u2019s process for deciding such applications, thereby ultimately enhancing their relationship with the organization. We conclude factors three and four slightly favor nondisclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Factor five refers to \u201cthe adequacy of safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure.\u201d This concerns the extent to which the requested documents are otherwise protected from disclosure. The Association\u2019s vice president asserted that consideration of applications is performed without attaching the applicant\u2019s name, to assure unbiased consideration. On the other hand, Carter maintained that existing safeguards were inadequate, because he learned through some unnamed source that Doe had received benefits. Given the apparent leak, this factor neither favors nor disfavors disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">It is also reasonable to discuss factors six and seven together. Carter\u2019s need for access is based on an interest in the Association\u2019s exercise of its authority to grant relief in Doe\u2019s case. Carter questions whether it is appropriate to award benefits to a person who was charged with crimes and allegedly terminated for conduct related to those charges. We need not take a position on whether the circumstances of Doe\u2019s termination should be a factor in the Association\u2019s decision-making to conclude that Carter\u2019s expressed interest relates to the Association\u2019s governance. For example, Carter does not seek disclosure for financial gain, as a finance company might, in seeking the names of beneficiaries because they are in financial distress and may be worth soliciting. Carter\u2019s request is instead grounded in an interest in the Association\u2019s authority to grant Doe a relief award given the allegations of impropriety that led to Doe\u2019s termination from public employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">We noted above that the statute authorizes consideration of the cause of a person\u2019s financial need. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:17-24. The relief decisions must be made according to the Association\u2019s rules and regulations. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:17-3(c). However, the lack of transparency in the Association\u2019s decision-making process, including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>lack of publicly available rules and regulations adopted after notice and comment, heightens the need for disclosure of documents related to individual cases. <em>Cf. Mason, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>at 64, 951 A.2d 1017 (stating that OPRA is designed \u201cto maximize public knowledge about public affairs in order to ensure an informed citizenry and to minimize the evils inherent in a secluded process.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The need for disclosure is also heightened by the fact that, apparently, only local relief associations\u2019 beneficiaries and amounts of grants are subject to DOBI\u2019s outside review. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:1-38.3. We conclude that factors six and seven weigh heavily in favor of disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Upon balancing the <em>Doe </em>factors, in view of the circumstances presented in this case, we conclude that the privacy clause does not bar plaintiffs right under OPRA to the records of the relief payments made to Doe.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">We briefly address the Association\u2019s contention that a contrary result is compelled by <em>Michelson v. Wyatt, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>611, 880 A.2d 458 (App.Div.2005). We disagree. In <em>Michelson, supra, </em>plaintiff sought disclosure of documents and information pertaining to the health insurance benefits enjoyed by public employees of the city in which he lived. <em>Id. </em>at 614, 880 A.2d 458. The court held that plaintiffs request was \u201cnot subject to access and disclosure pursuant to OPRA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623, 880 A.2d 458. The court deemed the detailed health insurance information requested to be personnel records that fell outside of government records as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-10. Also, disclosure was barred by Executive Order No. 26, which established that \u201cinformation regarding an individual\u2019s health history is not a government record subject to public access.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619-20, 880 A.2d 458; Executive Order No. 26 (McGreevey), \u00b6 4(b)(1) (2002). Finally, disclosure was barred by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:9-1.2(b), which \u201ctreats all personal health information as confidential information in accordance with HIPAA.\u201d <em>Michelson, supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 620, 880 A.2d 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\"><em>Michelson </em>does not compel non-disclosure in this case. Relief payments are not personnel records under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-10. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Furthermore, disclosure is not shielded by Executive Order No. 26 or any duly adopted regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In sum, plaintiff is entitled to the limited disclosure of Doe\u2019s relief payment checks under OPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">We also conclude that Carter is entitled to Doe\u2019s payment records under the common law right of access. <em>See Mason, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>at 67, 951 A.2d 1017 (noting that OPRA does not limit the common law right of access) (citing N.J.S.A. 47:1A-8). There is no question that Carter seeks a public record, subject to the common law right of access. <em>See Nero v. Hyland, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>213, 222, 386 A.2d 846 (1978) (\u201cThe elements essential to constitute a public record are ... that it be a written memorial, that it be made by a public officer, and that the officer be authorized by law to make it.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). There also is no question that Carter has standing; he is an Association member interested in the criteria applied to relief decisions. <em>See Irval, supra, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>at 372, 294 A.2d 425 (stating that some showing of interest is required to enforce the common law right to inspect).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">An access request under the common law is subject to an \u201cexquisite weighing process\u201d that balances the requestor\u2019s interest in disclosure and the government\u2019s interest in confidentiality. <em>Loigman v. Kimmelman, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>98, 108, 505 A.2d 958 (1986). The balancing process must be \u201cconcretely focused upon the relative interests of the parties in relation to the specific materials in question.\u201d <em>Piniero v. N.J. Div. of State Police, </em>404 <em>N.J.Super. </em>194, 206-07, 961 A.2d 1 (App.Div.2008) (citing <em>McClain v. Coll. Hosp., </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>346, 361, 492 A.2d 991 (1985)). The Court has identified several factors that may be considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-10\">(1) the extent to which disclosure will impede agency functions by discouraging citizens from providing information to the government; (2) the effect disclosure may have upon persons who have given such information, and whether they did so in reliance that their identities would not be disclosed; (3) the extent to which agency self-evaluation, program improvement, or other decisionmaking will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>chilled by disclosure; (4) the degree to which the information sought includes factual data as opposed to evaluative reports of policymakers; (5) whether any findings of public misconduct have been insufficiently corrected by remedial measures instituted by the investigative agency; and (6) whether any agency disciplinary or investigatory proceedings have arisen that may circumscribe the individual\u2019s asserted need for the materials. Against these and any other relevant factors should be balanced the importance of the information sought to the plaintiffs vindication of the public interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\"><em>[Loigman, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 113, 505 A.2d 958 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The requestor\u2019s motivation is also a relevant consideration. <em>Loigman, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 104, 505 A.2d 958 (\u201cSomewhat different but related considerations arise when the citizen seeks access to information to further a public good\u201d as opposed to a private interest.).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\"><em>Loigman </em>factors one and two slightly favor confidentiality. As discussed above, the Association contends disclosure of Doe\u2019s records may discourage members from applying for benefits in the future; however, this fear is speculative. In any event, Carter\u2019s request is confined to a single recipient, limiting any chilling effect of disclosure. However, as noted above, an applicant may reasonably have relied on the reference to confidentiality in the application form.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Turning to factor three, we discern no threat that disclosure would chill the ability of the Association or local associations to render their decisions, or to engage in self-evaluation and improvement. If anything, disclosure may encourage self-criticism and internal oversight. Carter seeks factual data, not evaluative reports (factor four). Moreover, there is no evidence that alternative remedial measures or outside oversight have addressed the issue of concern to Carter\u2014that is, whether benefits are granted to persons whose financial distress is allegedly the result of their misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">As <em>Loigman </em>provides, other relevant factors may be considered. In this case, weight may be given to the fact that Doe has already been placed in the public eye. His arrest and his termination received publicity in the local newspapers. Thus, to some extent, his personal travails are already in the public domain. What is not disclosed is whether he has received assistance from a local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>association or the Association. This distinguishes Carter\u2019s request from a request for payments made to any and all beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Carter\u2019s professed need is not based on personal curiosity, or personal financial interest. Rather, it is based on his interest in determining the criteria for relief awards, specifically, whether the local association or Association deems it appropriate to consider the cause of a person\u2019s financial need. The lack of transparency in the Association\u2019s decision-making, the lack of rules adopted pursuant to the APA, and the lack of oversight by DOBI of Association awards, heightens the interest in disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">In sum, we conclude that the public interest in disclosure in this ease outweighs the interest in confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">We briefly address the Association\u2019s argument that Carter\u2019s counterclaim for disclosure was time-barred, as it was filed more than forty-five days after the denial. OPRA actions have a forty-five-day statute of limitations, as do actions in lieu of prerogative writs. <em>Mason, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>at 57, 951 A.2d 1017. However, that time frame may be enlarged \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 951 A.2d 1017. The time period should be enlarged here because the Association\u2019s declaratory judgment action effectively preempted Carter\u2019s option to resort to the GRC, which has no specified limitations period. <em>Id. </em>at 70, 951 A.2d 1017. Carter was compelled to respond to a lawsuit that, as discussed above, the Association was not entitled to bring in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">We also note that because Carter has prevailed, in that he has secured access to Doe\u2019s relief payment records, he is entitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-6.

I further agree with the conclusions that OPRA \u201cgrants a right of action exclusively to requestors,\u201d and that \u201cthe Legislature did not intend for records custodians to bring actions against record requestors to enforce their asserted right to withhold records.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 257, 258, 128 A.3d at 727, 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">I also agree that the Legislature did not intend to permit any \u201cpublic agency,\u201d like the Association, to commence an action under OPRA seeking to pre-emptively establish <em>a defense that is expressly provided by the statute. See N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-5(g) (permitting the custodian of a government record to \u201cassert[ ] that part of a particular record is exempt from public access\u201d). Finally, I agree that permitting a public agency to initiate a lawsuit asserting a defense to the production of particular public records under the common law would result in \u201cfragmentary redress,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 260-61, 128 A.3d at 729-30, and should be avoided in furtherance of the salutary goal of judicial economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">I write separately, however, to state my respectful disagreement with my colleagues\u2019 expansive conclusion in Part II-A of their opinion that \u201cif there is no private right of action under a particular statute, a party may not secure a declaration of its statutory rights by seeking relief under the DJA.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 253, 128 A.3d at 725. In my opinion, that conclusion is not supported by the clear and unambiguous language of the DJA, which is the clearest indication of the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Town of Kearny v. Brandt, </em>214 <em>N.J. </em>76, 98, 67 A.3d 601 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">As noted by my colleagues, the DJA is remedial in nature and entitled to liberal interpretation. <em>Ante </em>at 251-52, 128 A.3d at 723-24. The DJA provides that \u201c[a]ll courts of record ... shall ... have power to declare rights, status and other legal relations, <em>whether or not farther relief is or could be claimed.\u201d N.J.S.A. </em>2A:16-52 (emphasis added). Seemingly, the Legislature did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>intend to foreclose a party from seeking relief under the DJA even if \u201cfurther relief1\u2019 could not be claimed by that party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:16-53, in turn, provides that \u201c[a] person ... <em>whose rights, status or other legal relations are affected by a statute, ... </em>may have determined <em>any question of construction or validity </em>arising under the ... statute ... and obtain a declaration of rights, status or other legal relations thereunder.\u201d (Emphasis added). As noted, I agree that a public agency cannot initiate a lawsuit under OPRA to determine whether a specific record is exempt from production under OPRA. In my mind, the highly discretionary remedy of declaratory relief cannot be invoked to settle such a dispute, because that issue has little to do with the \u201crights, status or other legal relation[]\u201d of and between, in this ease, the Association and Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">However, the Association is undoubtedly a person \u201cwhose rights, status and other legal relations <em>are affected\u201d </em>by OPRA. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:16-53 (emphasis added). In a different context, I believe the Association could initiate a lawsuit seeking relief under the DJA. For example, in <em>Paff, supra, </em>431 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 285, 69 A.3d 118 the trial court dismissed the plaintiffs complaint, finding the Association was not a public agency subject to OPRA. After thoroughly reviewing the Association\u2019s \u201cformation, structure, and function,\u201d we concluded that it was a public agency under OPRA and reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 289-90, 69 A.3d 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">In <em>Paff, </em>the issue arose in the context of an OPRA suit already initiated by a \u201crequestor.\u201d Given the Association\u2019s unusual status, however, I doubt that we would have dismissed an action initiated by the Association pursuant to the DJA seeking a declaration as to whether or not it was public agency. Even though OPRA provides no right of action to a public agency, I believe the Association\u2019s complaint in that context\u2014whether the association was subject to OPRA\u2014would have been cognizable under the DJA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>I find support for this conclusion not only through application of the plain language of the DJA, but also in cases that have long-recognized the appropriateness of such relief under the DJA. <em>See, e.g., N.J. Ass\u2019n for Retarded Citizens, supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 242, 445 A.2d 704 (resort to the DJA is appropriate \u201cto end uncertainty about the legal rights and duties of the parties ... in controversies which have not yet reached the stage at which the parties seek a coercive remedy,\u201d and where \u201cthere is an actual controversy ... which involves differing views on the meaning of applicable statutory provisions\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">In this regard, while the out-of-state and federal cases cited by my colleagues provide support for their conclusion\u2014\u201cif there is no private right of action under a particular statute, a party may not secure a declaration of its statutory rights\u201d\u2014I do not believe any of the cited New Jersey eases do. Moreover, it strikes me as anomalous that a statute like OPRA that provides a specific unilateral cause of action to a requestor could nonetheless provide the rationale for barring a clearly \u201caffected\u201d party\u2014here, the Association\u2014from seeking relief under the DJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Moreover, our courts have considered requests for declaratory relief under the DJA even though the particular statute at issue provided no right of action to a litigant. For example, in <em>Chamber of Commerce v. State, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>131, 138-39, 445 A.2d 353 (1982), the Court considered whether the plaintiff trade association was enti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>tied to relief under the DJA declaring the <em>Strikebreakers Act, N.J.S.A. </em>34:13C-1 to -6, unconstitutional. The Court ultimately concluded that portions of the statute were preempted by federal labor law, but other sections were not. <em>Id. </em>at 163, 445 A.2d 353. The Court did not predicate the relief upon the plaintiff, or for that matter, any person, having a private right of action under the Strikebreakers Act. Indeed, the statute was essentially penal in nature, and presumably could not be invoked by anyone other than the State. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34:13C-5 (making any violation of the act a misdemeanor).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">In <em>NL Indus., Inc. v.

Protection, </em>397 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 133, 936 A.2d 469 (App.Div.2007), <em>certif. denied, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>418, 949 A.2d 847 (2008), we considered the \u201crights and responsibilities\u201d of the parties under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10B-3.1, which permitted a local government unit that condemned property to replace\u2014with the Department\u2019s approval\u2014a person performing remediation at the contaminated site. Before considering the merits, we concluded that the plaintiffs complaint was cognizable under the DJA, specifically rejecting the Department\u2019s argument that jurisdiction lay in the Appellate Division and not the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 131-32, 936 A.2d 469. Notably, neither the statute at issue, nor the legislation of which it was a part, provided the remediating party with a specific cause of action by which to challenge the Department\u2019s or the public entity\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Finally, although I agree with much of my colleagues\u2019 opinion, I believe it unnecessary to paint with such a broad brush. Whether the DJA means what it says, or, whether its remedies are available only to those whom the Legislature has provided a specific cause of action, is an issue of some import. Resolving that issue in a manner that I believe departs from existing precedent is more appropriately the province of our Supreme Court. <em>See, e.g., Riley v. Keenan, </em>406 <em>N.J.Super. </em>281, 297, 967 A.2d 868 (App.Div.) (noting that an appellate court \u201cshould normally defer to the Supreme Court with respect to the creation of a new cause of action\u201d) (citing <em>Tynan v. Curzi, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>267, 277, 753 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>187 (App.Div.2000)), <em>certif. denied, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>207, 976 A.2d 384 (2009); <em>Proske v. St. Barnabas Med. Ctr., </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>311, 316, 712 A.2d 1207 (App.Div.1998) (declining to find damages for personal injuries based on a failure to perform a contractual term \u201c \u2018in the absence of [any] precedent, or ... clear direction by dictum from our Supreme Court\u2019 \u201d authorizing such action) (quoting <em>Coyle v. Englander\u2019s, </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>212, 226, 488 A.2d 1083 (App.Div.1985)), <em>certif. denied, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>685, 731 A.2d 45 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">I therefore respectfully concur in the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-9\"> In <em>Paff, </em>we cited three other cases that involved public agencies that, given their unusual circumstances, challenged whether they were subject to OPRA. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>at 287, 69 A.3d 118 (citing <em>Sussex Commons Assocs., LLC v. Rutgers, the State Univ., </em>210 N.J. 531, 46 A.3d 536 (2012); <em>Fair Share Hous. Ctr., Inc. v. N.J. State League of Municipalities, </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>489, 25 A.3d 1063 (2011); <em>The Times of Trenton Publ'g Corp. v. Lafayette Yard Cmty. Dev. Corp., </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>519, 874 A.2d 1064 (2005)). Although in those cases the issue arose in the context of a pending prerogative writ lawsuit brought by a requestor, I believe the Court would have resolved the issue had the public agency initiated the suit for declaratory relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-7\"> I recognize that there must be an \u201cactual controversy\u201d before the DJA can be invoked. <em>Finkel </em>v. <em>Twp. of Hopewell, </em>434 <em>N.J.Super. </em>303, 318, 84 A.3d 263 (App.Div.2013). However, that predicate could be easily satisfied, for example, if a request has been made, but the litigation has not commenced, as was the case here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
