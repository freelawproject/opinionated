Defendant D.B., an elementary school art teacher, appeals from an amended August 1, 2013 IAIU findings report. Both defendants contest the validity of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:129-7.3, upon which the Department\u2019s findings were based.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">D.B. and A.G. both seek to have the Department\u2019s findings letter changed from \u201cnot established\u201d to \u201cunfounded.\u201d We affirm the findings of \u201cnot established,\u201d but reverse and remand for the Department to issue new reports in conformity with the clear directions we have previously provided to the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\n<em>A.G.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">We first summarize the factual information with regard to each defendant separately, <em>beginning </em>with A.G. A.G. was employed by the Paterson public schools for twenty-nine years. On May 16, 2013, the Department received a referral from the principal stating that the prior day the teacher of a class of students with learning disabilities saw A.G. hit five-year-old Joey<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> multiple times on his arm with her open hand. Joey had been diagnosed as autistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">From May to July the IAIU investigator interviewed the following parties: A.G.; the reporting teacher; two adults who were in the classroom at the time; the principal; the school nurse; Joey; Joey\u2019s mother; and six of Joey\u2019s classmates. The investigator also received copies of notes taken by the principal as well as a May 15, 2013 account of the incident written by the teacher; a May 16, 2013 account written by A.G.; and a May 16, 2013 employee incident report written by A.G. and the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">On May 16,2013, A.G. wrote that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Yesterday at 1:00 p.m. when [we] were doing the math [Joey] was very upset when [a classmate, \u201cAna\u201d] s[a]t next to another student. [Joey] doesn\u2019t want[ ] [anyone] near to [Ana] so he was very ag[g]ressive and he started hit[t]ing so I was protecting the other[ ] students. He hit me ... in the face and scratched me in the right side of my face and left side of my hand. [The teacher] was next to me. [H]e was kicking the chair so I was holding his hands[.] I told him that he needs to respect, that he needs to stop and that he needs to do his work, then he [did] wash his face and hands[.] I was with him, then he did his work (test).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The classroom teacher wrote in her May 15 statement that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">[Joey] did not want to complete his class work and was acting out: screaming and trying to run out of the classroom. When he transitioned to [A.G.\u2019s] group she tried prompting him to complete his work but he did not comply. He threw the classroom materials from the table and ripped a test paper that was in front of him. When [A.G.] asked him to work, [Joey] scratched her face. At this point, [A.G.] started to hit [Joey] repeatedly and stating \u201cYou are not going to scratch me\u201d and \u201cYou need to have respect\u201d. The incident was reported to the building administrator[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">When interviewed by the investigator on June 14, 2013, the teacher asserted the following. A.G. hit Joey four times. She estimated that on a scale of one to ten, with one being the softest and ten being the hardest, A.G. struck Joey using a force of five to six. She had previously witnessed A.G. pinch or press on a student\u2019s neck in order to make the student sit down. Joey\u2019s behavior had improved dramatically after the termination of A.G.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">According to the principal\u2019s notes, the reporting teacher brought Joey to the office.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-10\">Due to [Joey\u2019s] disability, it is difficult to understand what he is saying. However, the teacher showed him the class picture and had him identify the students and teachers. When he pointed to [A.G.] he was able to say [A.G.\u2019s last name]. He was then asked if she had hurt him. He said yes and touched his mouth. He also brought his foot up to his cheek. He was again asked if she had hurt him. However, he was not able to respond or elaborate on what had happened. [The teacher] was not sure if and when he had been hit in the areas shown because it was not what she had seen in the particular incident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">Joey\u2019s mother, L.N., informed the investigator of the following. She noticed a bruise on Joey\u2019s face in April 2013, and Joey stated that a teacher did it, although he did not identify the teacher. She had had no concerns about Joey\u2019s safety at the school prior to April 2013. She had photographed and videoed Joey\u2019s bruise, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>in the video Joey responds to questioning about how he had been bruised, without indicating who was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The investigator tried to interview Joey, but he replied \u201cSponge Bob\u201d and shut his eyes when asked about a classroom incident with A.G. The instructional assistant claimed he witnessed Joey run out of the classroom after which he had to be brought back in and seated by a teacher and himself; Joey began to knock items down; he heard Joey and A.G. scream, but did not see Joey scratch A.G. nor see any marks on Joey. The instructional assistant also stated that although A.G. could be loud and aggressive in her tone of voice, he never witnessed her hit a student.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The investigator interviewed the substitute and the school nurse who examined both A.G. and Joey. They did not see any marks on Joey or marks on A.G.\u2019s face, although A.G. had a small scratch on her hand. Six of Joey\u2019s classmates said they had not seen A.G. hit Joey.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">A.G. was terminated effective May 31, 2013. The IAIU embodied its findings report in three separate letters dated August 14, 2013. The letters were sent to the state district superintendent, A.G., and Joey\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Each of the three letters included the following text:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">\n<em>Investigative findings</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">Physical Abuse/Substantial Risk of Physical Injury/Environment Injurious to Health and Welfare is not established, in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:6-8.21. No adjudicative findings have been made, as the Institutional Abuse Unit\u2019s review herein is solely investigative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-10\">Not established findings are not disclosed in a Child Abuse Registry Check but are maintained in agency records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">The letters to the district superintendent and to Joey\u2019s mother continued under the heading <em>\u201cInvestigative Observations </em>\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-12\">[Joey,] age [five,] had no observable injuries. On May 16, 2013, [Joey] was examined by the school nurse. The results of the investigation indicate that [Joey] was yelling and throwing papers in class. An adult witness observed [A.6.] smack [Joey] on the hand. [A.G.] denied that she smacked [Joey.] [A.G.] admitted that she put her hand over [Joey\u2019s] hand after he scratched her. It should be noted that [Joey] manifested a bruise under his eye in April 2013. However, there was no information to support that [A.G.] caused the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Based upon the information gathered and physical observations of the child, [Joey] is not an abused child as defined by statute. However, the information gathered indicates that [Joey] was harmed or placed at risk of harm by virtue of the incident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Additionally, each letter included a <em>\u201cConfidentiality Statement </em>\u201d providing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">[T]he results of the Department\u2019s investigation, including identifying information, are maintained in the Department\u2019s files and can only be disclosed as set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.10a. In accordance with the statute, however, we can release the findings report to administration to help ensure that proper care, treatment or supervision is provided, not only to the specific child or children involved here, but to all children under the care and supervision of the above referenced facility. These reports may be used by any person or entity conducting a disciplinary, administrative or judicial proceeding to determine terms of employment of an officer, employee or volunteer with an agency or organization providing services to children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">\n<em>D.B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">On April 24, 2013, the Department received a referral from the principal of a public elementary school in Paterson. The principal reported that Larry, a six-year-old student, said D.B., the child\u2019s art teacher, grabbed Larry\u2019s arm and scratched the child earlier that day. Over the following three weeks two investigators from the IAIU interviewed the following parties: Larry; D.B.; the principal; five of Larry\u2019s classmates; the school nurse; the school security officer; and Larry\u2019s mother. An investigator also took photographs of Larry\u2019s arm on the day of the referral.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">When the principal was interviewed that same day, he explained that earlier in the morning Larry showed him a linear red mark caused by D.B. scratching him. The principal also stated that, although students regularly complained about D.B., this was the first time he saw a raised mark on a child in connection with an incident. Additionally, the principal indicated that he had prior concerns about D.B.\u2019s failure to properly maintain control of her students, asserting that students in D.B.\u2019s classroom would run around and hit each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">Shortly after interviewing the principal, an investigator interviewed Larry in the presence of the principal. Larry stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>D.B. had sent him to the security guard because he and a classmate were laughing while refusing to stay seated. The security guard then sent him back into the classroom. When Larry returned to the classroom, he refused to sit down when asked to do so by D.B., which led to D.B. scratching him on his right arm. After Larry was scratched he went back out to the security guard with a classmate, at which time he showed the guard his arm and was then directed to the school nurse. Larry conceded that he did not always listen to D.B.\u2019s instructions during class.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">An investigator interviewed Larry\u2019s mother, who stated that Larry had informed her about his injury. Larry told her that his teacher grabbed and scratched his arm when he did not comply with her instruction to sit down in class.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">An investigator also interviewed D.B., who explained that she saw Larry throwing a chair at a student, but did not touch Larry at all. A \u201cParent Conference Request/Modification Report,\u201d written by D.B., detailed Larry\u2019s conduct in her class on the date of the incident. The Report stated that Larry called another student names, refused to sit down, ran around the classroom, and threw a chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The school nurse, who examined Larry\u2019s arm, observed three faint reddish marks on Larry\u2019s arm, which disappeared after the application of ointment. An investigator reviewed the \u201cIndividual Student Health Log,\u201d which documented the school nurse\u2019s examination of Larry on the referral date.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The investigators also interviewed five of Larry\u2019s classmates. Three children stated that Larry threw a chair, and D.B. then grabbed him by the arm and removed him from the classroom. The two other children gave completely divergent accounts. The security guard stated that D.B. called her to the classroom after which she brought Larry to the nurse.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">In three separate letters, the IAIU communicated its findings to D.B., the state district superintendent, and Larry\u2019s mother. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>counsel for D.B. wrote to IAIU seeking certain changes, on August 1, 2013 the IAIU sent amended findings letters to D.B. and the superintendent. The finding of \u201cnot established\u201d remained unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Each of the August 1, 2013 amended letters included the following text under the heading <em>\u201cInvestigative Findings </em>\u201d: \u201cPhysical Abuse/Cuts, Bruises, Welts and Abrasions is not established in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21. No adjudicative findings have been made. The Institutional Abuse Unit\u2019s review herein is solely investigative.\u201d Furthermore, the <em>\u201cInvestigative Findings </em>\u201d section of the amended letters recited that, \u201cNot established findings are not disclosed in a Child Abuse Registry Check [ ] but they are maintained in agency records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The August 1, 2013 amended letters further stated under the heading <em>\u201cInvestigative Observations </em>\u201d that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">[Larry] age [six], was examined by the school nurse who noted three faint red marks on [Larry\u2019s] right arm. It was reported that [D.B.] grabbed and scratched [Larry] on his right arm. Four witnesses interviewed reported that [D.B.] made physical contact with [Larry\u2019s] right arm. When interviewed [D.B.] denied grabbing [Larry\u2019s] arm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-9\">Based upon the interviews and physical observations of the child, [Larry] is not an abused or neglected child as defined by statute. The information gathered indicates that [Larry] was harmed or placed at risk of harm by virtue of the incident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">Each amended letter also included a <em>\u201cConfidentiality Statement </em>\u201d identical to the one included in the letters sent concerning A.G.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">In a memorandum dated June 14, 2013, which had attached IAIU\u2019s June 3, 2013 findings letter to the superintendent, the principal informed D.B. that due to the district\u2019s \u201czero tolerance policy approach to teachers possibly causing harm to students,\u201d the principal had recommended \u201cadditional disciplinary actions ranging from suspension to tenure charges.\u201d The same day the superintendent sent D.B. a letter stating that \u201cdue to conduct unbecoming,\u201d the district would withhold D.B.\u2019s salary increment for the 2013-2014 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Both A.G. and D.B. argue that, \u201cIAIU\u2019s findings that the child \u2018was harmed or placed at risk of harm\u2019 constitutes an adjudication and not a mere investigatory finding. [A.G. and D.B.] further contend[ ] that the procedures followed by IAIU in this case are violative of the due process safeguards ordered by this court in its prior decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The Department asserts <em>that N.J.A.C. </em>10:129-7.3(c)(3), effective April 1, 2013, does not violate the Due Process Clause, and the \u201cpromulgation of this regulation is authorized by statute and consistent with the agency\u2019s mandated responsibilities under Title Nine, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21 to -8.73.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u201cIt is settled that \u2018[a]n administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of statutes and regulations within its implementing and enforcing responsibility is ordinarily entitled to our deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wnuck v. N.J. Div. of Motor Vehicles, </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>52, 56, 766 A.2d 312 (App.Div.2001) (quoting <em>In re Appeal by Progressive Cas. Ins. Co., </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>93, 102, 704 A.2d 562 (App.Div.1997)). \u201cAbsent arbitrary, unreasonable or capricious action, the agency\u2019s determination must be affirmed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(citing <em>R &amp; R Mktg., L.L.C. v. Brown-Forman Corp., </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>170, 175, 729 A.2d 1 (1999)). \u201cAlthough we recognize that deference is generally given to an administrative agency charged with interpretation of the law, we are not bound by the agency\u2019s legal opinions.\u201d <em>Levine v. State, Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>28, 32, 768 A.2d 192 (App.Div.2001) (citing <em>G.S. v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>161, 170, 723 A.2d 612 (1999)). An agency\u2019s exercise of its statutorily delegated responsibilities is entitled to a strong presumption of reasonableness and our court will generally defer to that agency\u2019s expertise and superior knowledge in the field. <em>City of Newark v.

Not every harm or risk of harm is of such a serious nature to cause a child to become an abused or neglected child. Thus, it is not inconsistent to find that a child was placed at risk of harm and yet was not abused or neglected.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">On April 1, 2013, the Department adopted a framework providing four possible findings that are made after the Department evaluates the available information: \u201csubstantiated\u201d; \u201cestablished\u201d; \u201cnot established\u201d; and \u201cunfounded.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">1.

Although the New Jersey Constitution extends due process protection to personal reputation, \u201cwithout requiring any other tangible loss,\u201d <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 104 [662 A.2d 367] (1995), this does not mean that a liberty interest is implicated anytime a governmental agency transmits information that may impugn a person\u2019s reputation. DYFS\u2019 transmittals of investigatory findings to the parents and guardians of alleged abused students and the school district constituted a significantly more limited dissemination of adverse information than the notifications concerning the presence of Tier II and III sex offenders in a community which the Court in <em>Doe </em>found to require due process protections. 142 <em>N.J. </em>at 103-07 [662 A.2d 367], Moreover, a finding that child abuse allegations have not been substantiated but that DYFS has nevertheless expressed \u201cconcerns\u201d about a person\u2019s conduct is intrinsically less damaging to reputation than a finding that child abuse charges have been \u201csubstantiated\u201d or that a person is a convicted sex offender. Therefore, DYFS\u2019 limited dissemination of the results of its investigations did not cause the kind of damage to reputation which would entitle appellants to a hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Although, in <em>L.R. </em>we were considering the finding of \u201cnot substantiated\u201d under the prior framework of the <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:129-7.3(e), our reasoning is also valid when considering \u201cnot established\u201d under the current <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:129\u20147.3(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">In <em>In re an Allegation of Physical Abuse Concerning R.P., </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>105, 113, 754 A.2d 615 (App.Div.2000), we opined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">\u201c[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u201d Thus, even if a person has a constitutionally protected interest, it does not automatically follow that the person must be afforded an opportunity for an adjudicatory hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\">[ (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">We continued, stating that, \u201cA finding by [the Department] that child abuse charges have not been substantiated, but that there is some indication a child was harmed or placed at risk of harm, is purely investigatory in nature, with none of the procedural protections of an adjudicatory proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117, 754 A.2d 615 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">Similarly, we again reaffirmed this principal in the <em>S.P. </em>ease providing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-13\">[A] teacher is not entitled to an adjudicatory hearing to challenge a finding that child abuse allegations are not substantiated, even when DYFS has expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>\u201cconcerns\u201d about a teacher\u2019s conduct because such a finding is \u201cintrinsically less damaging to reputation than a finding that child abuse charges have been \u2018substantiated.\u2019 \u201d \u201cA finding by DYFS that child abuse charges have not been substantiated, but that there is some indication a child was harmed or placed at risk of harm, is purely investigatory in nature, with none of the procedural protections of an adjudicatory proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\"><em>[N.J.

Thus, the notification-of-findings process of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:129-7.3 does not constitute a violation of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">D.B. and A.G. also assert that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:129-8.1, which allows the Department to retain unproven accusations forever is a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.40a. As the case law clearly states, the interest of retaining information about alleged claims of abuse, where some cause for concern is demonstrated, is within the mandate given to the Department to protect children from abuse. The records retained for \u201csubstantiated\u201d allegations are the only ones made public, thus D.B. and A.G. have a lesser due process right in regard to information kept for the use of the agency and entities involved in the protection of children.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">D.B. and A.G. also argue that the conclusion specified by IAIU as to their conduct is beyond the authority of the agency. They argue that the language in the findings letters sent to the superintendents of schools is conclusory, in violation of established case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Both D.B.\u2019s and A.G.\u2019s argument that the Department has exceeded its regulatory authority is unpersuasive and inconsistent with New Jersey case law. We stated in <em>L.R. </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">\u201c[T]he grant of authority to an administrative agency is to be liberally construed in order to enable the agency to accomplish its statutory responsibilities and ... the courts should readily imply such incidental powers as are necessary to effectuate fully the legislative intent.\u201d DYFS has been granted broad authority to investigate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>child abuse allegations, including specific authority to investigate any child abuse allegation against a public school teacher and to report its findings to the teacher\u2019s employer. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7a. An investigation of an abuse complaint against a teacher may disclose conduct which poses a threat to the physical or emotional well-being of the teacher\u2019s students even though it does not rise to the level of \u201cchild abuse\u201d within the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21. Therefore, we are satisfied that DYFS has not only the <em>authority but the responsibility to take reasonable measures to protect students from, any threat to their well-being. The most obvious available measure to protect students from a teacher who poses a danger to their safety or welfare is for DYFS to communicate its concerns and recommendations to the school district which employs the teacher. </em>The district can then take whatever action it deems appropriate to address DYFS\u2019 concerns, including counseling, transfer of the teacher to another assignment or, in an extreme case, termination of employment. Accordingly, we are satisfied that DYFS has the statutory authority to find that child abuse allegations against a teacher are \u201cnot substantiated\u201d but that the teacher's conduct poses a risk of harm to his or her students, and to report those concerns to the school district which employs the teacher.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\"><em>[L.R., supra, </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 451-52, 729 A.2d 463 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">D.B. and A.G. argue that the Department\u2019s findings letters to the superintendents of schools violate the requirements of due process and fundamental fairness. In <em>S.P. </em>we explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVv\">A teacher against whom a finding has been made by DYFS expressing concern about the teacher\u2019s conduct \u201chas a due process right to challenge the wording of such a finding on the ground that it is misleading and unfairly damaging to his reputation.\u201d \u201cThe impact upon a teacher\u2019s reputation of a finding by DYFS expressing concern about the teachei\u2019\u2019s conduct may be significant, especially if it is accompanied by what appears to be an affirmative finding by DYFS that a teacher has had improper physical contact with a student.\u201d \u201cThe investigatory findings and \u2018concerns about the teacher\u2019s conduct,\u2019 warrant \u2018some due process protection\u2019 by \u2018judicial review and correction [of the findings] to curb administrative abuses.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZC\">[S.P., <em>supra, </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 270, 953 A.2d 790 (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">In <em>A.I., </em>we determined that the IAIU acted within its authority in issuing its findings but nonetheless ordered the IAIU to amend its letter to embody language explicitly stating that the IAIU had not adjudicated the findings or could not make binding recommendations, stating that the letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">needs to be amended to avoid an improper impression conveyed despite the ultimate finding that the charges of abuse were \u201cunfounded.\u201d Although interviews <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>with students and teachers presented conflicting accounts and no adjudication took place, IAIU\u2019s letter to the District stated, as if conclusively found, that appellant \u201cgrabbed [A.I.\u2019s] ponytail quickly at the same time as [the student] was trying to move away and as a result, the student fell to the floor.\u201d Accordingly, even though the section on \u201cInvestigative Findings\u201d states that \u201c[n]o adjudicative findings have been made [and] IAIU\u2019s review herein is solely investigative,\u201d the factual recitation in the \u201cEvaluation of Facts\u201d should be reworded to reflect this distinction. The letter should also note that IAIU\u2019s findings are not binding or conclusive. However, the overall conclusion that appellant\u2019s actions were \u201cunjustified and inappropriate\u201d is supported by the witness accounts, all of which suggest some physical confrontation between [the student] and [the teacher], and need not be deleted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">[A.I., <em>supra, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 131, 922 A.2d 817 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Similar to the AT case, the letter dated August 14, 2013 sent to the superintendent of schools regarding A.G. and the amended letter dated August 1, 2013, relating to D.B., failed to include in the \u201cInvestigative Observations\u201d section the statement that \u201cIAIU\u2019s findings are not binding or conclusive.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, in <em>S.P. </em>we opined that simply stating that the findings are not binding or conclusive is insufficient, and the IAIU\u2019s findings must clearly explain that it has made no determination as to the validity of the statements provided by witnesses. <em>S.P., supra, </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 272-73, 953 A.2d 790.
