New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, </em>403 <em>N.J.Super. </em>590, 595, 959 A.2d 1215 (App.Div.2008), <em>certif. denied, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>133, 970 A.2d 1049 (2009) (Avalon), we considered a challenge to certain regulations adopted in 2007 by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), \u201creferred to as the Public Access Rules, which substantially expanded [DEP\u2019s] authority over public access to beaches and other tidal waterways.\u201d We found the regulations were \u201cnot statutorily authorized and therefore invalid[].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597, 959 A.2d 1215. In response, DEP embarked upon another round of rulemaking, culminating in the 2012 adoption of new Public Access Rules (the Rules). 44 <em>N.J.R. </em>2559(a) (Nov. 5, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Hackensack Riverkeeper, Inc., and NY/NJ Baykeeper, two nonprofit organizations (collectively, appellants), quickly filed this appeal. We granted a motion by the American Littoral Society, Inc. (ALS), to appear as amicus curiae. The three organizations\u2019 professed missions include the conservation of coastal areas and the promotion of public and community access thereto and, in the ease of appellants, the waters, watersheds and wetlands of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">Appellants argue that DEP has again arrogated to itself the management of lands held in public trust, which power is reserved to the Legislature and has not been delegated to DEP. They also argue the Rules are preempted by, or improperly infringe upon, powers reserved to the State\u2019s municipalities. Appellants further contend that the Rules are not authorized by the Coastal Area Facility Review Act (CAFRA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:19-1 to -21, or any other statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>DEP contends that the Rules are authorized pursuant to the public trust doctrine, and the agency has been implicitly recognized as the proper governmental authority to manage lands held in public trust. Alternatively, DEP contends that CAFRA authorizes promulgation of the Rules. The agency also asserts that the Rules encourage cooperation with municipalities that is wholly consonant with the Municipal Land Use Law (the MLUL), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-1 to -163. ALS similarly argues that the Legislature has vested DEP with the authority to adopt regulations necessary to promote and protect the waterfront.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Since the appeal was argued, DEP again revised the Rules. <em>See </em>47 <em>N.J.R. </em>1392(a) (July 6, 2015). We asked appellants and DEP to address these revised Rules and their impact, if any, on the issues initially raised. Both sides assert that the revisions merely renumbered the Rules and effectuated no substantive changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">We have considered the arguments in light of the record and applicable legal principles. Some limited provisions of the Rules could fall \u201cwithin the fair contemplation of the delegation of [an] enabling statute,\u201d CAFRA. <em>In re N.J.A.C. 7:1B-1.1 et seq., </em>431 <em>N.J.Super. </em>100, 116, 67 A.3d 621 (App.Div.) (citation omitted), <em>certif. denied, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>8, 75 A.3d 1162 (2013). However, the Rules apply to many municipalities that are not subject to CAF-RA, because that statute only applies to certain municipalities. Moreover, the Rules far exceed the Legislature\u2019s limited delegation of authority to DEP under CAFRA to regulate \u201cland uses in the coastal zone.\u201d <em>Avalon, supra, </em>403 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 601, 959 A.2d 1215. We also agree with appellants that the Rules are not authorized by any other legislative enactment or by the Legislature\u2019s delegation of powers to DEP pursuant to the public trust doctrine. We are constrained, therefore, to invalidate the Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">In their latest iteration, the Rules amend DEP\u2019s Coastal Zone Management (CZM) regulations, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7. The CZM regulations \u201cestablishf ] the rules ... regarding <em>the use and develop-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>to <em>ent of coastal resources\u00ed,]\u201d </em>and \u201care used in reviewing <em>applications for coastal permits under [CAFRA </em>]\u201d and other statutes. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-1.1(a) (emphasis added). The CZM regulations list \u201ceight broad coastal goals,\u201d including \u201cMeaningful public access to and use of tidal waterways and their shores.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-1.1(c). The CZM regulations apply to all DEP \u201cactions and decisions,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-1.2(a), regarding the \u201ccoastal zone,\u201d defined as including not only geographic areas subject to CAFRA, but also all other coastal waters and tidal wetlands. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In particular, appellants\u2019 challenge focuses on <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-9.48, the public trust rights rule, and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-16.9, the public access rule (before DEP\u2019s July 2015 re-codification, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7E-3.50 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7E-8.11, respectively).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-9.48(b), public access to \u201clands and waters subject to public trust rights\u201d must be provided in accordance with <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-16.9, and any development \u201cthat does not comply with <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-16.9 ... is discouraged____\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-16.9, in turn, encourages, but does not require, municipalities to create Municipal Public Access Plans (MPAPs) that, among other things, identify current public access points and corresponding signage, incorporate parking and other amenities to the maximum extent practicable, and plan for future public access. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-16.9(c)-(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">DEP explained in 2012 that the new regulations</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-10\">encourage municipalities to take an active role in designing and ensuring public access to beaches and tidal waters in ways that will work best for their respective <em>circumstances____Under the mies in place prior to this adoption, the Department evaluated public access only when an applicant applied to the Department for a coastal permit and was required to provide public access under those mies. </em>The adopted rules enhance public access opportunities by encouraging municipalities to work with the Department to develop plans to help ensure that the public\u2019s access needs are met in a comprehensive and systematic approach. The Department will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>work with the municipalities on development of their access plan, and the plan will be required to meet the goals of the public access rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">[44 <em>N.J.R. </em>at 2602 (response to comment 234) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">More than two hundred municipalities are eligible to submit MPAPs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">A municipality, as part of its MPAP implementation strategy, may create its own dedicated Public Access Fund, to which developers contribute in lieu of providing public access onsite. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7\u201416.9(f). The Rules provide formulae required to be used for the calculation of appropriate contributions based upon the particular development. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7\u201416.9(f)(1) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">After public notice and comment, and DEP review and approval, a municipality must incorporate its MPAP into its master plan, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-5 and -28. <em>N.J.A.C. 7:</em>7-16.9(j). At five-year intervals thereafter, a municipality must provide DEP with a report detailing the status of all projects, an accounting of its dedicated Public Access Fund, and a list of problems and proposed remedies to assure compliance with the MPAP. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7\u2014 16.9(j)(4). Any changes to the MPAP or to the terms of a contribution made to the Public Access Fund must be submitted first to DEP for \u201creview and approval.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-16.9(Z)- In addition, if the municipality fails to implement or comply with its approved MPAP, DEP must \u201crevoke its approval.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. 7:</em>7-16.9(m).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Once an MPAP is adopted as part of a municipality\u2019s master plan, \u201cpublic access required to satisfy the conditions of a coastal permit for development in the municipality for permit applications filed with [DEP] ... shall be provided in accordance with the [MPAP].\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7\u201416.9(k). However, if a municipality does not adopt an MPAP, \u201cpublic access along and use of the beach and the shores shall be provided\u201d in accordance with the regulations. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-16.9(n). Depending upon the nature and size of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>particular commercial or residential development, on-site access must be provided. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-16.9(n)(l) and (2). In addition, a municipality must have an approved MPAP before DEP will approve a general permit for beach and dune maintenance. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-6.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">During argument, we asked the Deputy Attorney General representing DEP whether municipalities that did not adopt an MPAP could suffer other negative consequences, specifically eligibility for Green Acres funding. <em>See </em>44 <em>N.J.R. </em>at 2630-32 (comments and responses 464-83). We were assured that they would not. However, we note that DEP\u2019s current Green Acres regulations provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">(a) The following are <em>ineligible </em>to apply for Green Acres funding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">4. <em>Any local government unit that does not currently provide, or have active plans to provide, public access to the waterfront </em>and to tidally-flowed and dry sand areas subject to the Public Trust Doctrine, <em>consistent with the requirements of the Coastal Zone Management Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:7E-8.11 </em>and governing law. <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>7:36-3.2(a)(4) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">This \u201ccarrot-and-stick\u201d approach to secure submission of MPAP applications for approval and municipal compliance thereafter was publicly acknowledged by DEP. When the Rules were first issued in 2012, the agency declared that there were \u201cadequate incentives for municipalities to want to develop and seek Department approval of [MPAPs].\u201d 44 <em>N.J.R. </em>at 2631 (response to comments 465-68). DEP explained that it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\">not penalizing municipalities which do not have a [MPAP]. These municipalities will still be able to conduct beach and dune maintenance pursuant to an individual permit if they choose to not prepare a Municipal Public Access Plan. The Department believes that this differential treatment is appropriate to encourage the public access benefits that can be achieved through the cooperative planning effort reflected by a Department-approved [MPAP],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-11\">[44 <em>N.J.R. </em>at 2606 (response to comment 261).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">DEP\u2019s Commissioner called the consequences for municipalities not participating in the MPAP scheme \u201c \u2018the club if we need it.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">We set some well-known guideposts that inform our review. \u201cJudicial review of agency regulations begins with a presumption that the regulations are both valid and reasonable[,]\u201d and \u201cthe party challenging a regulation has the burden of proving that the agency\u2019s action was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.\u201d <em>N.J.

They contend that unless we are prepared to contradict our decision in <em>Avalon, </em>the result must be the same, and the Rules must be stricken. DEP argues that <em>Avalon </em>has limited application to this case because there we only considered a specific as-applied challenge to two particular provisions of the 2007 regulations that are no longer contained in the Rules. However, we agree with appellants that, absent express authorization from the Legislature, the public trust doctrine alone cannot justify DEP\u2019s adoption of the Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The public trust doctrine encompasses the \u201clegal principle that the State holds \u2018ownership, dominion and sovereignty\u2019 over tidally flowed lands \u2018in trust for the people.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Long Branch v.

DEP argues that the public trust doctrine, as interpreted by the Court, authorizes the agency to act as steward of the State\u2019s coastal resources, including assuring public access. <em>See, e.g., N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-16.9(aa) (describing DEP as \u201cthe State entity managing public access along the shore,\u201d with \u201can obligation to ensure\u201d access under the public trust doctrine). However, consistent with our assessment in <em>Avalon, </em>the cases DEP relies upon do not persuade us that the public trust doctrine can serve as the fount of the agency\u2019s regulatory power.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">For example, DEP claims that in <em>Lusardi v. Curtis Point Property Owners Ass\u2019n, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>217, 430 A.2d 881 (1981), the Court recognized the agency \u201cwas one of three State entities charged with promoting the State\u2019s interest in public access under the [pjublie [t]rust [djoctrine.\u201d DEP further asserts that <em>Lusardi </em>and <em>Matthews </em>demonstrate that \u201ceven where the State as a whole holds title to public trust lands, the ability to regulate it has been passed to [ ] DEP.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The Court in <em>Lusardi </em>considered whether a municipal zoning ordinance that prohibited recreational use of privately-owned oceanfront property was \u201can unreasonable exercise of the zoning power in light of judicial, legislative and executive pronouncements establishing a statewide policy of encouraging recreational use of dry sand beach areas.\u201d <em>Lusardi, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 222, 430 A.2d 881. The Court found expressions of this \u201cstatewide policy\u201d in the public trust doctrine, legislation and the coastal development policies promulgated by DEP. <em>Id. </em>at 227-28, 430 A.2d 881. However, the Court made clear that \u201cthe public trust doctrine [wa]s not directly applicable to th[e] case, which concern[ed] the exercise of zoning power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228, 430 A.2d 881. To the extent the Court found DEP\u2019s regulations were \u201cthe most detailed expression of this State\u2019s policies concerning the appropriate uses of shoreline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>resources,\u201d it did so with reference to specific statutory powers under CAFRA. <em>Id. </em>at 229, 430 A.2d 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Similarly, DEP\u2019s reliance upon <em>Matthews </em>is misplaced. In <em>Matthews, supra, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 326, 471 A.2d 355, the Court relied exclusively upon the public trust doctrine to conclude that \u201cprivate landowners may not in all instances prevent the public from exercising its rights under the public trust doctrine[,]\u201d and \u201c[t]he public must be afforded reasonable access to the foreshore as well as a suitable area for recreation on the dry sand.\u201d The Court\u2019s only mention of DEP\u2019s role was in a footnote, recognizing that pursuant to CAFRA, the agency\u2019s regulations supported unrestricted access to beaches. <em>Id. </em>at 325 n. 8, 471 A.2d 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Lastly, we reject DEP\u2019s claim that <em>Raleigh Avenue </em>recognized the agency\u2019s independent regulatory authority pursuant to the public trust doctrine. Without reciting the tangled facts of the case, it suffices to say that the Court rejected the property owner\u2019s claim that DEP \u201clack[ed] jurisdiction to approve any fees charged\u201d to the public for services associated with the beach. <em>Raleigh Ave., supra, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>at 60, 879 A.2d 112. However, the Court made clear that it was \u201cthe boardwalk pathway over the dunes to the ... beach [which] qualifies as a development, thereby triggering the DEP\u2019s CAFRA jurisdiction over related use of the beach and ocean.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 879 A.2d 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The Legislature spoke clearly regarding municipally-owned beaches when it enacted <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:61-22.20(a), and municipally-owned property in general, when it enacted <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-1 (providing that \u201cevery municipality\u201d may adopt and enforce ordinances to \u201c[m]anage, regulate and control the ... property ... of the municipality\u201d). Case law that has developed regarding the public trust doctrine, including those which have expanded its reach to privately-owned property, do not support DEP\u2019s contention that the Legislature implicitly delegated regulatory powers to the agency. DEP was not authorized to promulgate the Rules under the public trust doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Appellants next argue that DEP lacks the authority to promulgate the Rules pursuant to CAFRA or any other statute, and, as already noted, that the Rules conflict with the Legislature\u2019s specific grant of authority to municipalities to regulate municipally-owned land. DEP counters by arguing the Rules were authorized pursuant to CAFRA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The agency also argues that the Rules do not conflict with the MLUL.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">0)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Some additional standards govern our consideration of whether the Rules are authorized by CAFRA. \u201c[W]hen a regulation is challenged as contrary to the agency\u2019s statutory authority!,] ... the issue turns on statutory construction.\u201d <em>In re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 7:15-5.24(b), </em>420 <em>N.J.Super. </em>552, 564, 22 A.3d 94 (App.Div.)

(Bayshore Centre), </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>358, 364, 464 A.2d 1115 (1983). \u201cAlthough CAFRA is principally an environmental protection statute, the powers delegated to DEP extend well beyond protection of the natural environment. Succinctly stated, the delegated powers require DEP to regulate land use within the coastal zone for the general welfare.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">By enacting CAFRA, the Legislature intended to limit potential adverse environmental impacts while encouraging development of compatible land uses in the coastal zone. <em>Seigel v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>395 <em>N.J.Super </em>604, 615, 930 A.2d 461 (App.Div.) (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:19-2), <em>certif. denied, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>277, 937 A.2d 978 (2007). Thus, \u201c[e]ach agency decision involving an application for development under CAFRA invokes these \u2018competing policy considerations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>In re Cape May Cty. Mun. Utils. Auth., </em>242 <em>N.J.Super </em>509, 516, 577 A.2d 840 (App.Div.1990)). CAFRA specifically was intended to \u201cpreserve! ] the most ecologically sensitive and fragile area <em>from inappropriate development </em>and provide[] adequate environmental safeguards <em>for the construction of any developments </em>in the coastal area.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:19-2 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">We have previously discussed at length CAFRA\u2019s permitting process and DEP\u2019s regulatory authority under the statute. <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>e.g., Dragon v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>405 <em>N.J.Super. </em>478, 494-97, 965 A.2d 209 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>517, 973 A.2d 384 (2009). Succinctly stated, \u201cCAFRA expressly requires that any development within the State\u2019s specified \u2018coastal area\u2019 either (1) be conducted under a permit issued pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:19-5 or -5.1, or (2) be an activity that is explicitly exempted from the permitting requirement by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:19-5.2 or -5.3.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494, 965 A.2d 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">In <em>Avalon, </em>we rejected DEP\u2019s argument that CAFRA authorized the 2007 rule requiring public access to beaches at all times. <em>Avalon, supra, </em>403 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 601, 959 A.2d 1215. We held that \u201ceven though CAFRA delegates authority to the DEP to regulate certain land uses within the coastal zone, it does not preempt municipal regulation under the [MLUL].\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Bubis v. Kassin, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>612, 630, 878 A.2d 815 (2005); <em>Lusardi, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 229, 430 A.2d 881). Therefore, DEP\u2019s regulatory powers under CAFRA extended to \u201cland uses in the coastal zone, [but] the Legislature did not authorize [ ] DEP to preempt the basic municipal power to manage and control municipally-owned beaches, including deciding when those areas should be open to the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601, 959 A.2d 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">As to the requirement of additional parking and bathroom facilities contained in the 2007 version of the Rules, we recognized that \u201cCAFRA does not include any provision authorizing [ ] DEP to condition the issuance of [] a permit upon a municipality agreeing to provide additional parking spaces or restrooms in order to facilitate public access to the beach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606, 959 A.2d 1215. We rejected the agency\u2019s claim that because <em>Raleigh Avenue </em>recognized DEP\u2019s jurisdiction to monitor beach fees, the agency \u201cha[d] implied authority to impose whatever additional obligations [ ] DEP deem[ed] appropriate to facilitate public access to the beach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 607, 959 A.2d 1215. We noted, DEP\u2019s authority to review beach fees \u201ccan be viewed as \u2018incidental\u2019 to the powers the Legislature expressly granted to [ ] DEP under CAF-RA,\u201d but prescribing parking and bathroom facilities involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>important policy questions within the \u201cexclusive province of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 607-08, 959 A.2d 1215. \u201cThe Legislature could of course delegate authority for making these decisions to [ ] DEP. However, CAFRA does not contain such a delegation of authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608, 959 A.2d 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The only connection we discern between CAFRA\u2019s permitting process and the most recent iteration of the Rules is that applicants for CAFRA permits in municipalities that have adopted approved MPAPs may satisfy public access requirements \u201cin accordance with the [MPAP].\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-16.9(c) and (k). As already mentioned, in towns without approved MPAPs, an applicant must comply with other provisions of the Rules that place significant restrictions upon him or her. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7\u201416.9(c)(2) and (n). For example, pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7\u201416.9(u), public access areas must be clearly marked by signs approved by DEP, and, pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-16.9(z), \u201careas set aside for public access to tidal waterways and their shores shall be permanently dedicated for public use through the recording of a Department approved conservation restriction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Perhaps DEP could choose to adopt a different permitting process in municipalities that have adopted an MPAP. The precise question is not before us, nor do we need to decide the issue. We conclude that any nexus between CAFRA\u2019s general statutory purposes, its permitting processes and the Rules is limited at best, and it cannot justify the broad and pervasive regulatory regime imposed by the Rules taken as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Lastly, we note that CAFRA applies only to a well-defined \u201ccoastal area.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:19-4. That \u201ccoastal area\u201d is not coextensive with the \u201ccoastal zone,\u201d to which the Rules specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>apply. In short, CAFRA does not serve as explicit or implicit authority for DEP to promulgate the Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">For the sake of completeness, we address appellants\u2019 argument that the Rules conflict with provisions of the MLUL and other statutes that embody the Legislature\u2019s express delegation of powers to municipalities. Specifically, they argue DEP cannot require that a municipality wishing to adopt an MPAP incorporate same in its master plan, nor can DEP authorize the creation of municipal Public Access Funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The MLUL is \u201ca comprehensive statute that allows municipalities to adopt ordinances to regulate land development \u2018in a manner which will promote the public health, safety, morals and general welfare\u2019 using uniform and efficient procedures.\u201d <em>Rumson Estates, Inc. v. Mayor &amp; Council of Fair Haven, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>338, 349, 828 A.2d 317 (2003) (quoting <em>Levin v. Twp. of Parsippany-Troy Hills, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>174, 179, 411 A.2d 704 (1980)). However, a municipality\u2019s power \u201cmust be exercised in strict conformity with the delegating enactment\u2014the MLUL.\u201d <em>Toll Bros. v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Burlington, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>223, 243, 944 A.2d 1 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Two goals of the MLUL are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">To provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for a variety of agricultural, residential, <em>recreational, </em>commercial and industrial uses and <em>open space, both public and private, </em>according to their respective environmental requirements in order to meet the needs of all New Jersey citizens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\"><em>To promote the conservation of </em>historic sites and districts, <em>open space, </em>energy resources <em>and valuable natural resources </em>in the State and <em>to prevent urban sprawl and degradation of the environment </em>through improper use of land ...[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-2(g) and (j) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-11\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-28(b) requires that a master plan must include \u201c[a] statement of objectives, principles, assumptions, policies and standards\u201d and \u201c[a] land use plan element____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-28(b)(1) and (b)(2). The statute then sets forth fourteen other discretionary elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>The land use plan element requires consideration of \u201ctopography, soil conditions, water supply, drainage, flood plain areas, marshes, and woodlands[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-28(b)(2)(a). Discretionary elements include a \u201crecreation plan element,\u201d that includes \u201ca comprehensive system of areas and public sites for recreation[,]\u201d and a \u201cconservation plan element\u201d that provides \u201cfor the preservation, conservation, and utilization of natural resources, including ... marshes, wetlands, harbors, rivers and other waters. ...\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-28(b)(7) and (8).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Given this extensive list of a master plan\u2019s permissible contents, we reject appellants\u2019 argument that, by permitting municipalities to adopt an MPAP and requiring them to incorporate it as part of their master plans, the Rules violate this portion of the MLUL. Adopting an MPAP seems consistent with these required and permitted portions of a master plan.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">However, we note that the MLUL provides that a master plan must be periodically re-examined, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-89, the reexamination report must include specific recommendations as to amendments to the master plan, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D~89(d), and the failure to adopt a re-examination report \u201cconstitute[s] a rebuttable presumption that the municipal development regulations are no longer reasonable.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-89.1. We express substantial doubt that those provisions of the Rules requiring the regular update of MPAPs and prohibiting amendment without DEP approval can be harmonized with these provisions of the MLUL.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">We do agree with appellants that the creation of municipal Public Access Funds by which participating municipalities may, pursuant to the Rules, receive monetary contributions from permit applicants is, absent a specific legislative grant of authority, ultra vires. In <em>New Jersey Shore Builders Ass\u2019n v. Township of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>Jackson, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>449, 972 A.2d 1151 (2009), the Court concluded that the municipal appellants lacked the authority to promulgate ordinances that required developers to set aside open space or make payments in lieu thereof. <em>Id. </em>at 452, 972 A.2d 1151. The Court recognized that the \u201cstatutory authority that permits a municipality to require contributions for off-tract improvements is limited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453, 972 A.2d 1151 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-42 (\u201creferring to contributions for off-tract improvements to water, sewer, drainage, and street improvements only\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">DEP cites no statutory authority by which municipalities may accept monetary contributions from permit applicants simply by adopting an MPAP, and no such authority is provided by the MLUL or any other statute that we located. Those provisions of the Rules that empower a municipality to create a Public Access Fund lack any statutory authority and are ultra vires.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">In sum, we conclude that absent a specific legislative grant of authority, DEP was not authorized by the public trust doctrine to promulgate the Rules. We further conclude that CAFRA\u2019s permitting provisions might implicitly authorize limited portions of the Rules, but it is not our task to identify which limited portions of the Rules could be so authorized. Given their 1) application beyond CAFRA\u2019s territorial limits, and 2) their extensive scope, the Rules exceed any implied grant of legislative authority under the statute. Lastly, we conclude that the creation of a municipal Public Access Fund would be an ultra vires exercise of municipal power, and, while the MLUL could authorize adoption of a MPAP as part of a municipal master plan, the provisions of the MLUL that govern amendment of the master plan leave no room for DEP\u2019s pervasive involvement in the process as set forth in the Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">We therefore conclude that the Rules must be stricken, and we invalidate <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-9.48, the public trust rights rule, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-16.9, the public access rule, as well as any other provisions of the regulations that rely upon those two sections.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-14\"> <em>See </em>46 <em>N.J.R. </em>1051(a), 1053-57 (June 2, 2014) (DEP\u2019s table cross-referencing the Rules as adopted in 2012 with the changes proposed in 2014 and adopted in 2015).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b330-11\"> <em>See </em>http://www.state.nj.us/dep/cmp/access/mpamunis.htm (list of eligible municipalities) (last visited Dec. 1, 2015).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b331-13\"> Jacqueline L.
