NJDOC hired plaintiffs as corrections officers after they turned thirty-five years old. As a result, plaintiffs were enrolled in the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS). Plaintiffs filed a complaint claiming they should be transferred to defendant, the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System (PFRS), which has generally higher benefits but which also restricts initial enrollment to those not over thirty-five. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-2.5(a). Judge Phillip S. Carchman dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Plaintiffs appeal, claiming that the PFRS thirty-five-year age limitation cannot be applied to State corrections officers. However, the long history of PFRS makes clear that the Legislature intends to restrict PFRS membership to a person who is \u201cnot over 35 years\u201d when he or she becomes a \u201cpoliceman\u201d or \u201cfireman.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3. The Legislature has expanded the definition of \u201cpoliceman\u201d to include a State corrections officer and, with only brief exceptions not applicable here, has mandated that they meet the age requirement for eligibility set for all PFRS members. That requirement serves the Legislature\u2019s goals of using PFRS\u2019s heightened benefits to encourage persons to become officers while young and relatively fit, and to retire at a relatively early age. Moreover, the PFRS Board, by regulation, has properly applied this construction of the PFRS Act for more than forty years. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-2.5(a). Finally, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional challenges for substantially the same reasons given by Judge Carchman. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">In 2003, plaintiff Casey Piatt and sixty-two other plaintiffs filed a complaint in federal district court, challenging the application of the age restriction to corrections officers under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1001-1461, the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -49, and contract law. <em>Akers, et al. v. State of New Jersey, et al., </em>Civ. No. 03-3920 (D.N.J.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court dismissed Piatt\u2019s ERISA claim because ERISA did not apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>governmental pension plans, and dismissed without prejudice his remaining state-law claims. <em>Ibid. </em>(Aug. 26,2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">In 2010, Piatt and ninety-seven other plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Law Division in Camden County. Plaintiffs complained that when they were hired as corrections officers by NJDOC, they were enrolled in PERS rather than PFRS because they exceeded the maximum age limit for admittance into PFRS. They claimed the age limit of thirty-five in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-2.5(a) did not apply to them and, even if it did, was arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, void, and unconstitutional. They demanded they be transferred into PFRS retroactive to the first day of their employment, with no assessment of the additional contributions they would have paid if they had been in PFRS during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">After defendants answered the complaint, the action was transferred to Mercer County.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment. Defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">After hearing two days of oral argument, Judge Carchman issued a twenty-five-page oral opinion on May 29, 2013. In the course of his opinion, Judge Carchman pointed out that the pension benefits of PFRS are greater than those of PERS in part because employees must contribute more per paycheck to PFRS than PERS. The court found at least two reasons why the public interest would require corrections officers to be appointed before age thirty-five in order to enroll in PFRS:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>First, restricting enrollment in this way benefits the public fiscally as fewer individuals are permitted to enroll, and secondly, and perhaps more importantly, this restriction benefits public safety as it provides an incentive for individuals to become corrections officers earlier in their career and to be able to retire earlier!,] allowing for what has been statistically established as a more fit and higher energy workforce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">By order dated June 5, 2013, Judge Carchman denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion, granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Plaintiffs appeal the grant of summary judgment. Summary judgment must be granted if the court determines \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c); <em>accord Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 539-40, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). The summary judgment motions here addressed the applicability of the age limit in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3, and the validity of the age limit in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-2.5(a). \u201cA ruling on summary judgment is reviewed de novo. We thus \u2018apply the same standard governing the trial court,\u2019 and do not defer to the trial court\u2019s ... interpretation of \u2018the meaning of a statute\u2019 \u201d or the validity of a regulation. <em>Davis v. Brickman Landscaping, Ltd., </em>219 <em>N.J. </em>395, 405, 98 A.3d 1173 (2014) (citations omitted). We must hew to that standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">To properly address plaintiffs\u2019 claims, we review the statutory and regulatory history of the age limit, and of the inclusion of corrections officers as \u201cpolicemen\u201d under the PFRS Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1 to -68.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">The PFRS Act was originally adopted in 1944. <em>L. </em>1944, c. 255. It established a retirement system \u201cfor policemen and firemen.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-2. The PFRS Act originally required applicants to PFRS to be appointed to their position by age thirty. <em>Seire v. Police &amp; Fire Pension Comm\u2019n, </em>6 <em>N.J. </em>586, 590, 80 A.2d 97 (1951); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number><em>Bashwiner v. Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>68 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 5, 171 A.2d 331 (App.Div.1961). In 1968, that limit was raised to not over thirty-five years old. <em>Simon v. Bd. of Trs., Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>186, 190, 558 A.2d 490 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>652, 569 A.2d 1348 (1989). Since 1968, the PFRS Act has provided that \u201cany person becoming a full-time policeman or fireman ... shall become a member of this retirement system as a condition of his employment; he will be enrolled provided, that his age at becoming such full-time policeman or fireman is not over 35 years[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The PFRS Act allows the PFRS Board of Trustees to establish rules and regulations. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-13(a)(7). In 1971, the PFRS Board of Trustees adopted a regulation, entitled \u201cage requirements,\u201d providing that \u201c[ajpplicants are subject to a maximum age requirement which is 35 years.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-2.5(a) (1971). Since 1983, the regulation has provided that all applicants to PFRS \u201cmust be appointed to an eligible title on or prior to their 35th birthday.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-2.5(a); <em>see Sellers v. Bd. of Trs. of the Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>399 <em>N.J.Super. </em>51, 53, 942 A.2d 870 (App.Div.2008) (applying <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-2.5(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The Legislature repeatedly amended the definitions of \u201cpoliceman\u201d and \u201cfireman\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:16A-1 to make additional titles covered by PFRS. <em>Kossup v. Bd. of Trs., Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>372 <em>N.J.Super. </em>468, 475, 859 A.2d 721 (App.Div.2004). For many years, the definition of \u201cpoliceman\u201d did not include State corrections officers. <em>See Koschker v. Bd. of Trs., Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>209, 211, 558 A.2d 503 (App.Div.1989). The Legislature passed a supplementary act in 1973 allowing certain State corrections officers to enroll in PFRS by adding their titles to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1. <em>See id. </em>at 212, 558 A.2d 503 (citing <em>L. </em>1973, c. 156, \u00a7 1); <em>Allen v. Bd. of Trs., Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>197, 200, 558 A.2d 496 (App.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Div.1989) (same). The 1973 supplementary act also added <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-62, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">Eligibility for membership in the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System of New Jersey shall be extended to all active, permanent and full-time officer employees of the State of New Jersey with police powers and holding one of the titles cited in section 1 of <em>P.L. </em>1944, c. 255 ([N.J.S.A.] 43:16A-1) who are otherwise eligible in accordance with the provisions of this act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Also under the 1973 supplementary act, State corrections officers \u201cthen enrolled in PERS were offered a one-time opportunity to transfer their retirement fund membership to PFRS without cost and without regard to age\u201d if they did so within ninety days. <em>Koschker, supra, </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 212, 558 A.2d 503 (citing <em>L. </em>1973, c. 156, \u00a7 4 (codified at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-63(a))).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The 1973 supplementary act \u201cdid not, however, abolish the 35 year entry-age limitation; it was merely suspended. After the 90 day \u2018window of opportunity1 elapsed, enrollment in PFRS was again limited to employees 35 years old or younger.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Indeed, a 1975 amendment to the 1973 supplementary act provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">Each new officer who begins employment following the effective date of this 1975 amendatory and supplementary act, shall be required to enroll in the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System of New Jersey as a condition of employment, <em>provided he is otherwise eligible for membership by meeting the </em>appointment, <em>age, </em>and health <em>prescriptions required of all members.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-63(b) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">A confused period of changing laws and interpretations followed the application to the States of the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 621-34. <em>See Sellers, supra, </em>399 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 55-57 &amp; n. 1, 942 A.2d 870; <em>Koschker, supra, </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 214-15, 558 A.2d 503. However, first temporarily and then permanently, <em>ibid., </em>Congress amended the ADEA to allow States to use age as a criteria for hiring \u201claw enforcement officer[s].\u201d 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 623(j). This resulted in the renewed enforcement of the thirty-five-year age limit for eligibility for PFRS. <em>Sellers, supra, </em>399 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 56, 942 A.2d 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Indeed, in <em>Allen </em>and <em>Koschker, </em>we premised our decisions on the applicability of the thirty-five-year age limit to corrections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>officers. In <em>Allen, </em>we noted that, although Allen was appointed to a PFRS-eligible position as a State corrections officer, he \u201cwas not age-eligible to join PFRS because employees over 35 were not permitted to join PFRS.\u201d <em>Allen, supra, </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 202, 558 A.2d 496 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Koschker, </em>we similarly noted that the plaintiffs\u2019 positions as State corrections officers were made eligible for PFRS in the 1973 supplementary act because they \u201cwere over 35 at the time of the 1973 enactment.\u201d <em>Koschker, supra, </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 212, 558 A.2d 503. Because the plaintiffs failed to take advantage of the opportunity provided by the 1973 supplementary act to transfer into PFRS regardless of age, we held they were ineligible for PFRS because \u201cenrollment in PFRS was again limited to employees 35 years old or younger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218-19, 558 A.2d 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In 1989, the Legislature \u201celiminated the prior definition of policeman [under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1] which consisted of a list of diverse job titles, and replaced it with \u2018prescribed fundamental criteria.\u2019\u201d <em>Matter of Eligibility of Certain Assistant Union County Prosecutors to Transfer to PFRS under N.J.S.A. 43:16A-1 et seq., </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>551, 559, 694 A.2d 289 (App.Div.1997) [hereinafter <em>\u201cProsecutors </em>\u201d] (quoting Senate State Gov\u2019t Comm., <em>Statement to S. 2602, </em>at 1 (June 23, 1988)). The 1989 amendment rewrote <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43A6A-1 to provide only two eligible titles, \u201cpoliceman\u201d and \u201cfireman.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-l(2)(a), (b). The 1989 amendment also made clear that to be a \u201cmember\u201d of PFRS, a person had to be a \u201cpoliceman or fireman included in the membership of the retirement system pursuant to this amendatory and supplementary act.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1(3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>The 1989 amendment provided a functional definition of a \u201cpoliceman\u201d which logically if not explicitly would include a State corrections officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\"><em>\u201cPoliceman\u201d shall mean a permanent, full-time employee of </em>a law enforcement unit as defined in section 2 of <em>P.L. </em>1961, c. 56 <em>(C. </em>52:17B-67) or <em>the State, </em>other than an officer or trooper of the Division of State Police whose position is covered by the State Police Retirement System, <em>whose primai'y duties include the </em>investigation, apprehension or <em>detention of persons suspected or convicted of violating the criminal laws of the State </em>and who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">(i) is authorized to carry a firearm while engaged in the actual performance of his official duties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">(ii) has police powers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">(iii) is required to complete successfully the training requirements prescribed by <em>P.L. </em>1961, <em>c. </em>56 <em>(C. </em>52:17B-66 et seq.) or comparable training requirements as determined by the board of trustees; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">(iv) is subject to the physical and mental fitness requirements applicable to the position of municipal police officer established by an agency authorized to establish these requirements on a Statewide basis, or comparable physical and mental fitness requirements as determined by the board of trustees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1(2)(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">Finally, the 1989 amendment made clear that \u201c[n]othing in this amendatory and supplementary act shall be construed as authorizing\u201d the \u201cenrollment in the retirement system of any person who was ineligible for membership\u201d previously. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1.2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">The 1989 amendment \u201cwas part of a series of amendatory laws intended to increase the retirement allowance of police officers and firefighters!,] and restrict and reduce membership in PFRS\u201d to pay for those increased benefits. <em>Prosecutors, supra, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 559, 694 A.2d 289. To meet that goal, the Legislature stressed the importance of the requirement that persons seeking to enroll in PFRS be appointed by the age of thirty-five:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2k\">The articulated objective was to encourage police officers and firefighters to \u201cretiref ] at a younger age, in order to protect the public.\u201d It was said in the legislative hearings that police officers and firefighters were to be given enhanced benefits \u201cbecause the nature of [their] duties ... required] a level of physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>attributes [and energy] which [are] found, statistically speaking, among younger members.\u201d The underlying idea was to \u201cfacilitate\u201d early retirement and \u201cturnover within the system\u201d by \u201cgiv[ing] better benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 559-60, 694 A.2d 289 (quoting <em>Hearing on S. 2602 Before the Assembly State Gov\u2019t Comm., </em>203rd Legis., 2d Sess., at 18 (Feb. 6, 1989) (Statement of Douglas Forrester, Director, Div. of Pensions)) (alterations in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">We have found that the 1989 amendment\u2019s \u201cacknowledged purpose [was] to restrict eligibility and to reserve to the young and the fit active roles in police and firefighter activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560, 694 A.2d 289. Indeed, the 1989 amendment, like the 1973 supplementary act, required that a person employed in a position subsequently \u201ccovered by the retirement system is required to enroll in the retirement system as a condition of employment, provided the person is otherwise eligible for membership by meeting the appointment, <em>age </em>and health requirements prescribed for all members.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1.2(b) (emphasis added); <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-63(b). \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">In 1993, the Legislature passed another supplementary act providing that \u201cany correction officer ... employed on the effective date of this supplementary act in the Department of Corrections who is enrolled in PERS\u201d was \u201celigible, regardless of age,\u201d to \u201ctransfer membership from PERS to PFRS ... by waiving, within 90 days of the effective date of this supplementary act, all\u201d PERS benefits. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3.8(a), (a)(4), (b). \u201cIf an eligible person does not file a timely waiver of PERS benefits, the person\u2019s pension status shall remain unchanged and the person\u2019s membership shall not be transferred to PFRS.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3.8(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">This 1993 supplementary act was an exception that proves the rule governing current State corrections officers such as plaintiffs. The language and history of the PFRS Act shows that the thirty-five-year age limit long enshrined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-2.5(a) applies to all persons eligible for PFRS because they fall within <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-l\u2019s definitions of \u201cpoliceman\u201d and \u201cfireman.\u201d That includes State corrections officers, as we indicated in <em>Allen </em>and <em>Koschker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Plaintiffs argue that there is no statute that explicitly requires that State corrections officers, when appointed, must be no older than thirty-five to be eligible for PFRS. To the contrary, that limitation is set forth in the same operative provision of the PFRS Act which makes any qualifying person \u201ca member in this retirement system,\u201d namely <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">As set forth above, PFRS pensions are available only to a \u201cpoliceman or fireman.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3; <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-2 (creating a retirement system for \u201cpolicemen and firemen\u201d). Because <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3 only allows a person to enroll in PFRS \u201cprovided, that his age at becoming such full-time policeman or fireman is not over 35 years,\u201d a State corrections officer is barred by statute from enrolling unless he meets that limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Plaintiffs argue that they are law enforcement employees, and that it is \u201c[t]he definition of \u2018policeman\u2019 in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1(2) [which] identifies those law enforcement employees who are to be admitted to the PFRS.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1(2) does identify which persons hold a position that is eligible for admission to PFRS. <em>Ibid, </em>(providing, after the 1989 amendment, only two eligible titles: \u201cpoliceman\u201d and \u201cfireman\u201d); <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-62 (requiring that a State officer must be \u201cholding one of the titles cited in\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1 to be eligible for PFRS). However, it is <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3 that provides that a \u201cpoliceman or fireman ... shall become a member of this retirement system.\u201d Thus, a State corrections officer, like any other \u201cpoliceman,\u201d must meet the age requirement of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3 to be enrolled in PFRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Moreover, both the 1975 and 1989 amendments expressly provided that each new officer must be \u201cotherwise eligible for membership by meeting the ... age ... requirements prescribed for all members.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1.2(b); <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-63(b). Both the 1993 amendment and the 1973 supplementary act confirmed that the age limit applies to State corrections officers by providing one-time exceptions allowing \u201cany correction officer ... in the Department of Corrections\u201d to transfer to PFRS \u201cregard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>less of age.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3.8(a)(4), (b); <em>see Koschker, supra, </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 212, 558 A.2d 503. As Judge Carchman found, these provisions \u201cindicate a legislative intent\u201d that the thirty-five-year-old age limit applies \u201cto a broader swath of PFRS individuals than local police and firemen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Plaintiffs cite language in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3(1) that provides PFRS membership to any person who is a full-time policeman or fireman \u201cin a county or municipality or fire district located in a township,\u201d without mentioning State officers. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3(1). However, the Legislature has not opted to change who is eligible for PFRS by amending the quoted language from <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3, which has gone unchanged since 1944. <em>See Seire, supra, </em>6 <em>N.J. </em>at 590, 80 A.2d 97. Rather, as set forth above, the Legislature has chosen to change who is eligible for PFRS membership by amending the definitions of \u201cpoliceman\u201d and \u201cfireman\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The Legislature repeatedly, over many decades, added State job titles to those definitions, and then in 1989 included any law enforcement employee of \u201cthe State\u201d as a \u201cpoliceman,\u201d and any employee of a firefighting unit of \u201cthe State\u201d as a \u201cfireman.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1(2)(a), (b). To read <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3 to apply only to a \u201cpoliceman\u201d or \u201cfireman\u201d employed by a county, municipality, or fire district would improperly render all of those amendments a nullity. <em>State v. Terry, </em>218 <em>N.J. </em>224, 237, 94 A.3d 882 (2014). \u201c[I]t is well-established that a statute should not be construed in a manner that renders any portion of it a nullity.\u201d <em>Smith v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>19, 27, 527 A.2d 843 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">We cannot ignore the Legislature\u2019s inclusion of State employees in the definition of \u201cpoliceman\u201d and \u201cfireman\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1(2), and the Legislature\u2019s use of those defined terms to determine membership in PFRS under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3(1). While it would have been clearer for the Legislature also to add the words \u201cthe State\u201d to the quoted language in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3 to reflect the addition of State employees through the defined terms, the ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>sence of those clarifying words cannot thwart the Legislature\u2019s obvious intent to include eligible State officers as members in PFRS, provided they meet its criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Thus, we read <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:16A-3(1) to include as members of PFRS all qualified persons who fall within the definition of \u201cpoliceman\u201d and \u201cfireman\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1(2), whether they are employed by the State, county, municipality, or fire district in a township. This reading prevents from being surplusage the language in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1(2) including State officers within those definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Moreover, our reading does not render redundant the quoted language in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3(1), because it differentiates its two subsections. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3(1) makes PFRS membership available in \u201ca county or municipality or fire district located in a township\u201d where a pension for policemen and firemen had been established \u201cprior to the date [the PFRS] act takes effect,\u201d whereas <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3(2) makes PFRS membership available in \u201cany county, municipality or political subdivision thereof\u2019 where the PFRS act subsequently becomes effective pursuant to a referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">\u201c\u2018When interpreting different statutory provisions, we are obligated to make every effort to harmonize them, even if they are in apparent conflict.\u2019 \u201d <em>St. Peter\u2019s Univ.

The Legislature has been constant in enforcing that rule, with only brief exceptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>when it allowed short windows for transfer when PFRS was extended to new classes of employees under the 1973, 1989, and 1993 supplementary acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The obvious reasons for restricting the age of enrollment were reiterated by the Legislature in its 1989 amendment, which incorporated State corrections officers into the current definition of \u201cpoliceman.\u201d The Legislature\u2019s \u201cacknowledged purpose [was] to restrict eligibility and to reserve to the young and the fit active roles in police and firefighter activities.\u201d <em>Prosecutors, supra, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 560, 694 A.2d 289 (upholding the exclusion of assistant county prosecutors from PFRS).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The Legislature\u2019s purpose is achieved by reading the Legislature\u2019s acts and amendments as making eligible for PFRS only those persons who become State corrections officers when they are not over thirty-five. As Judge Carchman observed, the Legislature imposed this requirement to encourage persons to become State corrections officers when they have \u201c \u2018a level of physical attributes [and energy] which [are] found, statistically speaking, among younger members.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 559, 694 A.2d 289 (quoting <em>Hearing on S. 2602 Before the Assembly State Gov\u2019t Comm., </em>203rd Legis., 2d Sess., at 18 (Feb. 6, 1989) (Statement of Douglas Forrester, Director, Div. of Pensions)).

However, those arguments support refusing to make all corrections officers eligible for PFRS, and restricting PFRS eligibility to those persons who become corrections officers at a young age, bringing to the position the youthful vitality for which PFRS\u2019s higher benefits provide compensation, and encouraging the early retirement and turnover that PFRS seeks to elicit. Moreover, the Legislature can chose to limit PFRS eligibility even if it does not preclude the hiring of older persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Finally, plaintiffs argue that excluding from PFRS those persons who become State corrections officers when over thirty-five is contrary to the requirement that a \u201cpoliceman\u201d or \u201cfireman\u201d become a member of PFRS \u201cas a condition of his employment.\u201d N.J.<em>S.A. </em>42:16A-3(1). However, the Legislature qualified that phrase in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>42:16A-3(1) with the proviso that \u201chis age at becoming such full-time policeman or fireman is not over 35 years.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Legislature similarly qualified the \u201ccondition of his employment\u201d phrase in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1.2(b) and -63(b) with the proviso that \u201cthe person is otherwise eligible for membership by meeting the ... age\u201d requirements. <em>Ibid. </em>As we stated in <em>Allen, </em>a person who becomes a State corrections officer after age thirty-five, \u201c[ajlthough job-eligible, [is] not age eligible\u201d for PFRS. <em>Allen, supra, </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 208, 558 A.2d 496.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">\u201cOur construction of the statute is also supported by the long-standing administrative practice and interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Division of Pensions.\u201d <em>Prosecutors, supra, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 561, 694 A.2d 289.

The Board\u2019s longstanding regulation that applicants \u201cmust be appointed to an eligible title on or prior to their 35th birthday,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>adopts the interpretation which best fits the statutory history, language, and purpose, as set forth above. The Board\u2019s interpretation particularly accords with the Legislature\u2019s directions in the 1975 and 1989 amendments that a person in a position covered by PFRS is eligible for PFRS only if the person meets the \u201cage\u201d requirements prescribed \u201cfor all members.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1.2(b); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-63(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\u201c \u2018An administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute it is charged with enforcing is entitled to great weight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Prosecutors, supra, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 561, 694 A.2d 289 (quoting <em>In re Saddle River, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>14, 24, 362 A.2d 552 (1976)); <em>accord In re Freshwater Wetlands Prot.

Thus, \u201cStates may discriminate on the basis of age without offending the Fourteenth Amendment if the age classification in question is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\u201d <em>Kimel, supra, </em>528 <em>U.S. </em>at 83, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 645, 145 L.Ed.2d at 542; <em>In re C.V.S. Pharm. Wayne, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>490, 502, 561 A.2d 1160 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">As Judge Carchman found, granting increased pension benefits to persons who become corrections officers when thirty-five years old or younger has a rational basis. <em>See Boylan, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 250-51, 561 A.2d 552. We reject plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims substantially for the reasons set forth in Judge Carchman\u2019s thorough opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Plaintiffs argue that turning thirty-five has not prevented them from being hired or performing their duties. Nonetheless, the Legislature could rationally have chosen to encourage younger persons to become State corrections officers with the incentive of a more generous pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Accordingly, Judge Carchman\u2019s grant of summary judgment was proper, because it is appropriate and constitutional for <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:4-2.5(a) to limit PFRS eligibility to persons who become State corrections officers when they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>not over thirty-five years old.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A9T\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-9\"> The court dismissed all plaintiffs except for Piatt for failure to prosecute their claims after their counsel died while the federal lawsuit was pending. <em>Ibid. </em>(Jun. 27, 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b117-9\"> <em>See </em>29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1002(32), 1003(b)(1); <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-2.1 (providing that New Jersey's LAD does not \u201cinterfere with the operation of the terms or conditions and administration of ... any State or locally administered public retirement system\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b117-10\"> Prior to Judge Carchman's involvement, a Law Division judge dismissed thirty-seven plaintiffs, finding res judicata based on their dismissal from the federal lawsuit for failure to prosecute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b119-8\"> The same limitation appears in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3(2), which governs a \u201ccounty, municipality, or political subdivision thereof\u201d that adopts PFRS by referendum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\"> Because Allen was appointed during one of the periods where the age limit was considered invalid under the ADEA, he was entitled to relief provided such persons under the former <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:1-12.7. <em>Allen, supra, </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 208-09, 558 A.2d 496; <em>see Simon, supra, </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 191, 558 A.2d 490.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b121-8\"> The 1989 amendment also required the Board to \"review the positions of all members\u201d to determine if each \u201cposition shall continue to be covered under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>retirement system based upon the definitions of 'policeman' and 'fireman' in this act.\" <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-1.2(a), (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b127-8\"> Plaintiffs note PFRS members are not required to retire until they turn sixty-five. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-5(1). That does not alter the legislative purpose to encourage earlier retirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b128-8\"> Because we find persons who become State corrections officers over age thirty-five are statutorily ineligible for membership in PFRS, we need not address defendants' argument that this interpretation is also supported by consideration of mandatory retirement ages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\"> Therefore, we need not address the merits of plaintiffs' claim that res judicata did not justify the dismissal of thirty-seven plaintiffs by the Law Division based on their dismissal from the federal lawsuit. Even if the dismissal by the Law Division was inappropriate, summary judgment would also have been granted against those plaintiffs for the reasons set forth above.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
