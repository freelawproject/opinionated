As noted, defendant had been ordered not to \u201cthreaten\u201d or \u201cintimidate\u201d any expert based apparently on what the family judge perceived to be a pattern of such conduct when the matter was handled by another family judge who had recused himself. In responding to this appeal, plaintiff has regaled us with many of these earlier circumstances. These prior events may constitute relevant evidence in the contempt proceedings that will follow today\u2019s remand, but they have no bearing on the primary question before us\u2014whether the family judge who initiated the contempt proceeding should have presided over the trial of that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">There was a time when a hard-and-fast rule prohibited the initiating judge from presiding over a summary contempt proceeding. <em>See In re Fair Lawn Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>112, 115, 305 A.2d 72, <em>cert. denied, </em>414 <em>U.S. </em>855, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>155, 38 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>104 (1973); <em>City of Bridgeton v. Jones, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>325, 336-38, 549 A.2d 877 (App.Div.1988). As we observed in <em>Warren County Community College v. Warren County Board of Chosen Freeholders, </em>350 <em>N.J.Super. </em>489, 512, 796 A.2d 257 (App.Div.2002), <em>aff'd in part, modified in part, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>432, 824 A.2d 1073 (2003), before the 1994 amendment to <em>Rule </em>1:10-2, \u201c[i]t was reversible error for the same judge to hear the [summary contempt] proceedings.\u201d <em>See also City of Bridgeton, supra, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 337, 549 A.2d 877 (finding it \u201cfatally defective\u201d for the initiating judge to preside over a summary contempt proceeding). This approach was adopted chiefly because of the potential for arbitrariness when a judge acts as \u201ccomplainant, prosecutor, judge and executioner.\u201d <em>In re Buehrer, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>501, 514, 236 A.2d 592 (1967). As explained by Chief Justice Weintraub:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>With respect to procedural antidotes, our practice in contempt matters is calculated to limit the risk of arbitrariness and the appearance of arbitrariness. So, for example, when the charge is a violation of a court order, the penal proceeding may not be heard by the judge whose order was allegedly contemned unless the defendant consents to his sitting. Thereby obviated is the risk which inhered singularly in the contempt area when the offended judge sat in judgment of his own charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\"><em>[Fair Lawn Educ. Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>at 115, 305 A.2d 72 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Since 1994, however, <em>Rule </em>l:10-2(c) (emphasis added) requires only that \u201c[t]he matter shall not be heard by the judge who instituted the prosecution <em>if the appearance of objectivity requires trial by another </em>judge.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are, therefore, required to consider whether \u201cthe appearance of objectivity\u201d prohibited what occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">As the record reveals, the judge\u2019s April 16, 2014 order to show cause was prompted not only by the April 15, 2014 written complaint of plaintiffs counsel regarding defendant\u2019s communication with a custody expert, but also the suit\u2019s prior history, which had led to orders limiting or prohibiting such communications. The order to show cause also appears to have issued before defendant had an opportunity to explain or respond. This sudden leap from a complaining letter of matrimonial counsel to the commencement of summary contempt proceedings might alone suggest the appearance of objectivity had been lost. But, even if that were not so, we are satisfied from the events that followed that the judge erred in presiding over the summary contempt proceeding he initiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">We examine this question by first acknowledging that \u201c[t]he summary prosecution of a contempt committed outside the presence of the court is inherently a highly sensitive matter,\u201d and, for that reason, warrants \u201cscrupulous attention to the procedural safeguards embodied by the rules.\u201d <em>City of Bridgeton, supra, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 335, 549 A.2d 877. Our review is de novo for these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>very reasons.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Here, the judge opened the contempt proceeding\u2014before even inviting the appearances of counsel\u2014with a statement describing the proceeding by stating that he had directed defendant to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">show cause before this [c]ourt why his failure to comply with the [c]ourt\u2019s [o]rder of February 20, 201[4,] in addition to numerous prior court ordersf,] which prohibited [d]efendant from directly contacting any experts in this matter[,] would not be subject to me holding him in contempt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">Now, let\u2019s be clear. Counsel is here, and we\u2019ll have your appearances in a minute. But I note ... [c]ounsel is here. I note that the parties are here. And when I direct this following comment at Mr. Ippolito\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">I direct this at you, sir, with all due respect. I am not here to find you in contempt. I am here to find out if you are in contempt. Understand that? Big difference. Yes? No? All right. Well, we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. You want to talk to your lawyer, no problem. That was a pretty basic question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">So, let\u2019s have Mr. Ippolito sworn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">After defendant was sworn as directed by the judge, and after the attorneys gave their appearances, the judge then turned to defense counsel and said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-11\">So what I want you to do, Mr. Donahue, right now is your client is here in the [witness] box. He is here to tell me why he should not be held in contempt. All right? So please question him and he\u2019ll be cross-examined as we see fit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-12\">Although the transcript lacks the dynamics of a live presentation, the first few pages of the transcript are nevertheless palpable; the judge spoke directly at defendant and made clear that defendant was there to explain his conduct. The procedural safeguards contained in <em>Rule </em>1:10-2 are, as we'have mentioned, intended to avoid the inherent arbitrariness of a summary contempt proceeding. The utilization of all those safeguards ensures the \u201cappearance of objectivity.\u201d Their absence, as readily revealed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>judge\u2019s opening comments, calls into question the objectivity of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">For example, because the commencement of a proceeding pursuant to <em>Rule </em>1:10-2 constitutes a charge of criminal conduct\u2014 \u201c[t]he essence of the offense is defiance of public authority,\u201d <em>In re Yengo, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>111, 120, 417 A.2d 533 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>1124, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>941, 67 L.Ed.2d 110 (1981)\u2014defendant was entitled to most of the safeguards accorded criminal defendants, with the exception of the right to indictment and the right, in some cases, to a jury trial. Defendant was entitled to \u201cthe presumption of innocence, the privilege against self-incrimination, the right of cross-examination, proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and the admissibility of evidence in accordance with the rules of evidence.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The importance of these rights is further illuminated by their historical underpinnings. Similar circumstances prompted Justice Frankfurter to observe that \u201c[bjitter experience has sharpened our realization that a major test of true democracy is the fair administration of justice,\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is not for nothing that most of the provisions of our Bill of Rights are concerned with matters of procedure.\u201d <em>Sacher v. United States, </em>343 <em>U.S. </em>1, 23-25, 72 <em>S.Ct. </em>451, 462-63, 96 <em>L.Ed. </em>717, 731-32 (1952) (dissenting opinion); see <em>also Burdeau v. McDowell, </em>256 <em>U.S. </em>465, 477, 41 <em>S.Ct. </em>574, 576, 65 <em>L.Ed. </em>1048, 1051 (1921) (in which Justice Brand\u00e9is noted in his dissent that \u201cin the development of our liberty insistence upon procedural regularity has been a large factor\u201d). By directing defendant to take the oath and respond to the unsworn allegations conveyed by counsel\u2019s letter that led to the contempt proceeding, the judge sought defendant\u2019s waiver of his right against self-incrimination. And, by requiring that defendant testify first\u2014asserting that \u201c[defendant] is here to tell me why he should not be held in contempt\u201d\u2014the judge mistakenly assumed defendant was saddled with the burden of proving his innocence. The judge was greatly mistaken in this regard; it was the prosecution\u2019s burden to demonstrate defendant was in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>tempt beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With one swift direction at the start of the proceeding, the judge deprived defendant of the presumption of innocence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Defendant emphasizes another procedural safeguard bypassed here. <em>Rule </em>l:10-2(c) declares the proceeding \u201cmay be prosecuted on behalf of the court <em>only </em>by the Attorney General, the County Prosecutor of the county, or where the court for good cause designates an attorney, then by the attorney so designated\u201d (emphasis added). No attorney was designated. Instead, the judge seems to have largely prosecuted the matter himself; he directed that defendant testify first and, after defendant was briefly examined by his own attorney and then briefly by plaintiffs attorney, the judge extensively cross-examined. Despite the <em>Rule\u2019s </em>unambiguous declaration as to whom may prosecute such a matter, the judge took on that role. Contrary to law, the judge who instituted the action became \u201ccomplainant, prosecutor, judge and executioner.\u201d <em>Buehrer, supra, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>at 514, 236 A.2d 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">If there was any question about the \u201cappearance of objectivity\u201d before the proceeding began, the judge\u2019s comments at the outset and the proceedings themselves eliminate any doubt.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>judge\u2019s written decision, which explained the basis for his finding of contempt, was the judge\u2019s own expression of the reasons for the contempt proceedings. He stated that the history of prior difficulties with experts led to his concern when plaintiffs counsel wrote to him about defendant\u2019s communication with an expert; the judge opined in his written decision that \u201cyet another expert had been made uncomfortable and was potentially poised to resign from his role in this case.\u201d* *<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">For these reasons, we conclude the \u201cappearance of objectivity\u201d required that a different judge preside over the trial of the summary contempt proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">We lastly consider plaintiffs argument that what occurred was not actually a summary contempt proceeding but a proceeding of the type permitted by <em>Rule </em>1:10-3. That argument is without sufficient merit to warrant further discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(1)(E). We would add only that it is clear from everything the judge said<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and wrote<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> with regard to this pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>eeeding\u2014except the caption used on the order under review\u2014that the judge believed he was conducting a summary contempt proceeding.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The word \u201ccontempt\u201d is repeated throughout the hearing* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> when describing the nature of the proceeding and uttered more than a dozen times in the judge\u2019s ten-page written opinion. The preamble of both the order to show cause and the order that concluded the matter invoked <em>Rule </em>1:10-2, and the judge, in his opinion, cited only to <em>Rule </em>1:10-2 as the authority upon which the proceeding was based; he also cited numerous cases that dealt with the summary contempt power, demonstrating a clear understanding of the difference between the proceedings permitted by <em>Rule </em>1:10-2 and those authorized by <em>Rule </em>1:10-3. On the other hand, <em>Rule </em>1:10-3 was never mentioned (except to distinguish it from the summary contempt procedure) or cited either during the hearing or in the judge\u2019s written opinion or final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The May 7, 2014 order under review is vacated. We remand to the assignment judge for the designation of another judge to preside over the summary contempt proceeding instigated by the order to show cause entered on April 16, 2014, and for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b34-10\"> The prior versions of the <em>Rule </em>prohibited a judge from presiding over the summary contempt proceeding without exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b35-13\"> Because of concerns about the arbitrariness of the power of summary contempt, appellate review is immediately available as of right, <em>R. </em>2:2-3(a)(l), and execution of sentence is automatically stayed for five days following its imposition or, if an appeal is taken, during the pendency of the appeal, <em>R. </em>1:10-2 (incorporating the stay provisions of the rule applicable to contempt in the presence of the court, <em>R. </em>1:10-1), although bail may be required if reasonably necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b37-8\"> Interestingly, the judge called no other witnesses to testify\u2014not even the expert who was allegedly threatened or intimidated by defendant's communication.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b37-9\"> To be sure, the judge concluded in his written opinion that defendant \"intentionally\u201d violated \"the intent and the spirit\u201d of the February 20, 2014 order. That is not the same as finding that defendant intentionally acted beyond a reasonable doubt. To the contrary, the entire tenor of the proceeding and the content of the judge\u2019s written opinion suggests to us\u2014in reviewing the matter de novo\u2014that the judge failed to apply the reasonable-doubt standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b37-10\"> We would note that the form of the order to show cause is also problematic. Although an alleged contemnor has no constitutional right to indictment, <em>Yengo, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 120, 417 A.2d 533, he does have a right to notice of the charges. The assertion that defendant violated both the February 20, 2014 order and \"addition[al] numerous other prior [cjourt [orders]\u201d was insufficient to put defendant on notice of what he was being asked to defend against. At the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>least the earlier orders that the judge believed had been violated should have been specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b38-10\"> There was no proof to support that contention. The expert was never called to testify about his alleged discomfort.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b38-11\"> Toward the end of the April 23 hearing, the judge and defense counsel engaged in a colloquy about the nature of the proceeding. When defense counsel argued that he did not anticipate that testimony would be taken, asserting \u201c[generally, [tjestimony isn't taken on [ojrders to [s]how [cjause,\u201d the judge responded: \"Well, on <em>a contempt hearing </em>testimony is taken, Frank____ [Tjhis was an order to hear a contempt citation\u201d (emphasis added).
