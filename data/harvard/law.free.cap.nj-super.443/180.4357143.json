Fisher, Sr. appeals from a September 10, 2014 order, granting respondent Justina Nees\u2019s application to bar him from receiving a share of the intestate estate of their deceased son. Because we conclude that Nees failed to demonstrate that Fisher \u201cabandoned\u201d the child \u201cby willfully forsaking\u201d him within the intendment of the governing statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5\u201414.1(b)(1), we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">We derive the following facts from the parties\u2019 pleadings and certifications. The parties were married in 1994 and had one child, Michael, born in February 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">The parties separated in April 2001.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One month later, Nees obtained a Final Restraining Order (FRO) against Fisher after he attempted to remove Michael from school without first notifying her. Under the terms of the FRO, Fisher was permitted to have supervised parenting time with Michael at Fisher\u2019s psychologist\u2019s office. The FRO also ordered Fisher to submit to a risk assessment and to \u201creceive professional domestic violence counseling[.]\u201d Fisher did not attend all of his supervised parenting time sessions with his son. He also did not appear for the risk assessment or counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">In November 2001, Fisher filed a motion, seeking permission to have unsupervised parenting time with Michael. In response, Nees filed a cross-motion, requesting that all of Fisher\u2019s parenting time be supervised until he completed the anger management program and the risk assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>On January 29, 2002, the court temporarily suspended Fisher\u2019s parenting time pending his enrollment in an anger management program and completion of an assessment by the \u201cFamily Court Assessment Team.\u201d In his decision, the judge remarked \u201cthat [Fisher] ha[d] not exerted himself to take the basic steps\u201d set forth in the FRO concerning the required risk assessment and counseling and stated that Fisher\u2019s \u201ccontumacious disregard of the court\u2019s explicit requirements\u201d supported the denial of Fisher\u2019s request for unsupervised parenting time.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">On March 7, 2002, the court entered a Final Judgment of Divorce (FJOD), which incorporated the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement as to the terms of the dissolution. The FJOD granted sole custody of Michael to Nees, with Fisher\u2019s parenting time remaining suspended until he complied with the January 29, 2002 order. Fisher agreed to pay Nees $85 per week<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in child support for Michael, with the payments to be made through the County Probation Department by way of wage garnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">In Fisher\u2019s certification, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">During our divorce litigation, [Nees] made an offer to me, through our attorneys, that she would not ask for any child support if I were to agree to give up my parental rights to Michael. I emphatically said that I would absolutely never agree to that. Although I was having financial difficulties, I was never going to give up my parental rights to Michael in consideration for no child support. I wanted to have a relationship with Michael.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Nees did not contradict Fisher\u2019s statement in her pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">Fisher did not \u201cpresent[ ] himself for the\u201d Family Court Assessment Team evaluation required by the January 29, 2002 order. Therefore, on May 8, 2002, the trial court sent the parties a letter stating that \u201cthe suspension of [Fisher\u2019s] visitation with Michael ... continues in full force and effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">From January 2002 until Michael\u2019s death at the age of fifteen on September 24, 2010, Fisher \u201cnever had any legal visitation with his son.\u201d Fisher spoke to Michael during \u201csome\u201d telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>conversations in 2001 and 2002. Fisher stated he \u201cwould occasionally see Michael in public places.\u201d One summer, he saw Michael on a beach, approached him, and began talking to his son. At that point, Nees appeared, reminded Fisher of the FRO, and told him she would call the police if he did not leave. Fisher complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In 2006, Fisher moved to Florida. Fisher certified that he was going \u201cthrough some difficult times including having significant health issues.\u201d He fell behind in his child support obligations and, by 2010, was over $10,000 in arrears.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">In May 2010, Fisher filed a motion to decrease or terminate his child support obligation. Fisher stated that he was diagnosed with a serious health condition in February 2008 and could no longer work as a painter. Nees opposed the motion and attached a photograph of Fisher working on a ladder in 2009 to her pleadings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 4On July 6, 2010, the trial judge granted Fisher\u2019s motion and terminated his child support obligation as of May 13, 2010, the date he filed his motion. The judge explained his ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">[Fisher] has demonstrated that his circumstances have changed so that the current child support order is no longer feasible. [Fisher] is seriously ill and unable to work. There is no indication that he will recover and be able to resume work. Although [Nees] has provided a picture of [Fisher] working, this does not, in the court\u2019s view, outweigh the medical information [Fisher] has provided and his statements that he is unable to work. Even if [Fisher] did work for a day or two in October, that does not mean he can work now or has been able to work consistently for the past two years. It is pointless and impractical to maintain a child support order which [Fisher] cannot now and may never be able to pay.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Fisher stated that, about two months before Michael\u2019s death, Fisher \u201clocated\u201d his son on Facebook and sent him some messages. Michael responded to the messages. However, Fisher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>then discovered he \u201cwas blocked\u201d from Michael\u2019s account. Fisher certified that he did not \u201cknow who orchestrated that or why.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">In August 2010, Nees filed a motion to reinstate Fisher\u2019s child support obligation or, in the alternative, to require Fisher to apply for Social Security Disability benefits. Fisher did not file any opposition to the motion. On September 24, 2010, the judge ordered Fisher to apply for the benefits within thirty days. However, Michael passed away later that day.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Fisher learned of his son\u2019s death from a relative and returned to New Jersey to attend the funeral. Nees stated that she asked Fisher \u201cto pay for half of the funeral costs and he would not do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Michael died intestate and, with Fisher\u2019s consent, Nees was appointed on June 1, 2012 as the administratrix and administratrix <em>ad prosequendum </em>of Michael\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">Because Michael had no spouse or children, his parents would each share equally in his intestate estate. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>8B:5-4(b). However, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1, which became effective on July 1, 2009, provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An\">b. A parent of a decedent shall lose all right to intestate succession in any part of the decedent\u2019s estate ... if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-10\">(1) The parent refused to acknowledge the decedent or <em>abandoned </em>the decedent when the decedent was a minor <em>by willfully forsaking the decedent, </em>failing to care for and keep the control and custody of the decedent so that the decedent was exposed to physical or moral risk without propel' and sufficient protection, or failing to care for and keep the control and custody of the decedent so that the decedent was in the care, custody and control of the State at the time of death.... [ (emphasis added) ].<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>On March 21, 2014, Nees filed a verified complaint seeking to bar Fisher from receiving a share of Michael\u2019s estate under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1(b). She alleged that Fisher abandoned Michael after the parties\u2019 divorce by failing to have any contact with the child or pay his full child support obligation. On that same date, the Chancery Division issued an order to show cause. Fisher filed an answer to the complaint, denying that he abandoned his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Following oral argument on the return date of the order to show cause,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the trial judge granted Nees\u2019s request to bar Fisher from receiving a share of Michael\u2019s intestate estate. In his written opinion, the judge found that <em>\u201cN.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1(b)(l) bars a parent from inheriting a share of his [or her] child\u2019s intestate estate if that parent abandoned that child by willfully forsaking him [or her]\u201d and stated that the \u201ccourt\u2019s task [was] to determine whether the actions and inactions of [Fisher], in the context of the previous court orders hmiting his parental rights, qualify as a willful forsaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">In conducting this analysis, the judge did not refer to any of the case law interpreting the terms \u201cabandoned\u201d and \u201cwillfully forsaking\u201d in other contexts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, the judge referred to a dictionary definition of the word \u201cwillful,\u201d which defined the term as \u201c \u2018[proceeding from a conscious motion of the will; voluntary; [intending the result which actually comes to pass; designed; intentional; not accidental or involuntary.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The judge then summarized the facts in the record supporting his determination that Fisher \u201cabandoned his son by willfully forsaking him.\u201d The judge found that, although Fisher\u2019s parenting time had been limited by the FRO and the FJOD, Fisher still had the opportunity for supervised parenting time with Michael if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>he complied with the court\u2019s directives. However, Fisher failed to attend the supervised sessions and, when those sessions were suspended, failed to submit to a risk assessment or complete counseling in order to regain the opportunity to resume parenting time with Michael. The judge highlighted the comments made by the court in the January 29, 2002 order that Fisher had \u201c \u2018continued his contumacious disregard for the orders of [the] court by not cooperating or presenting himself for the [required] evaluations.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The judge noted that Fisher had no contact with his son after 2002, and moved to Florida in 2006. The judge also found that Fisher \u201cfailed to voluntarily comply with his child support obligations, which resulted in a wage garnishment and substantial arrears as of the date of his son\u2019s death.\u201d Thus, the judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">Previously, [Fisher], as a result of his own actions, was subject to severe limitations of his parental rights. [Fisher] failed to complete any of the court[-]mandated prerequisites to continue visitations with his son or regain his full parental rights. [Fisher] failed to provide his son with any voluntary financial support over the remainder of his life. Although his rights with respect to his son had been limited by [the] court, the facts here demonstrate that [Fisher] abandoned what relationship remained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">At the same time, however, the judge stated that \u201c[t]he court does not question that [Fisher] cared for his son or mean to imply that it was his purpose or specific intent to abandon him.\u201d The judge observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\">The paradigm case of abandonment by willfully forsaking [a child] would be where a parent, with uninhibited rights of custody and visitation, chooses to leave the familial unit, has no further involvement with the child, and provides no voluntary support for the child. This is not such a case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Finally, the judge stated, \u201c[a]dmittedly, it may not have been [Fisher\u2019s] specific intent or purpose to abandon his son.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">In spite of these findings, the judge granted Nees\u2019s application, stating that Fisher\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-12\">acts were unequivocally intentional rather than accidental or involuntary. His choice not to attend his supervised visits with his son and court[-]mandated anger management therapy was not accidental or involuntary. His failure to voluntarily fulfill his child support obligations was not accidental or involuntary. And ulti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>mately, the absence of his presence from the remainder of his son\u2019s regrettably short life was not accidental or involuntary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">This appeal followed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Whether Fisher \u201cabandoned\u201d Michael turns upon an interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5\u201414.1(b)(1). \u201cA trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference\u201d on appeal. <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v.

Olivero, </em>221 <em>N.J. </em>632, 639, 115 A.3d 1270 (2015) (citing <em>Murray v. Plainfield Rescue Squad, </em>210 <em>N.J. </em>581, 592, 46 A.3d 1262 (2012)). Our analysis of a statute begins with its plain language, giving the words their ordinary meaning and significance. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cIt is a basic rule of statutory construction to ascribe to plain language its ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Bridgewater-Raritan Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Bd. of Educ., </em>221 <em>N.J. </em>349, 361, 113 A.3d 764 (2015) (citing <em>D\u2019Annunzio v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>110, 119-20, 927 A.2d 113 (2007)). \u201cWhen that language \u2018clearly reveals the meaning of the statute, the court\u2019s sole function is to enforce the statute in accordance with those terms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Olivero, supra, </em>221 <em>N.J. </em>at 639, 115 A.3d 1270 (quoting <em>McCann v. Clerk of Jersey City, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>311, 320, 771 A.2d 1123 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">However, if there is any ambiguity in the statutory language, a court may look at extrinsic evidence \u201csuch as \u2018the statute\u2019s pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>pose, legislative history, and statutory context.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v.

A court may also consider \u201cextrinsic evidence if a plain reading of the statute leads to an absurd result or if the overall statutory scheme is at odds with the plain language.\u201d <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 493, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">As noted above, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1(b)(l) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">b. A parent of a decedent shall lose all right to intestate succession in any part of the decedent\u2019s estate ... if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">(1) The parent refused to acknowledge the decedent or abandoned the decedent when the decedent was a minor by willfully forsaking the decedent, failing to care for and keep the control and custody of the decedent so that the decedent was exposed to physical or moral risk without proper and sufficient protection, or failing to care for and keep the control and custody of the decedent so that the decedent was in the care, custody and control of the State at the time of death____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Fisher contends that the trial judge erred in only considering the first phrase of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5\u201414.1(b)(1) and determining that Fisher \u201cabandoned\u201d Michael by \u201cwillfully forsaking him.\u201d Fisher states that the two phrases that follow were meant to modify the words \u201cabandoned the decedent ... by willfully forsaking him.\u201d Thus, Fisher argues that a parent may lose his or her right to intestate succession under the statute only if the abandonment resulted in the child being \u201cexposed to physical or moral risk without proper and sufficient protection,\u201d or having to be placed \u201cin the care, custody and control of the State\u201d prior to his or her death. Because there is no evidence that Fisher\u2019s actions exposed Michael to \u201cphysical or moral risk\u201d or caused him to become a ward of the State, Fisher argues that the judge should not have determined that he abandoned his son. We disagree with Fisher\u2019s interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">As noted above, the plain language of a statute \u201cis typically the best indicator of intent.\u201d <em>In re Plan for the Abolition of the Council on Affordable Hous., </em>214 <em>N.J. </em>444, 467, 70 A.3d 559 (2013). Fisher\u2019s proposed interpretation ignores the punctuation used and the Legislature\u2019s inclusion of the word \u201cor\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>statute. \u201cPunctuation is part of an act and may be considered in its interpretation.\u201d <em>Commerce Bancorp, supra, </em>417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 336, 9 A.3d 1056 (quoting <em>Moore v. Magor Car Corp., </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>82, 87, 141 A.2d 536 (1958)). \u201c[T]he word \u2018or\u2019 in a statute is to be considered a disjunctive particle indicating an alternative.\u201d <em>State v. Kress, </em>105 <em>N.J.Super. </em>514, 520, 253 A.2d 481 (Law Div.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u201cWhen[, as here,] items in a list are joined by a comma or semicolon, with an \u2018or\u2019 preceding the last item, the items are disjunctive.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>487, 506, 621 A.2d 493 (App.Div.1993). Thus, purely as a matter of grammar, the three clauses in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5\u201414.1(b)(1) are distinct and separate from each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Based on this well-established rule of statutory construction and the plain language of the statute, we conclude that a parent may lose his or her right to intestate succession if the parent abandoned the decedent when he or she was a minor by: (1) \u201cwillfully forsaking the decedent\u201d; (2) \u201cfailing to care for and keep the control and custody of the decedent so that the decedent was exposed to physical or moral risk without proper and sufficient protection\u201d; <em>or </em>(3) \u201cfailing to care for and keep the control and custody of the decedent so that the decedent was in the care, custody and control of the State at the time of death____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">\u201cWhen the Legislature\u2019s chosen words lead to one clear and unambiguous result, the interpretative process comes to a close, without the need to consider extrinsic aids.\u201d <em>State v. Buckley, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>249, 263, 78 A.3d 958 (2013) (quoting <em>State v. Shelley, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>320, 323, 15 A.3d 818 (2011)). Therefore, we need proceed no further in considering Fisher\u2019s argument on this point. Nevertheless, the legislative history of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1(b)(1) fully supports our conclusion that a parent may abandon his or her child by taking any of the three specific actions set forth in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">As originally introduced on May 12, 2008, Assembly Bill 2681, (the bill that was eventually enacted as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1), de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>fined the term \u201cabandonment\u201d only by a specific reference to <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:6-1, without the inclusion of the language of that statute. In pertinent part, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">Abandonment of a child shall consist of any of the following acts by anyone having the custody or control of the child: (a) willfully forsaking a child; (b) falling to care for and keep the control and custody of a child so that the child shall be exposed to physical or moral risk without proper and sufficient protection; (c) failing to care for and keep control and custody of a child so that the child shall be liable to be supported and maintained at the expense of the public, or by child caring societies or private persons not legally chargeable with its care or their care, custody and control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">As is readily apparent from an examination of the language it used in the final version of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1(b)(1), <em>(L. </em>2009, c. 43), the Legislature simply replaced its \u201cshorthand\u201d reference to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1 in the original bill with virtually the same language set forth in that statute. Indeed, the main difference between the two statutes is that, when it enacted <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1(b)(l), the Legislature neglected to include specific letter designations ((a), (b), and (c)) for the three subsections of the statute as it did in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1. This omission, however, is of no moment because, as discussed above, the punctuation and language the Legislature used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1(b)(1) clearly demonstrate that \u201cabandonment\u201d under that statute, as was the case under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1, can consist of three distinct actions. <em>See In re Petition for Referendum on City of Trenton Ordinance 09-02, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>349, 359, 990 A.2d 1109 (2010) (\u201cWhen reviewing two separate enactments, the [c]ourt has an affirmative duty to reconcile them, so as to give effect to both expressions of the lawmakers\u2019 will.\u201d) (quoting <em>St. Peter\u2019s Univ. Hosp. v. Lacy, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>1, 14, 878 A.2d 829 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Fisher makes a final argument in support of his contention that a parent may only lose his or her right to a child\u2019s intestate estate if the abandonment exposes the child to the risk of physical harm. The sponsor of Senate Bill 1640, which was the Senate\u2019s version of Assembly Bill 2681, appended a statement to the bill when it was introduced. In pertinent part, the statement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>This bill is in response to a recent decision of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division, which held that the mother of an abused, abandoned, and neglected child was not entitled to inherit the $1 million the State paid to her son\u2019s estate to settle a lawsuit. The court concluded, using its equitable powers, that allowing the woman whose abuse and neglect led to the child\u2019s death to collect that child\u2019s inheritance would be \u201ccruel, ironic, and inequitable.\u201d This bill seeks to fill the gap in the statutory law on this issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\"><em>[Sponsor\u2019s Statement to S. 1640, </em>at 4 (May 5, 2008).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The sponsor\u2019s statement refers to our decision in <em>New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services v. M.W., </em>398 <em>N.J.Super. </em>266, 942 A.2d 1 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>347, 953 A.2d 765 (2008). In that case, the mother abused her three children and then left them in the care of a cousin who burned, beat, restrained, starved, and confined the children in a basement without access to a bathroom. <em>Id. </em>at 271-279, 942 A.2d 1. Two of the children were eventually rescued, but the third child was found dead in the basement. <em>Id. </em>at 274, 942 A.2d 1. The Division was supposed to be supervising and providing services to the children, but it failed to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 277-82, 942 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">While she was still in jail, the mother brought an action against the Division on behalf of the two surviving children, \u201calleging that the Division had negligently failed to protect her children from abuse while they were in the care of\u2019 the cousin. <em>Id. </em>at 282-83, 942 A.2d 1. The Division settled the case and, as part of the settlement, agreed to pay $1 million to the deceased child\u2019s estate. <em>Id. </em>at 283, 942 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Because <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1 had not yet been enacted, there was no statute to prevent the mother from inheriting the $1 million. However, the trial court granted the Division\u2019s application to retroactively terminate the mother\u2019s parental rights to prevent the inheritance from taking place. <em>Id. </em>at 285-286, 942 A.2d 1. On appeal, we upheld the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 286, 942 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">In our ruling, we noted that New Jersey had not \u201cadopted a statutory exception to the mandatory succession by intestacy statutes applicable to children to extinguish the inheritance rights of \u2018bad parents.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292, 942 A.2d 1. In the present case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Fisher argues that, based on the sponsor\u2019s statement that Senate Bill 1640 would address the horrific situation involved in <em>M.W., N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5\u201414.1(b)(1) should be interpreted to only apply to acts constituting \u201cabandonment\u201d that result in death or serious harm to the child. This argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">A statement appended to a proposed bill is often \u201ca highly persuasive indication of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Toogood v. St. Andrews Condo. Ass\u2019n, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>418, 425, 712 A.2d 1262 (App.Div.1998) (citing <em>Helfrich v. Hamilton Twp., </em>182 <em>N.J.Super. </em>365, 371, 440 A.2d 1366 (App.Div.1981)). And, we do not doubt that the tragic circumstances of <em>M.W. </em>prompted the Legislature to examine the issues raised by that case. Thus, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1(b)(4) prohibits a parent from sharing in his or her deceased child\u2019s estate if \u201c[t]he parent abused or neglected the decedent ..., and the abuse or neglect contributed to the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d That provision specifically covers the problem presented in <em>M.W.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">As demonstrated above, however, the Legislature did not limit <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1 only to cases where a parent causes serious physical or emotional harm to a child. By enacting subsection (b)(1), the Legislature obviously intended to address a broader array of concerns, including a situation where a parent \u201cabandoned the decedent when the decedent was a minor by willfully forsaking the decedent____\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, we reject Fisher\u2019s contention on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">We now turn to the question of whether Fisher \u201cabandoned\u201d Michael when he was a minor by \u201cwillfully forsaking him\u201d within the intendment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>BB:5\u201414.1(b)(1). In construing this statutory provision, the trial judge focused only on the word \u201cwillfully\u201d, which he defined through the use of a dictionary. \u201cBut dictionary definitions are not necessarily] a reliable guide to the meaning of words of ... statutes of this breadth and significance.\u201d <em>Whateley v. Leonia Bd. of Educ., </em>141 <em>N.J.Super. </em>476, 479, 358 A.2d 826 (Ch.Div.1976). Indeed, \u201cit is one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary; but to remember that statutes always have some purpose or object to accomplish, whose sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to their meaning.\u201d <em>Wilde v. Wilde, </em>341 <em>N.J.Super. </em>381, 394, 775 A.2d 535 (App.Div.2001) (quoting <em>Cabell v. Markham, </em>148 F.2d 737, 739 (2d Cir.), <em>aff'd, </em>326 <em>U.S. </em>404, 66 <em>S.Ct. </em>193, 90 <em>L.Ed. </em>165 (1945)).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Here, the terms \u201cabandoned\u201d and \u201cwillfully forsaking\u201d have been construed in several of our prior decisions concerning <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1. \u201cThere is a long-standing canon of statutory construction that presumes that the Legislature is knowledgeable regarding the judicial interpretation of its enactments.\u201d <em>Coyle v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>260, 267, 787 A.2d 881 (2002) (citing <em>State v. Burford, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>16, 20, 746 A.2d 998 (2000)). Therefore, these decisions, rather than a dictionary definition of one of the statute\u2019s terms, would most likely have guided the Legislature in its enactment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">None of our prior cases have interpreted the language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1(b)(l). However, as already noted, the terms of that statute are almost identical to those used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1. Both statutes state that abandonment can occur when a parent willfully forsakes his or her child. Thus, eases interpreting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1 are particularly relevant to our current analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">The leading case construing the terms of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1 is <em>Lavigne v. Family &amp; Children\u2019s Soc\u2019y, </em>11 <em>N.J. </em>473, 95 A.2d 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>(1953). In that ease, the parents took their seven-month old child to a child adoption agency, which agreed to place her in a temporary foster home. <em>Id. </em>at 475-76, 95 A.2d 6. Eventually, the parents \u201cexecuted a formal surrender and consent to\u201d the child\u2019s adoption. <em>Id. </em>at 476, 95 A.2d 6. Fourteen months later, the father attempted to have the child returned to him. <em>Id. </em>at 478, 95 A.2d 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">On these facts, the Court found \u201cthat the actions of the [parents] constitute[d] an abandonment of their child under\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1. <em>Id. </em>at 480, 95 A.2d 6. In defining the word \u201cabandonment,\u201d the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">The statutory notion of abandonment does not necessarily, we think, imply that the parent has deserted the child, or even ceased to feel any concern for its interests. It fairly may, and in our judgment does, import any conduct on the part of the parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\"><em>[Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Winans v. Luppie, </em>47 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>302, 304, 20 A. 969 (E. &amp; A. 1890)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">The Court also emphasized that the parent\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d to abandon the child must be \u201cclearly manifested[.]\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Winans, supra, </em>47 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>at 304, 20 A. 969). In that same vein, we defined the term \u201cforsaking\u201d as used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1 as a \u201cpermanent giving up or relinquishment of the child.\u201d <em>State v. N.I., </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>299, 312, 793 A.2d 760 (App.Div.2002).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he word willfully used in conjunction with forsaking ... \u2018means intentionally or purposely <em>as distinguished from inadvertently or accidentally.\u2019\u201d Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>State v. Burden, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>424, 427, 315 A.2d 43 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>282, 321 A.2d 243 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">After carefully reviewing these precedents and distilling them to their essence, we hold that, in order for a court to conclude that a parent has \u201cabandoned\u201d his or her child \u201cby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>willfully forsaking\u201d him or her under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5\u201414.1(b)(1), the court must find that the parent, through his or her unambiguous and intentional conduct, has clearly manifested a settled purpose to <em>permanently </em>forego <em>all </em>parental duties and relinquish <em>all </em>parental claims to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The Legislature did not specify what standard of proof should apply under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5\u201414.1(b)(1) when a party seeks to bar a parent from succeeding to a child\u2019s estate, and the trial judge did not address this issue. It appears the judge applied the preponderance of the evidence standard normally applied in civil cases. <em>See State v. Seven Thousand Dollars, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>223, 238, 642 A.2d 967 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Fisher argues that a clear and convincing evidence standard should have been used because that is the standard applied in termination of parental rights cases. <em>See N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. A.L., </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>1, 25, 59 A.3d 576 (2013). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">In a termination of parental rights case, \u201c[t]he burden rests on the party seeking to terminate parental rights \u2018to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence\u2019 that risk of \u2018serious and lasting [future] harm to the child\u2019 is sufficiently great as to require severance of parental ties.\u201d <em>In re Adoption of a Child by W.P. &amp; M.P., </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>376, 383, 706 A.2d 198 (App.Div.1998) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>In re Guardianship of J.C., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>1, 10, 608 A.2d 1312 (1992)). The question for the court \u201cfocuses upon what course serves the \u2018best interests\u2019 of the child.\u201d <em>W.P. &amp; M.P., supra, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 383, 706 A.2d 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">On the other hand, in a proceeding under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1, the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the child are not at issue; the only question is whether a parent may share in the child\u2019s financial estate. Therefore, we reject Fisher\u2019s argument that the termination of parental rights standard of proof should be applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>In so ruling, we recognize that the clear and convincing evidence standard is often used to determine issues involving will contests. Thus, for example, the burden of establishing lack of testamentary capacity is on the one who contests the will being offered for probate. This \u201cburden must be sustained by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Hoover, </em>21 <em>N.J.Super. </em>323, 325, 91 A.2d 155 (App.Div.1952), <em>certif. denied, </em>11 <em>N.J. </em>211, 93 A.2d 819 (1953). We also note that a provision in the Uniform Probate Code, that has not been adopted by our Legislature, bars a parent from inheriting from their child if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">the child dies before reaching [18] years of age and there is clear and convincing evidence that immediately before the child\u2019s death the parental rights of the parent could have been terminated under law of this state other than this [code] on the basis of nonsupport, abandonment, abuse, neglect, or other actions or inactions of the parent toward the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\"><em>[Unif. Probate Code </em>\u00a7 2-114 (amended 2010), 1 <em>U.L.A. </em>118 (2013).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">However, we presume that the Legislature was aware of these precedents when it enacted <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1 and nevertheless chose not to specifically impose a clear and convincing evidence burden of proof. <em>See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Land, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>163, 178, 892 A.2d 1240 (2006) (noting \u201cthat the Legislature is well aware of its ability to impose a higher standard of proof when it so desires\u201d). When, as here, the Legislature does not designate the standard of proof to be applied in a civil case, it is reasonable to conclude that the \u201cabsence of an evidentiary standard indicates that a preponderance of the evidence\u2014the traditional, default standard\u2014applies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179, 892 A.2d 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Moreover, we have determined that the Legislature intended to import the standard for determining \u201cabandonment\u201d that applies in eases arising under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-1 into <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1(b)(1). It is well established that the burden of proof in abandonment cases under Title 9 is the preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6\u20148.46(b)(1). That standard is therefore the most appropriate to use in cases arising under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Applying these standards to the facts of this case, we conclude that the evidence presented to the trial court did not preponderate in favor of a finding that Fisher \u201cabandoned\u201d his son by \u201cwillfully forsaking him.\u201d To be sure, Fisher did not take the actions necessary to enable him to have parenting time with Michael after Nees obtained the FRO against him. He did not submit to a risk assessment or counseling as ordered by the judge in the parties\u2019 divorce action. As a result, Fisher did not have parenting time with Michael for the period between the court\u2019s January 29, 2002 order suspending visitation and the date of Michael\u2019s death in September 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The judge in this case focused almost solely on these actions in determining that Fisher \u201cabandoned\u201d his son. The judge found that Fisher\u2019s actions \u201cwere unequivocally intentional rather than accidental or involuntary.\u201d However, that is only part of the test under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5\u201414.1(b)(1). As we hold in this opinion, the issue is whether Fisher clearly manifested a settled purpose to <em>permanently </em>forego <em>all </em>parental duties and relinquish <em>all </em>parental claims to the child. That purpose was not demonstrated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">As the judge specifically stated, \u201c[t]he court does not question that [Fisher] cared for his son\u201d and did not \u201cmean to imply that it was his purpose or specific intent to abandon him.\u201d The judge subsequently observed that \u201cit may not have been [Fisher\u2019s] specific intent or purpose to abandon his son.\u201d However, without that settled \u201cpurpose\u201d or \u201cspecific intent,\u201d there can be no abandonment or willful forsaking of a child. <em>Lavigne, supra, </em>11 <em>N.J. </em>at 480, 95 A.2d 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The judge ignored facts in the record which demonstrated that, in spite of his repeated failure to take steps to restore parenting time with his son, Fisher never acted with the settled purpose to permanently forego all of his parental duties or relinquish all parental claims to Michael. For example, Fisher certified, without contradiction, that during the divorce proceedings, he was presented with an offer that, if he agreed to give up his rights to the child, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Nees would not seek child support. Fisher rejected this offer out of hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The record also demonstrates that Fisher paid child support for Michael throughout the child\u2019s life. At oral argument before us, the parties estimated that Fisher\u2019s total child support obligation for the period between the parties\u2019 March 2002 divorce and the court\u2019s July 2010 order terminating the support obligation due to Fisher\u2019s extremely poor health was approximately $37,000. Although Fisher was approximately $10,000 in arrears at the time of the July 2010 order, he had still paid more than two-thirds of the total amount due.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">We do not view Fisher\u2019s May 2010 motion to reduce or terminate his child support obligation as evidence of a settled purpose on his part to <em>permanently </em>forego all parental duties and claims to his child. Child \u201csupport orders define only the present obligations of the former spouses. Those duties are always subject to review and modification on a showing of \u2018changed circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lepis v. Lepis, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>139, 146, 416 A.2d 45 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">In his motion, Fisher stated that his \u201csupport would never have stopped if not for [his] illness\u201d and, based upon the proofs submitted, the motion judge determined that Fisher\u2019s \u201ccircumstances have changed so that the current child support order is no longer feasible.\u201d Nevertheless, Fisher remained obligated to pay the existing arrears, and he continued to do so even after Michael\u2019s death. Fisher also did not oppose Nees\u2019 motion to reinstate child support if Fisher were able to obtain Social Security Disability benefits. Under these circumstances, we are unable to conclude that Fisher intended to permanently abandon Michael when he filed this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">The trial judge was critical of Fisher because the child support payments were made by way of wage garnishment. The judge therefore concluded that Fisher \u201cfailed to voluntarily comply with his child support obligations____\u201d However, the preferred method of paying child support is by way of wage garnishment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A: 17-56.8 provides that a child support order \u201cshall be paid by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>income withholding unless the order ... specifically provides for an alternative payment arrangement to which the parties agree in writing or [one of the parties] demonstrates and the court finds good cause for establishing an alternative arrangement.\u201d <em>See also R. </em>5:7-4A(a). Moreover, the parties agreed in the FJOD that child support should \u201cbe paid via income withholding through the ... Probation Department____\u201d Thus, this is not a case where a parent has willfully withheld all support from a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Although Fisher did not have parenting time with Michael after 2002, he did see and speak to the child on one occasion in violation of the FRO. Fisher also made contact with his son on Facebook a few months before his death. He returned to New Jersey to attend Michael\u2019s funeral. These actions are not consistent with those of a parent whose \u201csettled purpose\u201d was to permanently forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to his child.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Under these circumstances, we conclude that Nees did not demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that Fisher \u201cabandoned\u201d his son \u201cby willfully forsaking\u201d him. Therefore, the exception to intestate succession set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:5-14.1(b)(1) should not have been invoked in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-10\"> According to Nees\u2019s certification, the separation was prompted by Fisher\u2019s December 2000 arrest for peering into the window of a dwelling, which resulted in his indictment for fourth-degree criminal trespass, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-3(c). Fisher had previously been arrested in April 1996 for lewdness, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4, and, in November 1999, for another incident of peering into the window of a dwelling, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-3(c).
