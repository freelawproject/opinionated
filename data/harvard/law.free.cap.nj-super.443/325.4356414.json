On appeal, appellants contend that the examination requirement is inconsistent with the New Jersey Maritime Pilot and Docking Act (Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12:8-1 to -53, which has no examination requirement for docking pilot apprentices, contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent to omit such a requirement, and transgresses the Commission\u2019s enabling legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Alternatively, appellants contend that the examination requirement is arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable because the regulation fails to articulate clear regulatory standards. We reject all contentions and hold that the regulation is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">We begin with a review of the relevant authority. The Act governs two categories of pilots: maritime pilots, who pilot vessels in pilotage waters,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12:8-1.2; and docking pilots, who dock or undock vessels; navigate vessels within the harbor to and from anchorages or berths; navigate vessels entering the Port of New York and New Jersey upon relieving the maritime pilot; and navigate vessels departing the port until relieved by the maritime pilot. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12:8-53(a)(1)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>The State did not regulate docking pilots prior to enacting the Act in 2004. <em>See L. </em>1837, c. 61 (regulating maritime pilots). In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the Legislature found and declared that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">The State of New Jersey has responsibility for port security in the Port of New York and New Jersey and, pursuant to federal law, has the right and responsibility to regulate maritime pilotage in the port.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">Although efforts have been made to enhance the defense of the New York and New Jersey port area from terrorist attacks and to implement improved immigration and customs procedures, modernization and clarification of New Jersey\u2019s laws relating to those who pilot and dock foreign and domestic vessels have not yet occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">\n<em>There is a need to provide for a system that will ensure the proper and consistent identification, training, selection, oversight and monitoring of both maritime pilots and docking pilots.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>12:8-1.1(a), (c) and (d) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">The Legislature also declared it was in the public interest \u201cto modernize, clarify, revise and expand New Jersey\u2019s maritime pilotage laws, and to strengthen the New Jersey pilotage [C]om-mission by expanding its powers and duties and clarifying that docking pilots are under its jurisdiction[,]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12:8-1.1(e), and \u201cthat the [Cjommission be charged with the concurrent responsibility to ensure the safe operation and navigation of vessels, to protect the environment and enhance the economic viability of the port.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12:8-1.1\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">In accordance with this legislative intent, the Legislature granted the Commission regulatory authority over maritime pilots, docking pilots and maritime and docking pilot apprentices. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>12:8-1 to -53.

The program requires a maritime pilot apprentice to complete a four-year apprenticeship, during which the apprentice must satisfy the requirements set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:64-2.3 and -2.4. After completing those requirements, the apprentice must take and pass a written examination prescribed by the Commission, which \u201cshall test the apprentice\u2019s qualifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>tions for employment as a maritime pilot and knowledge of pilotage routes.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:64-2.7(a).

A 2009 amendment required apprentices to achieve a passing grade of \u201c70 percent on all written sections, except Rules of the Road,[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] which shall be 90 percent. Any charts drawn by the apprentice shall be graded on a pass/fail basis.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:64-9.4(e).

The Commission notified Harris that the examination</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">includes five modules covering the following areas:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">I. Laws and Regulations of the Commission and the United States Coast Guard</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">II.

Practical Piloting</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">In March 2014, the Commission appointed Harris as a docking pilot apprentice. He declined to take the examination and instead, he and McAllister filed the present appeal. On appeal, they do not contend that some of the requirements in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:64-9.4 exceed the requirements in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12:8-51. Rather, they parse-out subsection (d), contending that because the Act only requires an examination for maritime pilot apprentices, the examination requirement for docking pilot apprentices is contrary to the Act, contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent to omit such an examination requirement, and transgresses the Commission\u2019s enabling legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Alternatively, Harris and McAllister contend that the examination requirement is arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable because the regulation fails to articulate regulatory standards related to the examination requirements for docking pilot apprentices. They argue that the Commission improperly vested itself with the discretion to determine the content and administration of such examination without substantive guidance in the regulations to ensure that the examination is consistent with the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u201cAgency regulations are accorded a presumption of validity and reasonableness.\u201d <em>In re N.J.A.C. 7:1B-1.1, </em>431 <em>N.J.Super. </em>100, 114, 67 A.3d 621 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>8, 75 A.3d 1162 (2013). \u201cAlthough not bound by an agency\u2019s determination on a question of law, [we] give great deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of statutes within its scope of authority and its adoption of rules implementing the laws for which it is responsible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114-15, 67 A.3d 621 (citations omitted); <em>see also In re Freshwater Wetlands Prot.

As we have explained, the \u201cdeference [we afford to agencies] does not require abdication by the judiciary of its function to assure that agency rulemaking conforms with basic tenets of due process, and provides standards to guide both the regulator and the regulated.\u201d Id. at 236, 553 A.2d 798. Applying all of the above standards, we discern no reason to invalidate <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:64-9.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Here, the Legislature found and declared there was a need to provide a system that will ensure the proper and consistent training, selection, oversight and monitoring of docking pilots. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12:8\u20141.1(d).

Given the breadth of the discretion the Legislature afforded the Commission, we conclude that the examination requirement fell well within the substantive authority vested in the Commission to ensure that docking pilot apprentices have been properly trained and can safely operate and navigate vessels in the New York and New Jersey port area. The examination requirement is consistent with and achieves the express legislative policies and overall objective underlying the Act to provide a system for the proper training of docking pilots.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>In addition, the docking pilot regulations as a whole provide sufficient regulatory standards that inform the public and docking pilot apprentices of the content of the docking pilot apprentice examination. First, to be considered for a docketing pilot apprenticeship, the candidate must provide proof of licensure by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) \u201cauthorizing the piloting of vessels of any tonnage and endorsed for at least one section of the waters for which pilotage service may be required[.]\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:64-9.3(b)(12).
