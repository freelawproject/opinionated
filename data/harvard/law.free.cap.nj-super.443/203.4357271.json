Plaintiff also appeals from the trial court\u2019s October 17, 2014 order denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">However, plaintiff does not challenge the propriety of the dismissal of his action. Instead, plaintiff states that he is dissatisfied with dictum in the trial judge\u2019s written decision and has filed a notice of appeal for the sole purpose of asking this court to redact the dictum from the trial court\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because our jurisdiction is limited to appeals taken from judgments and not from opinions or dicta of a trial court, we dismiss plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>We derive the following facts and procedural history from the record on appeal. In a separate action (the collection action),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> plaintiff obtained an August 1, 2012 default judgment in the sum of $54,159.13 against Evelyn Melillo, who is defendant\u2019s former spouse.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff was unable to collect the judgment from Evelyn. Asserting that defendant might have information concerning Evelyn\u2019s financial assets, plaintiff served a notice of deposition upon defendant in the collection action. Defendant failed to appear for the deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">On January 6, 2014, the trial court granted plaintiffs application for an order compelling defendant to appear at a January 30, 2014 deposition and to produce documents requested by plaintiff. Defendant did not appear at this deposition and did not produce the requested documents. Plaintiff filed a motion asserting that defendant had \u201cviolated plaintiffs rights as a litigant\u201d and demanding that he be arrested. On March 24, 2014, the court ordered defendant to attend a deposition scheduled for April 21, 2014, and produce the requested documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">On April 17, 2014, however, Evelyn filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. By this time, the collection action had been reassigned to Judge Allen J. Littlefield, J.S.C. On April 21, 2014, Judge Little-field issued an order stating that, because Evelyn had filed a bankruptcy petition, plaintiffs claims against her in the collection action were dismissed without prejudice until the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings or the entry of an order by the bankruptcy court granting relief from the automatic stay under 11 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 362(d). Defendant appeared for the deposition on April 21, 2014, but advised plaintiff that he would not respond to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>questions or provide any documents because all collection proceedings against Evelyn had been stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Rather than filing another enforcement motion against defendant in the collection action or, if necessary, seeking relief from the stay in the bankruptcy court, plaintiff instituted a separate action against defendant on May 28, 2014.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In his complaint, plaintiff alleged defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the discovery orders in the collection action made his judgment against Evelyn \u201cuncollectible.\u201d As a result, plaintiff asserted that defendant was now responsible for paying the entire judgment, together with other damages and costs. Defendant filed an answer and a counterclaim. Plaintiff filed a motion to strike defendant\u2019s pleadings, and defendant responded by filing a cross-motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Following oral argument, Judge Littlefield denied plaintiffs motion to strike defendant\u2019s pleadings, re-designated defendant\u2019s counterclaim as a defense, and granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In a thorough written opinion, the judge ruled that when defendant failed to comply with the discovery orders after Evelyn filed for bankruptcy, plaintiffs sole recourse was to file an appropriate enforcement motion in the collection action, rather than filing a new, separate action seeking damages from defendant. Judge Littlefield explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">Regardless of whether [defendant was or was not required to appear for the various depositions, the failure of a non-party to appear for a deposition, even a court[-] ordered deposition, is not an independent cause of action. The procedures set forth by the Rules of Court provide an aggrieved party sufficient avenues for relief [through] means of motions to enforce litigant\u2019s rights and various forms of contempt of [c]ourt. In sum, New Jersey law does not recognize an independent cause of action for a [non-party\u2019s] non-compliance with discovery requests aimed at collecting a judgment as [pled] by ... plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Accordingly, Judge Littlefield entered an order on August 28, 2014 dismissing plaintiffs \u201cclaim\u201d with prejudice. On October 17, 2014, the judge partially granted plaintiffs motion for reconsidera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>tion and issued a corrected order stating that plaintiffs \u201ccomplaint is [dismissed] with prejudice for the reasons expressed in the [c]ourt\u2019s memorandum decision dated August 28, 2014. This [ojrder is not intended to bar any party from seeking any relief in the underlying matter of <em>Bandler v. [Evelyn] Melillo, </em>[the collection action].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">On appeal, plaintiff does not challenge the August 28, 2014 and October 17, 2014 orders dismissing his complaint against defendant with prejudice. However, plaintiff complains that, in the judge\u2019s written opinion addressing the contentions raised by the parties concerning defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the judge discussed defendant\u2019s argument that the automatic stay in the bankruptcy action excused his failure to comply with the discovery orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">In his decision, the judge initially observed that defendant was not required to appear for the April 21, 2014 deposition because the filing of Evelyn\u2019s bankruptcy petition \u201cstayed the proceedings in that matter including any and all efforts to collect the judgment against Evelyn Melillo. Collection efforts included deposing [d]efendant[,] and thus, the deposition was similarly stayed.\u201d Plaintiff alleged at oral argument that he was not going to ask defendant any questions at the deposition about Evelyn\u2019s assets but, rather, only planned to seek information that might support plaintiffs \u201cpotential claim\u201d against defendant \u201cfor his failure to appear at the prior depositions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The judge rejected plaintiffs argument because \u201c[r]egardless of whether [defendant was or was not required to appear for the various depositions,\u201d plaintiff could not bring an independent cause of action against defendant for failure to appear. Therefore, plaintiffs complaint against defendant had to be dismissed. Accordingly, the judge again stated that plaintiff should have filed an enforcement motion against defendant in the collection action. The judge noted that \u201cthere still remains a question as to whether or not the filing of said motion would violate the automatic stay.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>However, the judge stated that he was not going to render an advisory opinion on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration. He did not contest the order dismissing his complaint. However, plaintiff demanded that the judge redact the portion of his August 28, 2014 written opinion relating to the bankruptcy stay because plaintiff believed it was dictum and not necessary to support the judge\u2019s ultimate decision to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Following oral argument on October 17, 2014, Judge Littlefield denied this request. The judge found that, because plaintiff had made arguments concerning the effects of the automatic stay on his collection efforts, the court was obligated to address them. The judge again stated that he was not going to issue an advisory opinion as to the impact of the automatic stay on any future motion by plaintiff to enforce the discovery orders against defendant in the collection action. As noted above, the judge also corrected the August 28, 2014 order to make clear that no party was barred \u201cfrom seeking any relief\u2019 in the collection action. The judge did not mention the bankruptcy proceedings in the August 28,2014 and October 17, 2014 orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">This appeal followed. On appeal, plaintiffs only arguments relate to his contention that the judge should not have included a discussion of the automatic stay in his August 28, 2014 written decision. Plaintiff argues that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s gratis dictum is unnecessary and may cloud future proceedings\u201d and that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s dictum is mistaken and in contradiction to the trial court\u2019s own order.\u201d However, plaintiff does not appeal from the August 28, 2014 and October 17, 2014 orders dismissing his complaint. Under these circumstances, we are compelled to dismiss plaintiffs appeal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">It is well established that \u201cbecause an appeal questions the propriety of <em>action </em>[in the trial court], the rationale underlying the action is not independently appealable.\u201d <em>Price v. Hudson Heights Dev., LLC, </em>417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>462, 467, 10 A.3d 232 (App.Div.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>2011) (citing Mandel, <em>New Jersey Appellate Practice, </em>ch. 2:4-2 (2010)). Therefore, a party may challenge only the propriety of the judgment entered by the trial court, not the reasoning underlying the court\u2019s decision. <em>Do-Wop Corp. v. City of Rahway, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>191, 199, 773 A.2d 706 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In other words, \u201ca party satisfied with or not aggrieved by an action may not complain on appeal about the reasons cited for the action.\u201d Mandel, <em>New Jersey Appellate Practice, </em>ch. 2:4-2 (2016). This rule applies even if the trial court's reasoning is incorrect. <em>See Isko v. Planning Bd. of Livingston, </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>162, 175, 238 A.2d 457 (1968) (\u201cIt is a commonplace of appellate review that if the order of the lower tribunal is valid, the fact that it was predicated upon an incorrect basis will not stand in the way of its affirmance.\u201d), <em>abrogated on other grounds, Commercial Realty &amp; Res. Corp. v. First Atl. Props. Co., </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>546, 585 A.2d 928 (1991). Thus, contrary to the arguments raised by appellant on appeal, a party may not parse through the opinion of a trial judge and take an appeal from words, sentences, or sections of the opinion that he or she finds \u201cobjectionable\u201d when the party is not asserting that the order or judgment was made in error. <em>See Arons v. N.J. Network, </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>168, 181, 775 A.2d 778 (App.Div.) (rejecting plaintiffs complaints concerning \u201cthe quality of the letter opinion provided by the trial court\u201d because \u201cappeals are taken from judgments, not opinions\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>388, 788 A.2d 772 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">This rule is particularly apt in a case where, as here, the appellant is challenging dicta contained in the trial court\u2019s opinion. <em>See Glaser v. Downes, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>10, 16, 312 A.2d 654 (App.Div.1973) (holding that \u201cappeals are taken from judgments and not from opinions, let alone dicta\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>513, 317 A.2d 726 (1974). Dictum is a statement by a judge \u201cnot necessary to the decision then being made[,]\u201d and \u201cas such it is entitled to due consideration but does not invoke the principle of <em>stare decisis.\u201d Jamouneau v. Div. of Tax Appeals, </em>2 <em>N.J. </em>325, 332, 66 A.2d 534 (1949). \u201c[Pjortions of an opinion that are dicta <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>are not binding.\u201d <em>Nat'l Mortg. Co. v. Syriaque, </em>293 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 554, 681 A.2d 1232 (Ch.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Because the parties both broached the subject of the impact of the automatic stay on the pending proceedings, Judge Littlefield prudently discussed the parties\u2019 respective positions in his thorough opinion. However, as the judge made clear, the issue of whether the automatic stay imposed as the result of the Evelyn\u2019s bankruptcy action would prevent plaintiff from filing an enforcement motion against defendant in the collection action was not before him when he considered defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Therefore, the judge properly concluded that he would not render an advisory opinion on the issue. <em>See State v. Rose, </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>141, 189, 19 A.3d 985 (2011) (\u201cThe notion that a court of appeals willy-nilly can decide issues unnecessary to the outcome of the case results in the wholesale issuance of advisory opinions, a practice our judicial decision-making system categorically rejects.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Instead, the judge dismissed plaintiffs complaint against defendant because, as we noted, he concluded that \u201cthe failure of a non-party to appear for a deposition, even a court[-]ordered deposition, is not an independent cause of action.\u201d Plaintiff has not challenged that ruling on appeal. Thus, we have no jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs complaints concerning the dictum in the opinion related to the bankruptcy proceedings. <em>See Glaser, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 16, 312 A.2d 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">We also do not have jurisdiction to consider the October 17, 2014 order denying plaintiffs motion for reconsideration. Again, plaintiffs arguments concerning that order are limited to his assertion that the judge should have redacted the discussion of the bankruptcy proceedings from his earlier written opinion. However, \u201c[tjhis position as a basis for reconsideration is completely unsupported by legal authority.\u201d <em>Amerada Hess Corp. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>7 <em>N.J.Tax </em>275, 280-81 (Tax Ct.1985) (concluding that a plaintiffs \u201cdissatisfaction with the [trial] judge\u2019s written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>opinion!,]\u201d but not with \u201cthe judge\u2019s conclusion and final judgment!,]\u201d does not warrant reconsideration of the judge\u2019s order).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Accordingly, we dismiss plaintiffs appeal from the August 28, 2014 and October 17, 2014 orders for want of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-11\"> When the trial court denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration, it also denied his request to redact the dictum from its earlier opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b236-7\"> Docket No. L-1859-12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b236-8\"> Defendant and Evelyn divorced in February 2005.
