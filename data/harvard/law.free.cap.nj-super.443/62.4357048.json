New Jersey Association of Realtor Boards, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>470, 461 A.2d 1112 (1983), <em>mod., </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>449, 467 A.2d 577 (1983), and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:5-6.2(g)(2). Plaintiffs challenged the seller\u2019s termination, and appeal from the summary judgment order of the General Equity Part dismissing their complaint to enforce the sale agreement. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The facts are undisputed. On January 12, 2014, plaintiffs Michael Conley, Jr. and Katie M. Maurer signed a form contract to purchase a condominium unit in Bernards Township that defendant Mona Guerrero had offered for sale. The contract price was $292,000, and plaintiffs paid a $1000 deposit. Guerrero signed the contract two days later, and the executed contract was delivered on Wednesday, January 15, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The Guerrero-to-Conley<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contract included the standard attorney review provision, which provides that notice of disapproval must be sent to the realtor by \u201ccertified mail, by telegram or by delivering it personally.\u201d It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">The Buyer or the Seller may choose to have an attorney study this Contract. If any attorney is consulted, the attorney must complete his or her review of the Contract within the three-day period. This Contract will be legally binding at the end of this three-day period unless an attorney for the Buyer or the Seller reviews and disapproves of the Contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">If an attorney for the Buyer or the Seller reviews and disapproves of the Contract, the attorney must notify the REALTOR(S) and the other party named in this Contract within the three-day period. Otherwise this Contract will be legally binding as written. The attorney must send the notice of disapproval to the REALTOR(S) by certified mail, by telegram or by delivering it personally. The telegram or certified letter will be effective upon sending. The personal delivery will be effective upon delivery to the REALTOR\u2019S office. The attorney may also, but need not, inform the REALTOR(S) of any suggested revision(s) in the Contract that would make it satisfactory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">As a result of a three-day weekend, the attorney review period extended to Tuesday, January 21, 2014. Weichert Realtors, through its \u201cauthorized representative[ ],\u201d served as a disclosed dual agent on the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">After the agreement was executed, Guerrero\u2019s agent received competing offers to purchase the property. Plaintiffs were aware of this. They sent a handwritten note to Guerrero, describing their personal circumstances, and their desire for the house. The note stated, \u201cI hope that we are able to come to an agreement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>works for both sides.\u201d On or about January 15, plaintiffs increased their offer to $298,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Meanwhile, defendants Brian Kraminitz and Michele Tanzi offered to pay $307,500, as reflected in an agreement they and Guerrero signed on January 16, 2014. The attorneys for Guerrero, and Kraminitz and Tanzi, negotiated various modifications to the contract, which the attorneys deemed binding on January 20, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">On January 16, 2014, the Weiehert agent asked Guerrero\u2019s attorney, Martin D. Eagan, to transmit a disapproval of the Guerrero-to-Conley contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On January 20, 2014, an attorney in Eagan\u2019s office by letter advised plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, William Kearns, that the Guerrero-to-Conley agreement was terminated, stating, \u201cThis will confirm that the above-referenced contract has been terminated by the seller and the realtors are hereby authorized to release the initial deposit monies to the buyers.\u201d The letter was sent by email and facsimile to Kearns; the agent at Weiehert was \u201ccc\u2019d\u201d on the email. It was undisputed that Kearns and the agent received the letter on January 20, 2014. Plaintiffs do not deny that they also received notice of the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">On January 23, 2014, Kearns faxed a letter to Eagan asserting that the Guerrero-to-Conley contract was in \u201cfull force and effect\u201d because \u201cthe 3 days within which an attorney may terminate this contract has expired.\u201d Eagan and Kearns then exchanged emails disputing the effectiveness of the January 20, 2014 notice. Plaintiffs filed a verified complaint and proposed order to show cause, seeking specific performance of the Guerrero-to-Conley contract and other relief. Plaintiffs included Kraminitz and Tanzi as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Plaintiffs argued that the January 20 termination was ineffective because it was not sent in accord with the contract\u2019s attorney review provision. Kearns, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, admitted: \u201cMy clients ... were informed that their contract would be cancelled as other offers were being received after their initial offer was made and accepted, and a valid and binding contract executed, subject to attorney review.\u201d However, he asserted that plaintiffs, in making an increased offer, did not \u201crescind or abandon their contract, but were merely offering to create a new contract when and if their contract was cancelled or disapproved.\u201d Eagan, Guerrero\u2019s counsel, asserted \u201cit has become the standard and customary practice in residential real estate transactions to use email and facsimile notification at the time of contract disapproval in lieu of a certified mailing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Judge Edward M. Coleman denied temporary injunctive relief. As the facts were undisputed, Guerrero and plaintiffs filed competing motions for summary judgment. In a cogent written opinion, Judge Coleman granted defendants\u2019 motion, dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. Judge Coleman noted that the attorney review provision requires notice of disapproval to the broker and the other party, but specifies the method of delivery only as it relates to the notice to the broker. He discussed the history and purpose of the provision, citing <em>N.J. State Bar Ass\u2019n v. N.J. Ass\u2019n of Realtor Bds., </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>470, 461 A.2d 1112 (1983). Judge Coleman then analyzed three eases that construed the <em>provision\u2014Kutzin v. Pimie, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>500, 591 A.2d 932 (1991); <em>Romano v. Chapman, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>48, 816 A.2d 1080 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>431, 824 A.2d 159 (2003); and <em>Gaglia v. Kirchner, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>292, 721 A.2d 1028 (App.Div.1999)\u2014and found that none controlled the parties\u2019 dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Judge Coleman noted that <em>Kutzin </em>held a contract was not effectively rescinded where the attorneys for buyer and seller discussed modifications to the contract, but \u201cthere was no evidence of any form of specific disapproval within the review period.\u201d <em>See </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>at 507-08, 591 A.2d 932. Unlike in the instant ease, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>notice came only after the review period had expired. <em>Id. </em>at 505, 591 A.2d 932. Judge Coleman also discussed <em>Romano, </em>where we held that once the attorneys approved an agreement during the attorney review period\u2014which did not occur here\u2014a party may not terminate, even if the period was unexpired. 358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 56-57, 816 A.2d 1080.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Finally, Judge Coleman discussed <em>Gaglia, </em>which addressed an attempt by the buyer to enforce a contract by alleging that his own notice of disapproval was ineffective because it was sent by fax and ordinary mail, and only to sellers\u2019 counsel. <em>See </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 298, 721 A.2d 1028. Judge Coleman noted that Gaglia was denied relief because he was not permitted to rely on his own counsel\u2019s deviations from the mandated procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Judge Coleman recognized that generally, clear and unambiguous contract provisions must be enforced as written, citing <em>Levison v. Weintraub, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>273, 276, 521 A.2d 909 (App.Div.1987). However, the judge wrote, \u201c[T]his is a [cjourt of equity in which we are permitted to apply substance over form,\u201d citing <em>Applestein v. United Bd. &amp; Carton Corp., </em>60 <em>N.J.Super. </em>333, 348, 159 A.2d 146 (Ch.Div.1960). The judge continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">The purpose of the attorney review clause approved within the settlement in <em>Bar Ass\u2019n II, </em>was to \u201cprotect parties against being bound by broker-prepared contracts without the opportunity to obtain adequate protection of their separate interests.\u201d <em>Levison, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 277, 521 A.2d 909. It is undisputed that all parties to this transaction were represented by counsel and counsel were actually consulted, thus the underlying justification for the attorney review clause itself was satisfied. Further, Guerrero\u2019s breach was minor as it is further undisputed that Plaintiffs\u2019 were on actual notice of Guerrero\u2019s termination within the three-day period for attorney review. The essential purpose of the notice provision is to ensure actual notice and that was accomplished here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">This appeal followed. Plaintiffs argue that Guerrero was required to strictly adhere to the contractual provision specifying the methods of delivery. Defendants and amicus curiae, the New Jersey State Bar Association, generally respond that the termination notice in this case substantially complied with the contract and that actual notice was accomplished, thereby satisfying the underlying purpose of the notice provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">We review the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Henry v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>320, 330, 9 A.3d 882 (2010). We conclude, as did Judge Coleman, that defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s disapproval of the contract was effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Notice of disapproval must be sent to both the other contracting party and that party\u2019s real estate agent. <em>See N.J. State Bar Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 476, 461 A.2d 1112. In the original settlement between the State Bar and the New Jersey Association of Realtor Boards, notice was to be provided only to the real estate professional; however, the Court modified the agreement to require notice to the contracting parties. <em>Compare N.J. State Bar Ass\u2019n v. N.J. Ass\u2019n of Realtor Bds., </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>391, 395, 452 A.2d 1323 (Ch.Div.1982) (describing notice only to broker), with <em>N.J. State Bar Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 477, 461 A.2d 1112 (language as modified by the Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The contract prescribes the method of delivery only for notice to the agent. Any form of actual notice suffices as pertains to the buyer. Based on the history of the provision, the method-of-delivery provision was apparently designed to protect the interests of the real estate professionals, not the contracting parties. <em>See Peterson v. Pursell, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>268, 276, 771 A.2d 666 (App.Div.2001) (noting that the interests of the broker and the party \u201cmay not be congruent\u201d); <em>Denesevich v. Moran, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>554, 557, 512 A.2d 505 (App.Div.1986) (declining to treat the broker as a \u201cfiduciary so as to impute notice to the party\u201d in part because \u201ca broker\u2019s role is to bring the parties together and act as a conduit for negotiations\u201d). By contrast, the three-day-review itself was designed to protect parties from being bound by realtor-prepared contracts, without the benefit of legal counsel. <em>Levison, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 276, 521 A.2d 909. This obviously served the interests of the legal profession as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">The method-of-delivery provision, as well as the entire attorney review provision, arose out of a dispute between the bar and the real estate professionals. The provisions are mandated, even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>contracting parties would prefer to waive them. <em>See N.J. State Bar Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 481, 461 A.2d 1112 (enjoining real estate brokers from preparing contracts that would \u201cwaive, disclaim, relinquish or abridge the right of the parties\u201d to attorney review).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">In this case, plaintiffs\u2019 right to notice of disapproval\u2014which is not subject to the method-of-delivery requirements\u2014was satisfied. Instead, plaintiffs seek to enforce the rights of the agent to notice that complies with the method-of-delivery requirements. However, the agent does not complain about the deviation from the prescribed method of delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Even assuming the buyers may enforce the agent\u2019s right to notice by the prescribed method of delivery, there was substantial compliance. Enforcement of the method-of-delivery provision here would result in a forfeiture of Guerrero\u2019s right to disapprove the contract. Given Guerrero\u2019s substantial compliance, that forfeiture should be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">\u201c \u2018To the extent that the non-occurrence of a condition would cause disproportionate forfeiture, a court may excuse the nonoccurrence of that condition unless its occurrence was a material part of the agreed exchange.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gazis v. Miller, </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>59, 65, 874 A.2d 591 (App.Div.2005) (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts, </em>\u00a7 229 (1981)), <em>aff'd, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>224, 892 A.2d 1277 (2006). Disproportionality is a flexible concept; its application rests within the court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts, </em>\u00a7 229 comment b (1981). In determining whether a forfeiture is disproportionate, we weigh the extent of forfeiture against \u201cthe importance to [plaintiffs] of the risk from which [they] sought to be protected and the degree to which that protection will be lost if the non-occurrence of the condition is excused----\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Here, defendant\u2019s right of disapproval was conditioned on notice that complies with the specified methods of delivery. However, compliance with the condition was not a material part of the parties\u2019 agreement; it was imposed upon them by the consent judgment in <em>N.J. State Bar Ass\u2019n. </em>Enforcement of the condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>would cause a forfeiture\u2014'the loss of Guerrero\u2019s right to disapprove the contract and enter into an agreement with others. Applying that balance, the weight of Guerrero\u2019s forfeiture predominates, inasmuch as plaintiffs avoided the result the condition was designed to avoid\u2014lack of actual notice. <em>See Del. Steel Co. v. Calmar S.S. Corp., </em>378 F.2d 386, 387-89 (3d Cir.1967) (stating that \u201cno legitimate interest\u201d of the defendant-carrier would be served and it would \u201cplainly be inequitable\u201d to bar an action of the plaintiff-shipper who failed to timely file a written notice of claim of damage, as required by a bill of lading, where the carrier received written notice that the shipped goods were damaged, the carrier was aware of the damage, and the shipper orally advised the carrier that a damage claim would be made).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Substantial compliance may be more liberally applied in this case because the attorney review provision, in particular the notice requirement, is not the product of an arm\u2019s length agreement of the two contracting parties. Rather, the provisions are imposed upon buyers and sellers by the consent judgment approved by the Court in <em>N.J. State Bar Ass\u2019n, supra. Cf. Corcoran v. St. Peter\u2019s Med. Ctr., </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>337, 343-44, 771 A.2d 707 (App.Div.2001) (applying substantial compliance doctrine to service of a demand for a trial de novo pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(1)); 13 <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 38:12 (Lord ed. 2013) (distinguishing between contractual provisions expressing \u201cthe will of the parties\u201d and conditions \u201cthe law itself had imposed ... in absence of or irrespective of the manifested intention of the parties,\u201d which the court may relax \u201cso as to do justice and avoid hardship.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Our holding that the attorney here effectively terminated the contract by substantially complying with the notice requirement is not inconsistent with previous decisions construing the attorney review provision. Plaintiffs contend that <em>Peterson, supra, </em>compels a result in their favor. We disagree. In <em>Peterson, </em>the buyers alleged that the seller\u2019s termination of the sale agreement was untimely. 339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 271, 771 A.2d 666. We rejected the buyers\u2019 argument that the attorney review period commenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>when the buyers delivered a fully executed purchase agreement to the seller\u2019s broker, and not to the seller. <em>Id. </em>at 273-75, 771 A.2d 666. We held that even if later delivery to the seller\u2019s attorney constituted delivery to the seller\u2014since the seller had directed that the signed contract be delivered to her attorney\u2014the termination was timely made within three days thereafter. <em>Id. </em>at 276-77, 771 A.2d 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">We held that the buyers were required to strictly adhere to the contractual and regulatory language. <em>Id. </em>at 276, 771 A.2d 666. However, we did so because delivery of a signed agreement to the seller\u2019s real estate broker did not achieve the purpose underlying the requirement of delivery to the seller.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">Not only does plaintiffs argument violate the plain language of the attorney review provision, but it ignores the reality of the real estate transaction and, indeed, common sense. A broker\u2019s interest lay solely in negotiating a signed contract and obtaining a commission. [A] broker\u2019s role is to bring the parties together and [to] act as a conduit for negotiations. Its goal is simply to put the deal together. In approving the settlement agreement, the Supreme Court provided for the intervention of an attorney because the interests of the broker and those of a party may not be congruent. To clothe the broker with the attributes of a fiduciary in this context so as to impute delivery to a party by reason of delivery to the broker is unrealistic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\"><em>[Ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">By contrast, undisputed notice to the buyers and their real estate agent in this case achieves the goal of the provision: to accomplish actual notice. We are keenly aware that the actual notice did not avoid a dispute or litigation. But the litigation pertained not to the fact of notice, but to its legal implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">Furthermore, we are not convinced that <em>Kutzin, supra, </em>compels a different result than we reach here. While the Court referenced the disapproving attorney\u2019s failure to comply with the method-of-delivery requirement, its focus was on the failure to disapprove at all. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-11\">To rescind the contract, either party\u2019s attorney would have had to send notice of disapproval during the three-day period to both Weichert and Russo \u201cby certified mail, by telegram, or by delivering it personally.\u201d The record reveals that the only correspondence between the attorneys and the realtors during the three-day period in question was Kozinn\u2019s September 3rd letter to Russo. That letter did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>disapprove of the contract; rather, it stated that \u201cthe * <em>* </em>* contract is satisfactory to me as Attorney for the Seller with the exception that my clients have requested that I hold the deposit pending closing,\u201d an exception that was accepted by both Russo and Maeearone. Moreover, Kozinn did not send the letter by certified mail, nor did he send a copy to Weichert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">[124 <em>N.J. </em>at 507, 591 A.2d 932.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The Court\u2019s holding rested not on the method of delivery, but on the fact that Kozinn\u2019s letters did not disapprove of the agreement. Moreover, the Court did not consider the doctrine of substantial compliance, as it did not need to reach the issue whether delivery was effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Finally, we decline the Bar Association\u2019s invitation to endorse a revision of the current standard language to recognize the advent of modern communication methods such as email and the asserted obsolescence of telegram. (The record includes no competent evidence on the availability or unavailability of telegram carriers.) We acknowledge that the Court in <em>N.J. State Bar Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>did not explain the purpose served by prescribing methods of delivery of a termination notice. However, one purpose of the selected delivery methods is evident: to avoid or limit disputes and litigation over whether actual delivery was accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">A party may prove that he or she has sent notice by certified mail or telegram by resorting to evidence from a third-party\u2014the U.S. Postal Service or a telegram service. Unless the attorney giving notice personally delivers the notice himself or herself, a third person would be involved in personal delivery as well. Also, the drafters of the settlement in <em>N.J. State Bar Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>apparently deemed the three required methods as generally reliable means of accomplishing delivery. Whether email or facsimile can satisfy that apparent purpose, and under what conditions, we leave to others to address.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">We observe that in this case, it was not disputed that actual notice of termination was received by the buyers, their attorney and real estate agent. We do not intend to establish a general rule that delivery to the realtor by email satisfies the prescribed method of delivery. Rather, based on the facts and circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>presented, considered in light of the legal principles we have described, we affirm the trial court\u2019s determination that the notice of disapproval effectively terminated the Guerrero-to-Conley agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-12\"> For convenience, we use only one buyer's name in referring to the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b95-9\"> Defendant asserted that a second Weiehert agent stepped in to represent only Guerrero, because the original Weiehert agent was a dual agent. However, the Guerrero-to-Conley contract identified Weiehert as the dual agent and the named agent as Weiehert's representative. Moreover, the first Weiehert agent, not the second, asked Guerrero's attorney to \"void\" the Guerrero-to-Conley contract, noting she was representing both buyer and seller.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
