Sandra Brust (Brust) was diagnosed with mesothelioma in October 2010, and passed away from the disease while this litigation was pending. Plaintiffs allege Brust\u2019s father John Noga\u2019s employment from 1970 to 1977 as a train operator, yard operator, and supervisor with defendant Port Authority Transit Corporation (PATCO) resulted in take-home asbestos exposure leading to her illness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Noga\u2019s job duties included the repair and maintenance of air brake systems on PATCO\u2019s multiple unit (MU) locomotives.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the process, asbestos dust would then be released into the air and land on his work clothes. Upon returning home, Noga would play with his children, including Brust, who was born May 23, 1963, before changing or showering.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Additionally, plaintiffs claim Brust\u2019s mesothelioma may have been caused by her exposure to asbestos dust as Noga replaced automobile brakes on cars he worked on after hours.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Between 1963 and 1978, when the family moved to Georgia, Noga would buy an average of one used car per year, which he would repair for resale.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">From 1970 to 1985, starting at about age seven, Brust would help her mother wash her father\u2019s clothes, including his PATCO uniform. Brust\u2019s expert opined that she developed mesothelioma as a result of secondary exposure to friable asbestos fibers through direct contact with her father and while laundering his asbestos-laden clothes.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">In deciding the railroad defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, Judge Vincent LeBlon concluded that federal legislation and precedent preempt state tort claims related to locomotives. He rejected plaintiffs\u2019 argument that their claim was exempt from preemption because PATCO was not regulated by federal transportation agencies or regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>As to the automotive defendants, Judge LeBlon found that there was no evidence that Brust\u2019s contacts with automotive brake dust were sufficiently frequent, regular, and proximate to demonstrate causation. Thus, plaintiffs\u2019 proofs did not establish the elements of a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In sum, the judge granted the railroad defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment as a matter of law. He granted summary judgment to the automotive defendants because, even when the facts were viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, no genuine issue of material fact remained which could expose them to any liability. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\"><em>Rule </em>4:46-2(c) provides that summary judgment must be granted \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment ... as a matter of law.\u201d The appropriate inquiry is \u201cwhether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail____\u201d <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 533, 666 A.2d 146 (1995) (quoting <em>Anderson v.

Metro. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins.

The basis for their argument is that PATCO is an urban rapid transit operation, not a railroad, not subject to federal railroad safety regulations or to federal law generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">A brief discussion of the doctrine of preemption is warranted. It arises from the supremacy clause, which states that federal law \u201cshall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d <em>U.S. Const. </em>art. VI, cl. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u201cWhere a state statute conflicts with, or frustrates, federal law, the former must give way.\u201d <em>CSX Tmnsp., Inc. v. Easterwood, </em>507 <em>U.S. </em>658, 663, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>1732, 1737, 123 L.Ed.2d 387, 396 (1993). \u201cThe ultimate question is always whether Congress intended to preempt the subject matter of the state legislation.\u201d <em>Chamber of Commerce v. State, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>131, 142, 445 A.2d 353 (1982); <em>see also Comm. to Recall Robert Menendez from the Office of U.S. Senator v. Wells, </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>79, 103, 7 A.3d 720 (2010) (discussing federal preemption). \u201cCongress may preempt state common law as well as state statutory law through federal legislation.\u201d <em>Dewey v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>69, 77, 577 A.2d 1239 (1990) (citing <em>Chicago N.W. Transp. Co. v.

Congress thereby preempted both state legislation that would affect the design, construction, and material of every part of the locomotive and its appurtenances, <em>Napier v. Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co., </em>272 <em>U.S. </em>605, 611, 47 <em>S.Ct. </em>207, 209, 71 <em>L.Ed. </em>432, 438 (1926), and state law tort claims for defective design of locomotive equipment, Kur<em>ns, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 132 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1265-66, 182 L.Ed.2d at 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">Preemption under the LIA \u201callows railroad carriers to abide by a single set of national equipment regulations, instead of having to meet different standards and, potentially, to change equipment when a train crosses state lines.\u201d <em>Del. &amp; Hudson R.R.

Locomotives are designed to travel long distances, with most railroad routes wending through interstate commerce. The virtue of uniform national regulation \u201cis self-evident: locomotive companies need only concern themselves with one set of equipment regulations and need not be prepared to remove or add equipment as they travel from state to state.\u201d <em>[Law v.

The preempted field is the subject of locomotive equipment, regardless of the entity using it.

The plaintiffs\u2019 defective-design claims were found to fall \u201cwithin the pre-empted field because they would impose state-law requirements on a locomotive\u2019s physical makeup.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 132 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1272, 182 L.Ed.2d at 130 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part).

Under petitioners\u2019 approach, a State could not require <em>railroads </em>to equip their locomotives with parts meeting state-imposed specifications, but could require <em>manufacturers </em>of locomotive parts to produce only parts meeting those state-imposed specifications. We rejected a similar approach in an express pre-emption context in <em>Engine [Manufacturers] Ass\u2019n v. South Coast Air Quality Management [District], </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>246, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>1756, 158 L.Ed.2d 529 (2004). There, a state entity argued that its rules prohibiting the purchase or lease of vehicles that failed to meet stringent emissions requirements were not pre-empted by the Clean Air Act, 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 7543(a), because the rules in question were aimed at the purchase of vehicles, rather than then- manufacture or sale____We observed, however, that \u201ctreating sales restrictions and purchase restrictions differently for pre-emption purposes would make no sense,\u201d because the \u201cmanufacturer's right to sell federally approved vehicles is meaningless in the absence of a purchaser\u2019s right to buy them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>1756, 158 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>529. Similarly, a railroad\u2019s ability to equip its fleet of locomotives in compliance with federal standards is meaningless if manufacturers are not allowed to produce locomotives and locomotive parts that meet those standards. Petitioners\u2019 claims thus do not avoid pre-emption simply because they are aimed at the manufacturers of locomotives and locomotive parts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-11\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">Accordingly, the Court concluded that the LIA preempts state tort claims based on injuries caused by exposure to asbestos used in locomotive brake shoes even if the manufacturers were not subject to the LIA regulation. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">The Court in Kums also rejected plaintiffs\u2019 argument that their claims did not fall within the preemptive field because they arose out \u201cof the repair and maintenance of locomotives,\u201d as opposed to the \u201cuse of locomotives on a railroad line.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 132 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1267, 182 L.Ed.2d at 125. The plaintiffs contended that \u201cthe scope of the field pre-empted by the LIA is coextensive with the scope of the Federal Government\u2019s regulatory authority under the LIA,\u201d which did \u201cnot extend to the regulation of hazards arising from the repair or maintenance of locomotives.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Nonetheless, the Court refused to \u201credefine\u201d the preempted field:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">In <em>Napier, </em>the Court held that Congress, in enacting the LIA, \u201cmanifest[ed] the intention to occupy the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment,\u201d and the Court did not distinguish between hazards arising from repair and maintenance as opposed to those arising from use on the line____The pre-empted field as defined by <em>Napier </em>plainly encompasses the claims at issue here. <em>Petitioners\u2019 common-law claims for defective design and failure to warn are aimed at the equipment of locomotives.

Thus, the \u201cgravamen\u201d of petitioners\u2019 failure-to-warn claims \u201cis still that [Corson] suffered harmful consequences as a result of his exposure to asbestos contained in locomotive parts and appurtenances.\u201d____ Because petitioners\u2019 failure-to-warn claims are therefore directed at the equipment of locomotives, they fall within the pre-empted field defined by <em>Napier, supra, </em>272 <em>U.S. </em>at 612, 47 <em>S.Ct. </em>207, 71 <em>L.Ed. </em>432.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-18\"><em>[Id, </em>at --, 132 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1268, 182 L.Ed.2d at 126.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-19\">Here, it is undisputed that PATCO\u2019s MU locomotives, supplied by Budd, were \u201clocomotives\u201d as defined in 49 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 229.5 (2015), which ran on standard gauge track\u2014the gauge on which most railroads, including Amtrak, operate. Moreover, it is undisputed that the \u201clocomotive equipment\u201d at issue\u2014the locomotive air brake shoes installed on PATCO locomotives\u2014were designed and manufactured as components of a locomotive air brake system, designed for use on locomotives operated by railroad carriers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>subject to regulation under the LIA. <em>See </em>49 <em>C.F.R. </em>232.5 (2015) (\u201cAir brake means a combination of devices operated by compressed air, arranged in a system, and controlled manually, electrically, electronically, or pneumatically, by means of which the motion of a railroad car or locomotive is ... arrested\u201d). <em>See also Perry v.

In fact, the locomotive equipment was physically indistinguishable from the equipment in Kurns\u2014 that is, Cobra brand locomotive air brake shoes manufactured by RFPC and designed for the air brake system of a locomotive capable of travelling on a standard gauge track.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Because plaintiffs\u2019 negligence and products liability claims are directed at \u201cthe subject of locomotive equipment,\u201d they are therefore preempted under the sweeping field preemption adopted in <em>Napier, </em>and reaffirmed in <em>Kurns. </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are preempted as state actions that would affect \u201cthe design, the construction, and the material\u201d of locomotives, including claims for failure-to-warn. Kur<em>ns, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 132 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1267, 182 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">That the locomotive equipment operated by PATCO was a rapid transit operation not subject to the LIA regulation does not undercut the analysis. <em>Kums </em>defines the preempted field as the locomotive <em>equipment, </em>not by the entity that purchases or uses the equipment. <em>Id. </em>at -, 132 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1267-68, 182 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 125. In <em>Kurns, </em>the preempted field was not coextensive with the scope of the federal government\u2019s regulatory authority under the LIA. But that fact was found to be irrelevant to the application of the preemption doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at -, 132 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1267-69, 182 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 125-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">This broad field of preemption ensures uniformity of railroad equipment, an important safety and practical consideration given the national distribution of products manufactured for use in the industry. Focusing on equipment, as was the case in <em>Napier </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>Kurns, </em>ensures that all locomotive equipment, regardless of where or by which entity it is used, meets federal safety standards. Creating an exception based on the classification of the operation at the time of the injury would conflict with the conclusions in <em>Kurns, </em>would threaten uniformity, and would complicate the straightforward equipment preemption that has remained unchanged since 1926. We therefore reject plaintiffs\u2019 argument that because PATCO\u2019s operations were not subject to federal regulation, their state court claims should survive.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Motions for summary judgment should be granted where, as a matter of law, the moving party is clearly entitled to judgment. In this case the railroad defendants must prevail because Congress exclusively occupies the field including the manufacture of locomotive brakes.

Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to submit evidence that would allow [ ] a reasonable jury to find that [ ] Brust was exposed to friable asbestos on a regular' and frequent basis in close proximity to Defendant\u2019s product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The judge granted Abex\u2019s motion for summary judgment, regarding its automobile brake shoes, on the same basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">When the judge granted Pep Boys\u2019 motion for summary judgment,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> he reiterated Brust\u2019s deposition testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag8\">that she witnessed her father perform brake jobs on the vehicles infrequently maybe [ ] once every two or three years.

The judge opined, however, that even when viewing the facts in the light most favorable to her, nothing in the record established that her illness resulted from exposure during \u201cNoga\u2019s use of asbestos containing brakes sold and/or distributed by Pep Boys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">In a products liability failure-to-warn case, a plaintiff must prove that: 1) the product was defective; 2) the defect existed when the product left the defendant\u2019s control; 3) the defect caused injury to a reasonably foreseeable user; and 4) the defect was the absence of warning that the product can potentially cause injury. <em>James v.

New Jersey courts, as well as courts in a majority of other jurisdictions, <em>James, supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 302-04, 714 A.2d 898, look to the \u201cfrequency, regularity, and proximity\u201d of exposure as pronounced in <em>Sholtis, supra, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 28, 568 A.2d 1196. Assessment of those circumstances determines whether exposure to the defendant\u2019s asbestos-containing product was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in causing the alleged injury. <em>Hughes, supra, </em>435 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 337-38, 89 A.3d 179; <em>Provini v.

Viewing plaintiffs\u2019 evidence in the most favorable light, a jury could find that Noga replaced the brake shoes on eight cars from 1970 to 1978, and that both the old brake shoes, about which nothing is known, and the new brakes shoes were contaminated with asbestos. During those eight years, Brust was exposed to asbestos through contact with her father while he handled asbestos-contaminated brake shoes on at most four occasions, and through washing his clothes on at most eight occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Although Noga purchased most of the brake shoes from Pep Boys, he could not recall the names of the manufacturers of the replaced brake shoes, where most of the dust originated. He could not quantify the number of times he installed new Abex, Bendix, or Raybestos<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> brake shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Plaintiffs contend from this testimony that \u201cthe evidence would only support a finding that one set of brakes Noga purchased at Pep Boys was manufactured by Honeywell\u2019s predecessor, Bendix, and one other set by Abex.\u201d And it is undisputed that mesothelio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>ma can develop from minimal exposure to asbestos. But the exposures established by this record are so few and so limited that they simply fail to meet the \u201cfrequency, regularity, and proximity\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">That test was satisfied in <em>Olivo v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>394, 399, 895 A.2d 1143 (2006), for example, where the plaintiff alleged she developed mesothelioma as a result of laundering her husband\u2019s asbestos-laden work clothes over a forty-year period. Similarly, in <em>Anderson v. A.J. Friedman Supply Co., </em>416 <em>N.J.Super. </em>46, 54, 3 A.3d 545 (App.Div.2010), <em>certif. denied, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>518, 16 A.3d 383 (2011), we found summary judgment should not be granted where the plaintiff developed mesothelioma from laundering her husband\u2019s asbestos-laden work clothes over a thirty-year period. And, in <em>Kurak, supra, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 310, 321-22, 689 A.2d 757, sufficient proofs were established by the plaintiffs work as a laboratory technician in close proximity to asbestos-contaminated pipe insulation for at least thirteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Hence, we agree with Judge LeBlon that even if Brust was exposed to one of each of the automotive defendants\u2019 products over an eight-year period, assuming they were sold by Pep Boys, she failed to establish sufficient contacts to meet the frequency, regularity, and proximity test. <em>See, e.g., Chavers v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>349 <em>Ark. </em>550, 79 S.W.3d 361, 370 (2002) (one-time exposure does not satisfy regularity and frequency test). There is no genuine issue as to any material fact.
