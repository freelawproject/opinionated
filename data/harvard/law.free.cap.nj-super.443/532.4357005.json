Because we conclude that the employer\u2019s order was not reasonably justified under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">We derive the following facts from the testimony and documents presented at the hearing conducted in the Office of Administrative Law (OAL). On November 3, 2004, appellant began working as a truck driver for the Department of Public Works (the DPW) of the Township of Lakewood (the Township).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">On or about March 28, 2013, the Township manager received an anonymous letter purportedly from a \u201c[vjery concerned employee at Lakewood Public Works.\u201d The unsigned letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">I am writing this letter because I am very concerned about the mental well[-]being of [appellant]. We as co-workers dread being assigned with him and everyone knows he has some sort of mental issues and I truly feel it puts us all at risk with his tirades and outbursts on a daily basis like the one he had today with his union stewards [M.C., B.T., and P.R.] as well. The men and women here at Lakewood public works deserve to come to work and not be afraid of this man, we deserve a hostile free working environment and you as our employer are legally obligated to provide us such. For years we have complained about this man to former Director [J.F.], to our current administration in place now and it seems like a joke, it[\u2019]s not. In 1992 there were over 750 workplace killings and this is no laughing matter[;] it\u2019s very real and very serious. [Appellant] is a time bomb waiting to explode and he needs help, and it\u2019s your responsibility to ensure he gets it or provide some way for us to feel safe at work. I truly hope there is something you can do to ensure our safety, please don\u2019t put the township[\u2019]s fear of liability ahead of the employee\u2019s safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">Thank you for your time[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">For over eight months, the Township took no action concerning the letter. On December 2, 2013, however, \u201cthe Township advised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>appellant that he would be sent for a psychological fitness-for-duty examination, and that if he did not attend such an examination he would face disciplinary action.\u201d Eight days later, the DPW director sent a letter to appellant notifying him that an examination had been scheduled for December 16, 2013, with \u201ca follow-up meeting\u201d set for December 20, 2013. The letter warned appellant that the Township would discipline him if he did not attend both appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Appellant alleged that the examinations were not \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity\u201d under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A) and, therefore, the Township could not demand that he undergo them. Therefore, appellant did not attend either evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">On December 18, 2013, the Township served appellant with a Preliminary Notice of Disciplinary Action seeking to remove him from employment on charges of incompetency; inefficiency or failure to perform duties; inability to perform duties; conduct unbecoming a public employee; and \u201cother sufficient cause\u201d for discipline. The specification for the charges stated that appellant \u201cfailed to report for [the psychological fitness-for-duty] examination contrary to a direct instruction from [his] supervisors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">That same day, appellant requested a departmental hearing, which was held on January 6, 2014. The Township rejected appellant\u2019s contention that its demands were not permissible under the ADA and issued a Final Notice of Disciplinary Action terminating appellant\u2019s employment. Appellant appealed to the Commission, which transmitted the matter to the OAL for a contested case hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">At the OAL hearing, the Township presented the testimony of one witness, the DPW director, who testified that he had worked for the Township for thirty-two years and was familiar with appellant\u2019s work. The director stated that we \u201chad problems with [appellant] over the past years\u201d because he was \u201cat times ... confrontational, and at other times [he walked] away from someone who wished to speak with him.\u201d The director testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>was not afraid of appellant. Other than \u201cwriting up\u201d appellant \u201cfor not helping a fellow worker\u201d on an unspecified date, the director did not identify any prior, formal disciplinary action taken against appellant. When asked to describe appellant \u201cas a worker[,]\u201d the director stated that he was \u201cno different than any other employee[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The director testified that the Township manager showed him the anonymous letter \u201c[r]ight after he received it.\u201d The director did not investigate the allegations contained in the letter, and he was not sure what action, if any, the manager took concerning it. The director stated that appellant\u2019s \u201cjob performance was not a basis for [the Township] sending him to a psychological evaluation.\u201d The Township also stipulated that it had \u201cnever sent anyone for a psychological [examination] predicated upon the fact that they failed to help\u201d other employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Appellant\u2019s union representative briefly testified on his behalf. The representative stated that the Township manager showed him the anonymous letter \u201cshortly after it was received____\u201d The manager said that he thought \u201che need[ed] to act on\u201d the letter. The representative questioned whether the manager had \u201c \u2018a legal basis to act on it,\u2019 \u201d and that was \u201cthe last\u201d the representative \u201cheard of\u2019 the letter until the Township filed charges against appellant over eight months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">In a thorough Initial Decision, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) reversed the Township\u2019s decision to remove appellant. The ALJ found that there was \u201cno documentary or testimonial evidence of an investigation by the Township of the anonymous letter to determine the veracity of the allegations contained therein.\u201d Based upon the director\u2019s uncontradicted testimony, the ALJ also found that the Township\u2019s demand that appellant \u201cattend a psychological fitness-for-duty examination was not related to his work performance or to any specific allegation of psychologically[-]dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>ruptive behavior.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ also noted that appellant\u2019s \u201cwork performance was satisfactory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Under these circumstances, and relying upon 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A), the ALJ concluded that the Township\u2019s demand that appellant undergo a psychological examination was not \u201creasonably related\u201d to his job duties and was not \u201cconsistent with business necessity.\u201d The ALJ stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">Here, there was no evidence of a risk of injury to a fellow employee or the public, and no evidence or allegation of physical contact with another employee. The evidence offered by the [Township] is an anonymous letter that the Township took eight months to act on. There is no showing of an investigation into the anonymous letter. [The DPW director] credibly testified that appellant may be confrontational at times; however, this observation regarding appellant was not the asserted basis for the Township\u2019s request for a psychological fitness-for-duty examination of [appellant].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">[Appellant] did fail to attend the psychological fitness-for-duty examination, but without a reasonable basis for the request that he undergo the examination, the Township cannot punish him for failure to attend. Such an examination was not job-related and consistent with business necessity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Because the Township \u201cfailed to meet its burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that [appellant] committed the charged violations[,]\u201d the ALJ ordered that he be immediately reinstated to his truck driver position with back pay from the date of his termination to the date of his reinstatement. The ALJ also granted appellant \u201creasonable counsel fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">The Township filed exceptions and, on March 5, 2015, the Commission reversed the ALJ\u2019s determination. In its decision, the Commission failed to address appellant\u2019s contention that the Township\u2019s demand that he undergo a psychological examination was impermissible under the ADA. Indeed, the Commission did not even cite the ADA in its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">The Commission found that appellant was insubordinate because he \u201cfailfed] to perform his duty by disregarding his supe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>riors\u2019 orders to appear for the fitness-for-duty examinations.\u201d Although the Township had not charged appellant with insubordination, the Commission reasoned that the specifications for the charges set forth in the Preliminary and Final Notices of Disciplinary Action \u201cclearly subsumed allegations of insubordination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The Commission determined that appellant should not be removed from employment, and instead imposed a six-month suspension. The Commission explained that \u201cappellant\u2019s blatant disregard of oral and written orders from his superiors is significantly egregious to warrant a substantial penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The Commission also ordered appellant to undergo a psychological examination before he was reinstated to ensure that he was \u201cfully capable of performing the duties of his position.\u201d If the psychologist determined that \u201cappellant [was] fit for duty, without qualification,\u201d the Commission directed the Township to immediately reinstate appellant. However, if the psychologist determined that appellant was \u201cunfit for duty,\u201d the Commission ordered the Township to charge appellant \u201cwith inability to perform duties\u201d and remove him from employment, subject to appellant\u2019s right to appeal such a determination to the Commission. The Commission also denied appellant\u2019s request for counsel fees. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Established precedents guide our task on appeal. Our scope of review of an administrative agency\u2019s final determination is limited. <em>In re Herrmann, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>19, 27, 926 A.2d 350 (2007). \u201c \u2018[A] strong presumption of reasonableness attaches\u2019 \u201d to the Commission\u2019s decision. <em>In re Carroll, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>429, 437, 772 A.2d 45 (App.Div.)

In enacting the ADA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Congress found that \u201cdiscrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as employment,\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12101(a)(3), and therefore sought to \u201cassure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for such individuals!!.]\u201d <em>42 U.S.C.A % </em>12101(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Regarding employment discrimination, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12112(a) sets forth the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d that \u201c[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to [the] ... discharge of employees[.]\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12112(d)(1) states that this \u201cprohibition against discrimination as referred to in [42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12112(a) ] shall include medical examinations and inquiries.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A) prohibits employers, like the Township, from \u201crequirpng] a medical examination\u201d or \u201cmak[ing] inquiries of an employee as to whether such employee is an individual with a disability ... unless such examination or inquiry is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">\u201cThere is very little discussion of [42 U.S.C.A.] \u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A) in the ADA\u2019s legislative history.\u201d <em>Kroll v. White Lake Ambulance Auth., </em>691 F.3d 809, 815 n. 8 (6th Cir.2012). However, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s regulations make clear that an employer cannot require an employee to undergo medical tests that do not serve a legitimate business purpose. <em>See </em>29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 1630.13(b) (stating the general rule that, except as permitted by 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 1630.14, \u201cit is unlawful for a covered entity to require a medical examination of an employee\u201d); 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 1630.14(c) (stating that a medical examination may only be conducted if it is \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity\u201d). Courts give \u201c \u2018substantial deference\u2019 \u201d to the EEOC\u2019s regulations interpreting the ADA, including 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12112(d). <em>Tice v. Ctr. Area Transp. Auth., </em>247 F.3d 506, 515 n. 8 (3d Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Chevron. Deane v. Pocono Med. Ctr., </em>142 F.3d 138, 143 n. 4 (3d Cir.1998) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">In addition, the EEOC has issued interpretive guidelines to provide employers with detailed guidance on when they may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>lawfully require an employee to undergo a medical examination. <em>Enforcement Guidance: Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), </em>The U.S. Equal Emp\u2019t Opportunity Comm\u2019n [hereinafter <em>Enforcement Guidance </em>or <em>Guidance </em>], <em>http://www. eeoc.gov/policy/docs/guidance-inquiries.html </em>(last visited Jan. 19, 2016). We have long recognized that deference \u201cshould be afforded to the interpretation of the agency charged with applying and enforcing a statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Hargrove v. Sleepy\u2019s, LLC, </em>220 <em>N.J. </em>289, 301, 106 A.3d 449 (2015). Thus, while not binding, \u201c[t]he EEOC\u2019s interpretative guidelines ... \u2018constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Duda v. Bd. of Educ., </em>133 F.3d 1054, 1060, n. 12 (7th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Meritor Sav. Bank v. Vinson, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>57, 65, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2399, 2404, 91 L.Ed.2d 49, 58 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">In its <em>Guidance, </em>the EEOC explained that, prior to the enactment of the ADA, \u201cmany employers asked ... employees to provide information concerning their physical and/or mental condition. This information often was used to exclude and otherwise discriminate against individuals with disabilities\u2014particularly non-visible disabilities, such as mental illness\u2014despite their ability to perform the job.\u201d <em>Enforcement Guidance, supra. </em>Thus, \u201c[t]he ADA\u2019s provisions concerning ... mental examinations reflect Congress\u2019s intent to protect the rights of ... employees to be assessed on merit alone, while protecting the rights of employers to ensure that individuals in the workplace can efficiently perform the essential functions of their jobs.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Psychological fitness-for-duty examinations are \u201cmedical examinations\u201d under the ADA. <em>Enforcement Guidance, supra. </em>Thus, the examinations that the Township ordered appellant to undergo would only have been lawful if they were \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A). The <em>Guidance </em>defines these terms and \u201caddresses situations in which an employer would meet the general standard for ... requiring a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>medical examination.\u201d We therefore quote from the <em>Guidance </em>at length.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The EEOC has defined the \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity\u201d set forth in 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">Generally, a disability-related inquiry or medical examination of an employee may be \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity\u201d when an employer \u201chas a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that: (1) an employee\u2019s ability to perform essential job functions will be impaired by a medical condition; or (2) an employee will pose a direct threat due to a medical condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\"><em>[Enforcement Guidance, supra </em>(footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Pursuant to 29 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 1630.2(r), the term \u201c[djirect threat means a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The EEOC has further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2Z\">Sometimes this standard may be met when an employer knows about a particular employee\u2019s medical condition, has observed performance problems, and reasonably can attribute the problems to the medical condition. An employer also may be given <em>reliable information </em>by a <em>credible third party </em>that an employee has a medical condition, or the employer may observe symptoms indicating that an employee may have a medical condition that will impair his/her ability to perform essential job functions or will pose a direct threat. In these situations, it may be job-related and consistent with business necessity for an employer to make disability-related inquiries or require a medical examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-9\"><em>[Enforcement Guidance, supra </em>(footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">In other words, the employer must reasonably believe, either through direct observation or through reliable information received from credible sources, that the employee\u2019s perceived medical condition is affecting his or her work performance or that the employee poses a direct threat. Then, and only then, may the employer lawfully require the employee to undergo a psychological fitness-for-duty examination. <em>See Yin v. California, </em>95 F.3d 864, 868 (9th Cir.1996) (observing that an employer cannot require an employee to undergo a medical examination unless the employee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>\u201cproblems have had a substantial and injurious impact on [the] employee\u2019s job performance\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>519 <em>U.S. </em>1114, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>955,136 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>842 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The <em>Enforcement Guidance </em>cautions employers that they may not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">require a medical examination of an employee based, in whole or in part, on information learned from another person!, unless] the information learned is rehable and would give rise to a reasonable belief that the employee\u2019s ability to perform essential job functions will be impaired by a medical condition or that s/he will pose a direct threat due to a medical condition!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">[ (emphasis omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">In determining whether the information provided by a credible third-party is sufficiently reliable to support an order requiring the employee to submit to a psychological examination, the <em>Guidance </em>states that the employer should consider the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-10\">(1) the relationship of the person providing the information to the employee about whom it is being provided; (2) the seriousness of the medical condition at issue; (3) the possible motivation of the person providing the information; (4) how the person learned the information <em>(e.g., </em>directly from the employee whose medical condition is in question or from someone else); and (5) other evidence that the employer has that bears on the reliability of the information provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-11\">\n<em>[Enforcement Guidance, supra.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">To illustrate these requirements, the EEOC provided the following example, which is particularly pertinent to the case at hand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-13\">Example! ]: Kim works for a small computer consulting firm. When her mother died suddenly, she asked her employer for three weeks off, in addition to the five days that the company customarily provides in the event of the death of a parent or spouse, to deal with family matters. During her extended absence, a rumor circulated among some employees that Kim had been given additional time off to be treated for depression. Shortly after Kim\u2019s return to work, Dave, who works on the same team with Kim, approached his manager to say that he had heard that some workers were concerned about them safety. According to Dave, people in the office claimed that Kim was talking to herself and threatening to harm them. Dave said that he had not observed the strange behavior himself but was not surprised to hear about it given Kim\u2019s alleged recent treatment for depression. Dave\u2019s manager sees Kim every day and never has observed this kind of behavior. In addition, none of the co-workers to whom the manager spoke confirmed Dave\u2019s statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-14\">[ (emphasis omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7J\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Based upon the facts of this hypothetical example, the EEOC advised that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">the employer does not have a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that Kim\u2019s ability to perform essential functions will be impaired or that s/he will pose a direct threat because of a medical condition. The employer, therefore, would not be justified in asking Kim disability-related questions or requiring her to submit to a medical examination because the information provided by Dave is not reliable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aks\"><em>[Enforcement Guidance, </em>supra,]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">After carefully reviewing 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A) and the EEOC\u2019s regulations and its <em>Guidance, </em>and distilling them to their essence, we conclude that an employer may only require an employee to undergo a psychological fitness-for-duty examination when the employer has a reasonable belief, either through direct observation or through reliable information from credible sources, that the employee\u2019s perceived mental state will either affect his or her ability to perform essential job functions or that the employee poses a direct threat. As the EEOC has observed, the employer\u2019s \u201creasonable belief ... must be based on <em>objective evidence </em>obtained, or reasonably available to the employer, prior to ... requiring a medical examination. Such a belief requires an assessment of the employee and his/her position and cannot be based on general assumptions.\u201d <em>Enforcement Guidance, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Applying these principles to the facts of this case, we hold that the Township violated 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A) when it ordered appellant to participate in a psychological fitness-for-duty examination based upon the information contained in the anonymous letter. Simply stated, the Township did not meet its burden of demonstrating that its directive was \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Here, the DPW director testified that appellant\u2019s work performance was satisfactory and \u201cwas not a basis\u201d for the Township\u2019s demand that he undergo the evaluation. While appellant was \u201cconfrontational\u201d at times, the director stated that appellant was \u201cno different than\u201d other employees. Under these circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>we are satisfied that the Township failed to demonstrate that appellant\u2019s ability to perform his job functions was impaired by any suspected medical or mental condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The Township also failed to prove that appellant posed a direct threat to either himself, others or property. Again, the Township did not present any evidence that appellant had threatened other employees. The DPW director only mentioned one specific incident in appellant\u2019s nine years of employment where appellant was disciplined for not helping a co-worker. However, the Township stipulated that other employees were similarly disciplined over the years, but none of them were ordered to undergo psychological evaluations. The Township did not present any documentary evidence concerning any other disciplinary actions involving appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">In addition, the Township obviously did not consider appellant to be a direct threat to other employees or property because, after it received the anonymous letter, it failed to take any action concerning it for over eight months. During that entire time, appellant performed the duties of his position without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Turning to the anonymous letter, it is clear that, even though the letter made allegations of disruptive behavior, it did not represent the type of reliable information from a credible source upon which the Township could reasonably rely in ordering a psychological examination. The identity of the \u201c[vjery concerned employee at Lakewood Public Works\u201d who sent the letter was unknown. Therefore, the information in the letter was exactly the type of innuendo and rumor that the EEOC has advised employers is insufficient to support a mandatory evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Contrary to the Township\u2019s contention, it was not powerless to take appropriate action after it received the anonymous letter. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12112(d)(4)(B) plainly provides that an employer \u201cmay make inquiries into the ability of an employee to perform job-related functions.\u201d Thus, the Township could have solicited information from the DPW director and any other supervisors concerning appellant\u2019s job performance. The Township also could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>contacted the three \u201cunion stewards\u201d specifically named in the anonymous letter for information about the alleged \u201coutburst\u201d appellant had on March 28, 2013. Instead, the Township failed to investigate the allegations in the anonymous letter for over eight months and then sought to rely upon that letter as the sole basis for its order requiring appellant to submit to the psychological evaluation. Thus, this order clearly violated 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A). Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s finding of insubordination,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> given the undisputed circumstances presented, was erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Therefore, we conclude that the Commission\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable and, accordingly, we reverse and vacate the penalty imposed. We remand to the Commission for a calculation of back pay due to appellant upon his reinstatement to his former position and for consideration of his request for counsel fees. In remanding, we express no view on the merits of appellant\u2019s application for counsel fees or the amount that may be due him in back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Reversed and remanded. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-12\"> As we will discuss below, even if the anonymous letter did present a \"specific allegation of psychologically[-]disruptive behaviorf,]\" the allegation was not based upon reliable information provided by a credible third party as required by 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b570-9\"> Appellant initially filed a notice of appeal, which we dismissed on our own motion because it was interlocutory.
