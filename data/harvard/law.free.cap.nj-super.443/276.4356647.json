The charges stem from a road rage incident, during which defendant allegedly followed the victim to his home and threatened him with a gun. Newark Police Officers Thomas Hernandez and Queen Bates responded to the victim\u2019s 9-1-1 call and the Newark Police Department principally conducted the criminal investigation supporting the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">Defendant retained Anthony Fusco and his firm Fusco &amp; Macaluso Partners, LLC to provide his legal representation. The State moved to disqualify counsel and his firm asserting Fusco had an actual and apparent conflict of interest because he was counsel for the New Jersey Fraternal Order of Police Lodge (FOP), the union representing Newark Police Officers, and because Fusco previously represented a Newark officer involved in the investigation. The trial judge agreed and concluded Fusco was disqualified from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>serving as criminal defense counsel because of the apparent conflict, which created an appearance of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">On our leave granted, defendant appeals from the January 14, 2015 order memorializing this determination, arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">\n<em>POINT ONE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">MR. FUSCO\u2019S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NJFOP DOES NOT DISQUALIFY HIM OR HIS FIRM FROM REPRESENTATION OF THE DEFENDANT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">IN THIS CASE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">\n<em>POINT TWO</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-10\">THERE IS NO ACTUAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN THIS MATTER.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">Following our review, we reverse the order of disqualification and remand for further proceedings. We conclude the facts in this record do not support the judge\u2019s conclusions of an actual conflict of interest. We also conclude the trial judge erred in grounding his determination on the possible appearance of impropriety. The appearance of impropriety may not be used as a basis to find a conflict of interest under <em>RPC </em>1.7 or <em>RPC </em>1.9. <em>In re Supreme Court Advisory Comm. on Prof'l Ethics Op. No. 697, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>549, 563 n. 5, 568, 911 A.2d 51 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">These undisputed facts are found in the record of the State\u2019s motion seeking to disqualify Fusco and defendant\u2019s response. Fusco, as counsel for the FOP, represents \u201cmember police officers in administrative, civil and criminal matters which [arise] out of their duties as police officers.\u201d Further, Fusco is a featured columnist for the FOP News Magazine, where he regularly contributes, and is designated as \u201cState Lodge Attorney Tony Fusco.\u201d The State averred Fusco\u2019s representation of members of the FOP, who are employed by the Newark Police Department, precluded his representation of defendant because the criminal charges were principally investigated by the Newark Police Department. The State also suggested Fusco\u2019s role as attorney for the FOP equated to representation of the officer members, including the officers of the Newark Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">Additionally, in a supporting certification, an assistant prosecutor identified ten Newark police officers as potential witnesses, stating \u201csome of these officers will testify at the pending trial.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The list included Lieutenant Camilo Mos, who was present during defendant\u2019s videotaped custodial interview, but neither conducted the interview nor Mirandized defendant. The State also related Lt. Mos\u2019 disclosure he had engaged Fusco to represent him \u201cin an administrative hearing related to his employment\u201d ten years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">These facts alone underlie the State\u2019s position that Fusco\u2019s prior representation of Lt. Mos, and \u201cthe representation of the union itself, which in turn represents or has represented each of these Newark Police witnesses!,]\u201d constitutes an actual conflict of interest or at least an appearance of impropriety. It is noted the State did not provide a certification from Lt. Mos detailing the nature of Fusco\u2019s prior representation or addressing his position on Fusco\u2019s representation of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Fusco filed a responsive certification, which confirmed he was under contract with the FOP \u201cto represent member police officers in administrative, civil and criminal matters which arose out of their duties as police officers.\u201d Further, he acknowledged he had been \u201cretained by the [ ]FOP as legal counsel to render advice to the []FOP Board of Trustees!;]\u201d he \u201cregularly speak[s] at the [ ]FOP State Convention!;] and !he] authored] articles for their newsletter! ]\u201d; however, he was not designated counsel and officers were free to retain any attorney they chose. Fusco also admitted he represented \u201cLt. Mos in a Newark Departmental disciplinary hearing,\u201d probably when he was a patrol officer. However, he had no personal recollection of the matter, the file was not in the firm\u2019s current computer system, and being over ten years old, it was presumably in storage. Defendant also filed a certification waiving any alleged conflict Fusco and the firm might have because of the prior representation of Lt. Mos.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">On January 14, 2015, without benefit of oral argument, the motion judge issued a written opinion granting the State\u2019s motion. The judge reasoned defendant faced a \u201csignificant risk\u201d his defense would \u201cbe materially limited when Fusco\u201d or another attorney from his firm was required to cross-examine Lt. Mos. because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Fusco had access to information regarding Lt. Mos \u201cthrough past recollection of the prior case file,\u201d which he would be precluded from using. Consequently, to avoid violating <em>RPC </em>1.7(a)(2) and <em>RPC </em>1.9(c), Fusco would engage in a \u201cmore cautious cross-examination than would otherwise be warranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Also, although noting the appearance of impropriety standard was removed from the <em>RPCs </em>following the 2004 amendments, the judge nevertheless found the doctrine remained \u201ca consideration when examining a conflict of interest.\u201d He concluded, despite the uncertainty of whether Lt. Mos was a \u201ckey witness,\u201d the State\u2019s identification of him as a possible witness was sufficient to lead the public to perceive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">(1) Lieutenant Mos unfairly aided Defendant in order to ingratiate himself with Mr. Fusco in case he ever needs Mr. Fusco\u2019s legal services again; (2) that Mr. Fusco or the attorney from his firm appearing at trial did not vigorously cross-examine Lieutenant Mos; or (3) that Mr. Fusco or his associate would use confidential information from his earlier representation of Lieutenant Mos during Lieutenant Mos\u2019s cross-examination, such as information regarding prior bad acts. <em>See [State v.] Needham, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>100,] 104-07 [688 A.2d 1135 (Law Div.1996) ]. This appearance of impropriety presents \u201ca substantial risk of disservice to the public interest,\u201d as it will both undermine the integrity of the Court and provide a potential avenue for attacks on the fairness of this ease. <em>See [State </em>v.] <em>Davis, </em>366 <em>N.J.Super. </em>30,] 38, 42-43 [840 A.2d 279 (App.Div.2004) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Defendant requested leave to appeal from the January 14, 2015 order directing Fusco\u2019s disqualification. We granted interlocutory review.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">\u201c[A] determination of whether counsel should be disqualified is, as an issue of law, subject to de novo plenary appellate review.\u201d <em>City of Atl. City v. Trupos, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>447, 463, 992 A.2d 762 (2010). <em>See also State v. Bruno, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>322, 331-32, 732 A.2d 1136 (App.Div.1999). \u201cWhere ... the trial judge had no factual disputes to resolve on credibility grounds and only legal conclusions to draw,\u201d reviewing courts do not \u201cdefer to the trial judge\u2019s findings\u201d or ultimate decision. <em>Bruno, supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 331, 732 A.2d 1136. The burden rests with the State to demonstrate a disqualifying conflict exists. <em>See State v. Morelli, </em>152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>67, 70-71, 377 A.2d 774 (App.Div.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Consideration of this issue starts with a recognition of a criminal defendant\u2019s right secured by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution \u201cto have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend. VI. This fundamental right must be protected. <em>State v. Coon, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>426, 432-33, 715 A.2d 326 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>543, 724 A.2d 802 (1998). Additionally, United States Supreme Court jurisprudence has solidified the principle that a non-indigent defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel encompasses the right to be represented by the counsel of his choosing, as the Sixth Amendment \u201ccommands ... that the accused be defended by the counsel he believes to be best.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 <em>U.S. </em>140, 146, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>2557, 2562, 165 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>409, 418 (2006). New Jersey\u2019s Constitution equally recognizes a defendant\u2019s right to obtain counsel of his or her choosing. <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. I, \u00b6 10. <em>See also State v. Kates, </em>426 <em>N.J.Super. </em>32, 43, 42 A.3d 929 (App.Div.2012), aff<em>'d, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>393, 81 A.3d 662 (2014).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">Where the right to be assisted by counsel of one\u2019s choice is wrongly denied, ... it is unnecessary to conduct an ineffectiveness or prejudice inquiry to establish a Sixth Amendment violation. Deprivation of the right is \u201ccomplete\u201d when the defendant is erroneously prevented from being represented by the lawyer he wants____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\"><em>[Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, </em>548 <em>U.S. </em>at 148, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2563, 165 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 419.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">While the right to have counsel is resolute, a non-indigent criminal defendant is not guaranteed his or her choice of any lawyer. Certainly, the terms of the relationship must be agreed between attorney and client. <em>State v. Jimenez, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>475, 484, 815 A.2d 976 (2003). More important, the scope of an attorney\u2019s representation remains restricted by the <em>RPCs. Ibid. </em>Accordingly, \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s right to choose counsel is also circumscribed by the court\u2019s power to guard against conflicts of interest, and to vindicate the court\u2019s \u2018independent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within the ethical standards of the profession and that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kates, supra, </em>426 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 45, 42 A.3d 929 (quoting <em>Wheat v. United States, </em>486 <em>U.S. </em>153, 160, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>1692, 1698, 100 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>140, 149 (1988)). This squares with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the principle that a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel mandates counsel provide both adequate and conflict-free representation. <em>United States v. Moscony, </em>927 F.2d 742, 748 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>501 <em>U.S. </em>1211, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>2812, 115 L.Ed.2d 984 (1991). Thus, \u201c[a] defense attorney\u2019s representation must be untrammeled and unimpaired, his loyalty undivided.\u201d <em>State v. Bellucci, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>531, 538, 410 A.2d 666 (1980) (citation omitted). <em>See also State v. Cottle, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>449, 463-64, 946 A.2d 550 (2008) (\u201cWith so much on the line.... [a]n attorney should never place himself in the position of serving ... an interest in conflict with his client\u2019s interest.\u201d); <em>State ex rel. S.G., </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>132, 139, 814 A.2d 612 (2003) (\u201cIn criminal matters, in which the trust between attorney and client has enhanced importance, special vigilance is required because an attorney\u2019s divided loyalty can undermine a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Courts have examined allegations of conflict of interest and appearance of impropriety arising from counsel\u2019s representation of current and former clients. In <em>State v. Galati, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>572, 319 A.2d 220 (1974), a case decided prior to the adoption of the current <em>RPCs, </em>the State sought to disqualify privately retained defense counsel, alleging he, as the attorney for the Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association, Local No. 75 (PBA), had a conflict of interest, and his representation evoked the appearance of impropriety because counsel maintained a close professional relationship with the PBA organization and its members. <em>Id. </em>at 573-74, 319 A.2d 220. The State had called before the Grand Jury, and also intended to call at trial, the defendant\u2019s patrol partner, a member of the same PBA lodge as the defendant, which was the same lodge counsel represented. <em>Id. </em>at 573, 319 A.2d 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Noting a detailed factual analysis was essential when determining whether particular conduct constituted the appearance of impropriety, the Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">when the lawyer of a PBA chapter consults periodically and intimately with its membership for the legislative, economic and other well-being of the organization and its members, he acquires, or is generally believed to acquix\u2019e a special status, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>relationship, a bridge of confidentiality and trust which sets him apart from other lawyers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">So ... when the PBA\u2019s lawyer undertakes the representation of a private cause in which a member of that same PBA is destined to testify (on one side or another) there is bound to occur a public suspicion that the PBA witness will be inclined to palliate or vivify his testimony in order to accommodate the lawyer who, outside the courtroom, is <em>en rapport </em>with and supportive of the private and organizational interest of the PBA witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">And should the public so believe, and thus suspect the outcome of the litigation proceeded from undue influence upon the policeman\u2019s testimony, and not from the merits, there is a sure result. The doubts thus engendered or suspicions aroused (\u201cthese fellows all stick together\u201d) impoverish the appearance of justice and taint the image of law and its even-handed enforcement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">[Id. at 575-76, 319 A.2d 220.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">The Court \u201cappreeiate[d] that the views expressed ... will preclude a PBA attorney in the future from all representations in which an officer from the same PBA chapter will be called to testify. The sacrifice thus called for seems necessary to the appearance and substance of justice and good government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578, 319 A.2d 220. Despite noting a possible appearance of impropriety, the Court found no actual impropriety occurred and reversed the trial judge\u2019s order of disqualification, noting the circumstances presented were unique and both parties had equal access to the proposed witness. <em>Id. </em>at 578-79, 319 A.2d 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">After the formal adoption of the <em>RPCs </em>in 1984, the standard set forth in then <em>RPC </em>1.7(c) and <em>RPC </em>1.9 remained clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-11\">Attorneys [were] disqualified from representing clients not only in cases of actual conflict, but also when representation begets an appearance of impropriety. Thus, multiple representation [was] impermissible \u201cin those situations in which an ordinary knowledgeable citizen acquainted with the facts would conclude that the multiple representation poses substantial risk of disservice to either the public interest or the interest of one of the clients.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-12\"><em>[In re Inquiry to Advisory Comm. on Prof'l Ethics Etc, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>431, 433, 616 A.2d 1290 (1992) (quoting RPC 1.7(c)(2)),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>In <em>State v. Bruno, </em>the State advanced a disqualification argument challenging counsel and his firm\u2019s representation of the defendant who retained him because the State\u2019s lead detective in the criminal investigation had previously hired a member of the firm to represent him in a civil rights and worker\u2019s compensation matter. <em>Bruno, supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 324-25, 732 A.2d 1136. The detective would not consent to counsel\u2019s representation arguing he intended to request the firm file an action reopening his claim. <em>Id. </em>at 328, 732 A.2d 1136.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">After a thorough analysis of the facts of counsel\u2019s prior representation, the trial judge rejected the State\u2019s argument contending representation of the defendant constituted a conflict of interest and created an appearance of impropriety. <em>Id. </em>at 325, 732 A.2d 1136. Following our plenary review, we agreed. <em>Ibid. </em>We determined the evidence supported the detective was a former and not a current client of the firm, no actual conflict in counsel\u2019s former and current representations existed, and the firm\u2019s prior representation of the detective was limited in scope and, therefore, not subject to the same types of risk of gaming confidential information during that representation, which could be used to the detective\u2019s detriment during cross-examination were he to testify in the defendant\u2019s criminal case. <em>Id. </em>at 334, 337, 732 A.2d 1136. Finally, we held an \u201cinformed citizen with full knowledge of the facts would conclude that there is no \u2018high risk\u2019 of impropriety here\u201d and there is no \u201creasonable basis\u201d to conclude \u201cthese facts create an appearance of impropriety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337-38, 732 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>1136. <em>But see State v.

The Court emphasized the doctrine is not a factor to be considered in determining whether a prohibited conflict of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>interest exists under <em>RPC </em>1.7, 1.8 or 1.9 as its use \u201cinjects an unneeded element of eonfusion[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562 n. 5, 911 A.2d 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">To the extent the conclusion in <em>Galati </em>was based on an appearance of impropriety analysis, it conflicts with the Court\u2019s direction, declaring the amorphous and impractical appearance of impropriety doctrine may not serve as a basis to disqualify counsel because of a perceived conflict of interest. Disqualification must be based on an actual conflict or potential conflict of interest, as now defined by the <em>RPCs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\"><em>RPC </em>1.7(a) proscribes the simultaneous representation of clients, if the representation would be directly adverse to another client, stating in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest. A concurrent conflict of interest exists if ... (2) there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer\u2019s responsibilities to another client, a former client, or a third person or by a personal interest of the lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-9\"><em>RPC </em>1.7(b) allows affected clients to provide informed written consent if \u201cthe lawyer reasonably believes that [he/she]\u201d can provide the impacted clients \u201ccompetent and diligent representation\u201d; \u201cthe representation is not prohibited by law\u201d; and the affected clients are not adverse parties in the same litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">Ethical responsibilities stemming from the representation of a former client in the course of representing a current client is governed by <em>RPC </em>1.9. Subsection (c) addresses when a current representation may conflict with a former client\u2019s interests, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-11\">A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter or whose present or former firm has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-12\">(1) use information relating to the representation to the disadvantage of the former client except as these Rules would permit or require with respect to a client, or when the information has become generally known; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-13\">(2) reveal information relating to the representation except as these Rules would permit or require with respect to a client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">Finally, <em>RPC </em>1.10(a) pertains to the imputation of conflicts of interest to others, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>When lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by <em>RPC </em>1.7 or <em>RPC </em>1.9, unless the prohibition is based on a personal interest of the prohibited lawyer and does not present a significant risk of materially limiting the representation of the client by the remaining lawyers in the firm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Turning to the facts presented in this matter, the trial judge found Fusco\u2019s role as an attorney for the FOP was not a basis to require disqualification. Rather, disqualification was triggered by \u201can actual conflict of interest and an appearance of impropriety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">In concluding the facts showed an actual conflict of interest, the judge assumed Lt. Mos would testify at defendant\u2019s trial and Fusco\u2019s prior representation of Lt. Mos provided him access to private information, which could not be used or might impinge a vigorous cross-examination. These findings are not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">First, we agree with defendant that Lt. Mos is not a key or essential State witness based on his disclosed involvement. He did not respond to the victim\u2019s call for aid, arrest or Mirandize defendant, or actively participate during defendant\u2019s videotaped interrogation. The facts strongly suggest Lt. Mos\u2019 role in the State\u2019s case was merely tangential, as his participation appears far less significant than the role played by the officer in <em>Bruno. </em>Where it is likely Lt. Mos will not be called at trial because of his limited role in this matter, it would be improper for the State to seek disqualification merely as a strategic maneuver.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Second, the absence of a certification from Lt. Mos speaks volumes. His silence along with Fusco\u2019s inability to recall the nature of the prior matter creates a void; no facts show an actual conflict exists based on Fusco\u2019s prior representation. All we are told is Fusco represented Lt. Mos in a disciplinary matter when he was a patrolman more than ten years ago. The age of the prior matter and that Lt. Mos had not engaged Fusco since do not support a current relationship. Rather, the facts show the attorney-client relationship ended many years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Third, the nature of the prior representation must be examined. Prior representation, in and of itself, is not sufficient to justify disqualification. <em>See Bruno, supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 338, 732 A.2d 1136. Fusco\u2019s counsel to Lt. Mos was related to a departmental disciplinary proceeding. Disciplinary matters range from tardiness or paperwork flaws to significant breaches of police policies or violations of the law. <em>See Oches v. Twp. of Middletown Police Dep\u2019t, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>1, 10, 713 A.2d 993 (1998) (noting existence of police disciplinary charges for \u201cabsenteeism, tardiness, conduct unbecoming a police officer, or other off-duty conduct that is unrelated to the performance of official duties\u201d). The absence of factual underpinnings describing the prior representation makes it impossible to determine whether Fusco\u2019s role created \u201ca significant risk\u201d that his representation of defendant \u201cwill be materially limited\u201d due to responsibilities owed to Lt. Mos under <em>RPC </em>1.9(c)(2), or whether Fusco obtained knowledge from Lt. Mos which might aid defendant that he would be prohibited from utilizing. <em>RPC </em>1.9(c)(1). The assumption Fusco\u2019s prior representation would limit cross-examination because of ethical proscriptions against \u201creveal[ing] information relating to the representation\u201d or the \u201cuse [of] information relating to the representation to the disadvantage of the former client\u201d are unfounded. <em>RPC </em>1.9. The prior relationship may well have revealed no relevant information with the potential to undermine Lt. Mos\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The State\u2019s reliance on <em>Reardon v. Marlayne, Inc., </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>460, 473, 416 A.2d 852 (1980), is misplaced. In <em>Reardon, </em>the Court held: \u201cWhere <em>such substantially related matters are present </em>or when a reasonable perception of impropriety exists, the court will assume that confidential information has passed between attorney and former client, notwithstanding the attorney\u2019s declarations to the contrary. The presumption of access to and knowledge of confidences may not be rebutted.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). Lt. Mos and defendant\u2019s matters are not substantially related. Thus, the stated presumption does not arise and we cannot conclude, as the judge did, Fusco obtained confidential information by the mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>fact he long ago represented Lt. Mos in a matter the facts of which no one recalls.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The judge mistakenly concluded the appearance of impropriety doctrine remained pertinent based on dicta found in <em>Davis, supra, </em>366 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 44, 840 A.2d 279. When analyzing conflict assertions, the Court has clearly rejected the doctrine, stating: \u201cIn light of the 2004 amendments to the <em>Rules of Professional Conduct </em>that eliminated New Jersey\u2019s long-standing prohibition against the appearance of impropriety ... we hold that the appearance of impropriety standard no longer retains any continued validity.\u201d <em>Ethics Op. No. 697, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>at 552, 911 A.2d 51. Conflicts must be actual and not merely appearance based.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">On remand, the judge must conduct a detailed review, thoroughly examining the facts surrounding the prior representation and determine whether Fusco\u2019s prior representation on behalf of Lt. Mos was limited in scope or created an actual conflict with his representation of defendant. Pertinent to this inquiry are findings on whether the nature of the legal representation support a finding Fusco gained confidential information during the representation of Lt. Mos, which could be used to Lt. Mos\u2019 detriment during cross-examination were he to testify in the defendant\u2019s criminal ease. <em>See Bruno, supra, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 333-34, 732 A.2d 1136. This examination must also consider the likelihood Lt. Mos will be called at trial, noting the limited extent of his involvement in the criminal investigation. The State bears the burden of proving the facts supporting disqualification; the mere proffer of a witness who will not be called at trial may not be a basis to disqualify counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Reversed and remanded.
