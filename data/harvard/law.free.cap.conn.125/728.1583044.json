The plaintiff\u2019s husband, an employee of Barnes, was killed by a fall while working on the sign. The plaintiff claimed workmen\u2019s compensation as a dependent against the Community Chest as principal employer, but the compensation commissioner denied it and the Superior Court sustained him in so doing. The statute provides that an employee of a contractor may recover compensation from the principal employer when, among other conditions, the work upon which the employee was engaged was being performed \u201cin, on or about premises\u201d under the control of the principal employer. General Statutes, \u00a7 5230. The situation before us does not differ in any material respect from that involved in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Largay Brewing Co., </em>125 Conn. 109, 3 Atl. (2d) 668, and our decision in that case is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
