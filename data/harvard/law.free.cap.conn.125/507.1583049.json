O'Meara, but at the time being driven by Lewis, one of his automobile salesmen. The action was based upon a policy of insurance issued by the defendant to O\u2019Meara doing business as O\u2019Meara Motor Sales. The plaintiff did not allege or claim to have proved that O\u2019Meara was under any legal liability to him by reason of the injury which he suffered, and admitted upon the pleadings that in an action brought by him against O\u2019Meara and Lewis, though he secured a judgment against the latter, the issues were found in favor of O\u2019Meara. <em>Slattery </em>v. <em>O\u2019Meara, </em>120 Conn. 465, 471, 181 Atl. 610. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that the policy insured O\u2019Meara as the named insured and all others operating the automobile by his permission against liability, and that under the policy and \u00a7 4231 of the General Statutes the defendant is liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The court found these facts material to the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. On April 30, 1935, after trial, judgment was rendered for the plaintiff to recover $5841 of Lewis and finding the issues in favor of O\u2019Meara, in an action naming both as defendants, the former as operator and the latter as owner of an automobile which collided on July 13, 1934, with the plaintiff\u2019s car. At the time of the collision Lewis was using the car for his own personal pleasure and under circumstances which had no \u201cconnection\u201d with O\u2019Meara\u2019s business, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>and this use was not incidental to or in furtherance of the same. June 3,1934, the defendant had executed and delivered to O\u2019Meara its \u201cAutomobile Garage Liability Policy\u201d in evidence, which was in full force and effect at the time of the collision. By it the defendant undertook to insure O\u2019Meara against loss by reason of liability imposed by law upon the assured for property damage or personal injury, including death, in certain specified amounts and under certain named conditions, according to this indorsement attached to the policy at the time it was delivered: \u201cThis policy insures against such losses \u2014 defined in clauses one and two above \u2014 when sustained by reason of the conduct of the automobile sales agency, . . . including ownership, maintenance and operation of any style, type or make of automobile, ... for any or all purposes in connection with such business including pleasure use.\u201d The policy contained this among other conditions: \u201cright of recovery. No recovery against the company by the insured shall be had hereunder until the amount of the loss or expense shall have been finally determined, either by judgment against the assured after actual trial or by written agreement of the assured, the claimant and the company, nor in any event, unless suit is instituted within two years thereafter.\u201d No judgment has been recovered by the plaintiff against O\u2019Meara, nor have O\u2019Meara, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into a written agreement whereby O\u2019Meara or the defendant became bound to pay the judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff against Lewis, or any part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The court concluded that the defendant\u2019s undertaking was to pay to O\u2019Meara, or under \u00a7 4231 of the General Statutes to any person awarded judgment against him, the amount of the judgment with interest; the plaintiff had no right of action under \u00a7 4231; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>and the defendant had not waived its nonliability under the policy, and was not estopped to assert this defense by its participation in the trial upon Lewis\u2019 behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The principal claim on the plaintiff\u2019s appeal is that upon the facts found Lewis as an employee of O\u2019Meara was entitled to look to the defendant for indemnity for his (Lewis\u2019) liability, and that by virtue of \u00a7 4231 he as plaintiff is subrogated to Lewis\u2019 rights. His chief argument is that failure so to construe the above recited clause insuring against liability incurred in the conduct of O\u2019Meara\u2019s sales agency \u201cincluding ownership, maintenance and operation of any . . . automobile ... for ... all purposes in connection with such business including pleasure use,\u201d would render meaningless the last three words quoted. This contention is predicated on the further provision that the policy \u201cdoes not cover proprietors, partners or executives for the operation of personally owned automobiles whether or not used in the business of the Assured unless such automobiles are specifically described in the Policy and charged for at full individual car rates,\u201d and the fact that no such automobile is described therein. The plaintiff claims, therefore, that to give effect to the words \u201cincluding pleasure use\u201d the policy must be construed to cover the present case where Lewis, an employee, was driving O\u2019Meara\u2019s car on a frolic of his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The wording of the policy, however, considered in connection with O\u2019Meara\u2019s possible liability incident to the ownership and use of cars in connection with his automobile sales agency, makes clear that the words \u201cincluding pleasure use\u201d though inapplicable to such a case as the present, are not meaningless. The clause referring to the pleasure use of cars was presumably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>inserted to obviate the possibility of the company claiming nonliability on the ground that the car was being used for pleasure, even though it was in connection with the assured\u2019s business, in some such situations, for instance, as that which we had before us in <em>Ackerson </em>v. <em>Jennings Co., Inc., </em>107 Conn. 393, 140 Atl. 760. Certainly this clause is insufficient to extend the coverage of the policy definitely stated in the insuring clauses to be one for \u201closs by reason of the liability imposed by law upon the assured.\u201d The initial declaration in the policy is \u201cThe Assured\u2019s name is Martin J. O\u2019Meara d-b- as O\u2019Meara Motor Sales.\u201d Its insuring clause provides the \u201cCompany . . . does hereby insure the Assured named\u201d against \u201cliability imposed by law upon the Assured for damages.\u201d Subsequent repeated references are made to \u201cthe Assured\u201d and \u201cthe named Assured.\u201d Nowhere does the policy mention or suggest anyone other than O\u2019Meara as the assured. Assuming the implied provision for which the plaintiff contends could ever be construed to be a part of a policy so worded, no basis for this construction exists in the present case. The wording of the policy distinguishes this from the case where a policy provides the \u201comnibus coverage\u201d alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and involved in other cases decided by this court. <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co., </em>101 Conn. 369, 376, 125 Atl. 866; <em>Tomasetti </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co., </em>117 Conn. 505, 506, 169 Atl. 54; <em>Cain </em>v. <em>American Policyholders\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>120 Conn. 645, 648,183 Atl. 403. The plaintiff\u2019s claim of estoppel or waiver alleged in his reply having been abandoned in argument, the judgment in favor of O\u2019Meara in the original action is conclusive against the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In view of our disposition of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>no purpose would be served by considering that of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
