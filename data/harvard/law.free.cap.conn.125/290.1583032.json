J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhF\">The plaintiff, on December 14, 1933, was injured by a fall due to slipping on ice, and claimed compensation under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. She was unable to work for three or four days, but thereafter, although suffering pain at times in her back, she worked until February, 1938. The pain then became so severe that she consulted a physician who discovered a fracture of the coccyx, making necessary an operation and resulting in an inability to work for some months. She made no written claim for compensation, but the commissioner gave a hearing on July 13, 1938, found that the injury arose out of and in the course of her employment, but denied compensation because no written claim was made within one year from the date of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act formerly provided that no proceedings for compensation should be maintained unless notice of a claim for compensation was given within one year from the date of the injury, except where there was a written request or assignment for a hearing or a hearing was actually held within that time. Public Acts, 1913, Chap. 138, \u00a7 21. While the statute continued in this form we decided the case of <em>Esposito </em>v. <em>Marlin-Rockwell Corp., </em>96 Conn. 414, 114 Atl. 92. In that case it appeared that the plaintiff had suffered a strain which it was found caused a hernia, but which did not result in incapacity until some ten months later. He did not file a claim under the statute, but a hearing was held more than one year after he suffered the strain but less than a year after incapacity resulted. The defendants expressly claimed that the one-year period ran from the date of the accident or occurrence which caused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>injury. We held that the \u201cdate of the injury\u201d in the statute referred to a compensable injury and hence notice given or a hearing held within one year from the time the injured employee became entitled to compensation was sufficient. See also <em>Rossi </em>v. <em>Jackson Co., </em>120 Conn. 456, 460, 181 Atl. 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In 1927 the Legislature amended the statute to substitute for the requirement of notice within one year from the date of injury a provision that it must be given within one year \u201cfrom the date of the accident or the first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease, as the case may be, which caused the personal injury.\u201d General Statutes, \u00a7 5245, amended, Cum. Sup. 1935, \u00a7 1613c, 1937 Sup. \u00a7 799d. It seems clear that the purpose of this change, as regards a claim not arising from disease, was to alter the former statute interpreted as it was in the <em>Esposito </em>case and to substitute as the time when notice must be given, in place of one year from the date when the injury became compensable, one year from the date of the accident or occurrence from which the injury resulted. Any possible doubt as to this is completely removed when the terms of the amendment are considered as a whole. If the word \u201caccident\u201d in itself could be taken to refer to the time when an injury became compensable, the modifying clause \u201cwhich caused the personal injury\u201d would be meaningless; and the limitation requiring notice in the case of an occupational disease to be given within one year from the \u201cfirst manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease\u201d would be entirely out of harmony with the provision concerning injuries due to accident if the \u201cdate of the accident\u201d were to be given the meaning claimed by the plaintiff. We are not at liberty to depart from a legislative intent so clearly manifest. <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>Bieber-Goodman Corp., </em>118 Conn. 299, 303, 172 Atl. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>95. As no written claim for compensation was filed and no hearing held within one year from the date of the fall which ultimately resulted in incapacity, the commissioner could not do otherwise than dismiss the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
