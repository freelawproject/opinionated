L. 4219, two conditions must exist: He must be a poor perl son; and he must- be in need of assistance. One may be poor, and not need assistance; and he may need assistance and not be poor. It is not enough, under the section specified, that one of these conditions exists; both must be shown. In this respect, the person referred to in that section differs from the .one referred to in G. L. 4222; for the only requirement therein is that he shall be in need of relief, without regard to his financial condition. <em>Danville </em>v. <em>Sheffield, </em>50 Vt. 243. The notice required by G. L. 4220 is a prerequisite to a suit for reimbursement, the object of which is to show that the case is one \u25a0 necessitating ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>tion by tbe town giving it. <em>Randolph </em>v. <em>Roxbury, </em>70 Vt. 175, 40 Atl. 49.
