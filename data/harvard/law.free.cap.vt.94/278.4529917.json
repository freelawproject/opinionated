L. 3536, which provides that \u201cA husband who shall, without just cause, desert or wilfully neglect or refuse to provide for the support and maintenance of his wife in destitute circumstances, \u2019 \u2019 etc., \u2018 \u2018 shall be imprisoned * * * or fined, \u2019 \u2019 etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-19\">The State called the respondent\u2019s wife as a witness. On cross-examination she was shown a written report from the di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>rector of the State laboratory, which indicated that the respondent had gonorrhea about May 20, 1919, and was asked whether she had ever seen it before. She said she had not. She was then asked, in substance, if she ever had trouble with her husband about giving him that disease, and answered, \u201cNo.\u201d On redirect she was asked if the respondent had told her about his relations with other women. This, was objected to by the respondent and excluded. Thereupon the prosecuting attorney stated, in substance: \u201cMy contention is that if the respondent has gonorrhea, as he claims he has, and I do not doubt it, it could have laid dormant for the last four or five years. \u201d Further statement was interrupted by the respondent\u2019s objection to the examiner stating his contention in the presence of the jury, on the ground that it was immaterial, and an exception was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\"><bracketnum>[1-3]</bracketnum> -What was said about respondent in fact having gonorrhea, if improper, was harmless, becafise he claimed that he had it and gave evidence to show that fact. \"What was said about the disease lying dormant was proper, in view of the cross-examination. If the respondent had that disease it was permissible for the State to show, if it could, that he did not contract it from his wife, and it was permissible, too, for the examiner to indicate to the court how he proposed to show that fact. This is all that was done. Moreover, the statement could not have harmed the respondent because the State later introduced evidence, without objection, to show the fact to be as stated. '</p>\n<p id=\"AsZ\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The respondent waived his exception to the overruling of his motion for a directed verdict, made at the close of the State\u2019s evidence, by proceeding with the trial. <em>Latremouille </em>v. <em>Benningion &amp; Rutland Ry. Co., </em>63 Vt. 336, 22 Atl. 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">At the close of all the evidence the respondent moved for a directed verdict on the ground that the State had failed to establish the essential elements of the offence charged. The motion was overruled, subject to the respondent\u2019s exception. It would serve no purpose to recite the tendency of the State\u2019s evidence, for it clearly made a case for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">After the verdict and before judgment, the respondent moved in arrest of judgment, for that the complaint is fatally defective in not alleging, that the refusal to provide, etc., was wilful. The allegation in the complaint is that the respondent \u201cdid without just cause refuse to provide,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The State contends that the word \u201cwilfully\u201d does not qualify the word \u201crefuse\u201d but applies to the word.\u201cneglect\u201d only. We do not think this contention sound. Such certainly is not the grammatical, nor do we think it the reasonable, construction to be given this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The State says that the word \u201crefuse\u201d implies wilfulness. This might well be, if the meaning of the word \u201cwilfully\u201d is to be treated as synonymous with \u201cintentionally,\u201d or words of like meaning, as it sometimes is; but the word as here used has a broader meaning. Though given different definitions under different circumstances, it is said in <em>State </em>v. <em>Burlington Drug Company, </em>84 Vt. 243, 252, 78 Atl. 882, that the word \u201cwilful\u201d cannot, well mean less than intentionally <em>and by design. </em>And such has been held to be the meaning of the word \u201cwilfully\u201d as used in P. S. 5815 (G. L. 6925). <em>State </em>v. <em>Muzzy, </em>87 Vt. 267, 88 Atl. 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> These words, \u201cwilful\u201d and \u201cwilfully,\u201d when used with reference to violations of the criminal law mean something more-than a voluntary act, and more, also, than an intentional act which is in fact wrongful. They include the idea of an act intentionally done with a wrongful purpose, a bad purpose, or with a design to injure another, or one committed out of mere wantonness or lawlessness. <em>Spurr </em>v. <em>United States, </em>174 U. S. 728, 43 L. ed. 1150, 19 Sup. Ct. 812; <em>Potter </em>v. <em>United States, </em>155 U. S. 438, 39 L. ed. 214, 15 Sup. Ct. 144; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>United States, </em>153 U. S. 584, 38 L. ed. 830, 14 Sup. Ct. 934; <em>Felton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>96 U. S. 699, 24 L. ed. 875; <em>State </em>v. <em>Muzzy, </em>87 Vt. 267, 88 Atl. 895; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kneeland, </em>20 Pick. (Mass.) 220; 1 Bishop, Crim. Law, \u00a7 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> It is apparent that, given this meaning, the omission.of the word \u201cwilfully\u201d would have been fatal on demurrer. Nor is it cured by verdict. The earlier authorities on this subject are collected and discussed by the late Chief Judge Taft in an exhaustive opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>63 Vt. 496, 22 Atl. 621; and the later authorities, or many of them, are noticed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>92 Vt. 290, 102 Atl. 1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The rule deducible from .these eases is tersely stated in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Sherman &amp; Miller, </em>73 Vt. 26, 30, 50 Atl. 633, 635: \u201cIf the declaration omits to allege any fact essential to the right of action, and it is not implied in nor inferable from the finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>those that are alleged, a verdict for the plaintiff does not cure the defect.\u201d The same rule obtains in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Applying this rule to the case before us, it is obvious that the defect complained of was not cured by verdict, because it cannot be implied or inferred from the finding that the respondent refused to provide, etc., that he \u201cwilfully\u201d refused to do so. \u201cWilfulness\u201d is the gravamen of the offence under this statute, and failure to allege it is not cured by verdict. See <em>Pette\u2019s Admr. </em>v. <em>Old English Slate Quarry, </em>90 Vt. 87, 96 Atl. 596, where it is held that failure to allege nonassumption of risk was. a defect not cured by verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">It is not claimed, nor could it well be, that the words \u2018 did without just cause,\u201d as used in this statute, mean the same as wilfully. As here used these words evidently refer to the conduct of the wife, and not to a condition, physical or financial, of the husband, that would excuse or explain his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> The motion should have been granted, but this does: not mean necessarily that the respondent will be discharged. Under our modern practice, if, on hearing, this Court discovers a defect not cured by the verdict and which can be corrected by-amendment, it may, in a proper case, permit the amendment to-be made without disturbing the verdict <em>(Chaffee </em>v. <em>Rutland R. Co., </em>71 Vt. 384, 45 Atl. 750), or it may set aside the verdict and order a new trial. <em>Posnett </em>v. <em>Marble, </em>62 Vt. 481, 20 Atl. 813, 11 L. R. A. 162, 22 A. S. R. 126; <em>Pette\u2019s Admr. </em>v. <em>Old English Slate Quarry, supra; Rowley </em>v. <em>Shepardson, </em>83 Vt. 167, 74 Atl. 1002, 138 A. S. R. 1078; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>73 Vt. 26, 50 Atl. 633; <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Cass, </em>73 Vt. 314, 50 Atl. 1085. While these are civil cases, they deal with a rule of practice that is alike applicable to criminal eases in instances where amendments are permissible. The rights of the respondent are not thereby invaded, for if he prevails on a motion in arrest of judgment he is in no better situation than before the charge was preferred against him. <em>People </em>v. <em>McKay, </em>18 Johns. (N. Y.) 212; <em>People </em>v. <em>Casborus, </em>13 Johns. (N. Y.) 351; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gabor, </em>209 Pa. 201, 58 Atl. 278; <em>State </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>82 Conn. 321, 73 Atl. 780; 16 C. J. 1265, \u00a7 2821.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The practice of correcting defects in informations and complaints by amendment in the trial court, when properly called to its attention, has much to commend it. Thus delay and unnecessary expense can often be obviated.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>\n<em>Judgment reversed, and cause remanded, tvith leave to the State to apply for leave to amend its complaint within a reasonable time. If the State fails so to apply, let judgment on the verdict be arrested.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
