Promissory note\u2014When due\u2014Days or grace.\u2014A promissory note, which by its terms becomes clue on the first day of March, 1877, is, by virtue of the statute, entitled to days of grace, and the note is not due, for the purposes of instituting suit thereon, until the expiration of the last day of grace.

Practice\u2014How objection may be taken advantage op.\u2014A defendant is not required to raise the objection, that the note was not due at the time of commencement of the suit, by plea in abatement. The plaintiff must show an indebtedness at the time of bringing the suit, or he fails in his action.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-5\" pgmap=\"411\">3.

Bach note then constituted a separate demand. If the two notes when consolidated did not exceed the jurisdiction of the justice, then under the statute the plaintiff would be obliged to bring them both forward in one suit.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b411-6\" pgmap=\"411\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Warren county; the Hon.

Argall, 53 Ill. 307; Tisdale v. Minonk 46 Ill. 9; Gilmore v. McCullock, 26 Ill. 200.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-5\" pgmap=\"412\">That each note constituted a separate demand, and could be sued separately: Buckner v. Thompson, 11 Ill. 563; Mallock v. Krome, 78 Ill. 110.</p> <opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b412-6\" pgmap=\"412\">Pillsbury, J.</author> <p id=\"Aj1\" pgmap=\"412\">This suit was commenced before a justice of the peace of Warren county, upon the following promissory note:</p> <p id=\"b412-7\" pgmap=\"412\">\u201c $200. Denny, 111., Feb. 19,1876.</p> <p id=\"b412-8\" pgmap=\"412\">\u201c On or before the first day of March, A. D. 1877, for value received, we, or either of us-, promise to pay Almon Beecher the sum of two hundred dollars.</p> <p id=\"b412-9\" pgmap=\"412\">\u201cThis note given to secure the rent on 80 acres of land belonging to above-named party.</p> <p id=\"b412-10\" pgmap=\"412\">\u201cJames McCoy,</p> <p id=\"b412-11\" pgmap=\"412\">\u201cIndorsed: A. Beecher. Joseph McCoy.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b412-12\" pgmap=\"412\">Judgment was rendered by the justice against defendants, and they appealed to Circuit Court, where upon \u00e1 trial before the court, a jury being waived, a like result followed.</p> <p id=\"b412-13\" pgmap=\"412\">On the trial below, the defendants objected to the introduction of the note in evidence, on the ground that it was not due at time of the commencement of the suit, and in support of their objection read in evidence the summons issued by the justice, from which it appeared that the suit was commenced March 1, 1877.</p> <p id=\"b412-16\" pgmap=\"412\">Also the transcript of the justice, reciting issuing of summons March 2, 1877. The court- overruled the objection, and the defendants excepted, and assign the ruling of the court for error in this court.</p> <p id=\"b412-17\" pgmap=\"412\">This note was by virtue of the statute entitled to days of grace, and whether the summons or the transcrijit should control as to time of commencement of suit, is immaterial, as in either case the note was not due until the last day of grace, which was two days after suit was instituted.</p> <p id=\"b412-18\" pgmap=\"412\">In fact, it is admitted by the appellee that the suit was prematurely commenced, but claims that advantage should be taken of that by plea in abatement.</p> <p id=\"b412-19\" pgmap=\"412(11) 413(24)\">We do not so understand the law. A plaintiff is required to show that the defendant was indebted to him at the time of the commencement of the suit, or he fails in his action.</p> <p id=\"b413-4\" pgmap=\"413\">Our Supreme Court, in Hamlin, Hale &amp; Co. v. Race, 78 Ill. 422, say: \u201cWe had supposed no rule was more inflexible or better established than that a plaintiff cannot recover for money not due at the institution of the suit,\u201d and after citing various authorities, continue: \u201cIf this rule could be seriously questioned, other cases could be referred to as establishing the rule; but to our minds it requires no authority, as it is based upon principles obviously just.\u201d Daniels v. Osborn, 71 Ill. 169, is conclusive upon this point. It was asmmps\u00fc for goods sold and delivered, and non-assumpsit pleaded. The proof was that the goods were sold on credit, and the credit had not expired at the time of bringing suit. The court held that the suit was prematurely brought, and reversed the judgment.</p> <p id=\"b413-5\" pgmap=\"413\">There is no merit in the second point made by appellant. The two notes when consolidated exceeded the jurisdiction of the justice, therefore he could sue them separately before the same justice on the same day. Each note constituted a separate cause of action, and not one entire demand. The rule, therefore, that a party cannot split up an entire cause of action and maintain several suits thereon, does not apply: Buckner v. Thompson, 11 Ill. 564; Mallock v. Krome, 78 Ill. 110.</p> <p id=\"b413-6\" pgmap=\"413\">If these two notes had, when consolidated, not exceeded the jurisdiction of the justice, then under the statute the plaintiff would be obliged to bring them both forward in the one suit.</p> <p id=\"b413-7\" pgmap=\"413\">As the note was not due at the time of the institution of this suit, the plaintiff cannot recover. The judgment will be' reversed and cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b413-8\" pgmap=\"413\">Judgment reversed.,</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
