The loan was to be made by July 1st, and was to be used by Sheldon in paying off a prior mortgage on the land.</p> <p id=\"b552-7\" pgmap=\"552\">The purchase price was duly paid except the $1,900.</p> <p id=\"b552-8\" pgmap=\"552\">A short time after the sale, Convey expressed an unwillingness to pay the last installment of $1,900 by mortgaging the land on July 1st, because Montgomery\u2019s claim to the land could not be extinguished by that time, and before he made the loan he wanted Sheldon to perfect the title by compromise or otherwise, removing any claim that Montgomery had to it.</p> <p id=\"b552-9\" pgmap=\"552\">Thereupon it was agreed that the time for procuring the loan and paying the $1,900 to Sheldon should be extended until a settlement could be had with Montgomery and Convey should pay Sheldon interest on the money remaining due upon the land after July 1st.</p> <p id=\"b552-10\" pgmap=\"552\">The loan was perfected and the $1,900 paid to Sheldon on January 9th, 1878.</p> <p id=\"b552-11\" pgmap=\"552\">Convey refusing to pay the interest, this suit was brought by Sheldon, and he recovered in the court below the sum of $232.25.</p> <p id=\"b552-12\" pgmap=\"552\">The record does not show that Convey agreed to pay Sheldon any given rate of interest for the extension of the time. The law therefore declares that it shall be six per cent., and it is Sheldon\u2019s misfortune if he had to pay a greater rate upon the prior mortgage, ...</p> <p id=\"b553-4\" pgmap=\"553\">Sheldon is entitled to recover six per cent, interest on the $1,900, from July 1st, 1876, to the time it was paid, amounting to $73.85, and the appellee having remitted from the judgment all above that sum, the judgment will be affirmed for that amount; but as there was error in the record before the remittitur was entered, the costs of this court must be taxed to the appellee.</p> <p id=\"b553-5\" pgmap=\"553\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
