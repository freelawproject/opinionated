A. Holladay, his wife. All the expressions in the power of attorney are full and clear to this effect. Provision is even made for the death of one of the donors of the power, in-which event alone the power is to be exercised in the name of the survivor, clearly implying that before that event it is to be exercised in their joint names. . Hughes violated the spirit and letter of his warrant of attorney. The power which he exercised to sell the land of another was never created.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-7\">It is impossible to say that the deed was made in substantial compliance with the warrant of attorney.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-8\">The deed is not so much a departure from the mode prescribed of exercising a power, as the exercise of a power different from the one\u2019 conferred. The power was to make a deed in the name of two persons. The power exercised was the making of a deed in the name of one person. This was not a legal and valid compliance with the authority granted.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> An attorney acting under a written authority cannot substitute what in his judgment is substance for the forms required in the execution of the power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-9\">Nor can it be said that the legal title was in Holladay, and, therefore, that it was only necessary to execute a deed in his name. If Holladay owned the property, he had a perfect right to say upon what terms and with what forms it should be sold and conveyed. If he had provided in the power that the deed made under it should have three witnesses, the deed would not be valid with two. lie gave Hughes no authority to execute the deed in question. No inquiry can legally be made into Holladay\u2019s motives or reasons for requiring a joint deed in order to convey the property. Does the power of attorney require it? If so, and it was not done, that is the end of controversy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b621-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number><em>Mr. P.

In September following Hughes sold and conveyed in the name of Holladay alone, and as his attorney, the premises in controversy. The question presented is whether the deed thus executed in the individual name of Holladay, and not in the joint names of himself and wife, was sufficient to pass his title.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">In most of the States a married woman cannot, in the absence of statutory authority, execute, either alone or in connection with her husband, a valid power of attorney to convey her interest in real property. She can pass her interest only by uniting personally in a conveyance with her husband, and acknowledging upon a separate examination apart from him, before a public officer, that she executes the conveyance freely, without any fear of him, or compulsion from him. The private examination is required to protect her from the coercion or undue influence of her husband, and her acknowledgment is therefore considered as an essential preliminary to the validity of any transfer by her. The private examination is in its nature <em>personal; </em>it is a matter in which she cannot be represented by another. A privy acknowledgment by attorney, as observed by Bishop,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> would seem to involve a contradiction, and certainly would in a great degree defeat the object which her personal examination was intended to secure.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">\"Whether any statute exists in Colorado which authorizes a married woman to convey her interest in real property by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>attorney we are not informed. Counsel, whose attention was called on the argument to the matter, were not aware that any such statute exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Assuming, however, that such statute does exist, or that, without any such statute, the authority of a married woman to convey, in connection with her husband, which is conferred, implies a power to appoint an attorney for that purpose \u2014 and there are adjudged cases which proceed upon that theory \u2014 we do not see any objection to the validity of the deed actually executed.in the name of Holladay alone, or to its operation in passing the title. The wife of Holladay evidently joined in the power upon the supposition that she might, in case of surviving her husband, have a right of dower in the real property of which he was seized during her coverture, and that the release of such right might be required for an advantageous sale of the property. But in fact she could not in any event have had a right of dower in his real property in Colorado after its sale by him, although she did not unite in the sale. By a statute of that Territory the right of dower of the widow attaches only to lands of which the husband dies seized. Her joint execution with him, whether in person or by attorney, of the deed of the premises in controversy, would not therefore have imparted any greater interest, present or prospective, than his separate conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Undoubtedly it is a rule that a special power of attorney is to be strictly construed, so as to sanction only such acts as are clearly within its terms; but it is also a rule of equal potencj1 that the object of the parties is always to be kept in view, and where the language used will permit, that construction should be adopted which will carry out, instead.of defeating, the purpose of the appointment. Here the object, and the sole object, of the power was to enable the attorney to pass the title freed from any possible claim of the wife; and under the law of Colorado that result could be accomplished by the deed of the husband alone as fully without as with her signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">A power of attorney created by two or more persons pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>sessiug distinct interests in real property may,, of course, be so limited as to prevent a sale of the interest of either separately; but in the absence of qualifying terms, or other circumstances, thus restraining the authority of the attorney, a power to sell and convey real property, given by several parties, in general terms, as in the present case, is a power to sell and convey the interest of each, either jointly with the interests of the others, or by a separate instrument. The cases are numerous where a power given by several has been held invalid as to some of the parties, and yet sufficient to authorize a' transfer of the title of the others. The decision of those cases has proceeded on the doctrine stated, that where a power is given by several the interest of each in the property, to which the power refers, may be separately transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">It is proper to state that in sustaining the deed executed in the present case we confine ourselves to its operation in passing the existing title of Holladay. It contains a covenant of general warranty, and we express no opiuion on the question whether the power authorized the attorney to make any such covenant for his principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b621-11\"> On the Law of Married Women, $ 602.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u00a7\">\n<p id=\"b621-12\"><em> </em>Sumner <em>v. </em>Conant, 10 Vermont, 19; Mott <em>v. </em>Smith, 16 California, 533; Lewis <em>v. </em>Coxe, 5 Harrington, 401.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
