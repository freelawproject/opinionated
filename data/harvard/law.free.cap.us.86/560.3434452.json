M. Nunez and others, trading in partnership as I. M. Nunez &amp; Co. The action was assumpsit, and the suit was brought on the 10th of September, 1870. The declaration contained two counts. The first was upon an instrument described as a due bill, whereby the defendants acknowledged to be due and promised to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $1619.66. The second count claimed the same amount upon an account stated. It appeared by the bill of exceptions that upon the trial the plaintiff gave in evidence an instrument, which was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-7\">\u201cColumbus, Ga., September 1st, 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-8\">\u201cDue Joseph Dautel, or order, $1619.66, being balance of principal and interest for four j\u2019ears and six months' services.

Payment was not conditional to the extent of depending wholly and finally upon the alternatives mentioned. The stipulations secured to the defendants a reasonable amount of time within which to procure in one mode or the other the means necessary to meet the liability. Upon the occurrence of either of the events named or the lapse of such time, the debt became due. It could not have been the intention of the parties that if the crop were destroyed, or from any other cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>could never be sold, and the defendants could not procure the money from any other source,,the debt should never be paid. Such a result would be a mockery of justice.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The question of reasonable time, as the case was presented, was one to be determined by the court.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> When the suit was instituted more than five years had elapsed from the date of the instrument. This was much more than a reasonable time for the fulfilment of the undertaking of the defendants, and the plaintiff was entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The Circuit Court instructed the jury correctly, and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u00a7\">\n<p id=\"b574-13\"><em> Story on </em>Promissory Notes, \u00a7 27; Salinas <em>v. </em>Wright, 11 Texas, 575; Ex parte Tootell, 4 Vesey, 372.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AHZ\"> Hicks <em>v. </em>Shouse, 17 Ben Monroe, 487; Ubsdell et al. <em>v. </em>Cunningham, 22 Missouri, 124.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"Aqo\"> Frothingham <em>v. </em>Dutton, 2 Greenleaf, 255; Kingsley <em>v. </em>Wallis, 14 Maine, 57; Manning <em>v. </em>Sawyer, 1 Hawks, 37; Cocker et al. <em>v. </em>Franklin Hemp and Flax Manufacturing Company, 3 Sumner, 530.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
