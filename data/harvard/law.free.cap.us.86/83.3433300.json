The very purpose of the act was to enforce a gift. It requires a <em>donation.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-7\">But the money was not for <em>public use </em>within the legal signification of the terms. It was not to be paid into the treasury of the State, or to any State officer. It was not to be applied to the construction .of any work owned by the State or any political division thereof, or in which either has any legal interest. The money is to be taken from the owners of property in a particular town, and <em>given away </em>to a <em>private </em>corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-8\">For that the road to be constructed by the corporation is private property is obvious. Indeed the corporation has a vested right, by virtue of the act in question, if it be valid, to expel anj' person from the road who will not pay six cents per mile for riding in its cars thereon. The fact that the business of this corporation is to be that of a <em>common carrier of </em>persons and property for hire, and that as such the corporation is liable at common law to certaiu duties and responsibilities, and doubtless may be subjected by statute to others, does not make the road cease to be <em>private </em>property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>and its business <em>private, </em>and to be carried on for the private gain of its stockholders.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-5\">The occupation of an innkeeper is in the nature of a public employment. Inns are necessary for the accommodation of the public. The innkeeper is bound to receive all travellers who apply peaceably to be received as guests, so long as he has room ; and he is an insurer of the property of the guest. But the legislature has not power to order money to be levied upon the inhabitants of a locality and <em>given away </em>to a company, even to aid it iu the erection and maintenance of an inn.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-6\">So it may be for the public good that a factory be built and worked. Such enterprises as making railroads, opening good inns, building factories, &amp;c., \u2014 although done by individuals or corporations \u2014 may enhance the value of property and may tend to general prosperity. But this does not authorize the legislature, under the guise of an exercise of the taxing power, to compel citizens who are not regarded as public spirited to \u201c <em>donate\u201d </em>a portion of their property to individuals or corporations who propose to construct such works. There is a wide difference between exacting money from the citizen for <em>the use </em>of the State or a political division of it, and commanding him by legislative enactment to present to another individual or to a private corporation money to aid in constructing a work to be owned and worked by them for their private gain. This may be for the <em>public good, </em>but it <em>is not </em>taking the money for public <em>use.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-7\">2. Conceding the statute to be valid, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover in assumpsit. The interest warrants do not purport to be and were not made by or in the name of the town. There was no evidence of an}7 <em>promise </em>by the town to pay the amount sought to be recovered; and none from which a promise by the town could be implied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-8\">3. The town is not liable in its corporate capacity to an action at law for the non-payment of the instruments made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>and issued by the commissioners. The statute which authorized the money to be borrowed on the credit of the town and the instruments in question to be issued, prescribes how they shall be paid; and the holder must pursue the remedy prescribed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-5\">4. The bonds and coupons were disposed of by the commissioners in violation of the act of the legislature, and, therefore, the. plaintiff cannot recover. By the third section, the commissioners were required to dispose of the bonds for money at <em>not less than par, </em>and pay over the money to the company to aid in constructing the road. The commissioners raised no money on the bonds, but delivered them to the railroad\u2019 company, and the latter gave them to the plaintiff' and others who were contractors to build the road. The plaintiff' occupied no better position than the railroad corporation.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-6\">\n<em>Mr. G. Hughes, with whom was Mr. J. P.

There is no such prohibition to be found in the constitution of New York, and the courts of that State have many times held that the legislature has power to authorize cities and towns to subscribe for stock of a railroad corporation, to incur indebtedness for the subscription, and to impose taxes for the payment of the debt incurred. It is true no case in the highest court of that State has determined the precise question now presented, namely, whether a municipal corporation may be empowered to donate its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>bonds to a railroad company and collect taxes for the payment of the bonds. But subscriptions for stock, equally with donations, are outside of the ordinary purposes of such corporations, and the design of both is the same. It is to aid in the construction or maintenance of a public highway. It is for the promotion of a public use. The inducement to a subscription may be greater than the inducement to a donation. In the one case there may be a hope of reimbursement by the stock obtained ; in the other there can be no such expectation. In both, however, the warrant for the exercise of the power is the same. It may be that a mandatory statute requiring a municipal corporation to subscribe for stock in a railroad company, or to contribute to the construction of the railroad of such a company is not a legitimate exercise of legislative power, and that it is not even an act of legislation. This was decided by the Court of Appeals of New York in the case of <em>The People ex rel. </em>v. <em>Bacheler.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But the present is no such case. The legislative act by which the town of Queensbury was authorized to issue bonds in aid of the railroad from the village of Glenn\u2019s Falls to intersect with the Saratoga and Whitehall Railroad was not mandatory. It was merely enabling. It authorized the issue and donation of the bonds, if approved by a popular vote. It was a mere grant of power upon conditions, coupled with a prescription of the mode in which the power granted might be exercised. And that it was a constitutional exertion of legislative power must be considered as settled affirmatively by the decisions of this court in <em>Railroad Company </em>v. <em>The County of Otoe,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Olcott </em>v. <em>The Supervisors of Fond du Lac Counly.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It cannot, therefore, be maintained, as contended by the plaintiff in error, that the statute under which the coupons in suit were issued was transgressive of the power vested in the legislature. If the Court of Appeals of New York had decided otherwise we should feel constrained to follow its decision, but no such determination has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>It is next insisted that, even if the statute under which the bonds were issued be valid, an action of assumpsit cannot be brought to recover the sums due on the coupons. The reasons given in support of this proposition are that the coupons do not purport to be, and that they were not, made in the name of the town; and that the town is not liable to an action at law for the failure to pay the instruments made and issued by the commissioners designated by the statute. Neither of these reasons is well founded. The bonds to which the coupons were attached do purport to bind the town. They acknowledge that the town of Queensbury is indebted to the bearer or his assigns in the sum mentioned, for value received in money borrowed, payable on the 6th day of February, 1878, \u201cwith interest thereon at the rate of seven per cent., on presentation and delivery of the coupons for the.same, thereto attached.\u201d They are signed by the commissioners who v'ere' by the statute made agents of the town for issuing them, and they are countersigned by the clerk of the town of Queensbury. The coupons attached are all headed \u201cTown of Queensbury Interest Warrant.5-\u2019 They are in the form of orders drawn upon a bank, but signed by the commissioners as commissioners and attested by the town clerk. Very plainly, therefore, both the bonds and the interest warrants are evidence of indebtedness by the town. They appear to have been issued in strict compliance with all the requisitions of the statute. It is vain to say the statute imposed no duty upon the town or its officers. No oue can doubt that it is competent for the legislature to determine by what agents a municipal corporation shall exert its powers. The statute in question did designate the agents, and their acts, within the authority conferred, are binding upon their principal, upon the town of which they had been constituted the agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Equally untenable is the position that an action at law is not maintainable, because the holders of the bonds and coupons are entitled only to that remedy for a default of payment which is provided by the statute. There are cases, it is true, which hold that where a statute creates a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>and enjoins a duty, nothing may be done agreeably to the provisions of the common law to enforce the duty or assert the right further than is necessary to give effect to the statute. But we do not perceive that this principle has any bearing upon the present case. The fourth section of the act requires the commissioners designated as the agents of the town to report, annually, to the board of supervisors of the county, the amount required to pay the principal and interest on the bonds authorized to be issued, and makes it the duty of the supervisors to assess, levy, and collect of the real and personal property of the town of Queensbury, such sum or sums of money as shall have been reported to them by the commissioners. The money thus collected the supervisors are required to pay to the commissioners, to be applied by them to the payment of the bonds and interest. These are all directions given to the town and county officers and agents \u2014 not to the holders of the bonds and coupons. They prescribe duties to be performed after the amount of the debt due by the town has been ascertained, either by agreement or by judgment. That amount may be contested. It has been in this case. It could only be determined by an action at law. Only after such a determination could the commissioners report how much was required to be levied by taxation. The action, then, does not take the place of any remedy provided by the legislature. At most, it is a step to give effect to the statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The only other error assigned which requires notice is, that the court refused to direct a verdict for the defendants because the bonds were not disposed of by the commissioners at not less than par, because no money was received for them by the commissioners, and because they were delivered directly to the railroad company. But a delivery to the railroad company was plainly authorized by the act of the legislature. True, the commissioners were not at liberty to dispose of them for less than their par value, and they did not. Had they done so, and had the plaintiff not been a holder\u2014 without notice and for a valuable consideration \u2014 there might have been a defence to the action. The third section, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ever, empowered the commissioners to \u201c dispose of the bonds to such persons or corporation as they should deem most advantageous for tbe town, but not for less than par.\u201d And it required them not to pay over \u201c any money or bonds\u201d to tbe railroad corporation until certain satisfactory assurances should be furnished them. Thus it appears that delivery of the bonds to the railroad company was contemplated and authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">There is, therefore, no error in the record, and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b103-5\"> 8 Albany Law Journal, 120.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"Abn\"> 16 Wallace, 667.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b103-6\"> Ib. 678.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
