He pleaded to the jurisdiction, alleging that, immediately upon the commission of the assault, he had been placed in irons on board ship, for custody aiul to be forthcoming to answer any charge therefor, and was so kept until the vessel reached the <em>lower quarantine </em>anchorage in New York harbor, within the <em>Eastern </em>District of that State; that the vessel lay at anchor at such station for five days, during which he, being still in such custody, was delivered to the harbor police, officers of the State of New York, in order that he might be forthcoming, &amp;c.; and that they without process or warrant from any court carried him to the city of New York, where he was delivered over to the marshal of the United States for the <em>Southern </em>District of New York; and that a warraut for his arrest (being the first issued in this case) was afterwards duly issued to the said marshal; so that, upon the-whole, he had been appreheuded and brought first into the Eastern, and not into' the Southern District, and, therefore, could be tried only in the former district, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-6\">Upon demurrer, the following questions occurred, and the court certified a division upon them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-7\"><em>\u201c </em>1. Whether the prisoner, having been taken into custody by the master of an American vessel, while on her voyage, upon a charge of having, during the voyage, committed an offence against the United States on board such ship, upon the high seas and out of the limits of any State or district, and first brought, in such custody, into the Eastern District of New York, can be tried for such offence in the Southern District of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-8\">\u201c2. Whether the facts stated in the plea, show that the Southern District of New York is not the district in which the defendant was apprehended, within the meaning of the act of March 3d, 1825.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-9\">\u201c3. Whether the plea discloses that, within the meaning of the act of March 3d, 1825, the apprehension of the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>occurred either upon the high seas, or in the Eastern District of New York, and not in the Southern District of' New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-6\">\u201c4. Whether the act of March 3d, 1825, confers jurisdiction in the alternative, and enables this court to assume jurisdiction to try an indictment by reason of the fact that the defendant has been arrested in this district, upon the charge in the indictment contained, by an officer of the United States, as stated in the plea, notwithstanding it appears that the defendant was first brought into the Eastern District of New York.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-7\">The Eastern District of New York consists of the counties of Richmond, Queens, Kings, and Suffolk;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and by an act of 1865, establishing it,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> the jurisdiction of the court thereof over \u201cthe waters\u201d of such counties, excepting the county of Richmond, and \u201call matters made or done on such waters,\u201d is concurrent with that of the court of the Southern District.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b500-8\">\n<em>Mr. S. F. Phillips, Solicitor-General, for the United States.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-9\">I. The bringing of Arwo within the waters of the Eastern District is a \u201c matter done \u201d therein.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-10\">The first question certified does not define the place to which Arwo was brought as being within that part of the Eastern District over which the Southern has no jurisdiction. The division here is as to a \u201c matter done \u201d <em>in any pari </em>of the Eastern District, and, therefore, is to be settled by the act of 1865. There is nothing stated in the question to affect a concurrence of jurisdiction in the Southern District and the Eastern District over this offence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-11\">As regards the remaining three questions, the only fact as to the place contained in them additional to those in the first question, is as regards \u201c lower quarantine.\u201d Now this court has no judicial knowledge as to where lower quarantine is, except so far as its situation is fixed by the plea and the corresponding admission in the demurrer;<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> that is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>say, that it is within the Eastern District, but within which one of the four counties it is, there is nothing in the law or the record to show. If the present matter of first bringing Arwo was so done as to confer jurisdiction upon the courts of the Eastern District, then, by the act of 1865, it did so equally upon the Southern, unless it occurred within Richmond County. It was the business of the plea to draw this distinction. It has not drawn the required distinction. The plea is one of a class which must be \u201ccertain to every intent;\u201d \u201c that is, must have such technical accuracy as is not liable to the most subtle and scrupulous objection.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-6\">Because of the <em>concurrence </em>of jurisdiction above specified, the first question is to be answered affirmatively; and the others are to be met by a general objection that under the statements of the plea they are merely abstract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-7\">II. It may be, however, that the court will feel at liberty to express an opinion upon all the questions intended to be raised; and so we discuss their merits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-8\">Some courts hold that in cases presenting <em>both </em>of the local features described in that part of the act given above (p. 486) in italics (viz., <em>two </em>districts, one of apprehension, and another, that into which the accused was <em>first brought), </em>the prosecutors have a choice, and may institute proceedings in either indifferently. Others, that, in such cases, there is but one place for trial, to wit, the district into which the accused is first brought; that the other district is mentioned as a place of trial only where there is in the case no district into which the accused has been brought, i. <em>e., ex gr., </em>in cases where, having come voluntarily into the United States, he is after-wards apprehended, &amp;c. In these latter cases, the apprehension spoken of is plainly an apprehension under Federal authority. But there was no such apprehension here. Arwo was apprehended under ordinary ship police on board of a private vessel. There was no Federal color or element in his apprehension until that by the marshal of the Southern District.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-9\">But if this were otherwise, then, upon general principles, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>there is no reason for holding in such cases, that the act of 1790 does not give to the prosecution an unrestricted choice of districts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-4\">As regards the defendant, the provision, in any sense, is merely <em>positive.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-5\">On the other hand, it seems unreasonable to say that the statute meant to compel prosecutor and witnesses, and perhaps the ship besides, to lay up, at a quarantine anchorage as here, or as the case might make it, at a port of refuge or of repair, merely because they were so unfortunate as accidentally to be on a ship with a felon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-6\">We, therefore, suggest, under this branch of the argument, that the first and fourth questions certified be answered in the affirmative, and the second and third, in the <em>negative.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AxG\">\n<em>No opposing counsel.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b498-12\"> 4 Stat. at Large, 115, \u00a7 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b498-13\"> Act of April 30th, 1790, \u00a7 8; 1 Id. 113.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b500-12\"> Richmond County is Staten Island.
