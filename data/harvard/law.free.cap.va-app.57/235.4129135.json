Montalbano, claimant, appeals a decision of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (commission), that denied him benefits, finding that his termination from employment was for justified cause. Claimant also contends the commission erred in finding he is not entitled to an award of permanent partial disability based upon a 46% impairment rating to his right arm. For the reasons stated, we affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">On July 28, 2006, claimant sustained a compensable injury by accident to both wrists. As a result, he received various disability awards, the last being a temporary partial disability award beginning November 29, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">Claimant\u2019s August 26, 2008 claim seeking permanent partial disability was defended by Richmond Ford, LLC (employer), which alleged claimant refused selective employment and/or was terminated from light duty for justified cause on July 28, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">Claimant had worked for employer for 28 years prior to the compensable injury, approximately 15 or 16 years as an auto technician and approximately six years as a group leader.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>After wrist fusion surgery, claimant accepted a light-duty job in June 2007, working for employer in the detail shop. Several months later, he was promoted to manager of that shop, supervising between six and ten people. Claimant testified he was given no job description or training for that position. In his previous capacity with employer, he had no authority to discipline employees, although as manager of the detail shop, he had full authority to hire, discipline, and discharge employees under his supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Employer had a written policy prohibiting harassment, which stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">Richmond Ford, LLC does not and will not tolerate harassment of our employees. The term \u201charassment\u201d includes, but is not limited to: slurs, jokes, and other verbal, graphic, or physical conduct relating to an individual\u2019s race, color, sex, religion, national origin, citizenship, age or handicap. \u201cHarassment\u201d also includes sexual advances, request for sexual favors, unwelcome or offensive touching, and other verbal, graphic, or physical conduct of a sexual nature. VIOLATION OF THIS POLICY WILL SUBJECT AN EMPLOYEE TO DISCIPLINARY ACTION, UP TO AND INCLUDING IMMEDIATE DISCHARGE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Claimant indicated he had signed this policy statement on February 2, 2003 and admitted attending a presentation in January 2008 entitled, \u201cMaintaining Respect in the Workplace: Understanding and Prevent [sic] Harassment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Claimant testified he understood he was not to verbally embarrass or humiliate his employees, yet he stated his managers cursed and belittled him with impunity. He testified this behavior prevailed throughout the entire dealership. He related several incidents where his supervisor, Mark Higgins, cursed at him. On another occasion, according to claimant, the commercial truck manager cursed at claimant while a customer was present. Claimant was not aware of any disciplinary action taken concerning these incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Mark Higgins, claimant\u2019s immediate supervisor, related an incident from April 2008 where an employee came to Higgins, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>crying and shaking because claimant had screamed at him. That employee was so upset by claimant\u2019s behavior that he could no longer work that day. Higgins characterized the employee as \u201cdestroyed\u201d by claimant\u2019s verbal attack. Higgins counseled claimant about his conduct, advising claimant to control himself. Higgins indicated claimant admitted he had an \u201canger control\u201d problem. Higgins warned claimant that his behavior was considered harassment and intimidation. Higgins also told claimant that if such behavior continued, his job would be in jeopardy. He suggested claimant seek professional help. Higgins related another incident, occurring in June 2006, when claimant screamed at another one of his employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">At the hearing before the deputy, claimant admitted he had been counseled on at least two occasions by his supervisor, Mark Higgins, regarding improper treatment of employees under claimant\u2019s supervision. Specifically, claimant was to \u201cwatch\u201d what he said to his employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Sometime prior to July 25, 2008, claimant had a confrontation with S.L. The encounter caused S.L. to be upset and visibly shaken. S.L. told Higgins he could not work in that environment, and Higgins allowed S.L. to leave work for the day. Claimant explained that he only raised his voice because of the noise level in the shop. Higgins counseled claimant about this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">On July 25, 2008, claimant returned to the detail shop from another assignment and found his employees not working. He admonished them to return to work. Later that day, claimant and S.L. argued as to a missing part of a tool. S.L. testified that during this argument, claimant lost his temper and said S.L. was \u201cnothing but a mother-f- common dog.\u201d Claimant admitted calling S.L. a \u201ccommon dog\u201d but denied using the expletive. Claimant later apologized to S.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Claimant was discharged on July 28, 2008 for harassing his co-workers. The employer\u2019s \u201ctermination report\u201d indicated claimant\u2019s supervisor had received numerous complaints about claimant verbally harassing other employees and that claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>had a temper control issue. The report said claimant had been counseled \u201cnumerous times\u201d concerning his treatment of his employees and was told such conduct would not be tolerated. The report then recited claimant\u2019s July 25 confrontation with S.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The deputy commissioner found that claimant was terminated for \u201cjustified cause\u201d because his actions were \u201cso recurrent as to manifest a willful disregard of those interests and the duties and obligations he owes to his employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The full commission affirmed the deputy, finding claimant was terminated for violating employer\u2019s policy against verbal harassment of other employees. It further found claimant had been verbally counseled on at least two occasions about the use of profanity, yelling and screaming at his employees, and had failed to reform his behavior. The commission found claimant\u2019s wage loss was properly attributable to his -wrongful acts and concluded that claimant was responsible for those wrongful actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Claimant had previously sustained a compensable injury to both -wrists on July 28, 2006. In his claim for benefits, claimant described his injury as the hyperextension of both wrists. Claimant was treated by Dr. John E. Blank, an orthopedist. Dr. Blank diagnosed claimant with a right greater than left wrist scapholunate ligament tear, triangle fibrocartilage tear, and osseous wrist bone contusions. Dr. Blank performed several surgeries on claimant\u2019s right wrist to repair the injury and to relieve pain. On June 5, 2008, claimant underwent a functional capacity evaluation (FCE) and impairment rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">On June 12, 2008, Dr. Blank reviewed the FCE and permanent rating evaluation. He opined that the permanent impairment rating confirmed that \u201che has 22% loss of the right hand and 30% loss of the right wrist, 2% loss of the right elbow, which converts to 46% impairment of the right upper extremity and 28% impairment of the whole person with 0% impairment of the left upper extremity.\u201d Dr. Blank concluded that claimant made a valid effort at the FCE and was found to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>capable of occasionally lifting up to 30 pounds, pushing, pulling, and carrying.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Dr. Blank, in a questionnaire completed on October 23, 2008, opined that claimant had reached maximum medical improvement with respect to his right upper extremity injury of July 28, 2006. He stated that the claimant\u2019s fusion plate could be removed in the future if symptomatic, but there were no current plans for additional surgical treatment. He agreed that the claimant has a 46% permanent disability rating to his right upper extremity as a result of the July 28, 2006 work accident. Dr. Blank concluded that claimant could not return to his pre-injury job as an auto mechanic, noting that appellant is only capable of performing medium, not heavy, physical work.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Dr. Stephen Leibovic, an independent medical examiner, performed an examination of the claimant on December 2, 2008. Dr. Leibovic reviewed claimant\u2019s medical records and performed an x-ray. He was not certain that the wrist was completely fused, and he believed that the claimant was suffering from extensor tendon tendonitis over the plate. He stated, \u201cI believe if we can prove that the fusion is healed completely that the plate should be removed.\u201d He thought this would provide additional comfort and at the same time \u201ca radial styloidectomy should be performed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Dr. Leibovic further opined that the claimant had not yet reached maximum medical improvement. He believed it prudent to assess the integrity of the fusion and then remove the plate when indicated, as well as performing the radial styloidectomy. He assessed the claimant as having a 45% permanent partial impairment rating of the right upper extremity as a result of the July 28, 2006 injury, based upon his wrist fusion, his limited digital range of motion, and in part on his decrease in strength. He recommended that the claimant lift no more than 15 pounds with his right hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Dr. Blank reviewed Dr. Leibovic\u2019s report and indicated a radial styloidectomy might relieve claimant\u2019s pain but would not guarantee functional improvement. Dr. Blank continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>to favor waiting 18-24 months before considering the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The commission denied claimant permanent partial disability benefits, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">On review we find that the evidence is in equipoise about whether the claimant has reached maximum medical improvement, with Dr. Leibovic stating that the claimant has not yet reached MMI after four wrist surgeries, and Dr. Blank stating that he has. The claimant had not borne his burden of proof of maximum medical improvement. His claim is held in abeyance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\n<em>Termination for Justified Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">On appeal, claimant advances a number of reasons why his termination was not \u201cjustified.\u201d He argues that he did not violate the company policy against harassment since that policy was limited to harassment based on race, national origin, or sex, that his behavior was the norm in his workplace, that even if the policy encompassed abusive language, that policy was not enforced by employer, and that his behavior on July 25, 2008 was an isolated act.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">\u201cOn appeal from a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence are viewed in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below.\u201d <em>Artis v. Ottenberg\u2019s Bakers, Inc., </em>45 Va.App. 72, 83, 608 S.E.2d 512, 517 (2005) <em>(en banc). </em>Furthermore, \u201cwe are bound by the commission\u2019s findings of fact as long as \u2018there was credible evidence presented such that a reasonable mind <em>could </em>conclude that the fact in issue was proved,\u2019 even if there is evidence in the record that would support a contrary finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83-84, 608 S.E.2d at 517 (quoting <em>Westmoreland Coal Co. v. Campbell, </em>7 Va.App. 217, 222, 372 S.E.2d 411, 415 (1988)). However, \u201cwe review questions of law <em>de novo.\u201d Rusty\u2019s Welding </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number><em>Serv., Inc. v. Gibson, </em>29 Va.App. 119, 127, 510 S.E.2d 255, 259 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u201c[A]n employee on selective employment offered or procured by the employer, who is discharged for cause and for reasons not concerning the disability, forfeits his or her right to compensation benefits like any other employee who loses employment benefits when discharged for cause.\u201d <em>Timbrook v. O\u2019Sullivan Corp., </em>17 Va.App. 594, 597, 439 S.E.2d 873, 875 (1994); <em>see also Marval Poultry Co. v. Johnson, </em>224 Va. 597, 601, 299 S.E.2d 343, 345 (1983). The rationale behind this rule is that \u201c[t]he employee is responsible for that loss and not the employer.\u201d <em>Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co. v. Murphy, </em>12 Va.App. 633, 640, 406 S.E.2d 190, 193 (1991). However, \u201c[a]n employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits will be permanently forfeited only when the employee\u2019s dismissal is \u2018justified,\u2019 the same as any other employee who forfeits her employment benefits when discharged for a \u2018justified\u2019 reason.\u201d <em>Eppling v. Schultz Dining Programs, </em>18 Va.App. 125, 128, 442 S.E.2d 219, 221 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\"><em>Eppling </em>distinguished termination for \u201cjustified cause\u201d and termination for \u201ccause.\u201d Eppling was terminated for absenteeism caused by non-work-related health problems. The issue was whether Eppling could \u201ccure\u201d her \u201crefusal\u2019\u2019 of selective employment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> thus allowing her to receive benefits. Finding Eppling\u2019s termination was not a \u201cjustified cause,\u201d we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">A \u201cjustified\u201d discharge (one which warrants forever barring reinstatement of workers\u2019 compensation benefits) does not simply mean that the employer can identify or assign a reason attributable to the employee as the cause for his or her being discharged. Whether the reason for the discharge is for \u201ccause,\u201d <em>see Murphy, </em>12 Va.App. at 639, 406</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>S.E.2d at 193, or is \u201cjustified\u201d for purposes of forfeiting benefits must be determined in the context of the purpose of the [Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act and whether the conduct is of such a nature that it warrants a permanent forfeiture of those rights and benefits. [T]he Commission ... must be mindful of the purposes and goals of the Act. <em>[Richmond Cold Storage Co. </em>v.] <em>Burton, </em>1 Va.App. [106,] 111, 335 S.E.2d [847,] 850 [ (1985) ].</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">We concluded that while Eppling\u2019s employer had \u201ccause\u201d for termination, her absences were due to health problems, and not due to \u201cwrongful acts\u201d that \u201cjustified\u201d her dismissal so as to permanently bar her from benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u201c[I]t is not necessary to prove \u2018that the employee\u2019s wrongful act was intentional, willful, or deliberate in order to justify a termination for cause and a forfeiture of compensation benefits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Artis, </em>45 Va.App. at 85, 608 S.E.2d at 518 (quoting <em>Walter Reed Convalescent Ctr. v. Reese, </em>24 Va.App. 328, 336-37, 482 S.E.2d 92, 97 (1997)). \u201cRather, all that is required is a showing: (1) that the wage loss is \u2018properly attributable\u2019 to the wrongful act;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) that the employee is \u2018responsible\u2019 for that wrongful act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Reese, </em>24 Va.App. at 336, 482 S.E.2d at 97).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Our inquiry, then, is whether claimant\u2019s continued harassment of his subordinates, including repetitive abusive lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>guage, constitutes \u201cjustified cause\u201d for termination thus barring any award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">We find it does. In the context of unemployment benefits, we have addressed factors to determine whether abusive language constitutes willful misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Such factors include the severity of the language used; the quantity of the language used, i.e., whether it w\u00e1s a lengthy barrage or a brief incident; whether the language was spoken in the presence of customers, clients or other employees; whether the employee had a record of misconduct; whether prior warnings were given regarding employee\u2019s conduct; and whether the language was provoked by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\"><em>Kennedy\u2019s Piggly Wiggly Stores v. Cooper, </em>14 Va.App. 701, 706, 419 S.E.2d 278, 281 (1992) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">We find these factors are equally applicable in evaluating whether abusive language is \u201cjustified cause\u201d for termination. Here, claimant\u2019s outbursts were not isolated or provoked. He had been counseled on his inappropriate behavior and had, in fact, been warned that termination could result for continued behavior. Further, this language, on more than one occasion, had great impact on his subordinates\u2019 ability to perform their jobs. The fact that no customers heard these outbursts does not, under these facts, mitigate his behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">We therefore conclude that claimant\u2019s repetitive harassment of his subordinates through anger and abusive language was \u201cjustified cause\u201d for his termination, thereby justifying a forfeiture of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">Claimant further maintains because his behavior was not \u201cmisconduct\u201d under <em>Murphy, </em>he is not barred from receiving benefits because he \u201ccured\u201d his \u201crefusal\u201d of selective employment under Code \u00a7 65.2-510.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since we have determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>claimant was terminated for \u201cjustified cause,\u201d he cannot \u201ccure\u201d his \u201crefusal\u201d of selective employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Claimant also argues he violated no company policy because the written policy is limited to harassment based on race, color, sex, religion, national origin, citizenship, age or handicap. This contention ignores the clear language in the written policy that prohibits all harassment. The policy states that \u201c[t]he term harassment includes but is not limited to ...\u201d and then provides specific language prohibiting harassment based on race, color, etc. The latter phrase does not limit the prohibition on all harassment. Additionally, claimant was counseled several times on harassment and his use of abusive language. The commission properly concluded claimant was terminated for violating company policy against harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Next, claimant contends even if he violated company policy this policy was not enforced because others used abusive language and such language was the norm in the workplace. However, claimant, in his brief, never developed this argument nor cited any cases to support that position.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rule 5A:20 requires that an appellant\u2019s opening brief contain the \u201cprinciples of law, the argument, and the authorities relating to each question presented.\u201d Pursuant to that rule, we have held that \u201c[ujnsupported assertions of error \u2018do not merit appellate consideration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 730, 734, 660 S.E.2d 343, 345 (2008) (quoting <em>Buchanan v. Buchanan, </em>14 Va.App. 53, 56, 415 S.E.2d 237, 239 (1992)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Moreover, \u201cwhen a party\u2019s \u2018failure to strictly adhere to the requirements of Rule 5A:20(e)\u2019 is significant, \u2018the Court of Appeals may ... treat a question presented as waived.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parks v. Parks, </em>52 Va.App. 663, 664, 666 S.E.2d 547, 548 (2008) (quoting <em>Jay v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 510, 520, 659 S.E.2d 311, 317 (2008)). We therefore find appellant\u2019s failure is significant, and we consider this argument waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Finally, appellant argues that because he received no written reprimand, his actions were not sufficient to support termination for \u201cjustified cause.\u201d Yet, appellant does not dispute that he received a number of oral reprimands. He cites <em>Food Lion v. Newsome, </em>30 Va.App. 21, 515 S.E.2d 317 (1999), to support his position. However, appellant\u2019s argument isolates language in <em>Newsome </em>that has no bearing on his position. In determining Newsome had cured his refusal of selective employment, this Court, in reciting background facts, stated that Newsome had received six \u201cconstructive advice\u201d memos. Whether the reprimands were oral or written was not part of the <em>Newsome </em>analysis. Therefore, appellant cites no relevant case law to support his contention that reprimands must be written. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:20(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\n<em>Permanent Partial Disability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Claimant contends the commission erred in finding he is not entitled to an award of permanent partial disability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, he maintains the commission erroneously concluded he did not prove he had reached maximum medical improvement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Permanent partial disability benefits are \u201cnot awardable 'until the injury has reached a state of permanency, i.e. maximum improvement, when the degree of loss may be medically ascertained.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown v. United Airlines, Inc., </em>34 Va.App. 273, 277, 540 S.E.2d 521, 523 (2001) (quoting <em>County of Spotsylvania v. Hart, </em>218 Va. 565, 568, 238 S.E.2d 813, 815 (1977)). \u201c[I]t must appear both that the partial incapacity is permanent and that the injury has reached maximum medical improvement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u201c[A]n employee has reached maximum medical improvement if no reasonable expectation exists that the employee will obtain further functional improvement from medical treatment, even though the injury remains symptomatic and disabling.\u201d <em>Gunst v. Childress, </em>29 Va.App. 701, 707, 514 S.E.2d 383, 386 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The commission\u2019s determination whether maximum medical improvement has been reached is a factual finding. <em>See Cafaro Construction Co. v. Strother, </em>15 Va.App. 656, 660, 426 S.E.2d 489, 492 (1993). Pursuant to statute, the commission\u2019s factual findings are conclusive and binding on this Court when those findings are based on credible evidence. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-706; <em>McCaskey v. Patrick Henry Hospital, </em>225 Va. 413, 415, 304 S.E.2d 1, 2 (1983). In conducting our review, \u201cwe are required to construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the party who prevailed before the commission.\u201d <em>Gunst, </em>29 Va.App. at 707, 514 S.E.2d at 386 (citing <em>Crisp v. Brown\u2019s Tysons Comer Dodge, Inc., </em>1 Va.App. 503, 504, 339 S.E.2d 916, 916 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The claimant has the burden of proving maximum medical improvement. <em>See Mercy Tidewater Ambulance Service v. Carpenter, </em>29 Va.App. 218, 228, 511 S.E.2d 418, 422 (1999) (\u201cbecause claimant failed to show that he had reached maximum medical improvement, the commission was precluded from determining claimant\u2019s permanent loss of function\u201d). The commission had no authority to make an award for permanent injury without medical evidence that claimant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>achieved maximum medical improvement. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Hart, </em>218 Va. at 568, 238 S.E.2d at 815).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">The term \u201cburden of proof\u2019 actually refers to two separate burdens: the burden of producing evidence and the burden of persuasion. When a party has the burden of producing evidence on an issue, that party should receive an adverse ruling on the issue as a matter of law unless he or she produces evidence which a reasonable mind <em>could </em>accept as proof of the fact in issue. If the party with the burden of production meets this standard, he or she is entitled to have the finder of fact then determine whether he or she has met the applicable burden of persuasion. In the paradigm civil case, there is no special burden of production (the proponent of the issue simply must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding on that issue), and the burden of persuasion is proof by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See generally Bacon v. Bacon, </em>3 Va.App. 484, 488, 351 S.E.2d 37, 39-40 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\"><em>Campbell, </em>7 Va.App. at 222, 372 S.E.2d at 415 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The commission found the conflicting medical testimony as to whether claimant had reached maximum medical improvement was in equipoise. <em>See Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 9-10, 602 S.E.2d 402, 406 (2004) (defining equipoise as when the facts are \u201cequally susceptible to two or more constructions\u201d (citing <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 764, 772, 71 S.E.2d 73, 77 (1952))). In this case, the commission concluded claimant failed to meet his burden of proof. We find no error in this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Clearly, claimant met his burden of production. Dr. Blank opined that claimant had achieved maximum medical improvement. However, the commission found claimant had not met his burden of persuasion. Claimant did not convince the fact finder that Dr. Blank\u2019s opinion was more credible or should have been afforded more weight than Dr. Leibovic\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao5\">The determination whether the employer has met this burden is made by the [cjommission after exercising its role as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>finder of fact. In this role, the [c]ommission resolves all conflicts in the evidence and determines the weight to be accorded the various evidentiary submissions. \u201cThe award of the [cjommission ... shall be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A); <em>Falls Church Constr. Co. v. Laidler, </em>254 Va. 474, 478-79, 493 S.E.2d 521, 524 (1997); <em>Ivey v. Puckett Constr. Co., </em>230 Va. 486, 488, 338 S.E.2d 640, 641 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><em>Bass v. City of Richmond Police Dep\u2019t., </em>258 Va. 103, 114, 515 S.E.2d 557, 563 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Claimant was unable to convince the commission that his medical evidence should be afforded greater weight than the conflicting medical testimony presented by employer. Therefore, he failed to carry his burden of persuasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Nonetheless, claimant asserts that the commission misinterprets Dr. Leibovic\u2019s independent medical examination opinion that suggested the possibility of further treatment. Claimant argues the commission ignored that the proposed treatment suggested by Dr. Leibovic would not improve claimant\u2019s function of his upper extremity, but would only relieve pain. Therefore, there is no evidence, claimant argues, that functional improvement will ever result from any future treatment. Thus, claimant concludes, the evidence is not in equipoise.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">This position is belied by Dr. Leibovic\u2019s opinion. Claimant\u2019s argument is premised on a selection of isolated statements. Dr. Leibovic noted an enlargement and a bone spur at the radial styloid, suggesting the need for a radial styloidectomy. He also opined that if the fusion is complete, the fusion plate should be removed, thus providing \u201cadditional comfort.\u201d Dr. Leibovic concluded that he did not believe claimant had reached maximum medical improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Interestingly, in Dr. Blank\u2019s response to Dr. Leibovic\u2019s opinion, he agrees with Dr. Leibovic that removal of the fusion plate would \u201chelp with extreme tendonitis symptoms.\u201d When asked whether radial styloidectomy would result in any significant functional improvement, Dr. Blank answered, \u201cpain relief perhaps, but unable to guarantee functional improvement.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>In any event, he indicated he favored waiting 18-24 months before performing either procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Dr. Blank did not opine the radial styloidectomy would not result in any significant functional improvement, only that he could not guarantee that result. Therefore, he did not refute Dr. Leibovic\u2019s opinion that claimant had not reached maximum medical improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">There was evidence to support the medical opinions of both doctors. As the evidence was in equipoise, we find the commission did not err in concluding claimant failed to meet his burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Because claimant has not proven maximum medical improvement, an award of permanent partial disability is premature. This issue is left open for future determination. <em>See Carpenter, </em>29 Va.App. at 228, 511 S.E.2d at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The commission did not err in denying claimant benefits. The commission correctly upheld the deputy commissioner\u2019s determination that claimant was terminated for justified cause. The commission also properly concluded that claimant did not prove he had achieved maximum medical improvement. We therefore affirm the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\">. Being terminated for cause is the equivalent of refusing selective employment. <em>See Artis, </em>45 Va.App. at 91, 608 S.E.2d at 521 (\"A disabled employee who engages in voluntary misconduct is deemed to have constructively refused an offer of selective employment, thereby justifying a forfeiture of benefits.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\">. Virginia courts have considered various acts which provide \"justified\u201d cause for termination. <em>See Marval Poultry, </em>224 Va. 597, 299 S.E.2d 343 (finding that dishonesty provided justified cause); <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Watson, </em>219 Va. 830, 252 S.E.2d 310 (1979) (holding that frequent absences, poor work performance and attitude gave justified cause); <em>Artis, </em>45 Va.App. 72, 608 S.E.2d 512 (concluding that staging a robbery and committing attempted murder equaled justified cause); <em>Richfood v. Williams, </em>20 Va.App. 404, 457 S.E.2d 417 (1995) (ruling that the failure to pass a drug test upon which employment was conditioned provided justified cause).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\">. Claimant does not claim that he was terminated because of any disability related to the compensable injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b295-10\">. Code \u00a7 65.2-510 states in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">A. If an injured employee refuses employment procured for him suitable to his capacity, he shall only be entitled to the benefits \u2022provided for in \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-503 and 65.2-603, excluding vocational reha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>bilitation services provided for in subdivision A 3 of \u00a7 65.2-603, during the continuance of such refusal, unless in the opinion of the Commission such refusal was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">B. If an injured employee cures his unjustified refusal by accepting employment suitable to his capacity at a wage less than that originally offered, the employer shall pay or cause to be paid to the injured employee during his partial incapacity pursuant to \u00a7 65.2-502, a weekly compensation equal to 66 2/3 percent of the difference between his average weekly wages before his injury and the average weekly wage the employee would have earned by accepting the original proffered light duty employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b296-8\">. At oral argument, appellant conceded that he did not develop this specific argument in his brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\">. Termination for \"justified cause\u201d does not bar a claimant from an award of permanent partial disability. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-503.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b297-8\">. While the deputy denied permanent partial disability because claimant's injury was limited to his right wrist, and not to his right upper extremity, the commission\u2019s review opinion did not address that aspect of the deputy's opinion. The only issue before this Court is whether claimant met his burden to show he has achieved maximum medical improvement. We cannot consider alleged error on a ruling the commission never made. <em>See Paul Johnson Plastering v. Johnson, </em>265 Va. 237, 243 n. 4, 576 S.E.2d 447, 451 n. 4 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
