Newman Tire Co., </em>51 Va.App. 252, 255, 656 S.E.2d 431, 433 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Matthew Alson Thorpe owned a self-storage facility and operated a side business known as Alson\u2019s Ornamental Iron. Eric McMahon worked for Alson\u2019s Ornamental Iron. He and Thorpe performed \u201cresidential ornamental iron work\u201d which mostly involved constructing railings on home porches. App. at 48. One of Thorpe\u2019s self-storage customers, John Clary, asked Thorpe if he and McMahon would complete the construction of an unfinished metal building for a fixed sum of $5,000. Though neither Thorpe nor McMahon had done this work before, they agreed to take the job. Clary memorialized the contract by using soapstone to -write $5,000 on a shop worktable.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">\u201cIt was a slow time for [Thorpe\u2019s] work,\u201d McMahon testified, \u201cWe had a break between jobs.\u201d App. at 69. They agreed to Clary\u2019s fixed-price contract \u201c[j]ust to keep busy, make some money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Clary did not specify how the $5,000 would be divided between McMahon and Thorpe. Among themselves, however, McMahon and Thorpe agreed to split the sum equally. Clary said he wanted the job completed in one week but made clear the $5,000 would only be paid when the job was finished no matter how long it took.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Part of the job required Thorpe and McMahon to install metal roofing sheets. Shortly after starting the work, Thorpe fell through a skylight to his death. His widow, Alissa Thorpe, filed a claim for benefits asserting her husband was employed by Clary and sustained a fatal accident arising out of and in the course of that employment. She alleged Thorpe\u2019s $2,500 share of the $5,000 contract payment should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>be considered his \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">After reviewing the evidence, a deputy commissioner wrote to counsel and advised that the evidentiary record was incomplete on the issue of Thorpe\u2019s average weekly wage. The deputy commissioner explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">I confess that though I have scoured the record to access all the information available to make a proper determination of the average weekly wage of Mr. Thorpe, pursuant to \u00a7 65.2-101, the evidence is limited. For that reason, I invite your input as to whether there needs to be a reconvening of the hearing for that limited issue, or, if both parties are in agreement that no further evidence should come into the record, for your position statements on the determination of the average weekly wage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">App. at 109. The claimant\u2019s counsel wrote back stating \u201cno further evidence needs to be entered into evidence\u201d and the matter should be addressed on the existing evidentiary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The deputy commissioner held the evidentiary record was too incomplete to justify the conclusion that the $2,500 payment on a one-time construction project (which might or might not have lasted a week) could be extrapolated into Thorpe\u2019s <em>average </em>weekly wage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">Here the Commission is given no other wage guidance for Thorpe, no evidence of the weekly pay of [Clary\u2019s full-time employee], only that Thorpe and McMahon were to each receive $2,500.00 for the anticipated one week of work---There is no evidence that Thorpe and/or McMahon were averaging $2,500.00 per week before the accident or that they would be, or had any expectancy of, so earning that the weeks following May 26, 2006.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-12\"><em>Thorpe v. Clary, </em>VWC No. 228-88-61, 2010 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 235, at *2-3 (Apr. 27, 2010) (quoting deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion). The claimant\u2019s argument, the deputy commissioner concluded, was factually insupportable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-13\">To isolate this one week\u2019s high pay (with the unusual hiring incentive circumstances surrounding it) and now deem that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>amount a realistic loss \u201cwere it not for the injury\u201d is ... exalting \u201csome theoretical concept of loss of earning capacity\u201d over \u201ca realistic judgment on what the claimant\u2019s future loss is in the light of all the factors that are known.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-5\"><em>Id. </em>at *3. Rather than rejecting outright the claimant\u2019s evidence of lost wages, however, the deputy commissioner divided the $2,500 by 52 weeks and used the fraction as the decedent\u2019s average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The claimant appealed to the full commission. By a split vote, the commission agreed with the deputy commissioner. \u201cUnder the facts of this case,\u201d the commission concluded, \u201cwe believe that the sum of $2,500 does not accurately and fairly reflect the claimant\u2019s average weekly wage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Applying its precedent involving a similar fact pattern, <em>Bentley v. Cnty. of Tazewell, </em>VWC No. 237-63-34, 2009 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 225 (2009), the commission explained its reasoning this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">There was no evidence within the record that the decedent had anticipated any further jobs from the employer. The decedent had never worked for the employer and had never attempted this particular type of work prior to beginning this job. The claimant may have had other employment; however, the record shows that this employment was dissimilar to the employment in which he was working at the time of his death and, thus, any earnings from that employment could not be used to calculate the average weekly wage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-8\"><em>Thorpe, </em>2010 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 235, at *7. The commission took note of the deputy commissioner\u2019s \u201cunusual\u201d but \u201cperfectly reasonable\u201d offer \u2014 which the claimant\u2019s counsel did not accept \u2014 to reopen the evidentiary record and supplement the factual presentation on the wage issue. <em>Id. </em>at *8.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">A dissenting commissioner voted to reverse. As she viewed the evidence, the one-time payment of $2,500 could be deemed the average weekly wage Thorpe would have earned in the future had the accident not occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">Advocating the dissenting commissioner\u2019s reasoning, the claimant appeals seeking a reversal of the commission\u2019s decision and an order calculating the claimant\u2019s benefits using an average weekly wage of $2,500. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">We review questions of law <em>de novo </em>and independently determine the governing legal principles without deference to the decision under review. <em>Spicer v. Va. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Program, </em>48 Va.App. 613, 618, 633 S.E.2d 732, 734 (2006) (reaffirming principle of <em>de novo </em>review of \u201cpure questions of law\u201d); <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. v.

By statute, we treat the commission\u2019s factfinding as \u201cconclusive and binding\u201d if it rests on a sufficient threshold of evidence. <em>Berglund Chevrolet, Inc. v. Landrum, </em>43 Va.App. 742, 749-50, 601 S.E.2d 693, 697 (2004) (quoting Code \u00a7 65.2-706(A)). \u201cThis appellate deference is not a mere legal custom, subject to a flexible application, but a statutory command,\u201d <em>id. </em>(citation omitted), that binds us so long as a \u201crational mind upon consideration of all the circumstances\u201d could come to the conclusion the commission adopted, <em>K &amp; G Abatement Co. v.

It thus makes no difference that \u201cwe would have decided the fact[s] differently,\u201d <em>Perry v. Delisle, </em>46 Va.App. 57, 67, 615 S.E.2d 492, 497 (2005) <em>(en </em>banc) (parenthetically quoting <em>United States v.

Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985))), because the statute authorizes the commission to adopt whatever view of the evidence it considers \u201cmost consistent with reason and justice,\u201d <em>Georgia-Pac. Corp. v.

Sch. Bd. v. Cole, </em>258 Va. 430, 432, 520 S.E.2d 650, 651 (1999). \u201cThe commission is guided by statute in determining average weekly wage.\u201d <em>Ellen Kaye, Inc. v. Wigglesworth, </em>34 Va.App. 390, 394, 542 S.E.2d 30, 32 (2001) (citation omitted). The statutory \u201cguideposts\u201d determine the methods \u201cby which the commission may base its finding of average weekly wage.\u201d <em>Meredith Constr. Co. v. Holcombe, </em>21 Va.App. 537, 539, 466 S.E.2d 108, 109 (1996). Unless the commission misconstrues the statute, the determination of an employee\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d constitutes a \u201cquestion of fact\u201d deserving of deferential appellate review. <em>Pilot Freight Carriers, Inc. v. Reeves, </em>1 Va.App. 435, 441, 339 S.E.2d 570, 573 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Under Code \u00a7 65.2-101, calculating an employee\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d usually involves a simple equation: Take the employee\u2019s \u201cearnings\u201d over the \u201cperiod of 52 weeks immediately preceding\u201d the accident and divide that number by 52. Under this formula, the previous year\u2019s earnings with the employer are tallied and the \u201caverage weekly wage is then set at one fifty-second part of the average annual earnings so computed.\u201d 5 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 93.01[a] (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">\u2018When the employment prior to the injury extended over a period of less than 52 weeks,\u201d the statute authorizes the division of the employee\u2019s earnings \u201cby the number of weeks and parts thereof during which\u201d he earned wages so long as \u201cresults fair and just to both parties will be thereby obtained.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101. However, \u201cif the statutory period designated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>by the first test happened to be an abnormal one, it is plainly not fair and reasonable to follow it slavishly, whether the wages for the period were abnormally high or abnormally low.\u201d 5 Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 93.01[e] (footnotes omitted). The real inquiry is whether the method produces a fair \u201capproximation of claimant\u2019s probable future earning capacity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">\u201cIf the first segment of the wage-basis test must be passed over, the next question is whether there can be found an employee of the same class who worked substantially the whole of the period.\u201d 5 Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 93.01[d]. If the employee does not have enough of an employment track record to run this formula, the commission should consider \u201cthe average weekly amount which during the 52 weeks previous to the injury was being earned by a person of the same grade and character employed in the same class of employment in the same locality or community.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101; <em>see Dominion Assocs. Grp. v. Queen, </em>17 Va.App. 764, 767, 441 S.E.2d 45, 47 (1994) (finding \u201cno evidence in the record\u201d regarding average weekly amount earned by similar employees in similar circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Finally, Code \u00a7 65.2-101 vests the commission with wide discretion to depart from these general guidelines when \u201cexceptional reasons\u201d would make the equation \u201cunfair\u201d either to the employer or employee. <em>See, e.g., Queen, </em>17 Va.App. at 766, 441 S.E.2d at 46. If such reasons exist, the commission may use another \u201cmethod of computing\u201d the average weekly wage that \u201cmost nearly approximate^] the amount which the injured employee would be earning were it not for the injury.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101. The whole \u201creason for calculating the average weekly wage,\u201d after all, is to \u201capproximate the economic loss\u201d suffered by an employee or his beneficiaries. <em>Bosworth v. 7-Up Distrib. Co., </em>4 Va.App. 161, 163, 355 S.E.2d 339, 340 (1987).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>At every step in this tiered decisionmaking process, the burden of proof rests on the claimant. <em>See, e.g., Uninsured Emp\u2019rs Fund v. Thrush, 255 </em>Va. 14, 20, 496 S.E.2d 57, 60 (1998) (noting that claimant \u201csubmitted no evidence to the Commission concerning the earnings of a person engaged in similar employment\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Upon the claimant alone rests the burden of producing evidence and persuading the factfinder by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Smith v. Smith, </em>32 Va.App. 242, 248, 527 S.E.2d 463, 466 (2000) (holding claimant must prove average weekly wage claim by a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d). Nothing in the statute or our caselaw requires the employer to disprove the claimant\u2019s allegation of wage loss. Nor does the law permit the claimant to assume away the burden of proof by proffering an unsubstantiated wage figure and then remonstrating upon the employer\u2019s lack of refutation. <em>See, e.g., Mount Vernon Builders, Inc. v. Rotty, </em>28 Va.App. 511, 516, 507 S.E.2d 95, 98 (1998) (reversing an average weekly wage calculation based on a side job when \u201c[n]o evidence suggested that he intended to undertake other \u2018side jobs\u2019 or that other \u2018side jobs\u2019 \u201d were available).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In this case, the claimant presented a single fact in support of the average-weekly-wage claim: Thorpe agreed to split equally a one-time $5,000 contract payment for a construction job that might or might not have lasted a week. It was uncontested, however, that Thorpe had never engaged in similar contracting in the past, and no evidence suggested he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>likely would in the future.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For these reasons, the commission found this one-time payment constituted an isolated event \u201cthat does not accurately and fairly reflect the claimant\u2019s <em>average </em>weekly wage.\u201d <em>Thorpe, </em>2010 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 235, at *3 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Given the paucity of the evidentiary record, the commission was well within its factfinding discretion to reject the claimant\u2019s allegation that Thorpe earned on average $2,500 a week during the year preceding the accident. The evidence thus falls short of satisfying the first tier of Code \u00a7 65.2-101, which takes the employee\u2019s earnings over the previous year and divides it by fifty-two weeks. The claimant also failed to show the aberrational weekly wage figure would be a \u201cfair and just\u201d approximation of future loss. Code \u00a7 65.2-101.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The commission agreed with the deputy commissioner\u2019s view that this \u201cone week\u2019s high pay (with the unusual hiring incentive circumstances surrounding it)\u201d did not represent a \u201crealistic judgment\u201d of Thorpe\u2019s future loss. Equally so, the claimant presented no evidence establishing \u2014 under the second tier of statutory analysis \u2014 the wages earned by a \u201cperson of the same grade and character employed in the same class of employment in the same locality or community.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The inadequate factual presentation left the commission bereft of any reliable way to estimate Thorpe\u2019s average weekly wage. Relegated to the highly discretionary third tier of the Code \u00a7 65.2-101 definition of average weekly wage, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>commission understandably chose not to adopt the <em>sui generis </em>$2,500 figure and extrapolate it as the average weekly wage Thorpe could expect to earn in the future. Nor did the commission think it proper to simply deny the claim outright on the ground that the claimant failed to prove her wage allegation by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Instead, exercising its statutory power for \u201cexceptional reasons,\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101, the commission took the $2,500 figure, divided it by 52, and awarded benefits accordingly. The commission\u2019s reasoning relied on straightforward logic: If the <em>only </em>reliable evidence of Thorpe\u2019s actual wage income during the year preceding the accident was this <em>one-time payment </em>of $2,500, and no evidence implied that similar payments occurred before the accident or would likely occur after it, then that figure was the only baseline the commission could reasonably consider.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Where, as here, the legislature \u201cdeliberately leaves a wide area of discretion\u201d in determining an average weekly wage, this discretion should be applied \u201cnot mechanically nor technically, but flexibly, <em>with a view always to achieving the ultimate objective of reflecting fairly the claimant\u2019s probabl[e] future earning loss.\u201d </em>5 Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 93.01 [c] (emphasis added). \u201cThe fact that the calculation of \u2018average weekly wage\u2019 is not intended to be automatic and rigidly arbitrary is evident from the various typical provisions for adjustment of actual wages received in order to achieve a figure which is fairly representative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 93.01[e]. The commission, therefore, rightly avoids \u201cinexcusably rigidified interpretations of the wage formula\u201d at the expense of \u201can honest approximation of claimant\u2019s probable future earning capacity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Truth be told, the sparse evidentiary record in this case forced the commission to \u201cchoose between two unrealistic choices.\u201d Oral Argument Audio at 3:02 to 3:06 (concession of claimants counsel). The claimant, however, is in no position to find fault with the commission\u2019s unenviable choice. The claimant bore the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence Thorpe\u2019s average weekly wage. Because she failed to shoulder this burden, the commission did the best it could with the undeveloped state of the evidentiary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Because the commission correctly applied Code \u00a7 65.2-101 and made factual findings supported by the evidence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\">. \"The usual formulation speaks of a wage that fairly represents claimant\u2019s earning capacity. As the examples adduced throughout this discussion testify, there are almost an infinite number of variables that might figure in these cases, and, unspecific as this test is, it is much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>better than a technical test that methodically produces demonstrably inequitable results.\u201d 5 Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 93.01 [e] (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b674-7\">.

We see no need to compare and contrast the dissimilar fact patterns of <em>Thrush </em>and this case. At best, <em>Thrush </em>supports the commission majority\u2019s reasoning \u2014 that both this case and <em>Thrush </em>stem from a claimant\u2019s failure to present his case \u2014 and, at worst, is merely factually distinguishable.

When asked at oral argument on appeal why he found it unnecessary to put on evidence of similar workers \u2014 even after the deputy commissioner invited additional evidence \u2014 the claimant's counsel explained \"traditionally in Workers Comp, when we do that, we take other employees with the same employer\u201d and not \u201ccomparable jobs ... at other employers.\u201d Oral Argument Audio at 2:20 to 2:45. Neither the text of Code \u00a7 65.2-101 nor any of our opinions interpreting it, however, limits the comparable-jobs inquiry to other employees with the same employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
