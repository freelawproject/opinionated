INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">Appealing his conviction for driving under the influence, a second offense within five years, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266, Keith Orlando Young argues that because he was not arrested within three hours of the offense, the certificate of analysis used to convict him was inadmissible under Virginia\u2019s implied consent law. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">On October 24, 2008, at approximately 7:00 p.m., Young ran a stop sign and crashed into an SUV.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Young\u2019s car landed in a ditch with the driver\u2019s side door suspended in the air. Emergency personnel extricated him from the passenger side of the vehicle and slid him onto a backboard. Young was bleeding from his head and, according to emergency personnel, had a \u201cvery strong\u201d odor of beer emanating from his person. His speech was slurred, and he could not tell them his name. Young became combative and emergency workers \u201chad to tie his arms down\u201d and strap him to the backboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>. At approximately 7:40 p.m., Virginia State Trooper G.F. Finch arrived at the scene and saw Young \u201cfighting the medical personnel.\u201d When he approached, Finch noticed Young had glassy eyes, slurred speech, and a \u201cstrong odor of alcoholic beverage on his breath.\u201d When questioned by Trooper Finch, Young admitted he had been drinking prior to driving the vehicle and that the accident occurred at approximately 7:00 p.m. Trooper Finch observed in Young\u2019s vehicle two bottles of brandy and a cooler containing two cans of beer, one of which was open.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Trooper Finch followed the ambulance transporting Young to Mary Washington Hospital. They arrived at approximately 9:20 p.m., and Young was promptly admitted. While Young was lying in the hospital bed hooked to IVs, Finch told him he was under arrest and advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and the implied consent law. Finch testified Young was not free to leave at that point. Young verbally consented to have his blood drawn. After Finch took possession of vials of Young\u2019s blood, he released Young from custody on a Virginia Uniform Summons pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-73. At the time of the offense, Code \u00a7 19.2-73 provided, in pertinent part, \u201cIf any person under suspicion for driving while intoxicated has been taken to a medical facility for treatment or evaluation of his medical condition, the arresting officer at the medical facility may issue ... a summons for a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">In November 2008, the Department of Forensic Science completed a certificate of analysis after performing tests on the blood sample drawn from Young at the hospital. The certificate indicated that Young\u2019s blood alcohol content on the night of the accident was 0.22% by weight by volume.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">At trial, Young objected to the admission of the certificate of analysis. He contended that the certificate was inadmissible because he was not under arrest as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 before his blood sample was taken. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>court overruled Young\u2019s motion stating, \u201cI have to give plain meaning to the terms of the statute, and under \u00a7 19.2-73, paragraph B, the trooper has the authority, after he\u2019s placed him under arrest, to issue a summons, and that\u2019s what he did, so I\u2019m going to overrule your motion.\u201d At the close of evidence, the trial court overruled Young\u2019s motion to strike the evidence and found him guilty of driving while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, Virginia\u2019s implied consent statute, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">Any person ... who operates a motor vehicle upon a highway ... in the Commonwealth shall be deemed thereby, as a condition of such operation, to have consented to have samples of his blood ... taken for a chemical test if he is <em>arrested </em>for driving while intoxicated within three hours of the alleged offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">On appeal, Young argues that because the arresting officer \u201cdid not, at any time, accompany his arrest of Appellant with <em>any physical act </em>then Appellant was not subject to the implied consent law.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7 (emphasis added). Thus, Young continues, absent a timely arrest, the \u201cCommonwealth [had] no right to collect the sample in the first place and, <em>a fortiori, </em>even less right to offer into evidence test results based on the sample.\u201d <em>Cutright v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 593, 601, 601 S.E.2d 1, 5 (2004). <em>See also Overbee v. Commonwealth, 221 </em>Va. 238, 243, 315 S.E.2d 242, 244 (1984) (stating an untimely arrest results in exclusion of test results). Indeed, \u201cfailure to comply with Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 or companion statutes precludes introduction of the relevant test results in proof of DUI.\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 414, 420, 565 S.E.2d 328, 331 (2002). <em>See also Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 228, 233, 527 S.E.2d 456, 459 (2000) (noting unlawful arrest negates implied consent and renders test results inadmissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Under common law, the \u201cmere words of an officer stating to a suspect that he is \u2018under arrest\u2019 are not sufficient to constitute an arrest.\u201d <em>Bristol v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 568, 573, 636 S.E.2d 460, 468 (2006) (citing <em>California v. Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621, 627, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 1551, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Quoting from Professor Perkins\u2019s seminal work on the subject, <em>Hodari D. </em>held the common law also requires the officer to have some physical contact with the arrestee (even a slight \u201ctouching\u201d suffices) or, absent such contact, the arrestee must submit to the officer\u2019s assertion of authority. <em>Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. at 626-27, 111 S.Ct. at 1550-51 (citing Rollin M. Perkins, <em>The Law of Arrest, </em>25 Iowa L.Rev. 201, 206 (1940)); <em>see also Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 566, 571, 701 S.E.2d 68, 71 (2010), <em>aff'g, </em>55 Va.App. 451, 686 S.E.2d 554 (2009) (applying these common law principles, holding an individual was in custody for purposes of the escape statute, Code \u00a7 18.2 \u2014 478, when the officer \u201cspoke words of arrest and actually touched Hall for the stated purpose of arrest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">While an officer\u2019s mere words, telling a suspect he is under arrest, are insufficient to constitute an <em>arrest, Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. at 626, 111 S.Ct. at 1550-51, they <em>do </em>constitute an assertion of his authority. It is axiomatic that where the officer does not make any assertion of authority, a suspect cannot submit to him and, therefore, there can be no arrest. <em>See, e.g., Sprouse v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 488, 491, 673 S.E.2d 481, 482 (2009) (finding no arrest because the officer did not use any physical force, and \u201c[a]t no point following the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>accident did [the officer] indicate to [the suspect] that he was under arrest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">Common law principles of arrest, however, must be applied in harmony with applicable statutes. \u201cA number of the states,\u201d Perkins explained, have enacted statutes authorizing an officer \u201cto issue a summons himself, as the issuance of a \u2018ticket\u2019 to appear for a violation of the traffic laws.\u201d Perkins, <em>supra, </em>at 207. Statutes enacted for this purpose \u201cmay require the officer to make an arrest <em>prior </em>to the issuance of such a summons,\u201d <em>id. </em>(emphasis added), or they may authorize the issuance of a summons <em>instead </em>of an arrest. These two statutory approaches \u2014 issuing a summons either \u201cin lieu of arrest\u201d <em>or </em>\u201cafter an initial arrest,\u201d <em>Knowles v. Iowa, </em>525 U.S. 113, 115, 119 S.Ct. 484, 486, 142 L.Ed.2d 492 (1998) (summarizing an Iowa statute) \u2014 determine the necessity, timing, and scope of an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The General Assembly has enacted several such statutes. Code \u00a7 19.2-74(A)(1), for example, authorizes an \u201carresting officer\u201d to issue a summons releasing an arrestee from the officer\u2019s custody under certain conditions. If the \u201carresting officer\u201d reasonably believes the arrestee will disregard the summons or cause harm to himself or others, the arrestee cannot be released from the officer\u2019s custody. <em>Id. </em>If the arrestee, after being released, fails to later appear in court as directed by the summons, he may be charged with failure to appear in addition to \u201cthe charge upon which he was originally arrested.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-74(A)(3); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-936 (authorizing release on summons for a misdemeanor charge).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">A similar statute governs suspected drunk drivers who are \u201ctaken to a medical facility\u201d for treatment or evaluation. Code \u00a7 19.2-73(B). The version of Code \u00a7 19.2-73(B) in effect at the time of Young\u2019s arrest authorized an \u201carresting officer\u201d to issue a summons \u201cin lieu of securing a warrant\u201d for a suspected drunk driver who has been taken to a medical facility.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This statute recognizes the reality that an individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>receiving medical treatment cannot be taken into physical custody. If the arrestee later violates the summons by not appearing in court as directed, he may be convicted for failing to appear as well as for the DUI \u201ccharge upon which he was <em>originally arrested.\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-73(C) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">\u201cIt is a settled rule of construction that all statutes <em>in pari materia </em>should be read and construed together, as if they formed parts of the same statute and were enacted at the same time.\u201d <em>Dillard v. Thornton, </em>70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 392, 396 (1877). The \u201cdoctrine of <em>pari materia </em>teaches that \u2018statutes are not to be considered as isolated fragments of law, but as a whole, or as parts of a great, connected homogenous system, or a simple and complete statutory arrangement.\u2019\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Motor Vehicles v. Wallace, </em>29 Va.App. 228, 234, 511 S.E.2d 423, 425 (1999) (quoting <em>Moreno v. Moreno, </em>24 Va.App. 190, 198, 480 S.E.2d 792, 796 (1997)). Therefore, \u201cproper construction seeks to harmonize the provisions of a statute both internally and in relation to other statutes.\u201d <em>Hulcher v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 601, 605, 575 S.E.2d 579, 581 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Under these catch-and-release statutes, the summons serves as \u201ca <em>post-arrest document </em>which facilitates prompt release upon a promise to appear.\u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 666, 671, 440 S.E.2d 426, 430 (1994) (emphasis added) (voiding summons issued by an officer not based on a valid arrest); <em>see Lovelace v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 588, 596, 522 S.E.2d 856, 860 (1999) (describing \u201can \u2018arrest\u2019 that is effected by issuing a citation or summons rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>taking the suspect into custody\u201d). Reading these statutes <em>in pa\u00f1 materia, </em>it is clear that while an arrest under Code \u00a7 19.2-73(B) is not a traditional custodial arrest requiring a suspect to undergo the booking process and appear before a magistrate, it is an <em>arrest </em>nonetheless.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">It is the act of arrest itself that \u201cbrings into consideration the issuance of a summons,\u201d which thereafter \u201cmakes provision for the expeditious <em>release of an arrested person </em>without appearance before an issuing authority and a bail determination.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>17 Va.App. at 671, 440 S.E.2d at 430 (emphasis added); <em>cf. Rhodes v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 641, 645 n. 6, 513 S.E.2d 904, 907 n. 6 (1999) <em>(en </em>banc) (holding a search incident to arrest is not authorized \u201cwhere by statute a state has \u2018abjured the authority to execute <em>custodial </em>arrests\u2019 \u201d for minor offenses (citation omitted) (emphasis added)); <em>People v. Bland, </em>884 P.2d 312, 318 (Colo.1994) (noting that a statute that \u201cmandates the issuance of a notice or summons, however, is consistent with a non-custodial arrest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">In this case, the trooper declared Young under arrest for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-266. After doing so, the trooper informed Young of his <em>Miranda </em>rights as an arrestee. The trooper also read Young the statutory implied consent notice, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-268.3(B), which expressly reaffirmed that Young had been \u201carrested\u201d by an \u201carresting officer.\u201d Declaration and Acknowledgment of Refusal \u2014 Breath/Blood Test (Form DC-233).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Young submitted to a blood test. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>trooper later released Young from the arrest under Code \u00a7 19.2-73(B). The summons signed by Young and the arresting officer identified the \u201cArrest Location\u201d as Mary Washington Hospital and the \u201cArrest Date\u201d as October 24, 2008. The summons was not an arrest warrant. It did not <em>cause </em>Young to be arrested. To the contrary \u2014 it <em>released </em>Young from arrest. The issuance of the summons under Code \u00a7 19.2-73(B), releasing Young from arrest, served as a statutory marker confirming Young\u2019s ongoing submission to the arresting officer\u2019s authority. By signing the summons, Young acknowledged his continuing submission to the arrest and his promise to appear in court as a condition for being released from arrest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Young claims this reasoning conflicts with <em>Bristol. </em>We disagree. <em>Bristol </em>did not involve a suspect arrested and thereafter released under Code \u00a7 19.2-73(B) or its statutory companion, Code \u00a7 19.2-74. For that reason, there was no need for <em>Bristol </em>to mention, much less analyze, the statutory interplay between the catch-and-release statutes and the im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>plied consent statute. Instead, <em>Bristol </em>relied entirely on common law arrest principles and deemed the officer\u2019s actions insufficient to constitute an arrest because he \u201cdid not act in a manner that could be construed as constraining Bristol\u2019s personal liberty.\u201d <em>Bristol, </em>272 Va. at 574, 686 S.E.2d at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Unlike <em>Bristol, </em>this case turns directly on the manner in which Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-73(B) and 19.2-74 augment the common law principles of arrest. Reading these statutes <em>in pari materia </em>with the implied consent statute, an arrest followed by a release on summons satisfies the requirement of \u201cconstraining\u201d the arrestee\u2019s personal liberty, <em>Bristol, </em>272 Va. at 574, 636 S.E.2d at 463, for purposes of implicating the statutory duty to provide a blood or breath sample. The very fact that Young was formally released with a summons indicates he had been formally arrested. To conclude otherwise\u2014 particularly on the ground that the arresting officer must at some point <em>physically touch </em>the arrestee \u2014 adds an aberrational gloss to Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-73(B) and 19.2-74. In this respect, we agree with the reasoning of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine in a similar case in which a hospitalized DUI arrestee was released on a summons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-6\">Defendant\u2019s counsel concedes that defendant would have been validly arrested if [the arresting officer] had also merely placed his hand on defendant\u2019s arm or shoulder. <em>There is no reason for making the validity of an arrest in the present circumstances turn on such an insignificant formality, reminiscent of the medieval livery of seisin. ... </em>We also find no merit in defendant\u2019s contention that the fact that the Uniform Traffic Ticket issued to him stated that he was \u201csummonsed\u201d means that he was never arrested or negates any arrest that was made. <em>The arrest that did take place and the issuance of the ticket were not contemporaneous. It is not disputed that defendant was released from custody at the moment he received the ticket. Until that moment, however, he remained under arrest.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-7\"><em>State v. Donahue, </em>420 A.2d 936, 938 (Me.1980) (emphasis added). To be sure, \u201c[a]pplying additional restraints in such a case is redundant at best; at worst, it may interfere with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>medical treatment or aggravate the suspect\u2019s injuries.\u201d <em>Smither v. Dir. of Revenue, </em>136 S.W.3d 797, 799 (Mo.2004) (citation omitted); <em>State v. Setter, </em>721 S.W.2d 11, 17 (Mo.Ct. App.1986) (\u201cThe facts reveal that the officer placed respondent under arrest and read the <em>Miranda </em>warning. There was no need to <em>physically restrain </em>respondent because his injuries prevented him from leaving the hospital.\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Under the facts of this case, the implied consent statute applied to Young\u2019s arrest and authorized the admission of the BAC test results into evidence. Like the trial court, we disagree with Young\u2019s assertion that the trooper could not request a blood sample without first engaging in some \u201cphysical act,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7, during the period in which Young was under arrest. We thus affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-14\">. Young was also convicted of running a stop sign in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-821, but does not challenge that conviction on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b782-8\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-266, the statute under which Young was convicted, prohibits driving with a blood alcohol concentration of \"0.08 percent or more by weight by volume____\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b784-6\">. Though inconclusive by itself, the statement <em>\"you are under airest </em>\u201d nonetheless constitutes evidence of \" 'an intent on the part of the arresting officer to take the person into custody and a corresponding understanding by the person arrested that he is in custody.' \u201d <em>State v. Rochelean, </em>117 N.H. 792, 378 A.2d 1381, 1383 (1977) (quoting <em>State v. Wolfson, </em>116 N.H. 227, 356 A.2d 692, 694 (1976)); <em>accord Bell v. State, </em>881 S.W.2d 794, 799 (Tex.App.1994) <em>(\u201cA </em>reasonable person, injured and lying on a hospital stretcher, hearing from a police officer the words 'you are under arrest\u2019 and \u2018placed under arrest,' could conclude that he was not free to leave.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b785-7\">. In 2010, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 19.2-73 to give officers the discretion to issue a summons \u201cwithout having to detain\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>the suspect under medical attention if \"the officer has probable cause to place him under arrest.\u201d 2010 Va. Acts ch. 840. Because this scenario does not involve an actual arrest followed by a release from arrest, the 2010 amendment added that the \"issuance of such summons shall be deemed an arrest for purposes of Article 2 (\u00a7 18.2-266 et seq.) of Chapter 7 of Title 18.2.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In doing so, the General Assembly answered the question raised but not decided in <em>Sprouse, </em>53 Va.App. at 491-93, 673 S.E.2d at 482-83, whether a drunk driving suspect is \"arrested when he signed the summons\u201d where, unlike our case, the officer never expressly declared the suspect \"was under arrest.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b787-7\">. The dissent's position as we understand it is as follows: (1) Despite enacting Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-73 and 19.2-74, the legislature did not change the common law of arrest. We conclude these statutes augment the submission element of the common law of arrest. In addition, the dissent maintains that (2) under those statutes, one cannot be \u201carrested\u201d until one signs a document, the summons, upon which \u00a7 19.2-74 requires the officer to \u201cforthwith release him from custody.\u201d In short, the dissent appears to maintain an oxymoron: you are not arrested until you are released from custody.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b787-8\">.

The dissent appears to disregard the facts relevant to the arrest determination in <em>Bristol. </em>The Court in <em>Bristol, </em>immediately prior to concluding \"Bristol's consent to the blood test did not constitute a submission to police authority resulting in arrest,\u201d 272 Va. at 574, 636 S.E.2d at 463, recited the facts relevant to their determination, many of which took place <em>after </em>the blood draw: that \"Officer Doyle merely accompanied Bristol to the emergency room ... then left the hospital, <em>taking no action to constrain Bristol's personal liberty </em>....

Here, despite that Young\u2019s liberty was already physically restrained by his connection to IVs, Trooper Finch remained with Young after the blood sample was drawn, advised Young of the charge pending against him, and obtained his signature on the summons prior to departing from the hospital. The dissent maintains that these actions by Trooper Finch did not \"constrain Young\u2019s personal liberty.\u201d Short of physically touching Young, who was already rendered immobile, it is difficult to think of a greater restraint on Young\u2019s physical liberty than the trooper\u2019s unyielding presence while he was undergoing medical treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b790-8\">HUMPHREYS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ABW\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that Young was under arrest prior to the application of the implied consent law, and thus would hold that the circuit court erred in admitting the evidence of the certificate of Young\u2019s blood alcohol analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the issue of law whether the undisputed facts before us establish that the officers effected an arrest of [appellant].\u201d <em>Bristol v.

The Supreme Court explained Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 arrest requirements as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-5\">Under these provisions, a driver must be arrested within three hours of an offense before that driver may be required to submit to a breath or blood test.

Thus, a valid arrest prior to taking the test is statutorily required as a prerequisite to the admission into evidence of any blood or breath test results under Virginia\u2019s implied consent law. <em>See Roseborough v.

The majority contends initially that in reading Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-73 and 19.2-74 <em>in pari materia, </em>\u201cit is clear that while an arrest under Code \u00a7 19.2-73(B) is not a traditional custodial arrest requiring a suspect to undergo the booking process and appear before a magistrate, it is an <em>arrest </em>nonetheless.\u201d The majority then concludes \u201c[t]he summons was not an arrest warrant. It did not <em>cause </em>Young to be arrested. To the contrary \u2014 it <em>released </em>Young from arrest.\u201d From this initial premise, the majority uses reverse logic to conclude that, since one cannot be released unless first arrested, Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-73(B) and 19.2-74 must augment the common law principles of arrest because in \u201c[r]eading these statutes <em>in pari materia </em>with the implied consent statute, an arrest followed by a release on summons satisfies the requirement of \u2018constraining\u2019 the arrestee\u2019s personal liberty, <em>Bristol, </em>272 Va. at 574, 636 S.E.2d at 463, for purposes of implicating the statutory duty to provide a blood or breath sample.\u201d In other words, under the analysis of the majority, if a summons has been issued, an arrest must <em>ipso facto </em>have occurred previously. However, the facts in the record in this case provide little support to the majority\u2019s supposition that the issuance of a summons means that an arrest must have occurred prior to the blood sample being taken, or that the issuance of the summons and subsequent signature by Young exemplify a submission to an arresting officer\u2019s show of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">It is important to note that Trooper Finch issued the summons <em>after </em>the blood sample was taken, and not prior to it. As our Supreme Court has held, \u201cthe arrest must be completed before the driver may be required to take the test.\u201d <em>Bristol, </em>272 Va. at 574-75, 636 S.E.2d at 464. Thus, the majority\u2019s emphasis on the issuance of the summons is misplaced, and is of little use as a crutch to support a holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>a lawful arrest occurred in this case prior to the taking of the blood sample. <em>See Sprouse, </em>53 Va.App. 488, 673 S.E.2d 481 (holding the trial court erred in admitting the certificate at trial because the purported arrest \u2014 signing the summons\u2014 took place after the blood test was administered). Further, the fact that a summons is \u201ca post-arrest document which facilitates prompt release upon a promise to appear\u201d <em>does not, </em>in the alternative, stand for the proposition that because a summons was issued and signed then, <em>a fortiori, </em>a lawful arrest actually occurred at some earlier time. <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, 17 </em>Va.App. 666, 671, 440 S.E.2d 426, 430 (1994). For the same reasons, I also cannot subscribe to the majority\u2019s implicit suggestion that Young\u2019s acceptance of the summons and his consent to have the blood sample taken constitute a sort of <em>nunc pro tunc </em>submission to Trooper Finch\u2019s authority at that time or on some earlier occasion. <em>Bristol, </em>272 Va. at 575, 636 S.E.2d at 464 (\u201cThus, based on this statutory language, a driver\u2019s mere agreement to take a breath or blood test cannot constitute a functional component of the driver\u2019s arrest.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Lastly, while Code \u00a7 19.2-73, as amended in 2010, specifically provides that \u201c[t]he issuance of such summons shall be deemed an arrest for purposes of Article 2,\u201d this still does not satisfy the requirement in Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 that the arrest be completed <em>prior </em>to taking the test. Assuming, arguendo, that the issuance of a summons in this case constitutes contemporaneous evidence of an arrest, any such \u201carrest\u201d would then have occurred <em>after </em>the blood sample had been taken. Thus, the summons has no bearing on whether an actual arrest occurred either by physical restraint or submission to the officer\u2019s authority <em>prior </em>to the test being taken \u2014 as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Contrary to the majority\u2019s contention, I do not believe that Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-73(B) and 19.2-74 augment the common law principles of arrest or indeed have any application at all to a determination of whether an arrest occurred prior to the taking of the blood sample in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rather, in my view, the outcome of the issue presented in this appeal is entirely controlled by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bristol </em>and most recently in <em>Roseborough, </em>as well as this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sprouse, </em>and by an application of the common law principles of arrest and the plain language of the implied consent statute. In the present case, there is no evidence that Trooper Finch ever physically touched Young for the purpose of placing him under arrest, nor that Young did or said anything that would constitute a submission to Trooper Finch\u2019s police authority by manifesting a complete surrender of his personal liberty. At the hospital, Trooper Finch informed Young verbally that he was \u201cunder arrest\u201d while Young was lying in a hospital bed in the emergency room \u201chooked up with IVs,\u201d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>which point Trooper Finch said Young did not try to leave the hospital.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Trooper Finch, still standing next to the hospital bed, then advised Young of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and of the implied consent statute. While Trooper Finch read Young the implied consent notice, this recitation does not \u201cexpressly reaffirm[] that Young had been \u2018arrested\u2019 by an \u2018arresting officer\u2019 \u201d as the majority contends. If mere words cannot constitute an arrest, then it follows that a recitation of statutory language cannot \u201cexpressly affirm\u201d nor constitute an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">After Trooper Finch informed Young of the implied consent statute, Young consented to the withdrawal of his blood samples, and Trooper Finch subsequently took one of the samples. Trooper Finch then issued Young a summons pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-73, and left the hospital. At trial, Trooper Finch testified that he could not recall if he ever put a hand on Young, if Young ever acknowledged the arrest, or if Young was even strapped down to the hospital bed. Thus, at no time did Trooper Finch physically restrain Young at the hospital after he told Young that he was \u201cunder arrest\u201d and prior to the blood sample being taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Turning to any submission to police authority, aside from the fact that any submission to authority constituting an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>arrest is statutorily required <em>prior </em>to the utilization of the procedures in the implied consent statute, in my view, Young\u2019s consent to the blood test could not constitute a submission to Trooper Finch\u2019s authority, nor did his actions evince any such submission. <em>See Bristol, </em>272 Va. at 574, 636 S.E.2d at 464 (concluding that, without more, Bristol\u2019s consent to the blood test was not a surrender of his personal liberty but rather simply an agreement to submit to a blood test). Young never made any statement nor did he act in a manner demonstrating that he was completely surrendering his personal liberty to Trooper Finch\u2019s control. Young merely acquiesced to the taking of a blood test after he was verbally informed that he was under arrest, read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and notified about the implied consent statute. When the blood sample was taken, Trooper Finch remained by Young\u2019s side, and then left the hospital after receiving one of the samples and issuing a summons. Trooper Finch never restrained Young nor did he take any other actions to constrain Young\u2019s personal liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">For all of these reasons, I would hold that Young was not under \u201carrest\u201d prior to the taking of his blood sample, and thus the circuit court abused its discretion when it admitted the certificate of the blood alcohol test. Accordingly, I would reverse Young\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial if the Commonwealth is so advised.</p>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b791-8\">. While recognizing their existence, the majority departs from the application of the common law principles relating to arrest, and justifies this departure by a comparison of the \"catch-and-release\u201d provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-73(B) and 19.2-74 with the implied consent statutes in support of its conclusion that in reading them <em>in pari materia, </em>\"an arrest followed by a release on summons satisfies the requirement of 'constraining' the arrestee's personal liberty, <em>Bristol, </em>272 Va. at 574, 636 S.E.2d at 463, for purposes of implicating the statutory duty to provide a blood or breath sample. The very fact that Young was formally released with a summons indicates he had been formally arrested.\u201d However, this approach ignores the predicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>question of whether an arrest actually occurred such that a \"release\" followed. Furthermore, the majority's departure from the application of the common law principles of arrest on the ground that statutes, when read <em>in pari materia implicitly </em>augment the application of longstanding common law principles, is a holding built upon a quicksand foundation that foreshadows the possibility of unintended consequences in conflict with the long held bedrock jurisprudential and statutory principle embodied in Code \u00a7 1-200 that the common law remains in full force and effect unless clearly altered by statute. In addition, Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-73(B) and 19.2-74 do not define what constitutes an \"arrest,\u201d but merely refer to the officer as the \"arresting officer.\u201d Thus, the common law principles of an arrest are still applicable even in reading the statutes <em>in pari materia.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b794-5\">. The majority holds that \"[t]he issuance of the summons under Code \u00a7 19.2-73(B), releasing Young from arrest, served as a statutory marker confirming Young\u2019s ongoing submission to the arresting officer\u2019s authority. By signing the summons, Young acknowledged his continuing submission to the arrest and his promise to appear in court as a condition for being released from arrest.\u201d However, an individual does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>not submit to an officer's police authority merely by taking a summons from the hand of the officer, nor is such a submission evidenced by his signature on a summons. As Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-73 and 19.2-74 make clear, a summons is a charging document similar to a warrant, information, or indictment which can be issued by a magistrate irrespective of whether any arrest has previously occurred, and as such it merely initiates and serves as notice of the initiation of proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction but has no bearing on the issue of when or if an arrest has occurred. Further, in this case both the acceptance and the signing of the summons took place after the blood sample was taken, and thus also have no bearing on whether Young was actually arrested prior to the test through a submission to the officer\u2019s assertion of authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b795-6\">. The majority contends that my position is that the legislature did not change the common law principles of arrest despite its enactment of Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-73 and 19.2-74. However to be precise, my position is simply that the common law principles of arrest are still applicable when determining whether an arrest actually occurred. As the majority observes, a \"summons serves as a <em>\u2018post-arrest document </em>which facilitates prompt release upon a promise to appear.' <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 666, 671, 440 S.E.2d 426, 430 (1994) (emphasis added).\u201d Thus, as I noted above and consistent with the holding of <em>Bristol, </em>we must look to the common law principles in order to determine if, in fact, an arrest took place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b796-7\">. The majority notes that even though Young was already physically restrained by his connection to IVs, Trooper Finch remained with him after the blood sample was drawn, advised him of the charge pending against him, and obtained his signature on the summons all prior to leaving the hospital thus constituting a constraint of Young\u2019s liberty by Trooper Finch. While the majority excuses the requirement of some physical touching by Trooper Finch due to Young\u2019s medical condition and the circumstances of his treatment by the medical staff of the hospital, the fact remains that there is no evidence of physical touching by Trooper Finch or evidence that the hospital staff were somehow acting as agents of Trooper Finch when touching Young or determining how to treat his injuries. In the absence of evidence of any agency relationship, the hospital's restraint of Young is irrelevant to any analysis of Young's custody status. Further an individual should not be required to remove IVs or other physical restraints put in place by the hospital for the purpose of treatment and physically leave the hospital in order to negate any imputation of physical restraint to an officer standing nearby.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
