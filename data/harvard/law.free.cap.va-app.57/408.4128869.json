In the alternative, the commission held Patton proved compensability by a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>ponderance of the evidence. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In March 2007, Scott Patton was injured when he drove his truck off the road while working for Lysable Transport, Inc. Despite inconclusive information regarding the cause of the accident, the employer (through its insurer) made voluntary payments to Patton. In August 2008, the commission notified Patton by letter that he had not filed a \u201cwritten claim\u201d nor had any \u201cAgreement to Pay Benefits\u201d been submitted to the commission. The letter specifically warned Patton: \u201cThe fact that you may have been paid benefits without an award does not protect your legal rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Within the two-year limitation period, Patton\u2019s counsel filed a claim with the commission \u201cseeking temporary total disability benefits from [the date of the accident] through the present and continuing along with lifetime medical costs.\u201d In March 2009, the commission entered an order directing the employer<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to accept or deny the claim within twenty days. The employer responded to the order by denying the claim as not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">At the evidentiary hearing, Patton claimed the employer forfeited its statutory right to defend against the claim because the employer voluntarily paid benefits from March 2007 to January 2009. Patton produced documents from the insurance adjuster\u2019s files (obtained through discovery) stating the adjuster believed the accident was compensable<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Patton \u201cremain[ed] on an open TTD Award\u201d issued by the commission. The adjuster discovered her mistake in early 2009 and noted in her files, \u201cCLMT IS NOT UNDER AN OPEN AWARD.\u201d Even though no <em>actual </em>award had ever been entered, Patton argued the employer\u2019s voluntary payments created a legally incontestable <em>defacto </em>award.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In response, the employer pointed out it entered into no agreements with Patton, exchanged no correspondence admitting liability, shared none of its insurance adjuster\u2019s personal notes with Patton, and did not ever make Patton privy to any internal discussions regarding the compensability of his claim. Absent an agreement or stipulation waiving its statutory right to contest compensability, the employer reasoned, the right could not be assumed away under the <em>de facto </em>award doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">On the merits, the employer argued Patton had to show by a preponderance of the evidence how and why the accident occurred and, equally important, in what way the proven cause arose out of the conditions of his employment. Given the inconclusive nature of the evidence, the employer argued, Patton could not shoulder his burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Agreeing with the employer, the deputy commissioner held the <em>de facto </em>award doctrine did not apply merely where, as here, the employer made voluntary payments. The employer thus retained its right to contest compensability, and Patton retained his duty to prove it. Turning to the merits, the deputy commissioner found the evidence did not \u201cidentify any particular risk, hazard, defect or exertion associated with the employment that caused claimant\u2019s truck to leave the highway and to overturn.\u201d Because \u201cclaimant\u2019s accident is unexplained, and as there is no presumption that can be resorted to,\u201d the deputy commissioner held, \u201ca preponderance of the evidence fails to establish that claimant\u2019s accident and injury arose out of the employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Patton asked the full commission to review the deputy commissioner\u2019s ruling. By a split vote, the commission major<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>ity reversed. The majority opinion applied the <em>de facto </em>award doctrine \u2014 effectively rendering indisputable th\u00e9 compensability of the claim. <em>Patton v. Lysable Transp., Inc., </em>VWC No. 237-20-04, 2010 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 126, at *12. A few lines in the middle of the opinion, however, addressed compensability on the merits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\">The claimant further argues that the accident arose out of his employment because he proved how the accident occurred and the claimant\u2019s duties required his presence upon the public streets and his injury arose from an\u2019 actual risk of that presence upon the streets. We agree, but we find that a <em>defacto </em>award existed; therefore we will not address this error at length. We find that the evidence showed that the claimant fell asleep or was distracted by his load, ran off the road, overcorrected and lost control of his vehicle. The accident, therefore, arose out of his employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-5\"><em>Id. </em>at *10-11. The dissenting commissioner rejected the majority\u2019s reasoning on both issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">I do not believe that a claimant meets his burden of proof when a recitation of the facts of the accident contains the word \u201cor,\u201d <em>ie., </em>when either this happened \u201cor\u201d that happened. The fact that either of two scenarios would be compensable is irrelevant. The claimant must prove the scenario which caused his injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s finding that a <em>de facto </em>award should be recognized in this case. As no award had been entered, the employer was free to contest compensability at the hearing below. Our previous decisions have clearly held that a <em>de facto </em>award is not appropriate when a critical aspect of the claim is contested at the evidentiary hearing. It is difficult to imagine a more critical aspect of a claim than compensability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-8\"><em>Id. </em>at *15-16 (Comm\u2019r Williams, dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">On appeal, the employer argues the commission\u2019s <em>\"de facto </em>award in this case appears to fly in the face of the long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>standing law in Virginia which holds ... <em>de facto </em>awards do not exist when the defendants contest compensability of the claim.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 11. Because the doctrine does not apply, the employer asserts, Patton could not recover benefits without first proving how and why the accident occurred. We agree with both assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">A. <em>The De Facto Award Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act makes clear how settlement agreements become legally enforceable: \u201cIf after injury or death, the employer and the injured employee or his dependents reach an agreement in regard to compensation or in compromise of a claim for compensation under this title, a memorandum of the agreement in the form prescribed by the Commission shall be filed with the Commission for approval.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-701(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">By statute, therefore, any settlement agreement reached by the parties must be filed with the commission in an acceptable form, which the commission may then accept or reject. <em>Id. </em>If it accepts the settlement, the commission th\u00e9n issues an award making the agreement \u201cbinding\u201d and \u201cenforceable\u201d on all parties. <em>Id. </em>Once this happens, the employer forfeits its statutory right to contest the initial compensability of any claim covered by the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">A <em>de facto </em>award is a legal fiction crafted by the courts, \u201ca creature of case law not statutory law.\u201d <em>Ryan\u2019s Family Steak Houses v. Gowan, </em>32 Va.App. 459, 465, 528 S.E.2d 720, 723 (2000) (Bumgardner, J., concurring). An \u201caward\u201d under the statute is an <em>actual </em>award: a \u201cgrant or denial of benefits or other relief under this title or any rule adopted pursuant thereto.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101. Though the statute nowhere mentions <em>de facto </em>awards, we embraced the idea in <em>National Linen Service v. McGuinn, </em>5 Va.App. 265, 271, 362 S.E.2d 187, 190 (1987) <em>(en banc), </em>a case where the employer made voluntary payments and \u201cstipulated compensability\u201d of the claim. The settlement confirmation statute at that time, former Code \u00a7 65.1-93, did not include a penalty for failing to fulfill the duty to file written settlement agreements with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>commission, a duty uniquely placed on employers by former Code \u00a7 65.1-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Our holding in <em>McGuinn </em>was \u201cpremised on the fact that the statute did not explicitly provide penalties for an employer\u2019s failure to comply with its provisions.\u201d <em>Watts v. P &amp; J Hauling, Inc., </em>41 Va.App. 278, 285, 584 S.E.2d 457, 461 (2003) (citing <em>McGuinn, </em>5 Va.App. at 270, 362 S.E.2d at 189). Shortly after <em>McGuinn, </em>however, \u201ca penalty was added to the statute by the General Assembly,\u201d and \u201cthe legislature again amended the language of the statute to allow an employee, an employer, or a compensation carrier to prepare the memorandum of their agreement.\u201d <em>Watts, </em>41 Va.App. at 285, 584 S.E.2d at 461.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Because these statutory amendments undercut the very reason for the <em>de facto </em>doctrine, we have been careful not to extend the judge-made concept beyond its original parameters. The <em>de facto </em>award doctrine applies only when \u201cthe employer has <em>stipulated to the compensability of the claim, </em>has made payments to the employee for some significant period of time without filing a memorandum of agreement, and <em>fails to contest the compensability of the injury </em>____\u201d <em>Gowan, </em>32 Va.App. at 463, 528 S.E.2d at 722 (emphasis added). Only then is it \u201creasonable to infer that the parties have reached an agreement,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>McGuinn, </em>5 Va.App. at 269-70, 362 S.E.2d at 189), regarding compensability of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Making voluntary payments, by itself, falls far short of satisfying the preconditions of the <em>de facto </em>award doctrine. \u201cAn employer and carrier are not estopped from denying future payments merely because they have paid them in the past.\u201d <em>Rucker v. Thrift Transfer, Inc., </em>1 Va.App. 417, 420, 339 S.E.2d 561, 562 (1986) (citing <em>Salem v. Colegrove, </em>228 Va. 290, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>295, 321 S.E.2d 654, 656-57 (1984)). An employer\u2019s \u201cvoluntary payment of compensation or disability benefits does not waive its right to assert defenses,\u201d <em>Watts, </em>41 Va.App. at 286, 584 S.E.2d at 461 (making exceptions for \u201cfraud or concealment\u201d), because employers should be free \u201cto make voluntary payments without running the risk of being held thereby to have made an irrevocable admission of liability,\u201d 7 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 127.04[3], at 127-19 (2010). It would be wholly unreasonable for a claimant to think otherwise. As the commission warned Patton in this very case: \u201cThe fact that you may have been paid benefits without an award does not protect your legal rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The <em>de facto </em>award doctrine permits the commission to impute an award based upon an actual agreement or stipulation. It does not authorize the commission to impute an award based upon an imputed agreement or stipulation. Doing so would be little more than piling one legal fiction upon another. For this reason, an actual agreement or stipulation has been an essential element in every case in which we have applied the doctrine. For example, \u201c[i]n <em>McGuinn, </em>the parties had no dispute as to any issue of compensation.\u201d <em>White v. Redman Corp., </em>41 Va.App. 287, 291, 584 S.E.2d 462, 464 (2003). The employer \u201cstipulated compensability\u201d of the claim. <em>McGuinn, </em>5 Va.App. at 271, 362 S.E.2d at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Similarly, in <em>Henrico v. Taylor, </em>34 Va.App. 233, 540 S.E.2d 501 (2001), the employer entered into an agreement expressly stipulating the compensability of the claim. Based on the settlement, the commission entered an award order for temporary benefits. When the employer paid additional benefits beyond the award order\u2019s requirements, we held the <em>de facto </em>award doctrine could be applied in a change of condition context under Code \u00a7 65.2-708.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See also Gowan, </em>32 Va.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>at 462, 528 S.E.2d at 721 (recognizing a <em>de facto </em>award where the employer \u201cstipulated\u201d the employee \u201csuffered a compensable injury\u201d arising out of a workplace accident).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">To be sure, as Commissioner Williams noted,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> many of the commission\u2019s prior opinions have applied these limitations on the <em>de facto </em>award doctrine. In a case much like ours, the commission explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">To enter a <em>de facto </em>award where not only was compensability contested but also the evidence established and the deputy commissioner found that there was no compensable accident, occupational disease or ordinary disease of life, would be contrary to the Act. It would award benefits to an injured worker who did not meet the requirements of the Act. In addition the finding of a <em>de facto </em>award under the facts of the current case would discourage carriers from making any voluntary payments to injured workers because of the possibility that they may be subject to an award even if the evidence later established that there was no liability under the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-6\"><em>Caldwell v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>VWC No. 229-26-74, 2007 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 368, at *11 (May 14, 2007) (quoting <em>Try v. Doerflein, </em>VWC Nos. 211-57-12, 207-48-03 (Feb. 23, 2004)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Here, by contrast, the commission awarded benefits to Patton under the <em>de facto </em>award doctrine despite the absence of an agreement or stipulation of compensability by the employer. The commission erred as a matter of law by doing so. No evidence showed Patton and the employer entered into any oral or written agreement addressing compensability. Nor did the employer stipulate to compensability before the commission. Just the opposite occurred: The employer expressly contested compensability and, in fact, <em>prevailed </em>on the issue before the deputy commissioner. The <em>defacto </em>award doctrine, therefore, cannot justify the commission\u2019s award of benefits to Patton.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">B. <em>Arising Out of the Conditions of Employment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Despite its application of the <em>de facto </em>award doctrine, a few sentences in the middle of the commission\u2019s opinion appear to resolve the compensability issue on the merits: \u201cWe find that the evidence showed that the claimant fell asleep <em>or </em>was distracted by his load, ran off the road, overcorrected and lost control of his vehicle. The accident, therefore, arose out of his employment.\u201d <em>Patton, </em>2010 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 126, at *10-11 (emphasis added). But because \u201ca <em>de facto </em>award existed, the commission majority added, \u201cwe will not address this error [the deputy commissioner\u2019s contrary view] at length.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *10.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The employer argues, and we agree, the commission\u2019s either/or finding is self-defeating. Reviewing a highly inconclusive factual record, the commission narrowed the number of possible causes of the accident to two: <em>either </em>(i) Patton fell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>asleep and ran off the road, <em>or </em>(ii) Patton did not fall asleep, but rather, was distracted by the load and attempted in vain to keep his truck under control. Both could not be true. Patton could not have run off the road by being simultaneously asleep and awake, unconscious of danger and conscious of it. Nor could the commission logically find that each one of the two was more probable than not \u2014 thus satisfying the preponderance of the evidence standard \u2014 because doing so would increase the probabilities sum beyond 100% certitude. In his dissent, Commissioner Williams summarized the point well:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ati\">I do not believe that a claimant meets his burden of proof when a recitation of the facts of the accident contains the word \u201cor,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>when either this happened \u201cor\u201d that happened. The fact that either of the two scenarios would be compensable is irrelevant. The claimant must prove the scenario which caused his injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><em>Patton, </em>2010 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 126, at *15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Thus, the commission\u2019s disjunctive finding does not establish how and why the accident happened. <em>See generally Clifton v. Clifton Cable Contracting, </em>54 Va.App. 532, 540, 680 S.E.2d 348, 352 (2009); <em>accord Gossett v. Jackson, </em>249 Va. 549, 552-53, 457 S.E.2d 97, 99 (1995) (\u201cThe plaintiff must show why and how the accident happened.\u201d (citation omitted)). Absent a legal presumption, a claimant cannot recover if the cause of the accident \u201cremains speculative.\u201d <em>Pinkerton\u2019s, Inc. v. Helmes, 242 </em>Va. 378, 380, 410 S.E.2d 646, 647 (1991). And if the evidence does not prove by a preponderance \u201chow the accident happened,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 381, 410 S.E.2d at 648, it is by definition unexplained and thus speculative. <em>See Hill v. S. Tank Transp., Inc., </em>44 Va.App. 725, 732-33, 607 S.E.2d 730, 733-34 (2005) (holding the \u201cfacts must exist to explain how the accident occurred\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Accepting two <em>mutually exclusive </em>explanations in either/or equipoise involves an intrinsically inconclusive, and legally unprecedented, approach to the burden of proof. Neither the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act nor any of the many judicial opinions interpreting it have endorsed the amalgam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>ation of factually inconsistent causes into a composite whole for purposes of satisfying the claimant\u2019s burden of proof. Whether such an innovation should be adopted, we decline to say, for it is \u201cmore properly a matter of policy, a prerogative of the legislative branch of government,\u201d <em>Helmes, </em>242 Va. at 381, 410 S.E.2d at 648 (declining, for the same reason, to adopt a presumption of causation in non-death claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">In short, the commission used a legally erroneous approach to the burden of proof in this case. We do not address whether the evidence, judged by the correct approach, proves Patton\u2019s entitlement to benefits. Because we do not \u201cweigh the evidence on appeal\u201d or take any \u201cpersonal view of the underlying factual debate,\u201d <em>Clifton, </em>54 Va.App. at 541 n. 2, 680 S.E.2d at 353 n. 2 (citation omitted), we remand the case to the commission to review the factual record anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Because the <em>de facto </em>award doctrine does not apply as a matter of law, we reverse the commission\u2019s award of benefits on this ground. As for the commission\u2019s use of a disjunctive standard for assessing the evidence, we reverse and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-8\">.
