Foltz, Jr., (appellant) was convicted by a jury of abduction with intent to defile pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-48 and was sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. In particular, appellant contends that the court erred by ruling (1) that the placement of a GPS (global positioning system) device in the bumper of his work van did not violate the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article 1, section 10, of the Virginia Constitution, and (2) that the use of a GPS device to track appellant did not violate the Fourth Amendment of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Constitution or Article 1, section 10, of the Virginia Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After reviewing the relevant case law and the record here, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction for abduction with intent to defile.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Appellant, a registered sex offender on probation for committing sexual assault, became a suspect in a new series of sexual assaults in Northern Virginia that followed a pattern similar to his previous crimes. At the time, appellant worked for a food services company that provided him with a company van. Company employees who were assigned vans were only allowed to drive them to the company headquarters, to off-site workplaces, and to their homes, unless they were given special permission. Appellant, however, was allowed to use the van assigned to him after work to drive to probation-related appointments. Employees were allowed to keep personal items in their assigned vans and were responsible for the vans while they were in the employees\u2019 possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The police reviewed appellant\u2019s schedule for work and for probation-related meetings, comparing that schedule to the areas and times for the series of unsolved sexual assaults. They determined that the offenses occurred \u201caround the general area\u201d where appellant worked and attended meetings, and the times were consistent with his work and meeting times. Based on all the information that they had collected, the police decided to monitor appellant\u2019s movements by attaching a GPS system to one of his vehicles. The police did not obtain a warrant. They also did not ask appellant\u2019s employer for permission to attach a GPS device to the van assigned to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>On February 1, 2008, the Fairfax County police attached a GPS system to appellant\u2019s work van, which was parked on the street in front of appellant\u2019s home. The GPS system used three satellites to give the police information on the van\u2019s location. The GPS device itself operated on an independent battery and, therefore, did not draw any power from the van. To install the GPS device, an officer \u201creached [his] hand sort of underneath the bumper to a place that is not observable [from] the public street.\u201d The bumper on the van was \u201ca long tube\u201d with plastic ends and holes in it. The GPS device was attached to the left side of the rear bumper using a magnet and \u201ca sticky substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The GPS system did not take pictures nor allow the police to hear any conversations. It could not track particularly well \u201cin a covered parking area,\u201d but could provide general information in any place with cell phone service and could send a signal through glass and plastic. The system archived the information that it collected,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but the police could also track the GPS device in real time.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The police had no policy regarding the use of GPS devices, in part because the devices were not used particularly often.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The police did not predetermine how long they would track appellant. The police also did not develop a policy to avoid following the van into private areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The only allegedly private area that the van entered between February 1, 2008, and February 6, 2008, was appellant\u2019s employer\u2019s place of business, a warehouse located down a short access road marked \u201cPrivate Property.\u201d The warehouse was not open to the public, and vans in the warehouse were not visible from the public street. The GPS tracking log included information that the van was at the workplace, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the officers apparently did not examine this data before appellant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The police did not examine any data from the GPS until the afternoon of February 5, 2008, when they observed, in real time via a computer screen with a map, that the van was driven in and out of various neighborhoods. This pattern of driving concerned the officers, who characterized the pattern as hunting behavior. The officers watched the data stream for about 30 to 40 minutes \u2014 as the van was driving around.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">On the evening of February 5, 2008, another sexual assault occurred. The police checked the GPS log to determine if appellant\u2019s work van was in the area at the time of the attack. They discovered that the van was parked about a block or two away from the scene of the attack at the time it occurred. The police decided to follow appellant themselves on February 6, 2008, the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">While actually following appellant on February 6, 2008, the police observed him park his vehicle,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> get out, and put on a jacket and gloves. Two officers then followed appellant on foot. They observed him run, grab a woman who was walking down the street, and knock her to the ground. Appellant then pulled his victim under a tree, pinned her down, and tried to unbutton her pants. The police stopped the assault and arrested appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Prior to trial, appellant filed a motion to suppress all evidence collected after the police turned on the GPS system and began tracking the work van that he was driving. He argued that the police needed a warrant to attach the device to the van and also needed a warrant to use the GPS system to track him. At the conclusion of the suppression hearing, the trial court found appellant had standing to argue Fourth Amendment violations of privacy in the placement of the GPS on the van and in the tracking of the van.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>police needed reasonable suspicion, not a warrant, to put the GPS device on the van and concluding that the police had reasonable suspicion that appellant was committing the sexual assaults. The court also found that the van was not seized when the GPS device was placed in the bumper and that appellant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the exterior of a van parked on a public street. Regarding the tracking itself, the trial court found \u201call it did was technologically supplement that information which the police could have obtained by their own sensory perception by actually trailing him or following him for a period of time, which they ultimately did in making the arrest in this case.\u201d Thus, the trial court found that appellant had failed to show \u201cany actual invasion of his privacy.\u201d In addition, the trial court also found that appellant failed to show that any tracking at his employer\u2019s warehouse violated appellant\u2019s privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">II. The Fourth Amendment<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Privacy</p>\n<p id=\"Ac\">Appellant argues that the installation of the GPS device in the bumper of his work van was both a search and a seizure of the vehicle.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He also argues that the use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>GPS system was a search \u2014 both while he was driving the van and while it was parked inside his employer\u2019s warehouse.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, he contends, the police infringed upon his Fourth Amendment privacy interests and needed a search warrant before they could install the GPS device in the van and before they could activate the GPS system in order to track the van\u2019s movements.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">On appeal, we review questions involving Fourth Amendment issues as mixed questions of fact and law. <em>McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 546, 551, 659 S.E.2d 512, 515 (2008). In such cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">we give deference to the factual findings of the circuit court, but we independently determine whether the manner in which the evidence was obtained meets the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. The defendant has the burden to show that, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the trial court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion was reversible error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 552, 659 S.E.2d at 515 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">When considering a Fourth Amendment argument, courts must first determine whether a Fourth Amendment privacy right is involved \u2014 using a well-established, two-pronged test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">[A] Fourth Amendment search occurs when the government violates a subjective expectation of privacy that society recognizes as reasonable. <em>See [Katz v. United States, </em>389 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>U.S. 347, 361, 88 S.Ct. 507, 516-17, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) (Harlan, concurring) ]. We have subsequently applied this principle to hold that a Fourth Amendment search does not occur \u2014 even when the explicitly protected location of a house is concerned \u2014 unless \u201cthe individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search,\u201d and \u201csociety [is] willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable.\u201d <em>[California </em>v.] <em>Ciraolo, </em>[476 U.S. 207] 211 [106 S.Ct. 1809, 1811, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9\"><em>Kyllo v. United States, </em>533 U.S. 27, 33, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 2042-43, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001); <em>see also Oliver v. United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 177, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 1740-41, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984). Thus, in order to prevail here, appellant must establish both that he exhibited a subjective expectation of privacy in the bumper of the van and in his movements with the van <em>and </em>that society recognizes these expectations as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">A. Installation of the GPS Device</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Appellant argues that the police violated his privacy interests when they placed the GPS device inside the bumper of his work van while it was parked on the street in front of his house. He also argues that the police committed a seizure when they installed the GPS device because it \u201cchanged the nature\u201d of the van by decreasing its value. We find neither argument persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">1. Installation of GPS as a Search</p>\n<p id=\"AT\">Appellant claims he exhibited an expectation of privacy in the van\u2019s bumper while it was parked on a public street. The evidence does not support this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Neither the United States Supreme Court nor the Supreme Court of Virginia has addressed the issue of whether installing a tracking device directly on a car violates an expectation of privacy. However, the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Karo, </em>468 U.S. 705, 104 S.Ct. 3296, 82 L.Ed.2d 530 (1984), considered facts similar to the ones in this case. In <em>Karo, </em>tracking devices were placed in containers of ether that were then purchased by Karo, who in turn placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the containers in his vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 707, 104 S.Ct. at 3299. In finding that the transfer of the container to Karo did not infringe on his privacy, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">[The transfer] conveyed no information that Karo wished to keep private, for it conveyed no information at all. To be sure, it created a potential for an invasion of privacy, but we have never held that potential, as opposed to actual, invasions of privacy constitute searches for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 712,104 S.Ct. at 3302. Similarly here, the installation of the GPS device did not relay any private information to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit addressed whether the installation of tracking devices on a vehicle violates a suspect\u2019s expectation of privacy in <em>United States v. McIver, </em>186 F.3d 1119 (9th Cir.1999). In that case, forestry agents photographed McIver at the site of growing marijuana plants and then attached two tracking devices to the undercarriage of his 4Runner. McIver argued that the agents needed a search warrant to attach the devices. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the officers did not \u201csearch\u201d the vehicle by placing magnetized tracking devices on its undercarriage because McIver did not prove \u201cthat he intended to preserve the undercarriage\u201d of the vehicle \u201cfrom inspection by others\u201d and \u201cthe officers did not pry into a hidden or enclosed area.\u201d 186 F.3d at 1127.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Similarly here, appellant did nothing to prevent others from inspecting the bumper of the work van. <em>See Cardwell v. Lewis, </em>417 U.S. 583, 591, 94 S.Ct. 2464, 2469-70, 41 L.Ed.2d 325 (1974) (finding a defendant\u2019s privacy rights were not violated when the police examined a tire and took a paint sample from a car in a public parking lot because the vehicle was exposed to the public). The vehicle was not parked on private property, but instead was on a public street where anyone could approach it. <em>See United States v. Pineda-Moreno, </em>591 F.3d 1212, 1215 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cIf a neighborhood child had walked up Pineda-Moreno\u2019s driveway and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>crawled under his Jeep to retrieve a lost ball or runaway cat, Pineda-Moreno would have no grounds to complain.\u201d), <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>\u2014 F.3d -, 2010 WL 3169573, 2010 U.S.App. LEXIS 16708 (Aug. 12, 2010). The police did not need to remove a lock, latch, or cover to reach into the bumper and attach the GPS device. <em>See United States v. Rascon-Ortiz, </em>994 F.2d 749, 754-55 (10th Cir.1993) (finding that the agent did not violate a defendant\u2019s privacy by examining the undercarriage of a vehicle because \u201c[t]he undercarriage is part of the car\u2019s exterior, and as such, is not afforded a reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d and because the agent did not \u201cdisturb[ ] or move[ ] parts of the car in order to facilitate his observations\u201d). As the United States Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[t]he exterior of a car, of course, is thrust into the public eye, and thus to examine it does not constitute a \u2018search.\u2019 \u201d <em>New York v. Class, </em>475 U.S. 106, 114, 106 S.Ct. 960, 966, 89 L.Ed.2d 81 (1986). Nothing in the record here suggests that appellant attempted to prevent the \u201cpublic eye\u201d from viewing the van or its bumper.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Because the actual act of simply placing the GPS device in the bumper of appellant\u2019s work van conveyed no private information to the police and because appellant did nothing to prevent the public from observing the bumper, we find he did not exhibit an expectation of privacy in this area of the van. Thus, the installation was not a search that raised a Fourth Amendment privacy issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">As we find that appellant did not exhibit a subjective expectation of privacy in the bumper of his vehicle, we need not address whether society is prepared to recognize such an expectation as reasonable. However, we do note that the bumper of a van parked on a public street \u2014 as opposed to a place that would indicate appellant intended to prevent public access and viewing of the van \u2014 does not \u201cprovide the setting for those intimate activities that the [Fourth] Amendment is intended to shelter from government interference or surveillance. There is no societal interest in protecting the privacy of those activities\u201d that might occur in a bumper, especially when vehicles are parked on public streets that \u201care accessible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>to the public and the police in ways that a home, an office, or' commercial structure would not be.\u201d <em>Oliver, </em>466 U.S. at 179, 104 S.Ct. at 1741; <em>see California v. Carney, </em>471 U.S. 386, 392, 105 S.Ct. 2066, 2070, 85 L.Ed.2d 406 (1985) (\u201cThe public is fully aware that it is accorded less privacy in its automobiles because of this compelling governmental need for regulation.\u201d); <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 367, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 3096, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976) (finding that \u201cless rigorous warrant requirements govern because the expectation of privacy with respect to one\u2019s automobile is significantly less than that relating to one\u2019s home or office\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">2. Installation of GPS as a Seizure</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Appellant also claims that he had an expectation of privacy against seizures of the van. He argues that the police seized the van when they placed the device in the van\u2019s bumper because it \u201cchanged the nature\u201d of the property, decreasing its value.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Karo </em>explained that seizure of property occurs \u201cwhen \u2018there is some meaningful interference with an individual\u2019s possessory interests in that property.\u2019\u201d 468 U.S. at 712, 104 S.Ct. at 3302 (quoting <em>United States v. Jacobsen, </em>466 U.S. 109, 113, 104 S.Ct. 1652, 1656, 80 L.Ed.2d 85 (1984)). The Court then noted, \u201cThe existence of a physical trespass is only marginally relevant to the question of whether the Fourth Amendment has been violated, however, for an actual trespass is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712-13, 104 S.Ct. at 3302 (citing <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967); <em>Oliver v. United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">Here, appellant does not establish the placement of the GPS in the van\u2019s bumper was a \u201cmeaningful interference\u201d with his interest in the van. Although appellant contends that people commonly do not want to purchase vehicles that can be tracked by the police, it seems just as common for people to purchase cars that have devices installed that allow tracking of the vehicle. In addition, appellant\u2019s \u201cpossessory interests\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>the value of the van are exceptionally limited because he did not own the van. It belonged to his employer. The president of that company testified at the suppression hearing, but he did not express and has not expressed any concerns or objections regarding the installation of the device in his company\u2019s van.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, any decrease in the value of the van would have had a minimal, not a meaningful, interference with appellant\u2019s interests in the vehicle. We do not reach the question of whether there would have been a seizure of the van under these circumstances if appellant had owned the van because we do not need to do so in order to decide the question before us.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Appellant urges this Court to consider <em>Commonwealth v. Connolly, </em>454 Mass. 808, 913 N.E.2d 356 (2009), where the Massachusetts Supreme Court concluded that \u201cthe installation and use of the GPS tracking device\u201d was a seizure. <em>Id. </em>at 811, 913 N.E.2d at 361. In that case, the Massachusetts police installed a GPS device in the engine compartment of Connolly\u2019s minivan, so that the device could draw power from the vehicle\u2019s battery. <em>Id. </em>at 811-12, 913 N.E.2d at 361-62. Relying on the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, which is more expansive than the Fourth Amendment,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Massachusetts court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">a warrant was required here because the initial installation of the particular device clearly constituted a seizure under art. 14. The installation required not only entry by the police into the minivan for one hour, but also operation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>the vehicle\u2019s electrical system, in order to attach the device to the vehicle\u2019s power source and to verify that it was operating properly. Moreover, operation of the device required power from the defendant\u2019s vehicle, an ongoing physical intrusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 822, 762 N.E.2d at 369. Clearly, the installation in <em>Connolly </em>differs greatly from the installation in this case. Here, the police did not access the inside of the vehicle by lifting the hood or moving any part of the van. The GPS device installed by the Fairfax police did not use any power from the van\u2019s battery, but instead operated independently, unlike the one in <em>Connolly. </em>In addition to these factual differences, the legal analysis of the Massachusetts court is not relevant here as Article I, \u00a7 10 of the Virginia Constitution is coextensive with the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution \u2014 not broader. <em>Lowe v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 346, 348, 337 S.E.2d 273, 274 (1985). Therefore, <em>Connolly </em>is not persuasive authority for this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Instead, we find <em>McIver </em>instructive. In that case, discussed <em>supra, </em>the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that officers did not \u201cseize\u201d the vehicle because the defendant did not prove that the placement of the tracking devices \u201cdeprived him of dominion and control of his Toyota 4Runner, nor did he demonstrate\u201d that the devices damaged his vehicle in some way. 186 F.3d at 1127. The court concluded that Mclver had not established that the placement \u201cmeaningfully interfere^]\u201d with his \u201cpossessory interest\u201d in the 4Runner. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">We also find <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>474 F.3d 994 (7th Cir.2007), persuasive. In <em>Garcia, </em>the police attached a self-powered GPS to Garcia\u2019s car while it was parked on a public street. Garcia argued that the installation of the GPS was a seizure of his car. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit disagreed, explaining that Garcia\u2019s argument was \u201cuntenable.\u201d The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">The device did not affect the car\u2019s driving qualities, did not draw power from the car\u2019s engine or battery, did not take up room that might otherwise have been occupied by pas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>sengers or packages, did not even alter the car\u2019s appearance, and in short did not \u201cseize\u201d the car in any intelligible sense of the word.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In the case before this Court, as in <em>McIver </em>and <em>Garcia, </em>the installation of the GPS device in no way interfered with appellant\u2019s ability to operate the vehicle. The police did not damage the van by installing the GPS device in the bumper. No private information was exposed by the act of simply installing the device. In addition, as noted <em>supra, </em>appellant\u2019s possessory interest in the vehicle was limited, as the van belonged to his employer, not to him. We, therefore, conclude that any interference with appellant\u2019s limited possessory interest in the van was not a \u201c \u2018meaningful interference\u2019 \u201d by the police. <em>Karo, </em>468 U.S. at 712, 104 S.Ct. at 3302. Thus, the installation in this case did not constitute a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">B. Activation of the GPS Device</p>\n<p id=\"A_c\">Appellant also argues that the actual tracking of the van violated his Fourth Amendment privacy interests. Specifically, he contends that continually tracking his movements on the public roadways was a violation of his expectation of privacy. He also contends that tracking the van to his employer\u2019s warehouse, i.e., on private property, violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Before addressing the specifics of his argument, we note that appellant raises several dire predictions of law enforcement officers attempting to track the whereabouts of every citizen in Virginia, if this Court finds the trial court did not err here. Several other appellate courts have acknowledged a very legitimate concern that, if the police are allowed to randomly track whole sections of the population without probable cause or reasonable suspicion, then privacy rights may well be violated. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Knotts, </em>460 U.S. 276, 284, 103 S.Ct. 1081, 1086, 75 L.Ed.2d 55 (1983) (\u201c[I]f such dragnet-type law enforcement practices as respondent \u2022 envisions should eventually occur, there will be time enough then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>to determine whether different constitutional principles may be applicable.\u201d); <em>Garcia, </em>474 F.3d at 998 (\u201cIt would be premature to rule that such a program of mass surveillance could not possibly raise a question under the Fourth Amendment____\u201d). However, this case does not involve dragnets and mass surveillance, so these warnings are not as relevant here. <em>See Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, </em>476 U.S. 227, 239 n. 5, 106 S.Ct. 1819, 1827 n. 5, 90 L.Ed.2d 226 (1986) (\u201cFourth Amendment cases must be decided on the facts of each case, not by extravagant generalizations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">1. Tracking on Public Roadways</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Appellant argues that he exhibited an expectation of privacy while he was driving the work van down public streets and that society recognizes this expectation of privacy as reasonable. In making this particular argument, appellant raises concerns of an Orwellian society resulting from the use of sophisticated technologies such as GPS tracking \u2014 concerns that do indeed initially raise practical and constitutional alarms. <em>See Garcia, </em>474 F.3d at 998 (\u201cOne can imagine the police affixing GPS tracking devices to thousands of cars at random, recovering the devices, and using digital search techniques to identify suspicious driving patterns. One can even imagine a law requiring all new cars to come equipped with the device so that the government can keep track of all vehicular movement in the United States.\u201d). However, given the facts of this particular case, as Judge Posner and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals also concluded in <em>Garcia, </em>\u201c[wjhether and what kind of restrictions should, in the name of the Constitution, be placed on such surveillance when used in routine criminal enforcement are momentous issues that fortunately we need not try to resolve in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As in <em>Garcia, </em>appellant\u2019s claims fail to hold water under the facts of this case because the police used the GPS device to crack this case by tracking appellant on the public roadways \u2014 which they could, of course, do in person any day of the week at any hour without obtaining a warrant. Therefore, we disagree with appellant\u2019s argument and find that Judge Posner\u2019s com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>ments about judicial restraint are also appropriate and applicable here, where the police also used a GPS device primarily to track a suspect on public streets. Consequently, we do not address the concerns raised by appellant regarding what may one day be potential future practices of the police, but instead address appellant\u2019s arguments regarding the actual actions of the police taken in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">a. Subjective Expectation of Privacy</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Appellant claims that he manifested a subjective expectation of privacy with his \u201chunting\u201d behavior, i.e., by driving around in the van looking for victims. While we believe that appellant wanted this behavior to remain undetected, this \u201chunting\u201d behavior on the public streets did not indicate a subjective expectation of privacy. <em>See Class, </em>475 U.S. at 114, 106 S.Ct. at 966.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The police tracked appellant as he drove a van that was emblazoned with his employer\u2019s logo, which helped advertise the company\u2019s name to people who observed the van going by them on the public streets. The van itself, therefore, suggested that people would observe its movements. Appellant did nothing to minimize the visibility of the logo or the -van in general. In addition, nothing in this record suggests that appellant attempted to hide the movement of the van or \u201csneak\u201d it down the road. He did nothing to prevent people from observing him as he drove on the public streets. In fact, the officers described his \u201chunting\u201d behavior as driving slowly through the same areas, repeating a pattern \u2014 actually making it easier rather than harder for someone to observe the van\u2019s movements. This kind of behavior does not indicate that appellant actually attempted to prevent people from observing his actions. <em>Compare Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 352, 88 S.Ct. 507, 511, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) (explaining that when an individual enters a phone booth, closes the door, and pays to make a call, the individual has evidenced an expectation that his conversation will not be heard by an \u201cuninvited ear\u201d). Appellant did not exhibit a subjective expectation of privacy while he was driving the work van down public streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>b. Societal Expectation of Privacy</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Appellant also claims that society recognizes as reasonable an expectation \u201cnot to be constantly tracked.\u201d However, the United States Supreme Court has held that society does not recognize such an expectation for vehicles <em>on public streets. Knotts, </em>460 U.S. at 281, 103 S.Ct. at 1085 (\u201cA person traveling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movements from one place to another.\u201d); <em>Cardwell, </em>417 U.S. at 590, 94 S.Ct. at 2469 (\u201cA car has little capacity for escaping public scrutiny. It travels public thoroughfares where both its occupants and its contents are in plain view.\u201d); <em>see also Garcia, </em>474 F.3d at 997 (\u201cThe substitute here [using GPS to track a suspect] is for an activity, namely following a car on a public street, that is unequivocally <em>not </em>a search within the meaning of the amendment.\u201d). Society recognizes a privacy right not to be tracked in one\u2019s home, but the home is a very different setting from a public street. <em>See Kyllo, </em>533 U.S. at 33, 121 S.Ct. at 2043 (\u201cWhile we upheld enhanced aerial photography of an industrial complex in <em>Dow Chemical, </em>we noted that we found \u2018it important that this is <em>not </em>an area immediately adjacent to a private home, where privacy expectations are most heightened,\u2019 476 U.S. at 237, n. 4, 106 S.Ct. at 1826, n. 4 (emphasis in original).\u201d); <em>Karo, </em>468 U.S. at 715, 104 S.Ct. at 3303 (noting that, just as an officer cannot \u201csurreptitiously\u201d enter a home to determine if contraband is in the home, police cannot \u201csurreptitiously employ[ ] an electronic device to obtain information that it could not have obtained by observation from outside the curtilage of the house\u201d). As appellant\u2019s movements in his home were not tracked \u2014 only the movements of the work van were recorded \u2014 no recognized privacy right was violated when the police used the GPS device to track the van\u2019s movements on the public streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Appellant acknowledges the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Knotts </em>that \u201cpersons do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their movements on the public streets.\u201d However, he argues that technology has evolved since <em>Knotts </em>was decided, and, therefore, we should not con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>sider the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in that case as controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">In <em>Knotts, </em>the police placed a beeper into a container that was then sold to Knotts and his co-defendants. 460 U.S. at 278, 103 S.Ct. at 1083-84. Unlike here, where the GPS system automatically tracked and recorded the movement of the van, the beeper technology discussed in <em>Knotts </em>required that the police follow the signal from the beeper as the container was moved. <em>Id. </em>We find that this advancement in tracking technology provides an insufficient basis for distinguishing <em>Knotts. </em>As the trial court found, the use of GPS tracking only enabled the police to \u201ctechnologically supplement that information which the police could have obtained by their own sensory perception\u201d if they had been physically following appellant \u2014 and physically following a van\u2019s movements on public streets (which is the key to the police\u2019s resolution of this case), without stopping or interfering with the van, is certainly constitutionally legitimate behavior for police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The United States Supreme Court has acknowledged a difference between technology used as a substitute for legitimate police behavior and technology used as a substitute for police actions that violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>Karo, </em>468 U.S. at 715, 104 S.Ct. at 3303. Based on the record in this case, the GPS technology used here did not provide a substitute for police behavior that would have otherwise violated a recognized right to privacy. Here, a police officer could have followed and personally recorded the movements of the van, and, as appellant concedes, such an investigation would not have violated any recognized right of privacy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>Knotts, </em>in fact, noted that \u201c[n]othing in the Fourth Amendment prohibited the police from augmenting the sensory faculties bestowed upon them at birth with such enhancement as science and technology afforded them in this case.\u201d 460 U.S. at 282, 103 S.Ct. at 1086. The fact that the police used technology to follow the van\u2019s movements on public streets, therefore, did not somehow invade appellant\u2019s recognized privacy interests because the GPS did not act as a substitute for unconstitutional police action.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Smith v. Maryland, </em>442 U.S. 735, 741, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 2580-81, 61 L.Ed.2d 220 (1979), the analysis here requires that a court determine if the \u201ccontents\u201d of private behavior were invaded by the police. Here, the police tracked the movement of a van. The GPS did not give the police the ability to intercept appellant\u2019s conversations or to observe any private behavior inside the van. The van did not go into appellant\u2019s home. <em>See Cardwell, </em>417 U.S. at 590, 94 S.Ct. at 2469 (\u201cOne has a lesser expectation of privacy in a motor vehicle because its function is transportation and it seldom serves as one\u2019s residence or as the repository of personal effects.\u201d); <em>contrast United States v. Bailey, </em>628 F.2d 938, 943-44 (6th Cir.1980) (finding Bailey\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy was violated by the police using a beeper to track containers of chemicals being stored in various apartments). The GPS tracking simply \u201cenabled the police to be more effective in detecting crime\u201d because they could follow the van on the streets without losing it and without using limited police manpower. <em>Knotts, </em>460 U.S. at 284, 103 S.Ct. at 1086. Improving \u201cpolice efficiency\u201d is certainly not unconstitutional as long as the underlying observation by the police was not unconstitutional. <em>Id.; see Garcia, </em>474 F.3d at 998 (noting that the Fourth Amendment \u201ccannot sensibly be read to mean that police shall be no more efficient in the twenty-first century than they were in the eighteenth\u201d). As observing a person\u2019s work van on the public streets is not unconstitutional, the police\u2019s use of the GPS system to track appellant while he was in the van on the public streets likewise did not violate the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">2. Tracking at the Employer\u2019s Warehouse</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Appellant argues that the GPS system tracked the van onto the private property of his employer, which he alleges violated the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, he con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>tends, the trial court should have granted his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The trial court specifically found that appellant had not proven \u201cthat by tracking him to the business, his place of business, that there was anything there that caused an invasion of his privacy.\u201d On appeal, appellant does not explain how the police violated <em>his own </em>privacy expectations by tracking his work van to <em>his employer\u2019s </em>warehouse. Therefore, appellant has not established a subjective expectation of his own privacy that was violated by the GPS tracking of his employer\u2019s van when it was parked at his employer\u2019s place of business.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See Kyllo, </em>533 U.S. at 33, 121 S.Ct. at 2042-43. Furthermore, it certainly appears, as the Commonwealth argues, that the GPS tracking of the work van while at the warehouse did not contribute in any way to the decision by the police to personally follow appellant on February 6, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Appellant cites several federal district court cases involving cell phones, which can and often are taken into private <em>homes </em>to support his position that the police cannot track individuals on private property. However, appellant does not argue that the police tracked his movements in his home, so those cases do not apply. The \u201cpotential\u201d use of GPS tracking in other circumstances to follow individuals into truly private areas has no place in the analysis of this case. <em>Karo, </em>468 U.S. at 712-13, 104 S.Ct. at 3301-02; <em>Dow Chemical Co., </em>476 U.S. at 239 n. 5, 106 S.Ct. at 1827 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">We find the police did not violate the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article 1, section 10, of the Virginia Constitution by installing a GPS device in the bumper of appellant\u2019s work van while it was parked on a public street or by tracking the van with the GPS system on the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>streets, especially given that, before installing the GPS device and tracking the van, the police had reasonable, articulable suspicion that appellant was involved in a series of sexual assaults.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because we find that there is no search or seizure prohibited under the Fourth Amendment or under the Virginia Constitution, we do not need to further address appellant\u2019s argument that the evidence he seeks to suppress should have been excluded at trial as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion to suppress and affirm appellant\u2019s conviction for abduction with intent to defile.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-8\">. This Court granted appellant's petition to consider three questions. However, during oral argument, appellant conceded that the Commonwealth now agreed with him that the GPS system was able to track appellant's van while it was in his employer\u2019s warehouse, which had been the central disagreement upon which the third question presented was based. Therefore, appellant concluded, his third question presented was not important to the resolution of his appeal. As a result, we do not consider the third question presented in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-8\">.

The Commonwealth on appeal has argued, contrary to the ruling of the trial court, that appellant did not have standing because he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>using the van for purposes other than the purposes approved by his employer. However, this finding by the trial court in this particular case does not fall into the category of rulings that the Commonwealth would have been allowed to appeal. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-398(A) (granting to the Commonwealth the ability to petition for appeal pretrial rulings in limited cases where a trial court has dismissed an indictment or suppressed evidence). Because the Commonwealth cannot legitimately raise the issue here, we will not address the question of standing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\">.

The facts of this case are distinguishable from those recently considered in <em>United States v. Maynard, </em>No. 08-3034, - F.3d --, -, 2010 WL 3063788, at *1, 7, 2010 U.S.App. LEXIS 16417, at *4, 20 (D.C.Cir. Aug. 6, 2010), which, of course, is not controlling precedent for this Court. In <em>Maynard, </em>the police tracked the movements of a co-defendant, Jones, 24 hours a day for four weeks using a GPS device they had installed on Jones\u2019s own Jeep without a warrant. <em>Maynard, </em>- F.3d at ----, 2010 WL 3063788, at *7-8, 2010 U.S.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>LEXIS 16417, at *22. Reversing the denial of Jones's motion to suppress in that case, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that <em>\u201cthe whole </em>of a person's movements <em>over the course of a month </em>is not actually exposed to the public because the likelihood a stranger would observe all those movements is not just remote, it is essentially nil.\u201d <em>Maynard, </em>- F.3d at -, 2010 WL 3063788, at *12, 2010 U.S.App. LEXIS 16417, at *35 (emphasis added). In so holding, the Court reasoned that a reasonable person does not expect a \"stranger to pick up the scent again the next day and the day after that, <em>week in and week out, </em>dogging his prey until he has identified <em>all the places, people, amusements, and chores </em>that make up that person\u2019s hitherto private routine.\u201d <em>Maynard, </em>- F.3d at-, 2010 WL 3063788, at *12, 2010 U.S.App. LEXIS 16417, at *35-36 (emphasis added). Here, the police used GPS technology affixed to the outside of appellant's work van (with its advertising of his employer\u2019s business on the van\u2019s sides and with his employer's restrictions on appellant's use of the van) to track appellant's movements <em>with that van </em>for at most six days. On these facts, the police were able to monitor only <em>portions </em>of appellant's daily movements for those six days \u2014 not <em>the whole </em>of his movements for nearly a month, which was the situation in <em>Maynard. See Maynard, </em>- F.3d at -, 2010 WL 3063788, at *13, 2010 U.S.App. LEXIS 16417, at *39 <em>(\u201cThe whole </em>of one's movements over the course of a month is not constructively exposed to the public because, like a rap sheet, that whole reveals far more than the individual movements it comprises.\u201d (emphasis added)). Thus, whereas in <em>Maynard </em>the police used GPS technology to track the whole of defendant Jones\u2019s movements in his own Jeep around the clock for nearly a month, the police here used GPS technology for less than a week to track appellant while he was driving a company van that had advertising intended to reach the public on it \u2014 and never used GPS technology to track appellant while appellant was driving his own vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b136-12\">. A New York appellate court has held that warrantless tracking of a defendant with a GPS device for 65 days violated the State of New York\u2019s constitution, but that court acknowledged that the United States Constitution might not include this level of protection. <em>People v.

During the suppression hearing, the Commonwealth asked the trial court to find that the evidence which appellant sought to suppress was not the \"fruit\u201d of a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. <em>See Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 487-88, 83 S.Ct. 407, 417, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963) (discussing the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine for exclusion of evidence). However, the trial court instead explicitly based its denial of the motion to suppress on its finding that appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were not violated. In discussing the facts that supported this decision, the trial court did find that, after collecting the information from the GPS device and reviewing it, the police then decided to personally follow appellant, suggesting that they would not have followed him unless they had knowledge of his movements that the GPS tracking provided. On appeal, the Commonwealth has argued that there is simply no Fourth Amendment violation in this case. The Commonwealth has not really argued to this Court that, even if there were a Fourth Amendment violation by attaching and using the GPS device to track the van on the public streets, the testimony of the police who then followed appellant and observed his attack on the victim was, nevertheless, not \"fruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d Indeed, the Commonwealth states on brief, \u201d[T]he defendant\u2019s driving on public roads on the afternoon and evening of February 5, 2008, provided the impetus for the physical surveillance\u201d by the police that resulted in their observing his attack on the victim.

Based on information law enforcement officers had developed in investigating a series of unsolved sexual assaults in that region, they had begun to focus on appellant as a prime suspect in those unsolved crimes prior to placing the GPS device on appellant\u2019s employer\u2019s van.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Even assuming, without deciding, that the officers\u2019 placing a GPS device in the bumper of employer\u2019s van driven by appellant, while that vehicle was on a public street, somehow violated appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>appellant sought to suppress was the officers\u2019 eyewitness testimony of appellant attacking the victim. There is no dispute that the officers\u2019 eyewitness testimony, which appellant seeks to suppress as the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d of the asserted violation of his Fourth Amendment rights,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> was competent and relevant evidence proving appellant abducted the victim from the sidewalk to sexually assault her.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">In <em>Warlick v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 263, 266, 208 S.E.2d 746, 748 (1974),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the Supreme Court provided three limitations to the exclusionary rule and the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine: \u201c(1) evidence attributed to an independent source; (2) evidence where the connection has become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint; and (3) evidence which inevitably would have been gained even without the unlawful action.\u201d The record on appeal clearly reflects that the officers had obtained evidence independently of that provided through the GPS device that appellant was a strong suspect in the recent unsolved sexual assaults in the region. The record shows that their focus on appellant as a prime suspect was based on a comparison of the <em>modus operandi </em>that led to his prior conviction to the <em>modus operandi </em>used by a perpetrator of the recent unsolved sexual assaults. The latter assaults occurred in the area where appellant lived and where he attended meetings required as part of his probation requirements following his release from prison. Based on that information, the officers determined that they would visually follow appellant\u2019s movement. On the day of the attack at issue here, they observed appellant driving his personal car, then park and leave it on a public street and walk in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>direction of a woman who was walking by herself on the public way. When the officers saw appellant sexually attack the woman, they intervened, rescued the victim, and arrested him for the sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">In my view, the record on appeal provides no basis to exclude the eyewitness testimony of the officers who witnessed appellant\u2019s sexual attack on the victim. The officers\u2019 eyewitness testimony, as well as that of the victim, was competent to prove that appellant was guilty of abduction with the intent to defile the victim. Accordingly, I would affirm appellant\u2019s conviction without addressing the GPS Fourth Amendment issue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\">. Appellant's petition for appeal to this Court contained eight questions presented. We granted only three questions presented, each of which related to whether the officers\u2019 use of the GPS tracking device violated appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizure requiring the trial court to exclude any direct or derivative evidence obtained by the use of that device.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b141-6\">. <em>See Wong Sun v.
