On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in sentencing him pursuant to the mandatory minimum provisions contained in Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>\u00a7 18.2-374.3(C).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the following reasons, we find that the trial court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The underlying facts are not in controversy. Appellant contacted a person that he believed was thirteen years old, via both a telephone and an email address, to arrange sexual intercourse at the home of the person\u2019s alleged aunt. This person in reality, however, was a policewoman. He was charged with four offenses arising out of this incident, including one count of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">After appellant pled guilty via an <em>Alford </em>plea to these offenses,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the trial court continued the case for a sentencing hearing. At that hearing, appellant objected to sentencing under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(C), which contains a mandatory minimum sentence of five years \u201cif the [defendant] is at least seven years older than the child he knows or has reason to believe is less than 15 years of age.\u201d He argued that, because the actual \u201cchild\u201d in this case was not less than fifteen years old, the mandatory minimum sentence should not be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The trial court disagreed and sentenced appellant to ten years with five years suspended, consistent with the mandatory minimum sentence provision in the Code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(C), a defendant is guilty of illegally using a communication system if he contacts \u201cany person he knows or has reason to believe is a child less than 15 years of age\u201d with lascivious intent for the purpose of soliciting that person\u2019s involvement in any of several sexual encounters. While generally this crime is treated as a Class 5 felony, if a defendant was \u201cat least seven years older than the child he knows or has reason to believe is less than 15 years of age,\u201d then he shall be sentenced to \u201ca term of imprisonment of not less than five years nor more than 30 years in a state correctional facility, five years of which shall be mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Appellant, who was thirty-two years old at the time of the offense, contends that the trial court misinterpreted this statute. Specifically, he argues that the use of \u201cthe child\u201d in the sentencing portion of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(C) should be interpreted to mean that the mandatory minimum sentence applies only when the victim is actually a child. As the recipient of his email and telephone communications in this case was a policewoman, not an actual child, appellant contends that the trial court erred in applying the five-year minimum in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">A. Statutory Interpretation Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u201cStatutory interpretation is a question of law which we review <em>de novo, </em>and we determine the legislative intent from the words used in the statute, applying the plain meaning of the words unless they are ambiguous or would lead to an absurd result.\u201d <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 754, 759, 685 S.E.2d 655, 657 (2009). In addition, we should avoid interpretations that \u201cwould negate the legislative intent and would require an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute.\u201d <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 763, 250</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>S.E.2d 760, 763 (1979). When \u201ca statute contains no express definition of a term, the general rule of statutory construction is to infer the legislature\u2019s intent from the plain meaning of the language used.\u201d <em>Hubbard v. Henrico Ltd. Pshp., 255 </em>Va. 335, 340, 497 S.E.2d 335, 338 (1998). This Court must avoid interpretations that would \u201cviolate the settled principle of statutory construction that every part of a statute is presumed to have some effect and no part will be considered meaningless unless absolutely necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this analysis, we are guided by the principles expressed in <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>142 Va. 620, 625, 128 S.E. 578, 579 (1925):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">When we know the object of a statute and are called upon to construe a phrase or a sentence which, standing alone, may be susceptible of different interpretations, we know of no safer rule than to take the statute by its four corners and critically examine it as a whole to ascertain the legislative intent, as manifested by its different provisions. If, upon such an examination, an interpretation can be made, consistent with the language used, which will carry into effect the object sought to be accomplished by the statute, that interpretation should be adopted, in preference to one which would be equally consistent with the language used, standing alone, but which would defeat, or tend to defeat, the manifest intent of the legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">In short, courts must defer to the clear language enacted by the General Assembly and its clear purpose for enacting or amending a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">B. Use of \u201cthe child\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">In order to convict a defendant of a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(C), the trial court must find, <em>inter alia, </em>that the defendant was communicating with \u201cany person\u201d that he \u201cknows or has reason to believe is a child less than 15 years of age.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant conceded that he communicated with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>police officer believing that she was a child less than fifteen years old. The sentencing language then requires that a perpetrator receive at least a five-year sentence if he \u201cis at least seven years older than <em>the child </em>he knows or has reason to believe is less than 15 years of age.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(0) (emphasis added). Appellant argues that his crime did not actually involve a child, so \u201cthe child\u201d is nonexistent in this case. Therefore, he contends, the mandatory minimum provision in the statute does not apply here. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">This Court has previously noted that the purpose behind this portion of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3 is to criminalize \u201cthe knowing use of a communications system to solicit a minor for certain criminal acts,\u201d but \u201cdoes not require the solicitation of an actual minor.\u201d <em>Podracky v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 130, 138, 141, 662 S.E.2d 81, 85, 87 (2008). Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(C) creates a crime that involves the incitement to act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>illegally rather than actually committing the illegal act. Thus, the legislature clearly did not intend that the victim must be an actual child; the defendant\u2019s solicitation of sexual behavior from a person that he believes is a child constitutes the behavior that the legislature intended to prohibit. <em>Id. </em>at 142, 662 S.E.2d at 88 (noting that <em>\u201cHix </em>also establishes that Podracky was guilty of criminal solicitation despite the fact that he mistakenly addressed his solicitations to an adult police officer.\u201d (citing <em>Hix v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 335, 619 S.E.2d 80 (2005))); <em>see Huffman v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 823, 826-27, 284 S.E.2d 837, 839-40 (1981) (discussing solicitation as an inchoate crime, universally recognized under the common law of the United States). The legislature crafted the language that establishes this offense, and the punishment for it, in a manner that makes proof of the actual age of the recipient of the offending communication irrelevant. A trial court may convict a defendant upon proof that he <em>believed </em>the person that he solicited was a child. Thus, in every case of a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(C), if the defendant communicates with the victim of his solicitations and that person is held out to the defendant as being a child under the age of fifteen, then the person solicited is \u201ca child\u201d \u2014 whether the actual person contacted is a child or not \u2014 for the purposes of this statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">With this manifest intent of the General Assembly in mind, <em>Harris, </em>142 Va. at 625, 128 S.E. at 579, we turn to the sentencing portion of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(C). In order for the mandatory minimum to apply to appellant\u2019s sentencing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>evidence needed to prove that he was \u201cat least seven years older than <em>the child </em>he knows or has reason to believe is less than 15 years of age.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Appellant claims that the use of \u201cthe child\u201d indicates that the legislature intended that, for purposes of the mandatory minimum, the victim must be an actual child.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Although to convict a defendant under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3 the Commonwealth does not need to prove that the defendant contacted an actual child, the General Assembly, by enacting this statute, clearly intended to protect children from people who would take advantage of them <em>before </em>the perpetrator could commit a sexual assault on an actual child. <em>See Colbert v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 390, 398-99, 624 S.E.2d 108, 112-13 (2006) (noting that the provisions of what is now Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(C) are intended to protect children). The lack of a requirement that the Commonwealth prove any assault occurred and the lack of a requirement that an actual child be contacted clearly indicate this intent. <em>See Hubbard, </em>255 Va. at 340, 497 S.E.2d at 338 (\u201c[T]he general rule of statutory construction is to infer the legislature\u2019s intent from the plain meaning of the language used.\u201d). Applying the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions <em>only </em>to circumstances where a defendant contacted an actual child would undermine this purpose, allowing defendants who have the same purpose and take the same actions to avoid mandatory prison terms and continue their attempts to solicit children.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(C) requires that the trial court sentence a defendant to at least five years if \u201cthe person,\u201d i.e., the defendant, is seven years or more older than <em>\u201cthe </em>child he knows or has reason to believe is less than 15 years of age.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The word \u201cthe\u201d is used grammatically in the statute as a definite article \u2014 a word that, when used before a noun, specifies or particularizes the meaning of the noun that follows, as opposed to the indefinite article \u201ca.\u201d <em>See American Bus Ass\u2019n v. Slater, </em>231 F.3d 1, 4-5 (D.C.Cir.2000) (explaining that \u201c[i]t is a rule of law well established that the definite article \u2018the\u2019 particularizes the subject which it pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>cedes. It is a word of limitation as opposed to the indefinite or generalizing force of \u2018a\u2019 or \u2018an.\u2019\u201d (citing <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1477 (6th ed.1990))). The legislature used the definite article \u201cthe\u201d before \u201cchild\u201d in the sentencing portion of the statute, instead of the indefinite article \u201ca\u201d that it used before \u201cchild\u201d in the offense portion of the statute. \u201cThe child\u201d clearly refers to the one, particular subject who was the victim and target of the offense \u2014 whether that \u201cchild\u201d was actually an adult or not. <em>See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Smiley, </em>276 Ill.App.3d 971, 213 Ill.Dec. 698, 659 N.E.2d 1345, 1352 (1995) (\u201cThe word \u2018the\u2019 is \u2018an article which particularizes the subject spoken of <em>(Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1477 (6th ed.1990)); thus, use of the term \u2018the insured\u2019 in an exclusionary clause is meant to refer to a definite, specific insured.\u201d); <em>Lydon v. Sprinkler Servs., </em>841 A.2d 793, 797 (Me.2004) (\u201cIn this context, because \u2018the employee\u2019 certainly refers to the specific employee whose case is at issue, the evident change from the definite article to the use of the indefinite article \u2018an employee\u2019 in the final prohibition must reflect a legislative intent to refer not to the employee at issue, but to \u2018any' employee.\u201d); <em>Stephan v. Pennsylvania Gen. Ins. Co., </em>224 Conn. 758, 621 A.2d 258, 261 (1993) (\u201cAs a definite article, the word \u2018the\u2019 refers to a specific object whereas the indefinite articles \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018an\u2019 refer to unlimited objects.\u201d). The mandatory minimum provision in Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(C) clearly references <em>the </em>victim or target who is the subject of this crime, and who may or may not be an actual child.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In addition, the repetition of the phrase, \u201che knows <em>or has reason to believe </em>is less than 15 years of age,\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(C) (emphasis added) supports the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the statute as applying even if the victim is not actually a child. If the legislature had intended \u201cthe child\u201d to refer to an actual child, as appellant contends, then the legislature would have left the phrase, \u201che knows or has reason to believe,\u201d out of the sentencing provision and added language to clarify that \u201cchild,\u201d as used in this portion of the statute, no longer referred to any person that a defendant <em>believed </em>was under the age of fifteen. Instead, the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Assembly repeated the phrase, \u201che knows or has reason to believe is less than 15 years of age,\u201d in the sentencing portion of the statute, strongly suggesting that the actual age of \u201cthe child\u201d is unimportant \u2014 just as it is unimportant in the guilt phase. In addition, we note that appellant\u2019s interpretation of this statute would have us simply ignore this phrase, which is completely contrary to the principles of statutory interpretation and completely contrary to a common sense interpretation of the legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting this statute. <em>Wright, </em>278 Va. at 759, 685 S.E.2d at 657; <em>Hubbard, </em>255 Va. at 340, 497 S.E.2d at 338; <em>Harris, </em>142 Va. at 625, 128 S.E. at 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the mandatory minimum sentencing provision in Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3(C) applied in this case. The victim of the crime need not be an actual child for the mandatory minimum sentence to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">As the mandatory minimum sentencing provision applies here, the trial court did not err in sentencing appellant to an active sentence of five years in prison (i.e., ten years in prison, with five years suspended) upon his conviction of using a communication system to solicit a sexual encounter with a person he believed was under the age of fifteen. Therefore, we affirm his conviction and sentence, but remand for correction of a clerical error in the final sentencing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-13\">. <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 37-38, 91 S.Ct. 160, 167-68, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970) (acknowledging that a trial court can accept a guilty plea even if the defendant will only agree that the evidence is sufficient to convict him, but he will not admit his guilt).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b107-14\">. Periodically throughout the proceedings, the trial court and the parties referred to this offense as the \"pornography\u201d charge. This inaccurate description of the offense does not affect our analysis in this case, and no party has raised any issue regarding this mischaracterization.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b108-8\">. On brief, appellant also contends that the trial court may have convicted him under subsection (B), not subsection (C) of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3, and, therefore, the trial court erred in applying the mandatory minimum sentence. However, the record indicates that appellant seemed to believe he was convicted under subsection (C), and, most importantly, he did not raise any issue regarding subsection (B) prior to his appeal to this Court. As he did not raise this argument in the trial court, it is barred from consideration on appeal by Rule 5A:18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b108-9\">. Appellant was convicted and sentenced for violating four different statutes. In this appeal, he argues only that the trial court erred when it sentenced him to a mandatory minimum term of incarceration in relation to his conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b108-10\">. The final sentencing order contains a clerical error. The transcript and sentencing order clearly state that appellant was sentenced to a total of thirty-five years and that twenty-five years of that sentence would be suspended. However, at the conclusion of the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>order entered on May 18, 2009, the order lists the \"total time suspended\u201d as \"26 years.\u201d Therefore, we remand this case for the trial court to correct this conclusion of the sentencing order. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-428.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b110-9\">.

Any person who commits a second or subsequent violation of this subsection when the person is at least seven years older than the child he knows or has reason to believe is less than 15 years of age shall be punished by a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years nor more than 40 years, 10 years of which shall be a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b112-6\">. Although the evidence in this case established that the person that appellant believed was thirteen years old was actually a police officer, the Commonwealth was not required to prove anything about the actual person who was contacted by appellant. Code \u00a7 18.2-374.3 requires that the Commonwealth prove that the defendant knew or had reason to believe that the person he contacted was under the age of fifteen\u2014 not the actual age or identity of that person. We note that the Commonwealth did not include the age of the police officer that appellant contacted in its proffer of the facts at the time of the guilty plea, but did include information on the age of the person that appellant believed he was contacting and why appellant believed that she was under the age of fifteen.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
