Appealing his conviction for domestic assault and battery, a third offense, Daniel Lampkin maintains that an unsigned order documenting one predicate offense was improperly received in evidence. He argues that the order was not authenticated pursuant to the statute, and was thus inadmissible, because no evidence showed when the relevant term of court <em>began. </em>We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">II. <em>Fads</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">On February 8, 2010, Daniel Lampkin was tried for felony domestic assault and battery, a third offense, in the Circuit Court of Pittsylvania County. At trial, the Commonwealth moved into evidence two prior domestic assault conviction orders. Lampkin objected to the admission of the Henry County domestic assault conviction order arguing \u201cit lacks the official authentication.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">Counsel have stipulated that three properly certified Henry County Circuit Court orders were received in evidence: (1) An order dated January 16, 1998, signed by all presiding judges, reciting \u201cthat this Court does now stand adjourned until the next term thereof, as fixed by law\u201d; (2) an order dated April 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>1998, again signed by all judges, and reciting the quoted language above; and (3) an unsigned order dated March 10, 1998 documenting appellant\u2019s conviction for domestic assault and battery. Each of these three orders was certified as a true copy by the raised seal and the signature of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Henry County.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">The trial court took the objection under advisement, but ultimately determined the documents \u201cproved the element of third offense.\u201d The trial court found Lampkin guilty of domestic assault and battery, a third offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">III. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">\u201cGiven the \u2018broad discretion\u2019 of a trial judge over evidentiary matters, we apply a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of appellate review.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 741, 753, 607 S.E.2d 738, 743, <em>adopted upon reh\u2019g en banc, </em>45 Va.App. 811, 613 S.E.2d 870 (2005) (quoting <em>Seaton v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 739, 752, 595 S.E.2d 9, 15 (2004)). In determining whether the trial court abused its discretion, \u201c \u2018we do not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court. Rather, we consider only whether the record fairly supports the trial court\u2019s action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grattan v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 602, 620, 685 S.E.2d 634, 644 (2009) (quoting <em>Beck v. Commonwealth, </em>253 Va. 373, 385, 484 S.E.2d 898, 906 (1997)). Only when \u201c \u2018reasonable jurists could not differ\u2019 \u201d do we say an abuse of discretion occurred. <em>Tynes v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 17, 21, 635 S.E.2d 688, 689 (2006) (quoting <em>Thomas, </em>44 Va.App. at 753, 607 S.E.2d at 743).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">IV. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Lampkin does not contest the fact of his conviction or the certification of the Henry County conviction order. Rather, Lampkin argues the order was inadmissible as a matter of law to establish that conviction because no \u201corder or paper showing the beginning of the applicable term of court during which [his] conviction took place\u201d was entered into evidence. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Code \u00a7 19.2-295 provides that \u201cthe Commonwealth shall present the defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions by certified, attested or exemplified copies of the record of conviction.\u201d Nothing \u201cin this statute requires that the \u2018record of conviction,\u2019 if otherwise reliable, bear the signature of the sentencing judge.\u201d <em>Seaton, </em>42 Va.App. at 755-56, 595 S.E.2d at 17. However, circuit court orders of conviction \u201cshall be received [as prima facie evidence] <em>only when authenticated pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-123(A).\u201d Waller v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 731, 737, 685 S.E.2d 48, 51 (2009) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Under Code \u00a7 17.1-123(A), an unsigned order entered into a circuit court\u2019s order book is \u201cdeemed authenticated when ... an order is recorded in the order book on the last day of each term showing the signature of each judge presiding during the term.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also Weatherman v. Commonwealth, </em>91 Va. 796, 798, 22 S.E. 349, 350 (1895) (finding a judge\u2019s signature on the orders of the last day of a court term sufficient authorization of all preceding orders of the term that are spread upon the order book).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">We disagree with Lampkin that the Henry County conviction order is inadmissible because no \u201corder or paper showing the beginning of the applicable term of court during which [his] conviction took place\u201d was entered into evidence. In Code \u00a7 17.1-123(A), the General Assembly has clearly and unambiguously prescribed the procedure for authenticating an unsigned order in an order book. <em>See, e.g., Elliott v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 457, 463, 675 S.E.2d 178, 182 (2009) (finding we are bound by the unambiguous language of a statute). Nowhere does Code \u00a7 17.1-123(A) make a conviction order\u2019s authentication, and subsequent admissibility, contingent upon the admission of an order showing the beginning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>of the term of court during which the conviction was entered. Had the General Assembly desired to add such a requirement to the statute, it could have done so, but has not.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We decline appellant\u2019s invitation to do so here. <em>See Farrakhan v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 177, 180, 639 S.E.2d 227, 229 (2007) (finding an appellate court cannot add words to an unambiguous statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The Commonwealth submitted to the trial court an order ending the term preceding the March 10, 1998 conviction and an order ending the term during which that conviction was obtained. Under the plain terms of the statute, that was the only prerequisite for authentication and admission of the Henry County conviction order. Thus, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">V. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">In sum, we hold the trial court did not err in admitting the Henry County conviction order because it was properly authenticated in accordance with the statute. Thus, there is sufficient evidence to support his third domestic assault conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-13\">. Lampkin did not object to the admission of the prior Pittsylvania County domestic assault conviction order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b777-7\">. Indeed, there is no question that orders and oral pronouncements of the court need not be immediately recorded in the order book and signed by the judge. <em>Daley v. Commonwealth, </em>132 Va. 621, 623, 111 S.E. 111, 111 (1922). The \"universal practice is that the clerk extends the orders upon the permanent record of the court just as soon as possible, and they are thereafter read in open court and signed as orders of the date when the judgments were pronounced.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b778-9\">. Undoubtedly, such a requirement was not written into the statute because each circuit\u2019s terms of court are fixed by order and published in the Code of Virginia pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-517. Accordingly, the trial court could have taken judicial notice that the term of court during which Lampkin was convicted began on the \"Third Tuesday in January,\u201d or January 20, 1998. <em>See </em>Va. Sup.Ct. Rules, Part 1, Circuit Courts of Virginia, Times for the Commencement of the Regular Terms (1998); Code \u00a7 19.2-265.2 (\"Whenever, in a criminal case it becomes necessary to ascertain what the law, statutory or otherwise, of this Commonwealth ... is, or was, at any time, the court shall take judicial notice thereof whether specifically pleaded or not.\u201d). <em>See also Oulds v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 210, 213, 532 S.E.2d 33, 35 (2000) (finding the doctrine of judicial notice \"eliminates the necessity\u201d of introducing law into evidence).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
