On appeal, Smith admits his statement was false but argues he lacked <em>scienter </em>as a matter of law. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). This principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">Our examination of the record \u201cis not limited to the evidence mentioned by a party in trial argument or by the trial court in its ruling.\u201d <em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 144, 147, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008). In determining whether there is evidence to sustain a conviction, an appellate court must consider \u201call the evidence\u201d admitted at trial that is contained in the record. <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 94, 103, 688 S.E.2d 168, 173 (2010) (quoting <em>Bolden, </em>275 Va. at 147, 654 S.E.2d at 586).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">Smith was arrested on June 12, 2006, for felony possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. The general district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>court continued the case several times. Smith waived his right to a preliminary hearing and remained free on bail. Over a year later, on September 18, 2007, Smith\u2019s counsel wrote to advise Smith that the general district court had \u201ccertified\u201d the charge \u201cto the Grand Jury.\u201d On November 7, 2007, Smith\u2019s counsel wrote again to advise that the \u201ctrial date had been preset for January 11, 2008 at 10:00 a.m. in the Newport News Circuit Court. Your presence is required in court on that date.\u201d Counsel added a handwritten note to the letter: \u201cPlease give me a call to discuss case.\u201d A week later, on November 13, the grand jury issued an indictment against Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Smith did not call his counsel as instructed. Instead, on November 15, he walked into a pawnshop and attempted to buy a .40 caliber handgun. He filled out several forms, including ATF Form 4473 issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, an arm of the United States Department of Justice. The ATF Form 4473 begins, in bold letters, with:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">WARNING: You may not receive a firearm if prohibited by Federal or State Law. The information you provide will be used to determine whether you are prohibited under law from receiving a firearm. Certain violations of the Gun Control Act are punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment and/or up to a $250,000 fine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Various questions follow the warning, including Question ll.b, which asked: \u201cAre you under indictment or information in any court for a <em>felony, </em>or any other crime, for which the judge could imprison you for more than one year?\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Smith wrote \u201cNo\u201d in response to this question. Right above Smith\u2019s signature is a certification, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJy\">I certify that the answers to Section A are true and correct. I am aware that ATF Form 4473 contains Important Notices, Instructions, and Definitions____ I understand that a person who answers <em>\u201cyes </em>\u201d to any of the questions ll.b through ll.k is prohibited from purchasing or receiving a firearm---- I also understand that making any false oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>or written statement, or exhibiting any false or misrepresented identification with respect to this transaction, is a crime punishable as a felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The pawnshop manager refused to complete the sale after a computer background check revealed Smith\u2019s pending felony charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Charged with making a false statement on a firearm purchase form in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2, Smith took the stand in his own defense. He admitted reading ATF Form 4473 and answering its questions. At the time he filled out the form, Smith testified, he knew he had been charged with a felony and faced possible incarceration exceeding one year. He also knew he had earlier waived his right to a preliminary hearing. Smith likewise knew at the time he filled out the form that he had received letters from his counsel advising the felony charge had been certified to a grand jury and his trial had been preset for January 11,2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Even so, Smith testified he had no idea what the word \u201cindictment\u201d meant. The prosecutor focused on this point:</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Q: So when you got to the question, are you under indictment or information in any court for a felony or any other crime for which the judge could imprison you for more than one year, <em>you didn\u2019t know what the word indictment meant </em>in Section B?</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">A: <em>No.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Q: Why did you then \u2014 no, you <em>didn\u2019t know what it meant?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">A: No, I <em>did not know what it meant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">:i&lt; $ $ $ $</p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">Q: Alright, so despite all those statements in there, you didn\u2019t know what one of the items was, you didn\u2019t know what indictment meant <em>and you still answered no?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">A: <em>Right.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">* * * * * #</p>\n<p id=\"b371-17\">Q: And it\u2019s your testimony here in today\u2019s court that despite all of those \u2014 despite having waived your prelim-</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>inary hearing, despite having received these letters from Mr. Novey about your trial date, that <em>you still didn\u2019t know what an indictment was ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">A: <em>No, I didn\u2019t.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">App. 39-41 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In closing argument, the prosecutor argued, \u201cthroughout this form it\u2019s asking you to understand what\u2019s going on. And we\u2019re talking about the understanding of the word indictment.\u201d \u201cNot only that,\u201d the prosecutor continued, Smith \u201cadmits it on a form where all of these warnings pervade, do not answer this form if you do not understand it, do not answer this form because it may subject you to criminal liability. In the face of all that, he answered a question no to which he didn\u2019t even understand the word indictment.\u201d After denying Smith\u2019s motion to strike, the trial court found Smith guilty of making a false statement on a firearm purchase form in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2(K).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">On appeal, Smith argues Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2(K) only punishes a firearm buyer who answers \u201ca question on the form incorrectly, <em>knowing </em>at that time that the answer is incorrect.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 6 (emphasis in original). Working from that premise, Smith claims the uncontradicted evidence (his testimony) proved he did not know what the word \u201cindictment\u201d meant \u2014 thus he could not have possibly known he was under indictment. We follow Smith\u2019s logic but believe it leads to a very different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">A firearm buyer violates Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2(K) when he \u201cwillfully and intentionally\u201d makes a materially \u201cfalse statement\u201d on any \u201cfirearm transaction records as may be required by federal law.\u201d One such record is ATF Form 4473, which asks: \u201cAre you under <em>indictment </em>... in any court for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year?\u201d <em>Richardson v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 93, 98, 462 S.E.2d 120, 123 (1995) (emphasis in original). Smith answered that question with an unqualified <em>no. </em>\u201cThe word \u2018no\u2019 in response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>to a question assuredly makes a \u2018statement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brogan v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 398, 400-01, 118 S.Ct. 805, 808, 139 L.Ed.2d 830 (1998). And Smith\u2019s statement was false, as he was in fact under indictment at the time he filled out the ATF Form. Thus, the only issue is whether Smith made his false statement with the requisite <em>scienter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Smith sought to excuse his falsehood by claiming he did not know the meaning of the word \u201cindictment\u201d when he signed the ATF Form. Even if this were true, we fail to see how his excuse did anything but prove his deceit. If Smith did not know what an indictment was, he should not have <em>affirmatively </em>represented on the ATF Form that he was <em>not </em>under indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2 applies to false statements on any \u201cfirearm transaction records as may be required by federal law.\u201d A knowingly false statement on the required ATF Form also violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6). The <em>scienter </em>element of the parallel federal crime is satisfied by actual knowledge of the statement\u2019s falsity as well as any <em>\u201cdeliberate </em>disregard for its truth or falsity with a <em>conscious </em>purpose to avoid learning the truth.\u201d <em>United States v. Hester, </em>880 F.2d 799, 802 (4th Cir.1989) (emphasis added). This standard represents the unanimous view of the courts that have addressed the <em>scienter </em>issue in similar contexts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Consistent with these principles, the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Smith \u201cwillfully and intentionally\u201d made a false statement in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2(K). He made the untrue statement \u201cwith a bad purpose; without justifiable excuse ... without ground for believing it is lawful____\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>21 Va.App. at 99, 462 S.E.2d at 123 (citation omitted). The ATF Form explicitly warned Smith that making a false statement constituted a crime. <em>See United States v. Hayden, </em>64 F.3d 126, 132-33 (3d Cir.1995) (holding the ATF Form\u2019s warning of the illegality of making a false statement provided sufficient knowledge to satisfy the willfulness requirement). Despite that warning, Smith affirmatively declared he was <em>not </em>\u201cunder indictment\u201d while all along <em>knowing </em>he had no idea what the word \u201cindictment\u201d meant. By doing so, Smith displayed a \u201cdeliberate disregard for its truth or falsity with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth.\u201d <em>Hester, </em>880 F.2d at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Because the evidence proved Smith made a false statement on an ATF Form in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2(K), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\">. <em>See, e.g., United States v.

(Emphases added). Thus, I find unpersuasive and inappropriate the majority\u2019s heavy reliance on cases interpreting the <em>scienter </em>required by the federal statute, particularly as such a discussion may impact future interpretation of other Virginia stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>utes proscribing acts done \u201cwillfully and intentionally.\u201d <em>See generally </em>1 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>341 (2d ed.2003) (noting the traditional view of criminal intent often equated doing something <em>intentionally </em>with doing something <em>knowingly, </em>but that \u201cthe modern approach is to <em>define separately </em>the mental states of knowledge and intent\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Nevertheless, I agree that the evidence is sufficient to support Smith\u2019s conviction. \u201cTo be willful, conduct \u2018must be knowing or intentional, rather than accidental, and be done without justifiable excuse, without ground for believing the conduct is lawful, or with a bad purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 692, 699, 636 S.E.2d 403, 406 (2006) (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Duncan, </em>267 Va. 377, 384, 593 S.E.2d 210, 214 (2004)). Although, per the quoted definition from <em>Jones, </em>conduct is willful if it is either knowing <em>or </em>intentional, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2 requires that the willful conduct was also intentional. Thus, mere knowing conduct will not suffice to support a conviction under that statute. <em>Cf. Riegert v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 511, 518, 237 S.E.2d 803, 808 (1977) (in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence to prove larceny by false pretenses, holding that \u201cmerely showing ... the accused knowingly stated what was false is not sufficient\u201d and that \u201cthere must also be proof that his intent was to defraud\u201d). Here, Smith\u2019s conduct was intentional if he engaged in it with a conscious desire, intent, or purpose that a particular result would follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u201cIntent is the purpose formed in a person\u2019s mind and may be, and frequently is, shown by circumstances. It is a state of mind which may be proved by a person\u2019s conduct or by his statements.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 153, 156, 169 S.E.2d 449, 451 (1969). In weighing a witness\u2019 testimony, including the testimony of a defendant, the trier of fact may \u201caccept some parts as believable and reject other parts as implausible.\u201d <em>Pugliese v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 82, 92, 428 S.E.2d 16, 24 (1993). The evidence, viewed in light of these principles, supports the trial court\u2019s finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Smith intentionally made a materially false statement on the ATF Form 4473 he completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Question ll.b. of the ATF Form 4473 Smith completed<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> inquired as follows: \u201cAre you under indictment or information in any court for a <em>felony, </em>or any other crime, for which the judge could imprison you for more than one year? <em>(An information is a formal accusation of a crime by a prosecutor. See Definition 3.)\u201d </em>Definition 3 of the form indicates that the question applies to \u201c[a]n indictment, information, or conviction in any Federal, State, or local court.\u201d Smith admitted knowing when he completed the form on November 15, 2007, that he stood charged with a felony and that the maximum punishment he faced \u201c[w]as ... over a year.\u201d He also admitted that when he had previously appeared in district court and waived his right to a preliminary hearing as to that charge, a prosecutor was involved, and that he had received a letter \u201csomewhere close to November 7, 2008,\u201d from his attorney, which informed him that his trial date had been \u201cpreset\u201d for January 11, 2008. Finally, he testified he did not know what an indictment was but claimed that he \u201cdidn\u2019t think [he] was under indictment\u201d when he completed the form. The trial court found that Smith \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what the word indictment means,\u201d but that \u201c[a]s far as the <em>process </em>is concerned, ... the evidence shows that he knew what was going on.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Thus, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, supported a finding that, when Smith completed the form and answered, \u201cNo,\u201d to question ll.b., he had already appeared in lower court with a prosecutor and knew he was scheduled to be tried in \u201canother court,\u201d \u201cthe next step <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>up,\u201d for a felony for which he faced a maximum punishment of \u201cover a year.\u201d Despite knowing these things, and knowing, as the express language in question ll.b. indicated, that \u201c[a]n information is a formal accusation of a crime by a prosecutor,\u201d (emphasis omitted), he answered, \u201cNo,\u201d to the question, \u201cAre you under indictment or information in any court for a <em>felony, </em>or any other crime, for which the judge could imprison you for more than one year?\u201d Because Smith knew all these things, he could not truthfully answer \u201cNo\u201d to question ll.b., regardless of whether he knew what an indictment was.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Thus, the evidence supported a finding that Smith acted intentionally \u2014 with a conscious desire, intent or purpose to complete the form in a manner that would enable him to purchase a firearm \u2014 without regard for whether his answers were accurate or for whether he was permitted by law to purchase a firearm. Accordingly, I concur in the majority\u2019s ruling affirming Smith\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\">. The version of the form Smith completed indicates it was \"[r]evised May 2007.\u201d This version of the form contains language that has been added to question ll.b. since the Court quoted the form in <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 93, 98, 462 S.E.2d 120, 123 (1995) (quoting <em>Broolcs v.
