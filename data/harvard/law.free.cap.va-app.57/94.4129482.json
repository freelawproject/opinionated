On appeal, appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the testimony of all of his proffered character witnesses. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the character evidence proffered by appellant. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Whether evidence is admissible falls within the broad discretion of the trial court, and this Court will not disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The resolution of appellant\u2019s claim on appeal is reached by determining whether or not appellant offered the testimony for a proper purpose <em>and </em>laid the proper foundation to support the admission of his proffered character evidence. In this regard, character evidence is admissible for two different purposes at trial. First, \u201c \u2018[a] person on trial for a criminal offense has the right to introduce evidence of his reputation for pertinent character traits on the theory that it is improbable that a person who has a good reputation for such traits would be likely to commit the crime charged against him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Weimer v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 47, 52, 360 S.E.2d 381, 383 (1987) (quoting <em>Zirkle v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 862, 871, 55 S.E.2d 24, 29 (1949)). \u201cEvidence of this nature may be considered and weighed by the jury in determining his guilt or innocence, and, in a proper case, the punishment to be imposed.\u201d <em>Zirkle, </em>189 Va. at 871, 55 S.E.2d at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>On appeal, appellant argues that he offered evidence of his character for truthfulness and veracity as substantive proof of his innocence. The Supreme Court has long recognized that an individual\u2019s character for truthfulness is implicated in crimes involving the theft of another\u2019s possessions: \u201cEvidence of larceny involves \u2018the perpetrator\u2019s character for truth,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cstealing is a crime \u2018of that character which men generally are not found to commit unless when so depraved as to render it extremely probable that he will not speak the truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>167 Va. 526, 535-36, 189 S.E. 441, 445-46 (1937) (quoting <em>Davidson v. Watts, </em>111 Va. 394, 397-98, 69 S.E. 328, 329 (1910)). Appellant argues that he should have been allowed to introduce proof of his reputation for truthfulness and veracity to show that it was improbable that he obtained money by false pretenses from the victim or that he uttered a forged check.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">A second basis for the admission of character evidence is presented if the defendant testifies on his own behalf, and his character for truthfulness is called into question. Under these circumstances, he is entitled to present character evidence that supports his credibility as a witness. <em>Fry v. Commonwealth, </em>163 Va. 1085, 1087, 177 S.E. 860, 861 (1935) (citing <em>Miller v. Harless, </em>153 Va. 228, 149 S.E. 619 (1929)). Accordingly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">\u201cwhenever the character of a witness for truth is attacked, either by direct evidence of want of truth, or by cross-examination, or by proof of contradictory statements, in regard to the material facts, or by disproving by other witnesses the material facts stated by him in his examination; or in general, whenever his character for truth is impeached in any way known to the law, the party calling him may sustain him by evidence of his general reputation for truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Miller, </em>153 Va. at 241, 149 S.E. at 623). Facts are \u201cmaterial\u201d if they are those facts that \u201c \u2018the cross-examining party would be entitled to prove ... in support of [its] case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Seilheimer v. Melville, </em>224 Va. 323, 327, 295 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>896, 898 (1982) (quoting <em>Allen v. Commonwealth, </em>122 Va. 884, 842, 94 S.E. 783, 786 (1918)). \u201cEvery fact, however remote or insignificant, that tends to establish the probability or improbability of a fact in issue, is admissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Stamper v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 269, 257 S.E.2d 808, 815 (1979); <em>Ry. Co. v. Golladay, </em>164 Va. 292, 309, 180 S.E. 400, 407 (1935)).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">However, the prerogative of the defendant to introduce character evidence in appropriate circumstances is not unlimited. \u201cThe accused, in order to establish good character, is not permitted to prove specific acts, custom or course of conduct.\u201d <em>Chiles v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 698, 700, 406 S.E.2d 413, 414 (1991) (citing <em>Zirkle, </em>189 Va. at 871, 55 S.E.2d at 29; <em>Fields v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 300, 306, 343 S.E.2d 379, 382 (1986)). \u201cThe witnesses called may not testify to their own personal opinion of the accused, or to a special reputation of him formed upon a single occasion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 49 (3d ed.1988)); <em>accord Weimer, </em>5 Va.App. at 54, 360 S.E.2d at 384 (\u201c[Witnesses] may not testify that their own observation and knowledge leads them to believe that the defendant is a person of good reputation.\u201d). Instead,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">[the accused] is confined to proof of the opinion that the people of the community have about him. His specific acts, customs, conduct, etc., create this opinion. It is the sum total of all of these things \u2014 that is, the consensus of opinion of the people of the community in which [the accused] lives that is considered pertinent and proper evidence to prove character.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\"><em>Zirkle, </em>189 Va. at 871, 55 S.E.2d at 29. Essentially, \u201c[character] witnesses are not permitted to testify about anything except hearsay.... They are [only] permitted to summarize what they have heard in their community.\u201d <em>Weimer, </em>5 Va. App. at 54, 360 S.E.2d at 384. In accordance with these principles, this Court has recognized that \u201c[i]n legal parlance, where reference is made to the <em>character </em>of the accused, character is used as a synonym for <em>reputation.\u201d Byrdsong v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 400, 402, 345 S.E.2d 528, 529 (1986) (citing <em>Zirkle, </em>189 Va. at 871, 55 S.E.2d at 29).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">With these principles in mind, we consider the \u201ccharacter evidence\u201d proffered by appellant and ultimately excluded by the trial court during appellant\u2019s trial for uttering a forged writing and obtaining money by false pretenses. Appellant testified on his own behalf, and the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney questioned appellant\u2019s credibility during the cross-examination of appellant. Thereafter, appellant offered the testimony of five character witnesses for the purpose of showing appellant\u2019s character for truthfulness and veracity. Additionally, appellant offered the testimony of one of his five witnesses for the dual purpose of showing appellant\u2019s character for abiding the law as well as his character for truthfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">I. Excluded Character Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"A8\">A. Michelle Shank</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Appellant first proffered the testimony of Michelle Shank (Shank), appellant\u2019s former probation officer, as evidence of appellant\u2019s reputation for truthfulness and veracity. Shank testified that she supervised appellant until his case file for crimes unrelated to the instant case was closed in July 2008. She stated that appellant\u2019s probation supervision case file was closed because he \u201chad a successful adjustment to his supervision; he paid all his [c]ourt costs; he paid his restitution of approximately $3,000 in full; he didn\u2019t have any new law violations at that time; and he complied with all Office appointments and home contacts.\u201d The trial court excluded Shank\u2019s testimony because in its view the evidence had no bearing on appellant\u2019s reputation in the community for truth and veracity and, therefore, it was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Based on Shank\u2019s proffered testimony, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion. Shank testified regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>ing appellant\u2019s <em>specific conduct, </em>rather than the \u201c <em>\u2018consensus of opinion of the people of the community\u2019 \u201d </em>of appellant, and thus, the trial court properly excluded her testimony. <em>See Chiles, </em>12 Va.App. at 700, 406 S.E.2d at 414 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Zirkle, </em>189 Va. at 871, 55 S.E.2d at 29); <em>see also Fields, </em>2 Va.App. at 306, 343 S.E.2d at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">B. Teresa Johnson</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Appellant next proffered the testimony of Teresa Johnson (Johnson), who had known appellant for approximately five years. The following exchange occurred during the proffer of Johnson\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">Q. Do you know [appellant] in the community in which he lives and works?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">Q. Do you know his reputation for truthfulness and veracity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-10\">A. Good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-11\">Q. What is that? How do you know that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-12\">A. Because he worked with my husband in the backyard doing cars, and they never had no problems or nothing, and they ... did everything perfect. I mean, they never had no arguments or nothing. Nothing went on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-13\">Q. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-14\">COURT: That\u2019s not the community. That\u2019s her husband. He may form a part of the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-15\">Q. Did you ever see anyone else \u2014 hear anyone else talk about [appellant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-16\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-17\">Q. Other than your husband?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-18\">A. Nobody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-19\">Considering the proffered testimony of Johnson, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding Johnson\u2019s testimony. By her own admission, Johnson had not heard anyone other than her husband talk about appellant, and her opinion of appellant was based entirely on her person<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>al experience with, and observations of, appellant. Like the proffered testimony of Shank, Johnson\u2019s testimony was inadmissible because she was not able to testify regarding \u201cthe consensus of opinion of the people of the community.\u201d <em>Zirkle, </em>189 Va. at 871, 55 S.E.2d at 29; <em>accord Chiles, </em>12 Va.App. at 700, 406 S.E.2d at 414; <em>Fields, 2 </em>Va.App. at 306, 343 S.E.2d at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">C. Frank Washington</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Third, appellant proffered the testimony of Frank Washington (Washington), a law enforcement officer who had known appellant for eight years. When asked if he knew what appellant\u2019s reputation for truthfulness and veracity was in the community, Washington responded, \u201cSo far as in my book, he\u2019s in an excellent position, for me.\u201d When questioned further regarding appellant\u2019s reputation, Washington stated, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him get in no trouble at all, around me.\u201d Washington ultimately admitted he had not heard anyone speak of appellant\u2019s reputation in the community. The trial court excluded Washington\u2019s testimony because it did not describe appellant\u2019s reputation in the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We cannot say the exclusion of this testimony was an abuse of discretion by the trial court. Washington merely described appellant\u2019s behavior around Washington and Washington\u2019s personal opinion of appellant, rather than appellant\u2019s reputation for truthfulness and veracity in the community. <em>Chiles, </em>12 Va.App. at 699-700, 406 S.E.2d at 414; <em>Weimer, </em>5 Va.App. at 54, 360 S.E.2d at 384; <em>see also Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 423, 440, 587 S.E.2d 532, 544 (2003) (holding that \u201ca witness must be aware of the party\u2019s reputation before he may testify as to the lack of any reputation for a particular characteristic\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">D. Kathy Robey</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Appellant also proffered the testimony of Kathy Robey (Mrs. Robey), who had lived in the same campground as appellant for approximately one year. Mrs. Robey stated that she knew appellant\u2019s reputation in the community because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u201c[w]e all talked very highly of [appellant]. He helped everyone in that campground.\u201d When asked if she knew his reputation for truthfulness and veracity specifically, Mrs. Robey stated, \u201cHe had a very good reputation, especially with me.\u201d She then testified that she never talked to anybody else in the campground about appellant\u2019s reputation for truthfulness, and stated, \u201cI can\u2019t even recall having a conversation about anything like that.\u201d The trial court excluded Mrs. Robey\u2019s testimony because it did not relate to appellant\u2019s reputation for truthfulness and veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">While Mrs. Robey testified that appellant had \u201ca very good reputation\u201d and helped his neighbors, this testimony is not relevant to the description of appellant\u2019s reputation for truthfulness and veracity in the community. While showing an- accused\u2019s reputation for truthfulness and veracity is generally recognized as acceptable character evidence, <em>see Weimer, </em>5 Va.App. at 53, 360 S.E.2d at 383; <em>Bradley v. Commonwealth, </em>196 Va. 1126, 1133, 86 S.E.2d 828, 832 (1955), an accused\u2019s reputation for being \u201chelpful\u201d standing alone is simply not relevant evidence for the fact finder\u2019s consideration of appellant\u2019s reputation in the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Given Mrs. Robey\u2019s admission that she never talked to any of the campground\u2019s residents about appellant\u2019s reputation for truthfulness and veracity, we cannot say the trial court erred when it excluded Mrs. Robey\u2019s testimony. The trial court was entitled to infer that Mrs. Robey\u2019s testimony regarding appellant was based on her own personal opinion, rather than her knowledge of the community\u2019s opinion of appellant. As such, Mrs. Robey\u2019s testimony was not admissible. <em>See Chiles, </em>12 Va.App. at 699-700, 406 S.E.2d at 414 (character witnesses are not permitted to \u201ctestify to their own personal opinion of the accused\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">E. Frank Robey</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Finally, appellant proffered the testimony of Frank Robey (Mr. Robey), Mrs. Robey\u2019s husband, who lived with his wife in the same campground as appellant for approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>one year. The following exchange occurred during the proffer of Mr. Robey\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">Q. ... [D]id you see [appellant] interact in the campground?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">Q. And ... With other individuals in the campground?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">Q. All right. And did any of those people discuss his reputation with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\">Q. Did you discuss with any of your neighbors [appellant\u2019s] reputation within the community?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-13\">Q. All right. And what was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-14\">A. That [appellant\u2019s] a good guy. He ...

Did you ever speak, when you were speaking to any of the neighbors in the campground, about [appellant] besides being helpful? Did you ever talk to them about whether he was truthful and honest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-17\">A. Yeah. Yeah; he was ... He\u2019s truthful and honest, and, you know, in talking to other \u2014 we ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-18\">COURT: Did they tell you that ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-19\">A.

Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-22\">COURT: And you talked about his reputation for truthfulness and honesty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>A.

People would tell you that [appellant] was a good guy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-12\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">Appellant argued that Mr. Robey considered being a \u201cgood guy\u201d to be synonymous with being \u201csomeone who is law-abiding, ... truthful and honest and helpful.\u201d The trial court disagreed and excluded Mr. Robey\u2019s testimony because it was not relevant to whether appellant had a \u201creputation in the community for truthfulness and honesty, or for law-abidingness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">On appeal, appellant argues that excluding Mr. Robey\u2019s testimony is tantamount to allowing the case to be controlled by \u201csemantical subtleties\u201d under <em>Barlow v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 338, 341, 297 S.E.2d 645, 646 (1982). In <em>Barlow, </em>the Supreme Court held the trial court erred in excluding testimony that Barlow had \u201cno reputation for violent behavior in the community,\u201d on the grounds that such a reputation was \u201cnot the equivalent of having a reputation for being a peaceable, lawabiding [sic] citizen.\u201d 224 Va. at 339-42, 297 S.E.2d at 646-47. The Supreme Court found that the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>determination was improperly \u201ccontrolled by ... semantical subtleties. If the attorney had phrased the question differently and inquired as to [Barlow\u2019s] general reputation for violence or nonviolence, the import of the response would have been the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341, 297 S.E.2d at 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">We recognize that witnesses need not utilize precise legal language when giving character evidence, <em>id.; Byrdsong, 2 </em>Va.App. at 406, 345 S.E.2d at 531 (\u201c[T]he lay witness cannot be expected to respond with the precision of a skilled surgeon.\u201d); however, we cannot say that having a reputation for being a \u201cgood guy\u201d is necessarily the equivalent of having a reputation for truthfulness and veracity or for abiding the law, the character traits Mr. Robey\u2019s testimony was proffered to show. Mr. Robey specifically testified that he interpreted his neighbors\u2019 comments that appellant was a \u201cgood guy\u201d to mean his neighbors believed appellant was truthful and honest. However, Mr. Robey admitted that no one told him appellant was truthful and honest. Because Mr. Robey\u2019s neighbors never discussed appellant\u2019s reputation for truthfulness and honesty or for abiding the law, Mr. Robey\u2019s interpretation constitutes an impermissible personal opinion. <em>See Zirkle, </em>189 Va. at 871, 55 S.E.2d at 29; <em>Chiles, </em>12 Va.App. at 700, 406 S.E.2d at 414; <em>Fields, 2 </em>Va.App. at 306, 343 S.E.2d at 382. As such, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in excluding Mr. Robey\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">II. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">We conclude that the trial court committed no reversible error in excluding the testimony of appellant\u2019s proffered character witnesses.
