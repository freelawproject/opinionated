INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">The construction fraud statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-200.1, requires a person to receive an advance \u201cupon a promise to perform construction.\u201d Appealing his convictions under this statute, David Lee Testerman argues the evidence failed to prove he promised to perform construction since the advances he received paid only for supplies, not labor. He maintains he only promised to obtain supplies. We hold a person receiving an advance for supplies obtains an advance under this statute where the advance comes as a result of, or because of, a promise to perform construction. As Testerman\u2019s conduct meets this standard, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">Beginning in the summer of 2002, the Kinney family hired Testerman to perform construction work. As part of bathroom renovations in their home, the Kinneys decided to install new countertops. Testerman received an advance of $1,300 to purchase the countertops. However, the countertops never arrived and Testerman did not return the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">The Kinneys also employed Testerman to work on a townhouse they owned in Ocean City, Maryland. Testerman received an advance of $1,800 to buy new patio doors. The doors did not come, and Testerman did not return this money.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>In the case of both the countertops and the doors, the Kinneys intended the advances to pay only for supply costs, not labor. The Kinneys compensated Testerman for his labor at an hourly rate and paid him as he performed the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Testerman was to install the countertops and doors. At trial, Mrs. Kinney was questioned: \u201cAnd he was to install the countertops himself?\u201d She responded: \u2018Yes.\u201d A letter demanding repayment admitted without objection at trial declared concerning the countertops: \u201cYou stated you would work at my house the weekend of November 9 and 10, and that you would \u2018take care of everything.\u2019 You stated that you would positively complete the job this week the week before Thanksgiving.\u201d Mr. Kinney was asked at trial about the patio doors: \u201cSo he was to install them as well?\u201d He replied: \u201cYeah. I would have him install them, sure, or I would help with it.\u201d The demand letter also wrote: \u201cI paid you $1800.00, on October 2, 2002, for French doors that you were to help install in a townhouse I own in Ocean City, Md. We planned several weekends to work, but the doors never arrived.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">A jury convicted Testerman of construction fraud based on these failures. He now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Testerman argues he did not obtain the advances \u201cupon a promise to perform construction\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-200.1. He argues that since the advances paid only for supplies, not labor, he did not promise to perform construction, but rather promised to purchase supplies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold Testerman\u2019s actions fall within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">On appeal, we view \u201cthe evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party in the circuit court, and we accord the Commonwealth the benefit of all reasonable inferences deducible from the evidence.\u201d <em>Britt v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 569, 573, 667 S.E.2d 763, 765 (2008). We ask only if \u201c \u2018after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maxwell v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 437, 442, 657 S.E.2d 499, 502 (2008) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). We \u201cwill affirm the judgment unless the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 144, 148, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">On the other hand, statutory interpretation involves <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 77, 80-81, 655 S.E.2d 7, 9 (2008). Statutory interpretation aims primarily to determine legislative intent. <em>Commonwealth v. Zamani, </em>256 Va. 391, 395, 507 S.E.2d 608, 609 (1998). \u201cIn determining that intent, words are to be given their ordinary meaning, unless it is apparent that the legislative intent is otherwise.\u201d <em>Phelps v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 139, 142, 654 S.E.2d 926, 927 (2008). We strictly construe penal statutes against the Commonwealth, <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 121, 124, 661 S.E.2d 412, 414 (2008), but \u201cwill not apply \u2018an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute\u2019 that would subvert the legislative intent expressed therein,\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 581, 562 S.E.2d 139, 144 (2002) (quoting <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 761, 250 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">B. <em>Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-200.1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">If any person obtain from another an advance of money ... with fraudulent intent, upon a promise to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>construction, removal, repair or improvement of any building or structure permanently annexed to real property, or any other improvements to such real property ... and fail or refuse to perform such promise, and also fail to substantially make good such advance, he shall be deemed guilty of the larceny of such money ... if he fails to return such advance within fifteen days of a request to do so sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to his last known address or to the address listed in the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The statute requires an advance be paid \u201cupon a promise to perform construction.\u201d <em>Id.; see also McCary v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 119, 126, 590 S.E.2d 110, 114 (2003) (noting an element of the offense is \u201ca promise to perform construction or improvement involving real property\u201d). Obviously, advances given for materials alone, unaccompanied by any promise of labor, do not fall within the statute. Yet we believe the statute does encompass advances provided for materials to be purchased for construction work where the person receiving the advance has also promised to perform construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">First, it has importance that the statute places the word \u201cupon\u201d before \u201ca promise to perform construction\u201d to describe when the advance must occur. According to the dictionary, two possible definitions of \u201cupon\u201d include \u201ca beginning course of action or an action or condition that is a beginning\u201d and \u201cimmediately following on: very soon after.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged </em>2518 (2002). These definitions reveal the advance must come as a result of, or because of, a promise to perform construction. A person promises to perform construction work and receives an advance as a result. The advance may facilitate the work by providing funds to buy materials for use in the construction. It is not necessary that the advance pay directly for labor expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Second, advances for supplies represent a common part of construction work that the General Assembly undoubtedly had in mind when writing the statute. This Court has found \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>the underlying intent of the statute is to prohibit the fraudulent receipt of funds for construction work involving buildings or other structures permanently annexed to real property.\u201d <em>Boothe v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 484, 490, 358 S.E.2d 740, 744 (1987). If we were to hold that advances paid for materials within construction work did not fall within the statute, we would exclude many instances the General Assembly plainly intended to cover. While we have not directly addressed this issue before, the facts of our cases demonstrate the frequency of advances for this purpose. <em>See, e.g., Holsapple v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 522, 531, 574 S.E.2d 756, 760 (2003) <em>(en </em>banc) (stating an advance was given for roof trusses); <em>Mughrabi v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 538, 548, 567 S.E.2d 542, 547 (2002) (noting the defendant \u201cdemanded advances for supplies that were never purchased\u201d); <em>Klink v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 815, 818, 407 S.E.2d 5, 7 (1991) (stating the defendant ordered a door after receiving an advance); <em>Boothe, </em>4 VaApp. at 485, 358 S.E.2d at 741 (mentioning an advance given for a septic system).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Thus, in determining whether an advance triggers the construction fraud statute, the relevant inquiry is the scope of the promise. We consider whether a defendant received an advance as a result of construction he promised to perform.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">There is no dispute in this case that Testerman received advances to purchase materials. Thus, the remaining issue concerns whether he obtained the advances as a result of promises to perform construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">A promise is defined: \u201cThe manifestation of an intention to act or refrain from acting in a specified manner, conveyed in such a way that another is justified in understanding that a commitment has been made; a person\u2019s assurance that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>person will or will not do something.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1382 (9th ed.2009). \u201cIt is a word in free and common use.\u201d <em>Richmond Eng\u2019g &amp; Mfg. Corp. v. Loth, </em>135 Va. 110, 151, 115 S.E. 774, 786 (1923) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the jury could conclude Testerman received the advances because of promises to perform construction. Concerning the countertops, Mrs. Kinney was asked: \u201cAnd he was to install the countertops himself?\u201d She responded: \u201cYes.\u201d A demand letter delivered to Testerman stated regarding the countertops: \u201cYou stated you would work at my house the weekend of November 9 and 10, and that you would \u2018take care of everything.\u2019 You stated that you would positively complete the job this week the week before Thanksgiving.\u201d Concerning the patio doors for the Ocean City project, Mr. Kinney was asked: \u201cSo he was to install them as well?\u201d He replied: \u201cYeah. I would have him install them, sure, or I would help with it.\u201d The demand letter also recorded: \u201cI paid you ... for French doors that you were to help install in a townhouse I own in Ocean City, Md. We planned several weekends to work, but the doors never arrived.\u201d This evidence permitted the jury to find Testerman received the advances because of construction he promised to perform. Although the advances directly paid for materials, not labor, it sufficed that Testerman obtained them as a result of promises to perform construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-9\">. In arguing a motion to strike at trial, counsel stated: \"I also have a problem with this being a construction fraud charge because ... [Mr. Kinney] testified that that was for materials only.\u201d Counsel continued: \"Again, what we have here is some testimony that that check is not for labor but specifically for a countertop. Now, this might fall under [a false pretenses charge], Your Honor, but definitely not a construction fraud charge.\u201d In renewing the motion at the end of the case, counsel argued: \"In the case that Mr. Testerman\u2019s facing here the door is in question and the countertops. Those payments were paid in advance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>exclusively so that Mr. Testerman could get a discount and that those goods be delivered, goods being the operative word, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\">. This test makes clear, for example, that an advance for a supply of bricks would fall within the statute if the person receiving the advance had also promised to install the bricks, even if the advance did not pay for labor. On the other hand, if the person receiving the advance promised to do nothing but supply bricks, the advance would not trigger the statute. Otherwise, any supply contract could constitute construction fraud.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
