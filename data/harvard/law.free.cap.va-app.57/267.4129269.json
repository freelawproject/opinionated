On appeal, Thomas argues the court should have suppressed the evidence of his crimes because the arresting officers allegedly used the traffic stop as a pretext for conducting a drug investigation. Disagreeing with the legal assumptions underlying Thomas\u2019s assertion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">When reviewing a denial of a suppression motion, we review the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Glenn v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 413, 416, 642 S.E.2d 282, 283 (2007) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>275 Va. 123, 654 S.E.2d 910 (2008). This standard requires us to \u201cgive due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Malbrough v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 163, 169, 655 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2008) (citation omitted). In doing so, we \u201cconsider facts presented both at the suppression hearing and at trial.\u201d <em>Testa v. Commonwealth, </em>55 Va.App. 275, 279, 685 S.E.2d 213, 215 (2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">At about 11:30 p.m. one evening in September 2008, a Virginia State Trooper and a Lynchburg police officer on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>patrol together in a marked vehicle made a traffic stop of a Chevrolet Impala. The officers had just observed the Impala, while proceeding under a railroad trestle, cross over a double yellow line with both left wheels into the oncoming traffic lane. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-804(6) (prohibiting crossing \u201cdouble traffic lines\u201d except when turning).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thomas was seated in the front passenger seat of the Impala. After obtaining identification and vehicle registration information from the driver and Thomas, the officer returned to the patrol vehicle to request radio confirmation of their identities and the registration status of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">While waiting for the results of the radio check, backup officers arrived and asked the driver if he had drugs in the vehicle. The driver said no and then refused a request for a consensual vehicle search. The trooper brought his \u201cnarcotics detecting canine\u201d out from the patrol vehicle and advised the driver he intended to walk the dog around the Impala. The trooper directed the driver and Thomas to exit the car. As Thomas got out, one of the officers asked if he would consent to a pat down for weapons. Thomas stepped away, asking the officer why he thought that was necessary. When Thomas turned around, the officer saw the butt of a handgun partially sticking out from underneath Thomas\u2019s shirt. The officer yelled \u201cgun\u201d and then immediately seized a fully loaded .45 caliber handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Moments after the seizure of the handgun, police dispatch responded to the officers\u2019 initial request for information on the driver and Thomas. Dispatch advised that Thomas was wanted on an outstanding capias warrant issued by a juvenile and domestic relations district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dispatch provided this in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>formation to the officers within five to seven minutes after the initiation of the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The officer arrested Thomas on the outstanding warrant and for carrying a concealed weapon. Prior to searching Thomas incident to this arrest, the officer asked him if there was \u201canything else on his person\u201d the officer needed to know about. Thomas said he possessed marijuana. The officer then searched Thomas and found on him both marijuana and imitation crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Prior to trial, Thomas filed a motion to suppress both his statement that he possessed marijuana and the contraband found on his person. He argued that the \u201cquestions about drugs and so forth\u201d constituted \u201can additional seizure above and beyond the traffic stop itself that was not based on any reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and that because of that everything should be suppressed, because they abandoned the purpose of the traffic stop.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The prosecutor argued that under any objective standard the officers had authority to stop the vehicle for a traffic infraction. And before the stop had come to closure, the officers also had the authority to inquire into matters unrelated to the stop. \u201cOn top of all of that,\u201d the prosecutor added, \u201cthis defendant did have an outstanding capias. He was going to be arrested on that capias regardless of whether or not [the officer] ever saw the gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The trial court denied the motion to suppress. In its ruling from the bench, the court explained that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZD\">primary question is whether there was a pretext for a stop and that has to be judged by objective reasonable standards .... I would grant the motion if they didn\u2019t have a\u2014 a reason to stop the car but they have \u2014 on the objective standards they have a reason. They crossed the double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>yellow line. That violates the law. And I don\u2019t think there was another seizure within a seizure. I think we\u2019re still waiting on the traffic stop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">After this ruling, the trial court proceeded to hear additional evidence and found Thomas guilty of carrying a firearm as a convicted felon, unlawfully carrying a concealed weapon, and possessing marijuana, a second or subsequent offense. Thomas appeals, challenging only the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">On appeal, Thomas contends \u201cthe officers here wanted to investigate for drugs. They found a legal pretext to stop the car, and after accomplishing that, immediately and utterly abandoned the pretext in favor of their narcotics investigation.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 11. This argument, however, relies upon the false premise that the officers\u2019 subjective motivations can render unlawful an otherwise objectively reasonable exercise of police authority.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">For purposes of assessing the legality of an officer\u2019s actions, his \u201csubjective motivation is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 26, 37, 639 S.E.2d 217, 223 (2007) (quoting <em>Brigham City v. Stuart, </em>547 U.S. 398, 404, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 1948, 164 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006)). A police officer\u2019s \u201caction is \u2018reasonable\u2019 under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of the individual officer\u2019s state of mind, \u2018as long as the circumstances, viewed <em>objectively, </em>justify [the] action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stuart, </em>547 U.S. at 404, 126 S.Ct. at 1948 (emphasis in original and citations omitted). <em>Cf. Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 665, 673, 691 S.E.2d 801, 805 (2010) (holding an \u201cofficer\u2019s subjective characterization of observed conduct is not relevant\u201d to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>objective application of the Fourth Amendment (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Thus, faced with a suppression motion, a court should not limit itself \u201cto what the stopping officer says or to evidence of his subjective rationale,\u201d <em>Raab v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 577, 588 n. 2, 652 S.E.2d 144, 148 n. 2 (2007) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation omitted), but instead should make \u201c \u2018an objective assessment of the officer\u2019s actions in light of the facts and circumstances confronting [them] at the time,\u2019 and not on the officer\u2019s actual state of mind at the time the challenged action was taken,\u201d <em>Maryland v. Macon, </em>472 U.S. 463, 470-71, 105 S.Ct. 2778, 2783, 86 L.Ed.2d 370 (1985) (quoting <em>Scott v. United, States, </em>436 U.S. 128, 136, 98 S.Ct. 1717, 1723, 56 L.Ed.2d 168 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Thomas\u2019s invocation of the \u201cpretext\u201d talisman presupposes a subjective standard. \u201cUse of the word \u2018pretext\u2019 in such an evaluation does not resolve the question of fourth amendment compliance.\u201d <em>Bosworth v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va. App. 567, 570, 375 S.E.2d 756, 758 (1989). When \u201c \u2018pretext\u2019 is used to describe a police officer\u2019s reliance on an insufficient basis for stopping an automobile where a sufficient basis also exists, the word only identifies the officer\u2019s subjective intent which does not affect the constitutionality of the stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570-71, 375 S.E.2d at 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Stated another way, we do not consider allegations of the \u201cofficer\u2019s real motive\u201d for his actions if they otherwise satisfy the objective reasonableness standard adopted by the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 571, 375 S.E.2d at 758. An officer\u2019s \u201culterior motive,\u201d whatever it might be, does not nullify an objectively valid \u201clegal justification\u201d for his actions. <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 1774, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). Nor does it matter that the challenged detention involves a \u201cfine-only traffic violation\u201d rather than a more serious offense. <em>Arkansas v. Sullivan, </em>532 U.S. 769, 772, 121 S.Ct. 1876, 1878-79, 149 L.Ed.2d 994 (2001) <em>(per curiam). </em>Under settled precedent, \u201ca traffic-violation arrest ... [will] not be rendered invalid by the fact that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u2018a mere pretext for a narcotics search.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">An objective standard governs temporary investigatory detentions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> detentions for the purposes of issuing traffic citations,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> detentions for purposes of serving an arrest summons under Code \u00a7 19.2-74,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> full custodial arrests based upon probable cause,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as well as the scope and duration of each. Applied to the roadside stops, the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abd\">temporary seizure of driver and passengers ordinarily continues, and remains reasonable, for the duration of the stop. Normally, the stop ends when the police have no further need to control the scene, and inform the driver and passen- \u2022 gers they are free to leave. An officer\u2019s inquiries into matters unrelated to the justification for the traffic stop, this Court has made plain, do not convert the encounter into something other than a lawful seizure, so long as those inquiries do not measurably extend the duration of the stop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_i\"><em>Arizona v. Johnson, </em>555 U.S. 323, 129 S.Ct. 781, 788, 172 L.Ed.2d 694 (2009) (internal citations omitted); <em>see also Atkins v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 2, 15, 698 S.E.2d 249, 255-56 (2010) (quoting <em>Johnson, </em>555 U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 788); <em>Ellis v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 220, 227, 662 S.E.2d 640, 643 (2008) (\u201c[W]here a seizure of a person is based on probable cause to believe that a traffic violation was committed, an officer does not violate the Fourth Amendment by asking a few questions about matters unrelated to the traffic violation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>even if this conversation briefly extends the length of the detention.... \u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The objective circumstances of this case proved the officers still had a \u201cfurther need to control the scene\u201d and had not yet informed \u201cthe driver and passengers they [were] free to leave.\u201d <em>See Johnson, </em>555 U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 788. At the time the officer observed the butt of the handgun protruding from Thomas\u2019s clothes, police dispatch had not yet responded to the officer\u2019s request for an information check on the detainees\u2019 identifications and vehicle registration. The officers\u2019 questions about drugs and request for a consent search did not \u201cmeasurably extend the duration of the stop.\u201d <em>See id.; see also Atkins, </em>57 Va.App. at 17, 698 S.E.2d at 256 (holding it was \u201cnot unreasonable for the officers to continue to detain [a passenger] for a \u2018reasonable period of time\u2019 awaiting the results of the warrant check\u201d on another passenger). To be sure, the officers\u2019 questions did not extend the duration of the stop at all, given that all of their inquiries took place while they were still waiting for the dispatch report.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The same can be said for the use of the drug-sniffing dog. When a \u201ctraffic stop is \u2018lawful at its inception and otherwise executed in a reasonable manner,\u2019 a dog sniff conducted during the stop does not infringe on a constitutionally protected privacy interest.\u201d <em>Ellis, </em>52 Va.App. at 224, 662 S.E.2d at 642 (quoting <em>Illinois v. Caballes, </em>543 U.S. 405, 408, 125 S.Ct. 834, 837, 160 L.Ed.2d 842 (2005)); <em>see also Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 263, 270-71, 663 S.E.2d 108, 112-13 (2008). The officers\u2019 use of the drug-sniffing dog did not extend, much less measurably extend, the duration of this traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">In short, we find it legally irrelevant \u2014 even if factually true \u2014 that the \u201cofficers here wanted to investigate for drugs\u201d as Thomas alleges. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 11. Whatever their subjective motives, the <em>objective </em>facts authorized the officers to stop the Impala and issue a summons to its driver for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>crossing a double line. Given that authority, the officers likewise had the power</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u2022 to obtain the registration for the vehicle and request the identities of its occupants,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u2022 to seek radio dispatch confirmation of the information obtained from the vehicle occupants,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u2022 to detain Thomas, a passenger, during the duration of the stop,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u2022 to ask questions unrelated to the traffic violation,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\u2022 to order the driver and Thomas out of the vehicle,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>\u2022 to walk a drug-sniffing dog around the vehicle,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u2022 to seize Thomas\u2019s handgun the moment they saw it,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">because all these actions took place before the traffic stop had ended. The officers still had \u201cfurther need to control the scene\u201d and had not yet informed \u201cthe driver and passengers they [were] free to leave.\u201d <em>See Johnson, </em>129 S.Ct. at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Because the trial court correctly denied Thomas\u2019s motion to suppress, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-7\">. The officers also observed objects dangling from the rearview mirror that appeared to be in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 (prohibiting the suspension of \"any object or objects\u201d in a way as to \"obstruct the driver\u2019s clear view of the highway through the windshield\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\">. <em>See Price v.
