He alleges the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>court erred in refusing to suppress the evidence against him, arguing it was the result of an unlawful pat down and ultimate search of his person. The Commonwealth argues the pat down was lawful, but concedes the evidence was unlawfully obtained in the ensuing search of Baker\u2019s pants pocket. The Commonwealth contends this Court should apply the inevitable discovery doctrine to the facts and affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">At around 12:45 a.m. on June 2, 2007, Officer Justin K. Mathews (\u201cMathews\u201d) of the Chesapeake Police Department was on a routine patrol in the \u201chigh crime, high narcotic\u201d area of Berkley Avenue and Windy Road in Chesapeake, when he observed Baker \u201coperating a bicycle in that area without a headlight.\u201d Mathews decided to detain Baker because \u201cthe city code requires that a bicycle being operated on city streets requires a headlight between sunset and sunrise.\u201d Mathews made contact with Baker and explained the reason for the stop. Mathews immediately noticed that Baker had \u201ca strong odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from his person\u201d and \u201cbloodshot, watery, glassy eyes.\u201d Mathews also noted that Baker was having \u201ca little trouble balancing,\u201d as he straddled his bike. Baker was \u201csway[ing] to and fro.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Mathews obtained Baker\u2019s ID, and asked if he could search Baker. At that point, Baker \u201cbecame nervous,\u201d and refused permission to search. Even so, Mathews told Baker to put his hands on his head for a pat down. As Mathews ran his hands over Baker\u2019s pockets on Baker\u2019s right side, he saw that a \u201cglass tube object\u201d with \u201csome type of residue in it\u201d was sticking out of \u201cthe small coin pocket above the large pocket\u201d of Baker\u2019s jeans. Suspecting that the glass tube object was a crack pipe, Mathews removed it from Baker\u2019s pocket. Mathews put the tube in his upper shirt pocket, and informed Baker that he was under arrest. At that point, Baker broke free from Mathews and attempted to flee. After a brief chase, Mathews captured Baker and took him into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Prior to his trial, Baker filed a motion to suppress the evidence. The trial court held a hearing on the motion on April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>17, 2008. At the hearing, Baker inquired as to Mathews\u2019s reason for the pat down. Mathews responded, \u201cwell, any time I stop for pedestrians or subjects on a bike ... before I sit back in my patrol car and they\u2019re standing, I will conduct a pat-down, unless it\u2019s a consensual encounter and they deny such,\u2019 for my safety, that they don\u2019t have anything that\u2019s going to hurt me.\u201d Mathews denied suspecting the glass tube was a weapon when he removed it from Baker\u2019s pocket, admitting instead that he \u201csuspected it to be a crack pipe at that point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Upon the conclusion of Mathews\u2019s testimony, Baker argued there was no \u201cprobable cause\u201d for the pat down in this case. Baker also argued the seizure of the pipe was not supported by probable cause because the unlawful nature of the pipe was not readily apparent to Mathews at the time he removed it from Baker\u2019s pocket. The Commonwealth disagreed, but argued alternatively that even if the search was unlawful, \u201cthe arrest was an inevitable discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The trial court found, based upon the totality of the circumstances, that Mathews\u2019s actions were reasonable. Considering the time of night, the nature of the neighborhood, and the fact that Baker \u201cwas not in full control of his faculties,\u201d the court concluded the pat down was lawful. The trial court also found that the crack pipe was in plain view when Mathews seized it. Ultimately, the court denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">On September 29, 2008,- the parties appeared in the trial court on Baker\u2019s motion to reconsider. Baker argued that the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 546, 659 S.E.2d 512 (2008), decided one day after the trial court\u2019s initial ruling on Baker\u2019s motion to suppress, compelled a different ruling on his motion. Upon the conclusion of the arguments, the trial court distinguished <em>McCain </em>from the facts of Baker\u2019s case, and, again, denied the motion to suppress. Thus, on November 13, 2008, Baker entered a conditional guilty plea expressly retaining his right to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling on his motion to suppress. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The trial court sentenced Baker to four years imprisonment and then suspended it in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Baker, thereafter, noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\n<em>Did the trial court err in denying Baker\u2019s motion to suppress?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Baker contends on appeal that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because (1) the evidence proved Mathews did not have the requisite reasonable suspicion for the pat down; and (2) the illegal nature of the pipe in Baker\u2019s pocket was not immediately apparent to Mathews when he seized it. The Commonwealth concedes the seizure of the pipe was unlawful, but asserts that the tainted evidence is admissible under the doctrine of inevitable discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u201cwe determine whether the accused has met his burden to show that the trial court\u2019s ruling, when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was reversible error.\u201d <em>Roberts v. Commonwealth, </em>55 Va.App. 146, 150, 684 S.E.2d 824, 826 (2009) (citing <em>Murphy v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 568, 573, 570 S.E.2d 836, 838 (2002)). \u201c[W]e are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) (en banc). \u201cHowever, we consider <em>de novo </em>whether those facts implicate the Fourth Amendment and, if so, whether the officers unlawfully infringed upon an area protected by the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va. App. 447, 454, 524 S.E.2d 155, 159 (2000) (en banc) (citing <em>McGee, 25 </em>Va.App. at 198, 487 S.E.2d at 261).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\n<em>The Pat Down</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">Baker first contends on appeal that the pat-down search of his person violated the Fourth Amendment because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Mathews did not have a reasonable, articulable suspicion that Baker was armed and presently dangerous. The Commonwealth disagrees with that contention, arguing the trial court \u201ccorrectly concluded that Mathews had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that Baker may have been armed and dangerous, and, therefore, could perform a pat-down search for weapons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AnQ\">The United States Supreme Court has articulated \u201ca narrowly drawn authority to permit a reasonable [pat-down] search for weapons for the protection of the police officer ... where [the] police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that ... the persons with whom he is dealing may be armed and presently dangerous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><em>Roberts, </em>55 Va.App. at 153, 684 S.E.2d at 827 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 27, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1883-84, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). An officer may not automatically conduct a search for weapons during the course of a <em>Terry </em>stop. <em>McCain, </em>275 Va. at 554, 659 S.E.2d at 517. He may frisk for weapons only if he develops reasonable suspicion during the stop \u201cto believe that the particular person to be frisked is armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such \u201creasonable, individualized suspicion\u201d is required \u201c[e]ven in high crime areas,\u201d where \u201cany given individual\u201d may be armed, <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Maryland v. Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, 334 n. 2, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 1098, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990)), in large part because \u201c[t]he purpose of [a] \u2018pat-down\u2019 search is not to uncover evidence of criminal activity, but to permit the officer to conduct his investigation without encountering a violent response.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>264 Va. at 573-74, 570 S.E.2d at 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In other words, \u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Terry </em>does not permit a generalized policy that authorizes a police officer to frisk all persons.\u201d <em>McCain, 275 </em>Va. at 555, 659 S.E.2d at 517. \u201c[A]n officer may lawfully pat-down a suspect only when the officer can \u2018point to particular facts from which he reasonably inferred that the individual was armed and dangerous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 404, 406, 404 S.E.2d 77, 78 (1991) (quoting <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 64, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 1903, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>(1968)). \u201cCircumstances relevant in this analysis include characteristics of the area surrounding the stop, the time of the stop, the specific conduct of the suspect individual, the character of the offense under suspicion, and the unique perspective of a police officer trained and experienced in the detection of crime.\u201d <em>McCain, </em>275 Va. at 554, 659 S.E.2d at 517. While \u201cnervous, evasive behavior is [also] a pertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion,\u201d <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 124, 120 S.Ct. 673, 676, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000), mere nervousness during the course of a <em>Terry </em>stop, \u201cstanding alone, is insufficient to justify a frisk for weapons.\u201d <em>McCain, </em>275 Va. at 554, 659 S.E.2d at 517; <em>see also Moore, </em>12 Va.App. at 406-07, 404 S.E.2d at 78. That is, \u201c \u2018[a]n officer\u2019s perception of a suspect\u2019s nervousness [and verbal agitation], without additional articulable facts reasonably suggesting the suspect is armed and presently dangerous, cannot justify a pat-down search.\u2019\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>55 Va.App. at 154, 684 S.E.2d at 828 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Thompson v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 1, 8, 675 S.E.2d 832, 835 (2009)). Indeed, \u201c \u2018[i]f subjective good faith alone were the test, the protections of the Fourth Amendment would evaporate, and the people would be \u201csecure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,\u201d only in the discretion of the police.\u2019 \u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 22, 88 S.Ct. at 1880 (quoting <em>Beck v. Ohio, </em>379 U.S. 89, 97, 85 S.Ct. 223, 229,13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">In <em>McCain, </em>our Supreme Court reviewed the circumstances under which a police officer conducted a pat-down search for weapons on a passenger of a vehicle that was stopped for a traffic violation. 275 Va. at 549, 659 S.E.2d at 514. The officer in that case had observed both the driver and the passenger approach a known drug house for only a minute before returning to their car and driving away. The officer then followed the vehicle and stopped it for a driving violation. During the stop, another officer arrived in response to a request for backup and asked the passenger, Tyrone McCain, to step out of the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 550, 659 S.E.2d at 514-15. When the second officer requested permission to frisk McCain, McCain, who \u201cup to that point ... had complied with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>every request made by the officers,\u201d declined permission for the search. The second officer, nevertheless, \u201cordered McCain to place his hands on the vehicle and performed a pat-down search on him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550-51, 659 S.E.2d at 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The second officer later testified that McCain seemed nervous as he began to pat him down and that the first officer had told him McCain seemed \u201cedgy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 551, 659 S.E.2d at 515. The second officer initially only found keys in McCain\u2019s pocket, but \u201clater during the pat-down search, [the second officer] asked McCain if he had any weapons on his person, and McCain said that he had a gun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The second officer removed the gun from McCain\u2019s waistband and placed McCain under arrest. During a search incident to that arrest, the first officer discovered cocaine in McCain\u2019s pocket. <em>Id. </em>The neighborhood where the traffic stop occurred was \u201cknown for drugs, known for shots fired,\u201d and both officers regularly patrolled the area. The second officer later explained that \u201c \u2018for officer safety,\u2019 he conducts a pat-down search of every person he interacts with in that neighborhood, whether they want him to or not.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">McCain filed a motion to suppress in the trial court. After a hearing, the trial court found that McCain \u201cwas seized for purposes of the pat-down search, but that his detention for that purpose was constitutional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court, thereafter, affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress, and McCain appealed the matter to the Virginia Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>at 549-50, 659 S.E.2d at 514. The Supreme Court reversed, finding \u201cMcCain\u2019s actions gave the officers no legitimate reasonable suspicion that he was armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554, 659 S.E.2d at 517. The Court opined,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">\u201c[although the character of the location and the time are relevant factors, they did not provide either officer a particularized and objective basis for suspecting McCain was armed and dangerous[,] ... the officers did not notice any physical or mental impairment that would indicate drug use by McCain, and there were no physical or other characteristics observed by the officers that indicated McCain might be armed and dangerous. Although he may have appeared to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>be nervous, McCain identified himself when requested, did not make any furtive movements, and cooperated with the police officers until Thompson asked permission to do a pat-down search.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 554-55, 659 S.E.2d at 517. On these facts, the Supreme Court concluded, \u201c[t]he totality of the circumstances, namely, the time of day, the location in a \u2018high crime\u2019 area,\u201d and McCain\u2019s presence at a known drug house \u201cdid not create reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify detaining and frisking McCain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court then concluded that, since \u201c[n]o additional circumstances developed during the course of the traffic stop that would support a reasonable suspicion that McCain was ... armed and dangerous,\u201d McCain\u2019s motion to suppress should have been granted. <em>Id. </em>at 555, 659 S.E.2d at 517-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">In the instant case, Mathews detained Baker merely for riding a bicycle without a light in what Mathews similarly described as a \u201chigh crime, high narcotic\u201d neighborhood at 12:45 a.m. Like McCain, Baker obediently complied with every request made by Officer Mathews up to the moment Mathews requested permission to pat him down. As in <em>McCain, </em>although Baker seemed nervous at the prospect of being patted down, the record contains no factual evidence from which any reasonable police officer could infer that Baker was either violent or that he was in possession of a weapon. Baker made no threats or other furtive gestures suggesting Mathews was in any danger. Rather, as in <em>McCain, </em>Mathews failed to articulate any facts and circumstances that, when viewed objectively, would lead any reasonable police officer to conclude that Baker was armed or dangerous. Instead, Mathews\u2019s decision to perform a pat down resulted from his own generalized policy of patting down \u201cevery pedestrian or subject on a bike\u201d before returning to his patrol car to check their identification. Indeed, as was the case in <em>McCain, </em>Mathews testified that he always conducts a pat down \u201cunless it\u2019s a consensual encounter.\u201d Thus, Mathews\u2019s decision to pat Baker down was clearly automatic and not based on any particularized and objective set of facts from which a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>officer could infer Baker was armed and dangerous. Therefore, as in <em>McCain, </em>the trial court erred in concluding that the pat down was constitutionally proper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\n<em>The Crack Pipe</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Baker also contends that the seizure of the pipe from his pocket was a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Commonwealth concedes Mathews \u201clacked probable cause to remove the pipe from the defendant\u2019s pocket,\u201d but argues that the evidence is admissible under the doctrine of inevitable discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u201c[T]he determination whether a law enforcement officer had sufficient probable cause to seize contraband from a person in the course of a <em>Terry </em>pat-down search requires a consideration of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the search, as well as a consideration of the officer\u2019s knowledge, training and experience.\u201d <em>Cost v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 246, 251, 657 S.E.2d 505, 507 (2008). An officer conducting a <em>Terry </em>frisk may seize an object from a suspect\u2019s pocket only if he \u201creasonably believes the object could be a weapon,\u201d <em>Lansdown v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 204, 213, 308 S.E.2d 106, 112 (1983), or if he \u201ccan identify the object as suspicious under the \u2018plain feel\u2019 variation of the plain view doctrine.\u201d <em>Cost, </em>275 Va. at 251-52, 657 S.E.2d at 508 (citing <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 375-76, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 2136-37, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993)). \u201cHowever, an item may not be retrieved [even] under the plain view doctrine unless it is \u2018immediately apparent\u2019 to the officer that the item is evidence of a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252, 657 S.E.2d at 508 (citations omitted). \u201c \u2018[W]hen the character of the item is not immediately apparent from the \u2018pat[-]down\u2019 search, and the officer does not reasonably suspect that the item is a weapon, further search regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>item is not allowed [by the Fourth Amendment] because such an evidentiary search is unrelated to the justification for the frisk\u2019 of the suspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations in original) (quoting <em>Murphy, </em>264 Va. at 574, 570 S.E.2d at 839).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In <em>Murphy, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court held that marijuana contained in a plastic bag in Murphy\u2019s pants pocket was illegally seized during a pat-down search \u201cbecause the character of the bag\u2019s contents as contraband was not immediately apparent from the frisk.\u201d 264 Va. at 575, 570 S.E.2d at 839. Thus, the officer in that case did not have probable cause to seize the bag and its contents without a warrant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In the instant case, Mathews testified he did not believe the glass tube was a weapon when he removed it from Baker\u2019s pocket, admitting instead that he \u201csuspected it to be a crack pipe at that point.\u201d Although the glass pipe was protruding from Baker\u2019s pocket with \u201csome type of residue in it,\u201d the nature and character of the glass tube and its contents was, as the Commonwealth concedes, not immediately apparent to Officer Mathews when he removed the pipe from Baker\u2019s person. Thus, as the Commonwealth correctly notes, \u201cMathews lacked probable cause to remove the pipe from [Baker\u2019s] pocket.\u201d Therefore, Mathews clearly violated the Fourth Amendment when he seized the pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\n<em>Inevitable Discovery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The Commonwealth, nevertheless, asserts this Court should affirm the trial court because the evidence would ultimately have been discovered during Baker\u2019s lawful arrest for public intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">\u201cOrdinarily, evidence obtained as the result of an unlawful search is subject to suppression under the exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Jones, </em>267 Va. 532, 535, 593 S.E.2d 204, 206 (2004) (citing <em>Weeks v. United States, </em>232 U.S. 383, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652 (1914); <em>Hart v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 283, 287, 269 S.E.2d 806, 809 (1980)). \u201cHowever, not all illegally obtained evidence is subject to suppression.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>487-88, 83 S.Ct. 407, 417-18, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963)). \u201cOne of the exceptions to the exclusionary rule is the doctrine of inevitable discovery,\u201d which provides, \u201cthat evidence obtained by unlawful means is nonetheless admissible \u2018if the prosecution can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the information ultimately or inevitably would have been discovered by lawful means.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535-36, 593 S.E.2d at 206 (quoting <em>Nix v. Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 444, 104 S.Ct. 2501, 2509, 81 L.Ed.2d 377 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">However, we need not decide whether it was inevitable that Baker would necessarily have been arrested for public intoxication and searched incident to that arrest despite the fact that this issue was not ruled upon by the trial court. This case involves a conditional guilty plea under Code \u00a7 19.2-254, which mandates that we remand the case to the trial court to permit the possible withdrawal of the guilty plea if an appellant prevails on appeal without regard to any inevitable discovery or harmless error analysis. In fact, the Virginia Supreme Court specifically rejected an application of the inevitable discovery doctrine in a similar case, <em>Hasan v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 674, 667 S.E.2d 568 (2008). In that case, Qaadir Hasan entered a conditional guilty plea after the trial court denied his motion to suppress, reserving his right to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling on his motion to suppress and to withdraw his plea if successful on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 678, 667 S.E.2d at 570. This Court later affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of Hasan\u2019s motion to suppress, and Hasan appealed his case to the Virginia Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>at 678, 667 S.E.2d at 570-71. After the Supreme Court found that this Court erred in affirming the denial of the motion to suppress, it addressed the Commonwealth\u2019s alternative argument that \u201ca reversal of Hasan\u2019s conviction would be improper because the evidence ... would have been admissible under the doctrine of inevitable discovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 681, 667 S.E.2d at 572. The Supreme Court disagreed with the Commonwealth, finding,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">Th[is] arguments, which [is] in the nature of a harmless error analysis, [is] inapplicable to this case. Even if the Commonwealth is correct about the inevitable discovery of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>the weapon ..., Hasan entered a conditional guilty plea pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-254, which provides in part that \u201c[i]f the defendant prevails on appeal, he shall be allowed to withdraw his plea.\u201d Hasan has prevailed on appeal regarding suppression of the statement at issue in this case. He is entitled by statute to withdraw his plea. Hasan must be given the opportunity to reassess the admissible evidence that may be used against him and, if the Commonwealth wishes to continue its prosecution, demand a trial if he so desires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting Code \u00a7 19.2-254).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">In the instant case, Baker, like Hasan, entered a conditional guilty plea pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-254. Baker, like Hasan, has also prevailed on appeal regarding suppression of the evidence at issue in this case. It follows that, like Hasan, Baker is entitled by statute to withdraw his plea. We, thus, reject the Commonwealth\u2019s suggestion that the inevitable discovery doctrine applies here and reverse the trial court\u2019s refusal to suppress the evidence. We further remand Baker\u2019s case to the trial court so Baker can decide whether to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Based on the foregoing, we hold that the pat down in this case was unlawful because Officer Mathews did not articulate any particularized reason to believe Baker was armed and presently dangerous. Further, the Commonwealth concedes the resulting search of Baker\u2019s pocket and seizure of the crack pipe was unsupported by probable cause, and we agree. However, the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that reversal is inappropriate under the doctrine of inevitable discovery is without merit in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hasan. </em>Thus, we reverse the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b241-8\">. Neither is it of any particular importance that Baker was intoxicated. While \"[t]his Court has recognized there is a relationship between drug distribution and the presence of weapons,\u201d <em>see, e.g., Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 437, 445, 452 S.E.2d 364, 369 (1994), Virginia appellate courts have not recognized a similar nexus between mere public intoxication and the possession of weapons.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
