On appeal, he contends: (1) the evidence was insufficient because the Commonwealth failed to prove he had no valid prescription to obtain the drug; (2) Code \u00a7 18.2-263, relied upon by the Commonwealth, is unconstitutionally vague because it fails to state a standard of proof for the accused to overcome the government\u2019s burden of proof; and (3) that Code \u00a7 18.2-263 violates his due process rights by shifting the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to appellant to prove his innocence. For the reasons stated, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Appellant was in possession of three pills, each containing Oxycodone and Acetaminophen. The preparation is a Schedule II prescription drug. The shape, color, and manufacturer\u2019s markings of the pills were consistent with a pharmaceutical prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">Appellant did not contest that he possessed the pills. He filed a pretrial motion to dismiss the charge, arguing that Code \u00a7 18.2-263 was unconstitutional.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>argued the existence of a valid prescription was an affirmative defense, rather than an element of the offense. The trial court found the statute constitutional and denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Other than the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-263, the Commonwealth produced no evidence that appellant did not possess a valid prescription. Appellant argues the absence of a valid prescription is an element of the offense and must be proved by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">On appeal, appellant challenges the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 18.2-263 on two grounds. First, appellant contends the statute is unconstitutionally vague because it fails to state a standard of proof required for him to prove he had a valid prescription. Second, he argues the statute violates the Due Process Clause of both the United States and Virginia Constitutions by shifting the burden to appellant to prove his innocence. Appellant, assuming the statute is unconstitutional, then challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, because without the benefit of Code \u00a7 18.2-263, the Commonwealth did not prove he had no valid prescription to possess the pills. As the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 18.2-263 is dispositive of the sufficiency argument, we will first address the constitutionality of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\n<em>Vagueness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Appellant notes that while Code \u00a7 18.2-263 allocates the burden of proof to the accused to prove he had a valid prescription, it does not indicate whether that burden is by preponderance of the evidence, or beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant concludes a person of ordinary intelligence would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>not know what standard of proof is required. Therefore, he posits, this ambiguity could encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The Commonwealth responds that because appellant never argued this issue to the trial court and because the trial court never ruled on the vagueness issue, we cannot review this argument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Because appellant did not obtain a ruling from the trial court on his pretrial motion, \u201cthere is no ruling for [this Court] to review\u201d on appeal, and his argument is waived under Rule 5A:18. <em>Fisher v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 447, 454, 481 S.E.2d 886, 890 (1993). The main purpose of requiring timely specific objections is to afford the trial court an opportunity to rule intelligently on the issues presented, thus avoiding unnecessary appeals and reversals.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Although Rule 5A:18 contains exceptions for good cause or to meet the ends of justice, appellant does not argue these exceptions and we will not invoke them <em>sua sponte. See Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 752, 761, 589 S.E.2d 444, 448 (2003) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Because there was no ruling on the vagueness argument, the argument is waived and we will not consider it on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">\n<em>Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Appellant also contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-263 impermissively shifts the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof to him, violating the Due Process Clause of the United States and Virginia Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>On appeal, we review arguments regarding the constitutionality of a statute <em>de novo. Shivaee v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 112, 119, 613 S.E.2d 570, 574 (2005) (citing <em>Willy v. Gostel, </em>265 Va. 437, 440, 578 S.E.2d 796, 798 (2003)). When the constitutionality of a statute is challenged, we are guided by the principle that \u201c \u2018all acts of the General Assembly are presumed to be constitutional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Va. Society for Human Life v. Caldwell, </em>256 Va. 151, 156-57, 500 S.E.2d 814, 816 (1998) (quoting <em>Hess v. Snyder Hunt Corp., </em>240 Va. 49, 52, 392 S.E.2d 817, 820 (1990)). \u201cTherefore, \u2018a statute will be construed in such a manner as to avoid a constitutional question wherever this is possible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Yamaha Motor Corp. v. Quillian, </em>264 Va. 656, 665, 571 S.E.2d 122, 127 (2002) (quoting <em>Eaton v. Davis, </em>176 Va. 330, 339, 10 S.E.2d 893, 897 (1940)).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u201cThis presumption is \u2018one of the strongest known to the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boyd v. County of Henrico, </em>42 Va.App. 495, 507, 592 S.E.2d 768, 774 (2004) <em>(en banc) </em>(quoting <em>Harrison v. Day, </em>200 Va. 764, 770, 107 S.E.2d 594, 598 (1959)). Under the presumption, \u201ccourts must \u2018resolve any reasonable doubt\u2019 regarding the constitutionality of a law in favor of its validity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201cTo doubt is to affirm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Peery v. Bd. of Funeral Dirs., </em>203 Va. 161, 165, 123 S.E.2d 94, 97 (1961)).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Due process requires the prosecution \u201cto prove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged.\u201d <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 685, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 1883, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975). <em>Mullaney </em>held that any rule which has the ultimate effect of shifting the burden of persuasion to the accused upon a critical issue is constitutionally infirm. <em>Id. </em>at 701, 95 S.Ct. at 1890-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">In order to resolve whether there is a due process violation in this case, we first must address the threshold issue of whether the absence of a valid prescription is an affirmative defense or a negative element of the offense. If it is the latter, the burden of proof is on the Commonwealth, and it cannot be shifted to the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>It is a familiar principle of law that ambiguous penal statutes must be strictly construed against the Commonwealth. <em>Stevenson v. City of Falls Church, </em>243 Va. 434, 436, 416 S.E.2d 435, 437 (1992). If we are required to apply statutory construction, we will construe a statute to promote the end for which it was enacted, if we may reasonably reach such an interpretation from the language used. <em>VEPCO v. Board of County Supervisors, </em>226 Va. 382, 387-88, 309 S.E.2d 308, 311 (1983). Therefore, a statute should be read to give reasonable effect to the words used \u201c \u2018and to promote the ability of the enactment to remedy the mischief at which it is directed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mayhew v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 484, 489, 458 S.E.2d 305, 307 (1995) (quoting <em>Jones v. Conwell, </em>227 Va. 176, 181, 314 S.E.2d 61, 64 (1984)). \u201c \u2018Where a particular construction of a statute will result in an absurdity, some other reasonable construction which will not produce the absurdity will be found.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Miller v. Commonwealth, </em>180 Va. 36, 41, 21 S.E.2d 721, 723 (1942)).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><em>Mayhew </em>also notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">When construing penal statutes which contain qualifications, exceptions or exemptions to their application, the limiting language may be viewed as a negative element of the offense which the prosecution must disprove. Alternately, the court may determine that the exemption is a statutory defense, which the accused can assert to defeat the <em>prima facie </em>case of the prosecution. <em>Regular Veterans [Association, Ladies Auxiliary v. Commonwealth </em>], 18 Va.App. [683,] 688, 446 S.E.2d [621,] 624 [ (1994) ] (... [The accused bears] the burden of producing evidence [of the negation of circumstances] sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt of [his] guilt).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">In determining whether specific limiting language is an element of the offense or a statutory defense, a court should look both to the intent of the statute as a whole and the ability of the respective parties to assert the existence or absence of the underlying facts sustaining the applicability of the limitation. Accordingly, we should consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the wording of the exception and its role in relation to the other words in the statute; whether in light of the situation prompting legislative action, the exception is essential to complete the general prohibition intended; whether the exception makes an excuse or justification for what would otherwise be criminal conduct, i.e., sets forth an affirmative defense; and whether the matter is peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\"><em>Commonwealth v. Stoffan </em>[228 Pa.Super. 127], 323 A.2d 318, 324 (Pa.Super.Ct.1974); <em>See also State v. Williamson </em>[58 Wis.2d 514], 206 N.W.2d 613, 618 (Wis.1973) (It is undoubtedly the general rule that the state must prove all the essential facts entering into the description of the offense. But it has been held in many cases that when a negation of a fact lies peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant it is incumbent on him to establish that fact).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 489-90, 458 S.E.2d at 307-08 (internal quotations and some citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The Supreme Court of Virginia, in <em>Stillwell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 214, 218-19, 247 S.E.2d 360, 363 (1978), reviewed the purpose of The Drug Control Act, i.e. the situation prompting legislative action, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">In its enactment of The Drag Control Act the General Assembly recognized that, except in very rare and most unusual cases, there can be no lawful possession, sale or distribution of drags by anyone, particularly of those drags classified in Schedules I, II and III.... With few exceptions, enumerated by statute, no one can lawfully manufacture, possess, sell or distribute such drags____ The possession of drags is confined to a small group of professionals who are required to dispense the drags under restricted and controlled conditions. By and large, it can be said that the lawful possession of drugs is restricted to licensed manufacturers, licensed pharmacists, and to individuals who have possession as a result of a prescription given by an authorized physician. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>The General Assembly recognized that seldom, if ever, except in these authorized instances, could there be any explanation for the sale or possession of drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Clearly, the legislature intended for Virginia\u2019s drug laws to rigorously limit possession of Schedule I, II, and III controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">We next observe that the \u201cvalid prescription\u201d exemption of Code \u00a7 18.2-250 relates to a fact that would be solely within the knowledge of the accused. If we accept appellant\u2019s contention that the Commonwealth must prove appellant had no valid prescription, the offense would be virtually unprovable. Under appellant\u2019s theory, to obtain a conviction under the facts of this case, the Commonwealth would be required to prove that no medical professional, wherever located, in this Commonwealth or elsewhere, had prescribed the drug to appellant. This would involve a nationwide search of chain drugstores, as well as independent pharmacies, hospitals, prison infirmaries, etc. Appellant, at oral argument, conceded that such an undertaking would most likely be impossible. The General Assembly clearly did not intend such a result, nor would they enact such an impotent statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">While we acknowledge the requirement that we strictly construe ambiguous penal statutes against the Commonwealth, <em>Welch v. Commonwealth, </em>271 Va. 558, 563, 628 S.E.2d 340, 342 (2006), we are also aware \u201cthat the plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always to be preferred to any curious, narrow, or strained construction,\u201d <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 456, 459, 309 S.E.2d 337, 338 (1983). Hence, \u201cwe will not apply \u2018an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute\u2019 that would subvert the legislative intent expressed therein.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 581, 562 S.E.2d 139, 144 (2002) (quoting <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 761, 250 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Under well-settled law, \u201c\u2018the burden is on the Commonwealth to prove every essential element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bishop v. Commonwealth, </em>275 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Va. 9, 12, 654 S.E.2d 906, 908 (2008) (quoting <em>Powers v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 386, 388, 177 S.E.2d 628, 629 (1970)). This fundamental precept has been the bedrock of Virginia\u2019s criminal jurisprudence since the inception of this Commonwealth. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn a criminal case, the defendant is entitled to an acquittal, unless his guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Savage v. Commonwealth, </em>84 Va. 582, 585, 5 S.E. 563, 564 (1888).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u201cAn affirmative defense,\u201d however, raises \u201ca separate issue which may carry a separate burden of proof.\u201d Ronald J. Bacigal, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 17.28 (2007-2008 ed.). It is well settled that a criminal defendant may be required to bear all or part of the burden in establishing an affirmative defense \u201conce the facts constituting a crime are established beyond a reasonable doubt....\u201d <em>New York v. Patterson [Patterson v. New York], </em>432 U.S. 197, 206 [97 S.Ct. 2319, 2325, 53 L.Ed.2d 281] (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In Virginia, a criminal defendant typically bears the burden of \u201cproducing evidence in support of [an affirmative defense] sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt of [his or her] guilt.\u201d <em>Regular Veterans Assoc., Ladies Auxiliary v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 683, 688, 446 S.E.2d 621, 624 (1994) (citing <em>McGhee v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 560, 562, 248 S.E.2d 808, 810 (1978)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As is the case with any defense, \u201ca defendant may shoulder this burden of production by pointing to evidence adduced during the government\u2019s case, by introducing evidence to his own behoof, by relying on some combination of the foregoing, or otherwise by reference to any probative material in the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>858 F.2d 809, 814 (1st Cir.1988). However, once the defendant meets that burden, the Commonwealth, retaining the ultimate burden of persuasion, may be required to disprove the defense. <em>See Simopoulos v. Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number><em>wealth, </em>221 Va. 1059, 1069, 277 S.E.2d 194, 200 (1981), <em>aff'd, </em>462 U.S. 506 [103 S.Ct. 2532, 76 L.Ed.2d 755] (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"><em>Tart v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 272, 276-77, 663 S.E.2d 113, 115 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Under the <em>Mayhew </em>criteria, we hold that requiring the Commonwealth to prove this negative would undermine the general prohibition intended by the legislature. The exception, i.e. a valid prescription, justifies what would otherwise be criminal conduct. The presence of a valid prescription is \u201cpeculiarly within the knowledge of the [appellant].\u201d <em>Mayhew, </em>20 Va.App. at 490, 458 S.E.2d at 308. Thus, we conclude the presence of a valid prescription is an affirmative defense for which the appellant has the burden of going forward with supporting evidence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\"><em>People v. Pegenau, </em>447 Mich. 278, 523 N.W.2d 325 (1994), while not binding on this Court, offers persuasive reasoning. In <em>Pegenau, </em>appellant was convicted of unlawful possession of Valium and Xanax. The statute at issue was very similar to our Code \u00a7 18.2-250, and read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">A person shall not knowingly or intentionally possess a controlled substance or an official prescription form or a prescription form unless the controlled substance, official prescription form, or prescription form was obtained directly from, or pursuant to, a valid prescription or order of a practitioner while acting in the course of the practitioner\u2019s professional practice....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 333-34 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">The Supreme Court of Michigan held that \u201cthe operative words defining the elements of the crime are \u2018A person shall not knowingly or intentionally possess a controlled substance .... \u2019 The language concerning a prescription or other authorization refers to an exemption rather than an element of the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334. The <em>Pegenau </em>court referred to another Michigan case, <em>People v. Henderson, </em>391 Mich. 612, 218 N.W.2d 2 (1974), where the Supreme Court of Michigan interpreted the concealed weapon statute. That statute prohibited carrying a concealed weapon in an automobile unless the carrier held a license to do so. The <em>Henderson </em>court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>upheld language in the statute that placed on the defendant the burden to prove any exemption to the statute. The court concluded that any language in the statute referring to the absence of a license did not add an element to the crime, but merely acknowledged that a person may be authorized (by holding a license) to carry a pistol. <em>See id. </em>at 8.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As in <em>Pegenau, </em>the operative words of Code \u00a7 18.2-250, defining the offense, are \u201cknowingly or intentionally possess a controlled substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Thus, the exception language in Code \u00a7 18.2-250 is not an element of the offense, but rather an affirmative defense. As a result, appellant was required to satisfy his burden of producing or pointing to evidence that would allow him to invoke the exception. <em>See Tart, </em>52 Va.App. at 280, 663 S.E.2d at 117. Due process does not prohibit the use of inferences as procedural devices to shift to the accused the burden of producing some evidence contesting the otherwise presumed or inferred fact. <em>See Hodge v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 338, 341, 228 S.E.2d 692, 695 (1976). The <em>Hodge </em>Court held the \u201cpresumption that an unlawful homicide is murder in the second degree amounts to no more than an inference\u201d which the trier of fact may draw from proven facts. <em>Id. </em>at 343, 228 S.E.2d at 696. However, the ultimate \u201cburden of proof is always upon the Commonwealth, and <em>this burden never shifts.\u201d Id. </em>at 342, 228 S.E.2d at 695. Code \u00a7 18.2-263 is constitutionally valid, as it does not impermissibly shift the burden of proof to appellant or violate his due process rights. The trial court correctly denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\n<em>Sufficiency</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Finally, appellant argues the evidence was insufficient to convict him of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-250, because without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>benefit of Code \u00a7 18.2-263, the Commonwealth failed to prove he did not have a valid prescription to possess the Schedule II controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">However, this argument rises or falls with the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 18.2-263. We have already determined that Code \u00a7 18.2-263 is valid. This conclusion disposes of appellant\u2019s sufficiency argument. Appellant was properly convicted under Code \u00a7 18.2-250.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">We find that Code \u00a7 18.2-263 is constitutional and does not impermissibly shift the burden of proof to appellant. The trial judge properly denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss and convicted appellant, and we affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-11\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-250(A) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-12\">It is unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to possess a controlled substance unless the substance was obtained directly from, or pursuant to, a valid prescription or order of a practitioner while acting in the course of his professional practice, or except as otherwise authorized by the Drug Control Act (\u00a7 54.1-3400 et seq.). Code \u00a7 18.2-263 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>In any complaint, information, or indictment, and in any action or proceeding brought for the enforcement of any provision of this article or of the Drug Control Act (\u00a7 54.1-3400 et seq.), it shall not be necessary to negative any exception, excuse, proviso, or exemption contained in this article or in the Drug Control Act, and the burden of proof of any such exception, excuse, proviso, or exemption shall be upon the defendant.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b395-11\">. In his motion to dismiss, appellant raised the vagueness challenge but failed to argue vagueness before the trial court. The sole argument by appellant and the Commonwealth was the due process issue.
