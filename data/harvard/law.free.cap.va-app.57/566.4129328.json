Before a panel of this Court, Stevens argued that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress incriminating statements he made to police during a custodial interrogation after he requested counsel. Stevens contended that the police should have ceased questioning him because he claims to have unambiguously and unequivocally invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation as set forth in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">In an unpublished opinion, a divided panel of this Court reversed Stevens\u2019 convictions and remanded for a new trial. <em>See Stevens v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 0266-09-3, 2010 WL 2482325, at *5, 2010 Va.App. LEXIS 244, at *18 (Va. Ct.App. June 22, 2010). We subsequently granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc and stayed the panel decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On rehearing en banc, we hold that Stevens\u2019 state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>ment was ambiguous because the circumstances leading up to Stevens\u2019 statement made it unclear whether Stevens had requested the presence of an attorney during custodial interrogation, or whether he had simply expressed his desire to have an attorney appointed to represent him at trial. Because of this ambiguity, we conclude that the police were permitted to ask Stevens limited questions solely for the purpose of clarifying the statement. Accordingly, we hold that the police did not violate Stevens\u2019 right to counsel under <em>Miranda, </em>and, therefore, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">On July 22, 2008, the appellant, Roger Lee Stevens, was arrested for his involvement in a deadly shooting that occurred during a drug transaction. After his arrest, Investigators Chaney and Nicholson of the Pittsylvania County Sheriffs Department questioned Stevens at a police station in Chat-ham, Virginia. They began the interrogation by carefully reading Stevens his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Stevens waived those rights<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and answered the investigators\u2019 questions for approximately two hours. During this time, Stevens never asked for counsel. After this session concluded, Stevens was transferred to an unidentified jail; he did not remain in Chatham because of a need to keep him separate from another person in custody at that location.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Apparently, the magistrate before whom Stevens had appeared during the night had erroneously ordered Stevens to be transported to the juvenile and domestic relations district court for his original appearance and appointment of counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Based on the magistrate\u2019s order, authorities transferred Stevens to a holding cell at that court even though the proper court for this advisement was the general district court, which was not sitting that day. Because of this mix-up, the advisement was continued until the next day that the general district court was to sit.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">When he arrived for work that morning, Investigator Chaney learned that Stevens wanted to talk with him again. Accordingly, Chaney went to the holding cell and engaged in a \u201cbasic conversation\u201d with Stevens. Stevens asked Chaney if he could leave the cell to see his child at home. Chaney explained that Stevens could not leave because he was in police custody for several serious crimes. He further explained that he would come visit Stevens later to talk with him some more.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Later that day, Chaney and Nicholson had Stevens returned to the police department so they could speak with him further. Their conversation began as follows<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">Chaney: You wanna, you want to talk to us some more?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aka\">Stevens: Ya\u2019ll want to talk to me or something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">Chaney: Yeah. You want to talk to us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">Stevens: Ya\u2019ll want to talk to me? I ain\u2019t doing nothing [inaudible] sitting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">Chaney: Well reason we ask is cause we brought you back over that, this morning you asked for me, and we brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>you back over here the reason I\u2019m asking you is because your rights still apply. You still understand your rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWG\">Stevens: I have the right to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">Chaney: Everything that I read you last night, do you still understand your rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">Stevens: Mm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">Chaney: You can have a lawyer present if you want one. Stevens: I want, that\u2019s what I need. I want to know what\u2019s, you know what I\u2019m saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">Chaney: You can stop answering at any time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">Stevens: That\u2019s what I want, a lawyer, man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-10\">Chaney: You do want a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-11\">Stevens: I mean, that\u2019s what I thought they brought me up here for today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-12\">Nicholson: Well they gonna appoint you a lawyer. I mean you gonna get a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-13\">Chaney: The question is do you want a lawyer before you talk to us again or are you willing to talk to us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-14\">Stevens: I mean I\u2019ll listen to ya but you already said if I could stop if I wanted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-15\">Chaney: Stop answering at any time you want to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-16\">Stevens: I\u2019ll listen to what you got to say. If you want \u2014 if I say something \u2014 if I feel I don\u2019t want to say no more y\u2019all done told me I can stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-17\">Nicholson: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-18\">Chaney: Stop anytime you want.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-19\">Nicholson: No problem at all with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-20\">Chaney: All you got to say is I don\u2019t want to say \u2014 I don\u2019t want to talk to you no more. That\u2019s all you gotta say.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-21\">After this exchange, Stevens made incriminating statements to Chaney and Nicholson, which he later sought to suppress. In support of his motion to suppress, Stevens argued that he unambiguously and unequivocally invoked his Fifth Amendment right to have counsel present during questioning, and thus all further questioning should have ended immediately. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>In contrast, the Commonwealth argued that Investigators Chaney and Nicholson reasonably construed Stevens\u2019 statement as ambiguous in light of the full circumstances surrounding Stevens\u2019 aborted advisement and subsequent detention. Thus, the Commonwealth contended that the investigators were permitted to clarify the ambiguity. The trial court denied Stevens\u2019 motion and admitted the incriminating statements made to police. Stevens was subsequently convicted of numerous crimes. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">As he did before the trial court, Stevens argues on appeal that he made an unambiguous and unequivocal request to have counsel present during custodial interrogation. Accordingly, he contends that police questioning should have immediately ceased after he said, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want, a lawyer, man.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">We view the facts \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth,\u201d the prevailing party below, <em>Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 100, 104, 694 S.E.2d 590, 593 (2010), and grant it \u201call inferences reasonably deducible therefrom,\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Jenkins, </em>255 Va. 516, 521, 499 S.E.2d 263, 265 (1998). However, whether a defendant invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation presents a mixed question of law and fact. <em>Commonwealth v. Hilliard, </em>270 Va. 42, 49, 613 S.E.2d 579, 584 (2005). Hence, \u201c\u2018the determination of what [the defendant] actually said is a question of fact we review only for clear error,\u2019 \u201d but \u201c \u2018[w]hether those words are sufficient to invoke a right to counsel is a legal determination that we review de novo.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Redmond, </em>264 Va. 321, 327, 568 S.E.2d 695, 698 (2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Uribe-Galindo, </em>990 F.2d 522, 523 (10th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>The Fifth Amendment guarantees that \u201c[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. To prevent such compulsion, the United States Supreme Court has \u201cestablished a number of prophylactic rights designed to counteract the \u2018inherently compelling pressures\u2019 of custodial interrogation, including the right to have counsel present\u201d during custodial interrogation. <em>McNeil v. Wisconsin, </em>501 U.S. 171, 176, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 2208, 115 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991) (quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 467, 86 S.Ct. at 1624); <em>see also Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 485-86, 101 S.Ct. at 1885 (\u201cThe Fifth Amendment right identified in <em>Miranda </em>is the right to have counsel present at any custodial interrogation.\u201d). Thus, as the Supreme Court has recognized, \u201cto have <em>counsel present </em>during a custodial interrogation is an axiom of American law.\u201d <em>Zektaw v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 127, 135, 677 S.E.2d 49, 53 (2009) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Once an accused requests to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, the accused \u201cis not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 484-85, 101 S.Ct. at 1885. Thus, the police \u201c \u2018may not reinterrogate an accused in custody if he has <em>clearly </em>asserted [this] right to counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arizona v. Roberson, </em>486 U.S. 675, 680, 108 S.Ct. 2093, 2097, 100 L.Ed.2d 704 (1988) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 485,101 S.Ct. at 1885). However, nothing in <em>Edwards </em>prevents police from questioning a suspect who does \u201cnot wish to have <em>a lawyer present\u201d </em>during questioning. <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 460, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 2356, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">It is not always clear, however, whether a suspect has invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, and thus has asked for \u201cthe particular sort of lawyerly assistance that is the subject of <em>Miranda,\u201d McNeil, </em>501 U.S. at 178, 111 S.Ct. at 2209, or whether he has asked for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>counsel for some other purpose. For instance, a suspect may seek the advice of counsel regarding preliminary police interaction, but not for the purpose of receiving counsel during custodial interrogation. <em>See United States v. LaGrone, </em>48 F.3d 332, 333, 337 (7th Cir.1994) (holding that a suspect\u2019s request for counsel to advise him on whether he should consent to a police search, pursuant to the Indiana Constitution, did not invoke his <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel during a subsequent custodial interrogation). In fact, a suspect may even request the presence of counsel during custodial interrogation on a limited basis that still permits some police questioning. <em>See Connecticut v. Barrett, </em>479 U.S. 523, 525-26, 107 S.Ct. 828, 830, 93 L.Ed.2d 920 (1987) (holding that a suspect may invoke his <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel only with respect to written statements, while still permitting verbal statements without qualification). Further, a suspect may also validly choose to forego the presence of counsel during custodial interrogation and instead choose simply to have an attorney for formal proceedings before a court, <em>United States v. Gouveia, </em>467 U.S. 180, 190, 104 S.Ct. 2292, 2298, 81 L.Ed.2d 146 (1984), or he may even choose to proceed without an attorney at all, <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 813-14, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2530, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). Given the range of options available to an accused, it follows that \u201c \u2018preserving the integrity of the accused\u2019s <em>choice </em>to communicate with police only through counsel is the essence\u2019\u201d of the Court\u2019s decisions affording the accused with a right to counsel in those circumstances. <em>Minnick v. Mississippi </em>498 U.S. 146, 153, 111 S.Ct. 486, 491, 112 L.Ed.2d 489 (1990) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Patterson v. Illinois, </em>487 U.S. 285, 291, 108 S.Ct. 2389, 2394, 101 L.Ed.2d 261 (1988)); <em>see also Barrett, </em>479 U.S. at 528, 107 S.Ct. at 831 (\u201cThe fundamental purpose of the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miranda </em>was \u2018to assure that <em>the individual\u2019s right to choose </em>between speech and silence remains unfettered throughout the interrogation process.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 469, 86 S.Ct. at 1625)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Finally, while we recognize that \u201ca defendant who does not want to speak to the police without counsel present need only say as much when he is first approached and given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings,\u201d <em>Montejo v. Louisiana, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 2079, 2090, 173 L.Ed.2d 955 (2009), where we are called upon to determine whether a reasonable police officer would have considered such a request ambiguous or equivocal, we must be mindful that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao2\">[suppression of evidence, however, has always been our last resort, not our first impulse. The exclusionary rule generates \u201csubstantial social costs,\u201d which sometimes include setting the guilty free and the dangerous at large. [The United States Supreme Court has] therefore been \u201ccautio[us] against expanding\u201d it, and \u201c[has] repeatedly emphasized that the rule\u2019s \u2018costly toll\u2019 upon truth-seeking and law enforcement objectives presents a high obstacle for those urging [its] application.\u201d [The Court has] rejected \u201c[indiscriminate application\u201d of the rule, and [has] held it to be applicable only \u201cwhere its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served,\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201cwhere its deterrence benefits outweigh its \u2018substantial social costs.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-8\"><em>Hudson v. Michigan, </em>547 U.S. 586, 591, 126 S.Ct. 2159, 2163, 165 L.Ed.2d 56 (2006) (some alterations in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">In light of these important considerations, we are now faced with how to evaluate a suspect\u2019s statement to police regarding his desire for counsel. Obviously, to invoke the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel \u201c\u2018requires, at a minimum, some statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney.\u2019\u201d <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459,114 S.Ct. at 2355 (quoting <em>McNeil, </em>501 U.S. at 178, 111 S.Ct. at 2209). But, if the statement is \u201cambiguous or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect [making the statement] <em>might </em>be\u201d asking for the presence of an attorney during custodial interrogation, the officer may ask questions to clarify the statement. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (citing <em>McNeil, </em>501 U.S. at 178, 111 S.Ct. at 2209; <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 485, 101 S.Ct. at 1885). In fact, \u201cwhen a suspect makes an ambiguous or equivocal statement, it will often be good police practice for the interviewing officers to clarify whether or not he actually wants an attorney\u201d present. <em>Id. </em>at 461, 114 S.Ct. at 2356.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The Supreme Court has examined on many occasions whether a particular statement made by a suspect unambiguously and unequivocally invoked the suspect\u2019s right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation. Oftentimes, it has viewed a defendant\u2019s statement as seeking mere clarification of his <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel, and not as a clear invocation of that right. <em>See, e.g., Hilliard, </em>270 Va. at 51, 613 S.E.2d at 585 (holding that the statement, \u201cCan I have someone else present too, I mean just for my safety, like a lawyer like y\u2019all just said?,\u201d was not a clear assertion of the defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel); <em>Redmond, </em>264 Va. at 330, 568 S.E.2d at 700 (holding that the statement, \u201cCan I speak to my lawyer? I can\u2019t even talk to [a] lawyer before I make any kinds of comments or anything?,\u201d was not a clear request for the presence of counsel during custodial interrogation); <em>Midkiff v. Commonwealth, </em>250 Va. 262, 265-67, 462 S.E.2d 112, 114-15 (1995) (holding that \u201c[t]he statement, \u2018I\u2019m scared to say anything without talking to a lawyer,\u2019 ... does not clearly and unambiguously communicate a desire to invoke\u201d a Fifth Amendment right to counsel). Yet other times, the Court has viewed certain statements as clear requests for counsel during custodial interrogation. For instance, in <em>Zektaw, </em>the Supreme Court held that the statement, \u201cI\u2019d really like to talk to a lawyer because this \u2014 oh my God, oh my Jesus, why?,\u201d was an unambiguous and unequivocal invocation of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel under <em>Miranda. Zektaw, </em>278 Va. at 131-32, 138-39, 677 S.E.2d at 51, 55. The Court similarly held in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number><em>Commonwealth v. Ferguson, </em>278 Va. 118, 121, 126, 677 S.E.2d 45, 46, 49 (2009), that the statement, \u201cNah, I want a lawyer, you know what I\u2019m saying?,\u201d was a clear, unambiguous, and unequivocal request for counsel during custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Like the statements in <em>Zektaw </em>and <em>Ferguson, </em>Stevens\u2019 statement requesting counsel was certainly unequivocal in content; however, equivocation and ambiguity are two distinct concepts that each warrant our review. Unlike equivocation, ambiguity arises from the circumstances leading up to the statement, along with the statement itself, rather than the words of the statement alone. In <em>Zektaw </em>and <em>Ferguson, </em>the Supreme Court was presented only with statements made under traditional circumstances \u2014 that is, statements made by a defendant during police questioning with little or no other relevant circumstances leading up to the questioning itself. <em>See Zektaw, </em>278 Va. at 131-32, 677 S.E.2d at 51; <em>Ferguson, </em>278 Va. at 121-22, 677 S.E.2d at 46-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Accordingly, neither of those cases dealt with atypical circumstances leading up to a defendant\u2019s request for counsel\u2014 circumstances that might have suggested the defendant was not requesting to have counsel present during police questioning, but rather, that suggested the defendant was seeking counsel for some other purpose. Such circumstances could render a suspect\u2019s statement <em>ambiguous, </em>even if the statement\u2019s words are unequivocal. Because we are now presented with this issue, we must evaluate whether the \u201ccircumstances leading up to the request for counsel would render it ambiguous,\u201d <em>Smith v. Illinois, </em>469 U.S. 91, 98, 105 S.Ct. 490, 494, 83 L.Ed.2d 488 (1984), such that the suspect failed to \u201c \u2018articulate <em>his desire to have counsel present </em>sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney,\u2019 \u201d <em>Redmond, </em>264 Va. at 328-29, 568 S.E.2d at 699 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S.Ct. at 2355).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>When we so evaluate the specific circumstances of this case, we conclude that Investigators Chaney and Nicholson, as police officers familiar with those circumstances, could reasonably have considered Stevens\u2019 request to be ambiguous \u2014 that it was just as likely Stevens was referring to his desire to have an attorney appointed to represent him before the court as it was that he was requesting an attorney to be present before further questioning. Stevens had been arrested and interrogated by Nicholson and Chaney the day before he gave his statements to them. Before the first interrogation began, Nicholson and Chaney advised Stevens of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and he waived those rights. During that first interrogation, Stevens never requested to speak to an attorney, and thus he never expressed a desire to have an attorney present during the first interrogation. Therefore, it was reasonable for the investigators to infer that they had built a rapport with Stevens and that he was willing to speak with them without an attorney present.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Thereafter, Stevens was transferred to an unknown jail, but the next day, he found himself back in a holding cell in Chatham, near Chaney and Nicholson\u2019s police station. Chaney and Nicholson did not instigate their second meeting with Stevens; rather, Stevens specifically asked to speak with Chaney.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Stevens expressed an interest in being released so he could see his young son. Chaney later had Stevens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>brought over to the police station to talk with him and Investigator Nicholson. At that time, both Chaney and Nicholson understood that Stevens had been transferred for advisement and that once Stevens made an appearance in court \u2014 whenever that might be \u2014 the court would appoint him an attorney.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Thus, when Stevens said, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want, a lawyer, man,\u201d explaining \u201cthat\u2019s what I thought they brought me up here for today,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the context in which the statement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>made interjected some ambiguity into the statement itself. There is surely nothing unreasonable about the officer\u2019s uncertainty as to whether Stevens wanted counsel present for custodial interrogation, or whether he wanted counsel for some other purpose \u2014 specifically, to represent him at trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Further, since Stevens had not previously requested the presence of counsel, and since Stevens had instigated the second meeting, Chaney and Nicholson could have reasonably wondered whether Stevens wanted a lawyer present before he talked to them, or whether he wanted a lawyer to aid him with adversarial judicial proceedings. Therefore, under the facts of this case, we hold that the investigators could have reasonably viewed Stevens\u2019 statement as ambiguous, and thus they were permitted to ask Stevens clarifying questions when he made that objectively ambiguous statement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>We are mindful that the judicially crafted rule of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards </em>\u201cis justified only by reference to its prophylactic purpose.\u201d <em>Maryland v.

Its purpose is to preserve \u201c \u2018the integrity of an accused\u2019s choice to communicate with police only through counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Texas v. Cobb, </em>532 U.S. 162, 175, 121 S.Ct. 1335, 1344, 149 L.Ed.2d 321 (2001) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (quoting <em>Patterson v.

Thus, the rule does not bar \u201c \u2018an accused from making an <em>initial </em>election as to whether he will face the State\u2019s officers during questioning with the aid of counsel, or go it alone.\u2019\u201d <em>Cobb, </em>532 U.S. at 175, 121 S.Ct. at 1344 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Patterson, </em>487 U.S. at 291, 108 S.Ct. at 2394). Rather, it permits the accused to make the choice that he believes is best; therefore, if the accused elects to go it alone, we should not exclude his subsequent statements at trial. <em>Id.; see Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S.Ct. at 2355.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Since the police must respect and act upon a suspect\u2019s choice, we will suppress a statement made outside of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>attorney\u2019s presence \u201conly if a reasonable officer should have been <em>certain </em>that the suspect expressed\u201d the unambiguous and unequivocal election of his right to counsel during custodial interrogation. <em>Cobb, </em>532 U.S. at 176, 121 S.Ct. at 1345 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S.Ct. at 2355). As we have explained, a reasonable police officer would not necessarily have had such certainty in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">As we have noted, when police officers are confronted with factual circumstances leading up to \u201ca [suspect\u2019s] reference to counsel that [is] insufficiently clear to invoke the <em>Edwards </em>prohibition to further questioning,\u201d <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 454, 114 S.Ct. at 2352, \u201cit will often be good police practice for the interviewing officers to clarify whether or not [the suspect] actually wants an attorney\u201d present, <em>id. </em>at 461, 114 S.Ct. at 2356. Investigators Chaney and Nicholson followed this \u201cgood police practice\u201d when they explained to Stevens that a lawyer would be appointed to represent him when he appeared in court, and then asked, \u201cThe question is do you want a lawyer before you talk to us again or are you willing to talk to us?\u201d They merely clarified his ambiguous statement, which was both the legally allowable and legally prudent response to that statement. Thus, the investigators\u2019 behavior was appropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the full circumstances leading up to Stevens\u2019 request for counsel rendered Stevens\u2019 statement ambiguous. A reasonable police officer under the circumstances could have reasonably wondered whether Stevens had invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, or whether he had invoked a right to counsel for some other purpose. Thus, the police were permitted to clarify the request. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-12\">. By granting the petition for rehearing en banc, we vacated the previous panel decision. <em>Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 168, 170, 622 S.E.2d 771, <em>772 </em>(2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-7\">. Although Stevens would not sign a waiver form, Stevens verbally agreed to waive each of his <em>Miranda </em>rights to the investigators. The parties do not dispute that Stevens validly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights during this first interrogation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b617-8\">. The parties have, at various times, referred to this proceeding as an advisement or arraignment. Clearly, the proceeding was Stevens' initial appearance before a court not of record for purposes of advising him of his right to bail and right to counsel and for appointment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>counsel if appropriate. Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-158, 19.2-159. For purposes of this opinion, we will refer to this proceeding as an advisement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b618-11\">. It is important to note that there is no transcript of this conversation. Rather, a video recording was introduced at trial. Because the trial court was able to view the conversation, it could consider not just the words spoken, but also the inflection, body language, and tone of voice of Stevens, Chaney, and Nicholson. Having watched the video, we note that, although the written words suggest a deliberate and sequential conversation, much of the quoted dialogue was a fast-paced exchange. The entire time lapse from the beginning of Stevens' explicit request for a lawyer until the end of his comment \"that\u2019s what I thought they brought me up here for today\u201d was approximately four seconds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\">. Stevens\u2019 position, as crystallized during oral argument, was that his subsequent statements became inadmissible the moment Investigator Chaney said, \"You do want a lawyer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b622-5\">. While we are well aware that the right to counsel and the right to remain silent during custodial interrogation are two distinct rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>under <em>Miranda, </em>we also recognize that the legal issues surrounding those two rights in particular are very similar, if not the same. <em>See Berghuis v. </em>Thompkins,-U.S.-,-, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 2260, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010) (explaining that \u201cthere is no principled reason to adopt different standards for determining when an accused has invoked the <em>Miranda </em>right to remain silent and the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b625-7\">. As the Kansas Supreme Court has held, \"The timing as well as the content and context of a reference to counsel may help determine whether there has been an unambiguous assertion of the right to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>the assistance of an attorney in dealing with a custodial interrogation by the police.\u201d <em>State v. Appleby, </em>289 Kan. 1017, 221 P.3d 525, 548 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b626-6\">. The dissent strongly emphasizes that, in its view, Chaney and Nicholson initiated a third, distinct meeting with Stevens. However, when we examine the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we conclude that the material exchange arose from a continuation of the second meeting that had been instigated by Stevens. Chaney explained this when he said, \"|T]his morning you asked for me, and we brought you back over here,\u201d i.e., as a result of Stevens' request. Even if, however, we accepted the dissent's characterization of the meeting, the fact remains that Chaney and Nicholson went into the meeting knowing about the aborted advisement. As we explain below, that aborted advisement serves as the backbone of the unique circumstances that inserted ambiguity into Stevens\u2019 statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b627-6\">. At oral argument, Stevens argued that no evidence suggested that the investigators were actually aware of the aborted advisement or that Stevens was expecting the imminent appointment of counsel. However, because we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and grant it all reasonable inferences from that evidence, <em>Jenkins, </em>255 Va. at 521, 499 S.E.2d at 265, we must presume that the investigators were aware of these peculiar circumstances. When asked if he knew why Stevens had been returned to Chatham, Investigator Chaney testified that he \"figured he was, he was coming to be arraigned.\u201d He also testified that he was \"pretty sure [he] had broached that subject [of whether Stevens had been appointed a lawyer] but [he couldn\u2019t] say for sure.\u201d He further acknowledged that Stevens did not, at that point, tell Chaney that he had been appointed a lawyer. For that second meeting, the investigators met Stevens at a holding cell in the juvenile and domestic relations district court, and therefore the trial court could reasonably infer that they understood that Stevens had been brought to the wrong location. More notably, during the second meeting, Nicholson explained that a lawyer would be appointed for Stevens, and then Chaney asked, \"The question is do you want a lawyer before you talk to us again or are you willing to talk to us?\u201d Thus, by their words and actions, the investigators clearly indicated that they understood the peculiar circumstances before them when they approached Stevens for the second time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b627-7\">. Because of the trial court\u2019s position as fact-finder, we must defer to its judgment regarding the nature of the exchange and the \u201cstatement\u201d to be evaluated as memorialized on video. Given Stevens\u2019 and the investigators\u2019 mannerisms, along with the disjointed nature of the colloquy, the trial court reasonably viewed Stevens' statement as a whole \u2014 not merely considering the first part, as Stevens asks us to do. Although Investigator Chaney interjected a statement of surprise \u2014 one he characterized as a comment, not a question \u2014 -by quickly exclaiming, \u201cYou do want a lawyer,\u201d that did not affect the unity of the statement made by Stevens, nor was Chaney\u2019s interjected statement of surprise impermissible interrogation. In fact, not even \" 'subtle compulsion\u2019 \u201d amounts to impermissible interrogation, <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>291, 303, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1691, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980), which goes beyond the interjected statement of surprise here.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa_\">Further, we do not view Chaney's single comment recognizing Stevens\u2019 request for an attorney as even approaching the improper \"continued police questioning\u201d presented by <em>Smith, </em>469 U.S. at 91-93, 105 S.Ct. at 491. There, \u201d[t]he interrogation ... bore a substantial similarity to the one condemned in <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>where the accused after requesting counsel was told that 'he had\u2019 to talk to his interrogators.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99 n. 8, 105 S.Ct. at 494 (quoting <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 479, 101 S.Ct. at 1882). As the Court explained, \"It was precisely such '[badgering]\u2019 that the <em>Edwards </em>safeguard was designed to prevent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (citing <em>Oregon v. Bradshaw, </em>462 U.S. 1039, 1044, 103 S.Ct. 2830, 2834, 77 L.Ed.2d 405 (1983)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\">. Although we recognize that we view these facts under an objective standard, we note that when Chaney was asked whether he perceived Stevens\u2019 statement as a request for a lawyer to help him with court proceedings and bond hearings, or a request to have a lawyer present for questioning, Chaney responded, \"I wasn\u2019t sure. That\u2019s why I was trying to clarify.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\">. The dissent observes that the statement occurred in the context of a custodial interrogation, and thus it reasons that only an exploration of the immediate circumstances surrounding that custodial interrogation is warranted. We agree with the dissent that the exchange occurred in the context of a custodial interrogation. If we thought otherwise, we would not need to analyze whether Stevens\u2019 statement was ambiguous, since that question arises only when a defendant could have conceivably requested the presence of counsel during custodial interrogation. <em>See Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S.Ct. at 2355. Accordingly, even in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>context of custodial interrogation, ambiguity in a suspect's statement may arise. <em>See id. </em>To determine what circumstances may make the statement ambiguous, we see no reason to restrict our examination to only those circumstances that have happened mere seconds or minutes before. A reasonable police officer could certainly look beyond the immediate circumstances to determine how to react to a given situation and interpret a particular statement from a suspect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b629-11\">. If police officers questioning a suspect \"reasonably do not know whether or not the suspect wants a lawyer, a rule requiring the immediate cessation of questioning 'would transform the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards into wholly irrational obstacles to legitimate police investigative activity.'\u201d <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S.Ct. at 2355-56 (quoting <em>Michigan v. Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 102, 96 S.Ct. 321, 326, 46 L.Ed.2d 313 (1975)).

The majority concludes Investigators Chaney and Nicholson \u201cmerely clarified [appellant\u2019s] ambiguous statement [concerning his desire for a lawyer], which was both the <em>legally allowable </em>and <em>legally prudent </em>response to that statement.\u201d <em>See supra </em>at 582, 704 S.E.2d at 593 (emphases added). Although it may have been <em>prudent </em>for the detectives to continue questioning appellant if they hoped to elicit an incriminating confession from an unrepresented defendant, I would hold their doing so was not, in fact, <em>legally allowable. </em>Appellant\u2019s statement, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want, a lawyer, man,\u201d was not remotely ambiguous, either in the abstract or in the context in which it was uttered in this case. To the contrary, it constituted an unequivocal invocation of appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to have counsel present during the custodial interrogation appellant was about to undergo. Accordingly, under settled principles, the investigators were required to cease their interrogation of appellant immediately, and the confession they elicited during the uncounseled interrogation that followed violated appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The right under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution \u201cto have counsel present during a custodial interrogation is an axiom of American law expressed in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)[,] and its progeny.\u201d <em>Zektaw v.

However, where the request is clear, subsequent dialog is inappropriate, and \u201can accused\u2019s subsequent statements are not relevant to the question whether he invoked his right to counsel.

Where the parties \u201c[do] not dispute the content of [a defendant\u2019s] statements to the police[,] ... appellate consideration of the circuit court\u2019s denial of [the defendant\u2019s] motion to suppress is restricted to a <em>de novo </em>review of the legal issue of whether [the defendant\u2019s] words, taken in context, were sufficient to invoke his right to counsel.\u201d <em>Hilliard, </em>270 Va. at 50, 613 S.E.2d at 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The majority concedes appellant\u2019s statement itself, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want, a lawyer, man,\u201d was unequivocal and, thus, that it must examine the context in which appellant made that statement. In determining whether the context of the statement resulted in ambiguity, the majority opinion omits certain testimony of the investigators which is critical to determining whether the trial court erred in concluding appellant\u2019s statement was not an invocation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">As the majority opinion indicates, on the night of appellant\u2019s arrest, the investigators advised him of his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda, </em>and he waived those rights, including his right to have counsel present. He then spoke with Investigators Chaney and Nicholson for two hours, during which time he said nothing incriminating. This was his first meeting with the investigators. The next morning, appellant asked to talk to Investigator Chaney again. The majority opinion accurately reflects the two men had what was their <em>second </em>meeting at about 10:00 a.m. that morning and that appellant \u201cinstigate[d]\u201d this meeting. When Investigator Chaney went to see appellant in his holding cell near the district court courtroom, appellant asked \u201cto go home,\u201d saying \u201c[he] want[ed] to see [his] [infant] son,\u201d and Investigator Chaney told appellant, \u201c[Y]ou can\u2019t go home. You\u2019re charged, you know, with shooting into an occupied vehicle resulting in death.\u201d Chaney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>testified that, after that exchange, \u201c[they] just had ... basic conversation,\u201d and Chaney said, \u201c[W]ell, I\u2019m going back downstairs ... but I\u2019ll bring you down later to the office and talk to you again.\u201d Chaney did not testify <em>appellant </em>gave any indication at that time that he wished to talk further with the investigators.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Several hours later, Investigator Chaney had appellant brought to the investigators\u2019 office, where they conducted the videotaped interview. This was Investigator Chaney\u2019s <em>third </em>meeting with appellant. Investigator Chaney testified unequivocally that he and Investigator Nicholson, not appellant, initiated this third meeting, saying we \u201chad [appellant] brought up ... [because] we wanted to talk to him again.\u201d At the beginning of the videotaped interview, Investigator Chaney confirmed he and Nicholson initiated this third meeting, and Chaney then expressly discussed appellant\u2019s <em>right to have counsel present during the impending interrogation:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">Inv.

It is true that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, established appellant had been brought to the courthouse for arraignment and \u201cappoint[ment] [of]\u201d \u201can attorney ... under his Sixth Amendment rights\u201d and that these things did not actually take place as scheduled that morning. Nevertheless, the video-recorded exchange between appellant and the officers establishes that appellant asserted his right to an attorney <em>in the context of the impending custodial interrogation, initiated by the investigators, and their review of his rights pursuant to Miranda. </em>As quoted above, when Investigator Chaney reminded appellant of his right to \u201chave a lawyer present [for questioning] if [he] want[ed] one,\u201d appellant responded \u201c[Tjhat\u2019s what I need.\u201d When Investigator Chaney proceeded to tell appellant that he \u201c[could] stop answering at any time,\u201d appellant again focused on his right to have \u201ca lawyer present,\u201d saying \u201cThat\u2019s what I want, a lawyer, man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">As set out above, the United States and Virginia Supreme Courts have recognized, and the majority opinion does not adequately acknowledge, that \u201c[a] statement either asserts or fails to assert an accused\u2019s right to counsel\u201d and <em>\u201can accused\u2019s subsequent statements are not relevant to the question whether he invoked his right to counsel.\u201d Redmond, </em>264 Va. at 327, 568 S.E.2d at 698 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Smith, </em>469 U.S. at 97-98, 105 S.Ct. at 494). Applying these principles to the circumstances of this case, I would hold as a matter of law that appellant\u2019s statement constituted an unequivocal invoca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>tion of his right to have counsel present during the custodial interrogation and that the investigators violated appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to counsel by failing scrupulously to honor that request. In the face of the clear invocation of that right, the officers lacked authority to ask any clarifying questions, and the answers to those questions must be disregarded.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">To the extent the Commonwealth argues and the majority implies Investigator Chaney may have thought it was unlikely that appellant was invoking his Fifth Amendment right to counsel because <em>appellant </em>initiated the meeting that was video recorded, any such inference was objectively unreasonable on the facts of this case, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. Investigator Chaney\u2019s testimony indicates appellant initiated only the <em>second </em>meeting, which took place at appellant\u2019s district court holding cell and involved appellant\u2019s asking to go home to see his infant son, which Chaney said would not be possible. After some additional \u201cbasic conversation,\u201d Investigator Chaney told appellant he would bring appellant over to talk again later in the day, but Chaney gave no indication that he did so because appellant expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>a desire to talk to him further or to discuss the crime for which he stood charged. In addition, appellant indicated in the dialog at the beginning of the video recording that he was in the investigators\u2019 office because \u201cYa\u2019ll want to talk to me.\u201d When Investigator Chaney agreed they wanted to talk to appellant and inquired, \u201cYou want to talk to us?\u201d appellant responded once again, \u201cYa\u2019ll want to talk to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Thus, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, indicates that when appellant said, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want, a lawyer, man,\u201d he had been brought to the investigators\u2019 office for additional questioning at the investigators\u2019 request rather than his own and the investigators were in the process of readvising him of his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda. </em>Under these circumstances, the objective evidence indicates as a matter of law that appellant unequivocally invoked his Fifth Amendment right to counsel, compelling the suppression of the statements he made when the investigators failed immediately to cease that interrogation. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision affirming the admission of appellant\u2019s uncounseled confession.</p>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b632-6\">. Quoting a concurring opinion in a United States Supreme Court case, the majority indicates suppression is appropriate \" 'only if a reasonable officer should have been <em>certain </em>that the suspect expressed\u2019 the unambiguous and unequivocal election of his right to counsel during custodial interrogation.\u201d <em>See supra </em>at 582, 704 S.E.2d at 593 (quoting <em>\"[Texas v.] Cobb, </em>532 U.S. [162,] 176 [121 S.Ct. 1335, 1345, 149 L.Ed.2d 321] [(2001)] (Kennedy, J., concurring) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S.Ct. at 2355)\u201d). The case upon which the concurring opinion of Justice Kennedy relies, however, requires only that the suspect \"must unambiguously request counsel\u201d and provides that as long as he \"articulate[s] his desire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney,\u201d he \"need not 'speak with the discrimination of an Oxford don.' <em>\u201d Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S.Ct. at 2355 (quoting <em>id. </em>at 476, 114 S.Ct. at 2364 (Souter, J., concurring in the judgment)). To the extent the majority\u2019s requirement of proof that a reasonable officer must be \"certain\u201d the suspect has invoked his right to counsel might be viewed as adopting a higher standard of proof than \u201cunambiguous[ness],\u201d I would reject its \"certainfty]\u201d language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b636-5\">. The fact that appellant subsequently referenced his belief that he had been brought to court that day so that counsel could be appointed for him did not negate his prior statement that he wanted an attorney present for questioning. The fact that the clarifying questions had nothing to do with the charged crimes does not support the conclusion that no Fifth Amendment violation could have occurred. As the Supreme Court has observed, if a suspect invokes his right to have counsel present, thereby indicating his</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">\"belie[f] that he is not capable of undergoing such questioning without advice of counsel, then it is presumed that any subsequent waiver that has come at the authorities\u2019 behest, and not at the suspect\u2019s own instigation, is itself the product of 'inherently compelling pressures\u2019 and not the purely voluntary choice of the suspect.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJc\"><em>Zektaw, </em>278 Va. at 136, 677 S.E.2d at 53 (quoting <em>Arizona v.
