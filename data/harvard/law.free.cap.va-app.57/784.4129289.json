Murphy argues that the trial court erred when it sustained the Charlotte County Department of Social Services\u2019 (the Department) Special Plea of Sovereign Immunity asking for dismissal of his claim for attorney\u2019s fees. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">Murphy has three minor children. The Department removed the children based on allegations of abuse and neglect. Several hearings were held in the juvenile and domestic relations district court (the JDR court) regarding the Department\u2019s petitions. Ultimately, the JDR court dismissed the petitions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently, Murphy filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees to be assessed against the Department pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-278.19.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The JDR court denied his motion. Murphy appealed the denial of attorney\u2019s fees to the trial court. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Department responded by filing a Special Plea of Sovereign Immunity. The trial court ultimately granted the Department\u2019s Special Plea, ruling that \u201cthe doctrine of sovereign immunity bars [Murphy\u2019s] claim for attorney\u2019s fees against the Charlotte County Department of Social Services.\u201d Murphy then appealed this ruling to the Court of Appeals of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Murphy argues that the trial court erred in granting the Department\u2019s Special Plea of Sovereign Immunity and denying his request for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-278.19.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In reviewing this argument, we are mindful that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-6\">\u201c \u2018Where no evidence is taken in support of a plea in bar, the trial court, and the appellate court upon review, consider solely the pleadings in resolving the issue presented.\u2019 \u201d <em>Niese v.

Laingford, </em>261 Va. 495, 497, 544 S.E.2d 357, 358 (2001)). \u201cThe facts as stated in the pleadings by the plaintiff are taken as true for the purpose of resolving the special plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Lostrangio, </em>261 Va. at 497, 544 S.E.2d at 358). \u201cThe existence of sovereign immunity is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>City of Chesapeake v. Cunningham, </em>268 Va. 624, 633, 604 S.E.2d 420, 426 (2004).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-7\"><em>Gray v. Va. Sec\u2019y of Transp., </em>276 Va. 93, 97, 662 S.E.2d 66, 68 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">The Department argues that it is protected by the doctrine of sovereign immunity from the claim for attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>The trial court agreed, holding, \u201c[T]he Commonwealth or any of its subdivisions cannot be sued in the absence of an express and clear waiver of its claim under sovereign immunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">\u201cAs a general rule, the Commonwealth is immune both from actions at law for damages and from suits in equity to restrain governmental action or to compel such action.\u201d <em>Alliance to Save the Mattaponi v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 423, 455, 621 S.E.2d 78, 96 (2005) (citations omitted). \u201cThe same immunity principles apply to counties, which are political subdivisions of the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Ligon v. Cnty. of Goochland, </em>279 Va. 312, 316, 689 S.E.2d 666, 668 (2010) (citing <em>Mann v. Cnty. Board of Arlington Cnty., </em>199 Va. 169, 174, 98 S.E.2d 515, 518 (1957); <em>Fry v. Cnty. of Albemarle, </em>86 Va. 195,197-98, 9 S.E. 1004, 1005 (1890)). However, the Commonwealth\u2019s sovereign immunity can be waived by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The doctrine of sovereign immunity serves many purposes. These purposes include protecting the public purse, ensuring the uninterrupted functioning of government, eliminating any public inconvenience and danger that may result from officials being fearful to act, assuring that citizens will continue to accept public employment, and discouraging individuals from improperly threatening or initiating vexatious litigation. <em>Gray, </em>276 Va. at 101, 662 S.E.2d at 70; <em>Afzall v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 226, 231, 639 S.E.2d 279, 282 (2007); <em>Messina v. Burden, </em>228 Va. 301, 307-08, 321 S.E.2d 657, 660 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Only the General Assembly can determine as a matter of policy whether the Commonwealth\u2019s sovereign immunity should be abrogated with regard to a particular type of legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>action. <em>Afzall, </em>273 Va. at 230, 639 S.E.2d at 281; <em>Commonwealth v. Luzik, </em>259 Va. 198, 206, 524 S.E.2d 871, 876 (2000). In reviewing a statute, courts will conclude that the General Assembly has taken such action abrogating the Commonwealth\u2019s sovereign immunity only when the statutory language has explicitly and expressly announced such a waiver. <em>See Gray, </em>276 Va. at 102, 662 S.E.2d at 71; <em>Afzall, </em>273 Va. at 230, 639 S.E.2d at 281; <em>Hinchey v. Ogden, </em>226 Va. 234, 241, 307 S.E.2d 891, 895 (1983); <em>Elizabeth River Tunnel Dist. v. Beecher, </em>202 Va. 452, 457, 117 S.E.2d 685, 689 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 316-17, 689 S.E.2d at 668-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">At oral argument before this Court, Murphy conceded that there was no express waiver of sovereign immunity in Code \u00a7 16.1-278.19. This concession would seem to resolve the issue before us. However, \u201c \u2018[o]ur fidelity to the uniform application of law precludes us accepting concessions of law made on appeal. Because the law applies to all alike, it cannot be subordinated to the private opinions of litigants.\u2019 \u201d <em>Copeland v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 529, 531-32, 664 S.E.2d 528, 529 (2008) (quoting <em>Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 168, 172, 622 S.E.2d 771, 773 (2005) (en banc)). Therefore, we look to the language of the statute and the law to determine whether the Department\u2019s sovereign immunity was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Code \u00a7 16.1-278.19 states: \u201cIn any matter properly before the court, the court may award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs on behalf of <em>any party </em>as the court deems appropriate based on the relative financial ability of the parties.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In looking at this language, we find that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>is informative and controlling. There, the Supreme Court held that \u201ca waiver of sovereign immunity cannot be implied from general statutory language.\u201d <em>Lig\u00f3n, </em>279 Va. at 319, 689 S.E.2d at 670 (citations omitted). The Supreme Court then held that the broad term \u201cany employee\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 8.01-216.8 did not expressly and specifically refer to employees of the Commonwealth and its subdivisions; thus, the Commonwealth had not explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>waived sovereign immunity under the retaliatory discharge provision of the Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">Similarly here, the General Assembly did not specify that \u201cany party,\u201d as stated in Code \u00a7 16.1-278.19, referred to the Commonwealth and its subdivisions. While the General Assembly was very much aware when enacting this statute that the counties\u2019 departments of social services would frequently be parties to actions instituted in JDR courts,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> such as petitions for abuse and neglect (Code \u00a7 16.1-278.2), foster care (Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-281, -282, -282.1, -282.2), and termination of parental rights (Code \u00a7 16.1-283), nevertheless, similar to the situation in <em>Lig\u00f3n, </em>the General Assembly chose to use the general nomination, \u201cany party,\u201d rather than to expressly and specifically waive the shield of sovereign immunity. If the General Assembly had intended that the counties\u2019 departments of social services would have been subject to the discretionary assessment of attorneys\u2019 fees in all JDR court proceedings, then it would have said so expressly. <em>Hinchey v. Ogden, </em>226 Va. 234, 241, 307 S.E.2d 891, 895 (1983) (\u201c[Tjhere can be no waiver of sovereign immunity by implication.\u201d). Accordingly, appellant\u2019s counsel most appropriately conceded at oral argument that Code \u00a7 16.1-278.19 did not expressly and specifically waive the Department\u2019s protection of sovereign immunity. Thus, we hold the trial court did not err in sustaining the Department\u2019s Special Plea of Sovereign Immunity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Murphy presents another argument in support of his claim that the trial court erred in finding that the Department was not immune to his motion for attorney\u2019s fees. He argues that the General Assembly has waived the Department\u2019s sovereign immunity in suits in equity where a party seeks an award of costs, pointing to Code \u00a7\u00a7 17.1-600 and 17.1-629, which are found in the title of the Code addressing actions in \u201ccourts of record,\u201d i.e., trial courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Code \u00a7 17.1-629 states: \u201cIn no case, civil or criminal, whether in a court of record or a court not of record, except when otherwise specially provided, shall there be a judgment for costs against the Commonwealth.\u201d However, Code \u00a7 17.1-600 limits the applicability of this prohibition as it applies to suits in equity, stating: \u201cThe laws of costs shall not be interpreted as penal laws; nor shall anything in this chapter take away or abridge the discretion of a court of equity over the subject of costs, except as provided in \u00a7 17.1\u2014 604.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The parties agree that this case involves a matter in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">However, Murphy\u2019s motion only requested attorney\u2019s fees, not costs. This Court has previously noted that \u201ccosts\u201d do not necessarily include \u201cattorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>See O\u2019Loughlin v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>23 Va.App. 690, 693, 479 S.E.2d 98, 99 (1996). In addition, Code \u00a7 17.1-600 speaks of the courts\u2019 \u201cdiscretion\u201d in equity \u2014 but Virginia courts do not have discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees in any case, whether legal or equitable, absent a specific grant of such authority. <em>See Lannon v. Lee Conner Realty Corp., </em>238 Va. 590, 594, 385 S.E.2d 380, 383 (1989) (\u201c[W]e have consistently adhered to the \u2018American rule\u2019: ordinarily, attorneys\u2019 fees are not recoverable by a prevailing litigant in the absence of a specific contractual or statutory provision to the contrary.\u201d (citation omitted)). Because Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>\u00a7 17.1-600 does not specifically allow the award of attorney\u2019s fees, the trial court could not award attorney\u2019s fees to Murphy here, especially given the opposing party was the Department, a government agency protected by sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-11\">. The JDR court\u2019s orders are not included in the record. Murphy asserts that the JDR court dismissed the removal petitions, but one child remained in the Department\u2019s custody based on a CHINS petition until custody was later awarded to Murphy. The Department states that the JDR court adjudicated the abuse and neglect petitions, but by agreement of the parties, the JDR court later vacated the adjudication and the Department was allowed to withdraw its petitions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-12\">. Murphy incurred significant attorney\u2019s fees during this process in the JDR court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b836-9\">. Murphy never argued to the circuit court \u2014 nor did he argue in his briefing to the Court \u2014 that sovereign immunity does not apply to a \u25a0motion for attorney's fees if the Commonwealth has initiated the underlying suit. Murphy argues only that Code \u00a7 16.1-278.19 and Code \u00a7 17.1-660 allow a trial court to award attorney\u2019s fees to a party who prevails against the Commonwealth in an equity case in the JDR court, such as in the case here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b836-10\">. Murphy argues that this Court previously decided the issue before us in <em>Donald </em>v. <em>Fairfax Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>20 Va.App. 155, 455 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>S.E.2d 740 (1995) (en banc). Murphy correctly notes that the Supreme Court of Virginia reversed our <em>Donald </em>holding on jurisdictional and procedural grounds, <em>Fairfax Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Human Dev. v. Donald, </em>251 Va. 227, 467 S.E.2d 803 (1996), but argues that the rationale of our <em>Donald </em>holding should be adopted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">After the Supreme Court of Virginia reversed and remanded the <em>Donald </em>case, this Court withdrew and vacated its opinion. Therefore, our <em>Donald </em>opinion has no precedential value, and we may not consider it as authority on the issue of sovereign immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b839-5\">.

Cook, </em>276 Va. 465, 484, 666 S.E.2d 361, 370-71 (2008), the Supreme Court did rule that the Court of Appeals could award appellate attorney\u2019s fees to a child\u2019s grandparents in a foster care proceeding. However, the issue of sovereign immunity was not raised in that case. <em>Id. </em>The only argument on attorney's fees was whether this Court had applied the appropriate standard under Code \u00a7 16.1-278.19, and the Supreme Court specifically refused to express an opinion as to whether the grandparents actually were entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>at 484 n. 11, 666 S.E.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>371 n. 11.
