Davis, appellant, was convicted in a jury trial of vehicular aggravated involuntary manslaughter, in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1(B). Appellant contends the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the manslaughter indictment because that conviction violates both the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution and \u00a7 19.2-294 of the Code of Virginia. He also contends the evidence was not sufficient to prove causation and criminal negligence. Finding no error, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Under well established principles of appellate review, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences deducible from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below. <em>Banks v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 539, 543, 586 S.E.2d 876, 877 (2003). So viewed, on the evening of January 6, 2009, appellant attended a birthday party along with his cousins, Lawanda Rainey and Ronald White. Both White and appellant drank alcohol at the party. White left the party on foot before appellant, and Rainey left in appellant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">As Davis drove on an unlit stretch of Mecklenburg Avenue, he was sending text messages on his cellular phone. Appellant testified his headlights illuminated the road. Rainey saw something in the road and yelled to appellant to \u201cwatch out.\u201d Seconds later, appellant hit White, who was lying in the road. Rainey never indicated appellant took any evasive action prior to striking White. Appellant lost control of his car and crashed into a ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Officers arrived at the scene. White was declared dead at the scene. Virginia State Trooper Joseph Landry observed that there were no skid marks leading to the decedent\u2019s body.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also observed damage to the front undercarriage of appellant\u2019s car. Landry detected a slight odor of alcohol on appellant. Landry testified appellant appeared to be under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>influence of alcohol. Landry put appellant into the police car and advised him of his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights. Appellant stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap8\">I\u2019m going to be honest with you. Me and my cousin was coming down the road. I was sitting there texting on my phone and I did not realize he was laying in the road. And I ran over top of him. And after I ran over top of him, that\u2019s when I realized I had ran over top of something. And that\u2019s when I swerved and hit the bank and everything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Appellant admitted to drinking alcohol, so Landry administered field sobriety tests. Appellant did not perform satisfactorily. At the sheriffs office, a breath test revealed appellant\u2019s blood alcohol level to be .15.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">On April 8, 2009, appellant was convicted in general district court of driving under the influence, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. Immediately after his conviction, appellant was served with an indictment, returned by the grand jury on April 6, 2009, charging him with aggravated involuntary manslaughter, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Appellant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on July 8, 2009. On July 21, 2009, the trial court conducted a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion. The trial court found no double jeopardy violation under <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), and no violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-294.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">A jury heard the aggravated involuntary manslaughter case on August 11, 2009. Melissa Kennedy, a forensic scientist who is a supervisor in the Breath Alcohol Department of Forensic Science, testified as an expert in toxicology. She stated that concentration and divided attention problems begin when the blood alcohol level reaches .05.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Kennedy explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>divided attention is the most important part of safe driving. At a .05 blood alcohol level, one begins to lose judgment and the ability to think coherently. She also testified that visual difficulties begin at a blood alcohol level of about .10. Alcohol consumption impairs reaction time such that an impaired driver takes longer to recognize an emergency and to take evasive action. Kennedy stated that while appellant\u2019s blood alcohol level was .15 at the time it was tested, it would have been .19 to .21 at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">At trial, appellant testified that when Rainey told him something was in the road, he \u201cimmediately\u201d put his phone down and swerved to avoid the object. Appellant denied not looking at the road. He explained, \u201cI was looking down and looking up at the same time. I wasn\u2019t on. my cell phone the whole entire time.\u201d When asked if he could have seen the object in the road sooner had he had not been texting, but looking forward, appellant replied in the negative, because it was dark. He further admitted that after seeing the object in the road, he had time to swerve around it. At trial, appellant denied hitting White.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The jury convicted appellant of aggravated involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the aggravated involuntary manslaughter indictment because that conviction violates both the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution and \u00a7 19.2-294 of the Code of Virginia. Specifically, he argues he was improperly convicted and punished twice for committing one offense. He also argues the Commonwealth did not prove that White\u2019s death was caused by appellant driving under the influence of alcohol, nor did the Commonwealth prove the requisite criminal negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>\n<em>Double Jeopardy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A7J\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">In reviewing a double jeopardy claim, or a claim based on statutory interpretation, this Court shall conduct a <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See Dalo v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 156, 164-65, 554 S.E.2d 705, 709 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Our inquiry is whether the convictions and punishments for driving while intoxicated and aggravated involuntary manslaughter, both of which arose from the same incident, violate the double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. In pertinent part, this amendment states that \u201c[n]o person shall ... be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u201cThis constitutional provision guarantees protection against (1) a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and (3) multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>Payne v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 216, 227, 509 S.E.2d 293, 300 (1999).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">To determine whether two charges constitute the same offense, we must consider the rule enunciated in <em>Block-burger, </em>284 U.S. at 304, 52 S.Ct. at 182.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[WJhere the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A double jeopardy violation exists only if the offenses always require proof of the same elements. <em>See Illinois v. Vitale, </em>447 U.S. 410, 419-20, 100 S.Ct. 2260, 2267, 65 L.Ed.2d 228 (1980). \u201cIn applying the <em>Blockburger </em>test, we look at the offenses charged in the abstract, without referring to the particular facts of the case under review.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 196, 200, 539 S.E.2d 732, 734 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">An analysis of whether the multiple convictions and punishments imposed upon appellant are proper requires a determination of legislative intent. Thus, we must first examine the statutes under which appellant was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-266 (driving while intoxicated) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">It shall be unlawful for any person to drive or operate any motor vehicle ... (i) while such person has a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent or more ... (ii) while such person is under the influence of alcohol, (iii) while such person is under the influence of any narcotic drug or any other self-administered intoxicant or drug of whatsoever nature, or any combination of such drugs, to a degree which impairs his ability to drive or operate any motor vehicle ... (iv) while such person is under the combined influence of alcohol and any drug or drugs to a degree which impairs his ability to drive or operate any motor vehicle....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 (aggravated involuntary manslaughter) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">A. Any person who, as a result of driving under the influence in violation of clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) of \u00a7 18.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>266 ... causes the death of another person, shall be guilty of involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">B. If, in addition, the conduct of the defendant was so gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life, he shall be guilty of aggravated involuntary manslaughter, a felony punishable by a term of imprisonment of not less than one nor more than 20 years, one year of which shall be a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The driving while intoxicated and involuntary manslaughter statutes contain different elements. An element of driving while intoxicated is having a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more. Code \u00a7 18.2 \u2014 266(i) requires no evidence of erratic driving, performance on sobriety tests, or any other evidence that the defendant is \u201cintoxicated.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 4.1-100 (defining \u201cintoxicated\u201d as \u201ca condition in which a person has drunk enough alcoholic beverages to observably affect his manner, disposition, speech, muscular movement, general appearance or behavior\u201d). Blood alcohol concentration is not an element of involuntary manslaughter. While aggravated involuntary manslaughter requires proof of driving under the influence, it also requires criminal negligence and death. Code \u00a7 18.2-266 does not require these elements. Viewed in the abstract, conviction under these two statutes passes the <em>Blockburger </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Because we find that each statute requires proof of additional facts not found in the other, therefore constituting two distinct offenses, there is no constitutional double jeopardy violation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>\n<em>Code \u00a7 19.2-29\u00ed</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ASC\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Appellant also contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss because he was twice tried and convicted for the same act. He argues his convictions violate the statutory bar against double prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">As previously noted, in considering a claim based on statutory interpretation, this Court conducts a <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See Dalo, </em>37 Va.App. at 164-65, 554 S.E.2d at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-294 states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">If the same act be a violation of two or more statutes, or of two or more ordinances, or of one or more statutes and also one or more ordinances, conviction under one of such statutes or ordinances shall be a bar to a prosecution or proceeding under the other or others.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">\u201cAlthough the language of [this statute] does not state that it provides a defense of former jeopardy, \u2018it amounts to such a defense in purpose and desired effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Londono v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 377, 393, 579 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2003) (quoting <em>Epps v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 150, 155, 216 S.E.2d 64, 68 (1975)). This statute \u201cspeaks to \u2018acts\u2019 of the accused, not elements of the offense.\u201d <em>Wade v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 359, 365, 388 S.E.2d 277, 280 (1990). So \u2018 \u201cif two offenses involve \u201ctwo separate and distinct acts,\u201d conviction of one does not bar a prosecution for the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 137, 145, 562 S.E.2d 341, 345 (2002) (quoting <em>Lash v. County of Henrico, </em>14 Va.App. 926, 930, 421 S.E.2d 851, 853 (1992) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The test of whether there are separate acts sustaining several offenses is whether the same evidence is required to sustain them. In applying the \u201csame evidence\u201d test, the particular criminal transaction must be examined to determine whether the acts are the same in terms of time, situs, victim, and the nature of the act itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>38 Va.App. at 146, 562 S.E.2d at 345 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus we must compare the acts upon which the manslaughter conviction was based with the acts underlying the conviction for driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">If the two convictions cannot be sustained by the same evidence, \u201c \u2018then the fact that several charges relate to and grow out of one transaction or occurrence does not make a single act or offense where two separate acts or offenses are defined by statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Londono, </em>40 Va.App. at 394, 579 S.E.2d at 649 (quoting <em>Hundley v. Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 449, 451, 69 S.E.2d 336, 337 (1952)).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">In <em>Londono, </em>appellant was charged with both state and federal offenses. The charges stemmed from transporting drugs into Virginia, possessing those drugs with the intent to distribute, and for conspiring to do so. This Court found that the time and situs of appellant\u2019s acts were different. The federal charges, possessing heroin with the intent to distribute and conspiring to possess heroin with intent to distribute, were based on his possession of those drugs at the train station in Richmond. The state charges, in contrast, were based on his transporting the drugs into the Commonwealth, which occurred the moment he crossed into Virginia with the drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 394-95, 579 S.E.2d at 649-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">In <em>Jefferson v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 361, 597 S.E.2d 290 (2004), the defendant was found to be carrying a weapon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>during a traffic stop. He was charged and convicted of both carrying a concealed weapon and possession of a weapon by a convicted felon. This Court found that assuming time, situs, and victim were the same, the nature of the act was different in each prosecution. For the concealed weapon conviction, the Commonwealth had to prove that the defendant had a handgun on his person, hidden from common observation, without the legal authority to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 368-69, 597 S.E.2d at 294. But to prove his guilt for the second charge, the Commonwealth had to show that he had a prior felony conviction and that he knowingly and intentionally possessed or transported the gun. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In this case, appellant\u2019s conduct supported convictions for both driving under the influence and aggravated involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">First, the time and situs of the acts were different for each offense. The moment appellant began to operate his vehicle while intoxicated, he was guilty of driving under the influence. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-266. It was not until he struck and killed White, some distance from where he began driving, that he committed manslaughter. <em>Cf. Londono, </em>40 Va.App. at 395, 579 S.E.2d at 649-50 (holding the appellant was guilty of transporting illegal substances into the Commonwealth the moment he crossed the border into Virginia, which took place well before they were discovered).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Next, each act had a distinct victim. The victim of driving under the influence was the Commonwealth. The victim of manslaughter was Ronald White.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Finally, the nature of the act specific to each prosecution is distinct. Appellant\u2019s act of driving with a blood alcohol concentration of at least .15 but not more than .20 predicated his conviction and sentencing for driving under the influence. In the conviction order for driving under the influence, it is clear that appellant was convicted under Code \u00a7 18.2-266(i), \u201cwhile such person has a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more.\u201d Appellant was sentenced under Code \u00a7 18.2-270, which provides an additional mandatory minimum period of five days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>incarceration if the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol concentration was at least .15 but not more than .20. Thus, the act required for a conviction of driving while intoxicated is not appellant\u2019s manner of driving, performance on sobriety tests, etc., but rather only his blood alcohol concentration. In contrast, appellant\u2019s act of 1) driving under the influence of alcohol (where he \u201chas drunk enough alcoholic beverages to observably affect his manner, disposition, speech, muscular movement, general appearance or behavior,\u201d Code \u00a7 4.1-100) and 2) killing someone as a result of his impaired driving was the evidence used to convict him of aggravated involuntary manslaughter. Although driving was the conduct common and necessary to each offense,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the time, situs, victim, and nature of the act were distinct. Because of this, different evidence could be needed to sustain each conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Therefore, appellant\u2019s prosecution for aggravated involuntary manslaughter does not violate Code \u00a7 19.2-294.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\n<em>Sufficiency</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ANV\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In examining a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, appellate courts will review the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing at trial and consider any reasonable inferences from the proven facts. <em>Zimmerman v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 384, 386, 585 S.E.2d 538, 539 (2003). The judgment of the trial court is presumed to be correct and will be reversed only if it is \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Viney v. Commonwealth, </em>269 Va. 296, 299, 609 S.E.2d 26, 28 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Appellant contends the Commonwealth did not prove White\u2019s death was caused by appellant\u2019s driving under the influence. Appellant also argues the evidence did not establish he acted with a reckless disregard for human life.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>A proximate cause is \u201can act or omission that, in natural and continuous sequence unbroken by a superseding cause, produces a particular event and without which that event would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 523, 529, 685 S.E.2d 43, 46 (2009); <em>see also Doherty v. Aleck, </em>273 Va. 421, 428, 641 S.E.2d 93, 97 (2007). \u201cThere can be more than one proximate cause [of an incident] and liability attaches to each person whose negligent act results in the victim\u2019s injury or death.\u201d <em>Gallimore v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 441, 447, 436 S.E.2d 421, 425 (1993). Causation is a factual issue left to the jury to decide. <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 616, 632, 529 S.E.2d 829, 837 (2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Appellant contends that his sending text messages, rather than his driving under the influence of alcohol, caused him to strike and kill White. However, this is belied by the record and by appellant\u2019s own testimony. When appellant was asked if he might have seen the object in the road sooner had he not been texting, appellant responded negatively, because it was dark. Appellant also stated that he was not looking at his cell phone the entire time, but rather he was looking at his phone and looking at the road. Appellant testified that when Rainey alerted him to an object in the road, he immediately put down his phone and looked at the road. He said he swerved, began weaving back and forth, and lost control of the car. Appellant\u2019s own words contradict any contention that sending text messages caused the accident.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">While appellant\u2019s act of sending text messages while driving under the influence was foolhardy and reckless, it was not an intervening cause of the accident. \u201cTo be an intervening cause ... [an incident] must have been an event which [the defendant] could not have foreseen.\u201d <em>See Gallimore, </em>246 Va. at 447, 436 S.E.2d at 425. Any reasonably prudent person would have realized the inherent risk involved with sending text messages while driving under the influence of alcohol. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Appellant\u2019s use of his cellular phone to send text messages did not break the chain of events initiated by his driving while intoxicated. It merely aggravated his recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Rainey, appellant\u2019s passenger, did not testify that appellant took any evasive action to avoid hitting White. Her testimony was that once she warned appellant that there was something in the road, appellant hit White within a few seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The trier of fact is not required to accept a party\u2019s evidence in its entirety, <em>Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 102, 107, 341 S.E.2d 190, 193 (1986), but is free to believe and disbelieve in part or in whole the testimony of any witness, <em>Rollston v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 535, 547, 399 S.E.2d 823, 830 (1991). The jury was entitled to reject appellant\u2019s testimony that he swerved to miss White, and conclude that appellant had time to take evasive action, but because of his intoxicated state, failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The impact of alcohol on appellant\u2019s behavior is supported by the evidence. Melissa Kennedy, the toxicology expert, testified that appellant\u2019s blood alcohol concentration was high enough that his concentration, attention, vision, judgment, and, most importantly, reaction time would all be negatively affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">\u201cDrunken driving is not only unlawful in itself, but it tends to make the defendant\u2019s dangerous conduct more dangerous.\u201d <em>Essex v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 273, 283, 322 S.E.2d 216, 221 (1984). Appellant\u2019s intoxication set in motion a chain of events that led to White\u2019s death. <em>See Gallimore, </em>246 Va. at 447, 436 S.E.2d at 425. The record clearly demonstrates that appellant\u2019s intoxication caused him to operate his vehicle in an unsafe fashion. His failure to see White lying in the road or to take any evasive action was the cause of White\u2019s death. The fact finder could properly infer that appellant\u2019s texting did not cause appellant\u2019s inattention to the object in the road. Therefore, we find there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that appellant\u2019s driving under the influence of alcohol caused the accident, as well as White\u2019s resulting death.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Appellant also alleges the Commonwealth failed to prove criminal negligence. This argument is without merit. \u201cConduct that is \u2018gross, wanton and culpable\u2019 demonstrating a \u2018reckless disregard for human life\u2019 is synonymous with \u2018criminal negligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Riley v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 467, 483, 675 S.E.2d 168, 177 (2009) (quoting <em>Jones v.

This fact by itself demonstrates criminal negligence and justifies a finding that appellant\u2019s conduct was gross, wanton, and culpable. <em>See Stevens v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 481, 488, 634 S.E.2d 305, 310 (2006) (concluding that a high level of intoxication supported a finding of criminal negligence).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">In addition, the record contains numerous other facts to support the jury\u2019s finding. Appellant was driving under the influence and sending text messages on a dark, rainy night. He failed to take any evasive action to avoid hitting White. His behavior demonstrated a disregard for human life. The jury correctly found evidence of criminal negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Driving under the influence and aggravated involuntary manslaughter are not the same offense. There was no violation of double jeopardy or Code \u00a7 19.2-294. The trial court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment. Further, the evidence was sufficient to prove that appellant drove under the influence and that this was a cause of the accident and decedent\u2019s death. Finally, the record supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>the jury\u2019s finding of criminal negligence. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b500-9\">.

In a prosecution for a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-36.1 or Code \u00a7 18.2-266(ii), (iii), or (iv), Code \u00a7 18.2-269 creates a rebuttable presumption that the accused was under the influence when the accused has a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or higher. However, the applicability of the statute to the issue before us was never raised below or briefed by the parties. A judge of this panel inquired whether Code \u00a7 18.2-269, in a <em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 304, 52 S.Ct. at 182, context, established that the blood alcohol concentration presumption was an element common to Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-266 and 18.2-36.1. The Attorney General responded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>that under Code \u00a7 18.2~266(i), the blood alcohol concentration is an element of the offense, while Code \u00a7 18.2-269 only creates a method of proving intoxication.

V. \u201cThe constitutional prohibition of double jeopardy has been held to consist of three separate guarantees: (1) \u2018It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. [ (2) It] protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. [ (3) ] And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Illinois v. Vitale, </em>447 U.S. 410, 415, 100 S.Ct. 2260, 2264, 65 L.Ed.2d 228 (1980) (quoting <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2076, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969) (footnotes omitted)). The first and second guarantees are only applicable to a second proceeding brought after an acquittal or conviction, i.e., a successive prosecution. The third guarantee, however, is relevant in simultaneous prosecutions. Thus, I believe that we must begin our analysis by determining whether the prosecutions were successive or simultaneous before we determine whether Davis was twice subjected to prosecution for the same offense following a conviction or whether he received multiple punishments for one offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">In <em>Phillips v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 548, 549-50, 514 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1999), the Supreme Court of Virginia considered \u201cwhether Code \u00a7 19.2-294 bar[red] a defendant\u2019s conviction on two felony charges of selling marijuana on school property, after he had been convicted in the general district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>court on two misdemeanor charges of distribution of marijuana based on the same acts.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There, two arrest warrants were issued for appellant charging him with the felony offenses of selling marijuana on school grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 550, 514 S.E.2d at 341.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">One week later, two more arrest warrants were issued against Phillips charging him with misdemeanor offenses of distributing less than a half-ounce of marijuana ..., in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1, based on the same acts as the felony charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">On October 29, 1996, Phillips appeared in the General District Court of Russell County on all four charges. At that hearing, Phillips was tried and convicted on the two misdemeanor charges and waived a preliminary hearing on the two felony charges. The grand jury later indicted Phillips on the two felony charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-7\"><em>Id. </em>In determining whether Phillips\u2019s prosecutions were successive or simultaneous, the Supreme Court of Virginia defined \u201cprosecution\u201d as \u201cthe process in which an accused is brought to justice from the time a formal accusation is made through trial and final judgment in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553, 514 S.E.2d at 343; <em>see Sigmon v. Commonwealth, </em>200 Va. 258, 267, 105 S.E.2d 171, 178 (1958) (defining \u201cprosecution\u201d as \u201cthe means adopted to bring a supposed criminal to justice and punishment by due course of law, and consists of a series of proceedings from the time formal accusation is made by swearing out a warrant, the finding of an indictment or information in a criminal court, the trial, and final judgment\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>The procurement of arrest warrants on different dates does not automatically trigger the successive prosecution bar of Code \u00a7 19.2-294. Since the bar is intended to protect an accused from the \u201chazards of vexatious, multiple prosecutions,\u201d the bar does not preclude the prosecution of charges in a single, evidentiary hearing, even though the arrest warrants were obtained on different dates. In such a situation, the accused is not subjected to a greater burden than when the charges are brought simultaneously and heard together. The accused conducts his defense based on the same trial sequence and faces the same potential for anxiety, expense, and punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><em>Phillips, </em>257 Va. at 553, 514 S.E.2d at 343. The Court ruled that Phillips\u2019s \u201cprosecutions were simultaneous, not successive, because they were joined in a single evidentiary hearing in the general district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court reached this conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>sion even though Phillips waived a preliminary hearing on the two felony charges. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThus, the later events in the circuit court on the felony charges were merely a continuation of the same prosecution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Over the course of time, this Court and the Supreme Court of Virginia have decided various factual scenarios along the prosecution continuum as satisfying the definition of simultaneous prosecutions. <em>See Bradshaw v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 484, 491-92, 323 S.E.2d 567, 571-72 (1984) (felony charges initiated at separate times but final judgments reached in the same proceeding); <em>Phillips, </em>257 Va. at 553, 514 S.E.2d at 343 (misdemeanor and felony charges initiated at separate times with the misdemeanor resolved in general district court and the preliminary hearing waived on the felony); <em>Freeman v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 126, 128-29, 414 S.E.2d 871, 873 (1992) (misdemeanor and felony charges initiated at the same time, but out of necessity, the misdemeanor was concluded before the felony was concluded in circuit court). Davis\u2019s case presents yet another set of facts, i.e., misdemeanor charges brought at one time and felony charges brought separately but prior to final judgment in the misdemeanor case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Based on the broad definition of \u201cprosecution\u201d employed in <em>Phillips </em>and other cases, i.e., \u201c \u2018prosecution\u2019 is the process in which an accused is brought to justice from the time a formal accusation is made through trial and final judgment in a court of appropriate jurisdiction!;,]\u201d 257 Va. at 553, 514 S.E.2d at 343, I believe that Davis\u2019s prosecutions were simultaneous as his prosecution for aggravated involuntary manslaughter commenced with his indictment by a grand jury before his prosecution for driving while intoxicated concluded with the final judgment in general district court. Just as the \u201csimultaneous initiation of criminal charges is not the exclusive factor in determining whether those charges have been resolved in a simultaneous prosecution!]]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 552, 514 S.E.2d at 342-43, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the prosecution of the offenses in a single evidentiary hearing is an \u201coverriding\u201d but not exclusive factor. Therefore, I would find that where the two prosecutions overlap at any time before one reaches final judgment, the prosecutions are simultaneous and not successive.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Because Davis\u2019s prosecutions were simultaneous, our holding in <em>Dalo v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 156, 554 S.E.2d 705 (2001), controls. In <em>Dalo, </em>the appellant was similarly charged with driving while intoxicated and involuntary manslaughter in a simultaneous prosecution. <em>Id. </em>at 160-61, 554 S.E.2d at 707. This Court held that <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), is not controlling where the legislative intent is clear. <em>Id. </em>at 163-64, 554 S.E.2d at 708-09. This Court concluded that the General Assembly intended to allow multiple punishments for involuntary manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. <em>Id. </em>at 166-69, 554 S.E.2d at 709-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">In this case, Davis correctly conceded that \u201cthe case law is clear that when \u00a7 18.2-266 and \u00a7 18.2-36.1 are tried simultaneously at any point in the proceedings, there is no Fifth Amendment violation.\u201d Therefore, I would hold that Davis\u2019s argument that his multiple convictions for aggravated involuntary manslaughter and driving while intoxicated constitute constitutional double jeopardy is without merit. Given that I would hold that the prosecutions are simultaneous, I would conclude that Code \u00a7 19.2-294 has no applicability because, by its terms, it only applies when the charges are tried successively. <em>Phillips, </em>257 Va. at 552, 514 S.E.2d at 342 (stating that \u201c[b]y its terms, the statute does not apply to simultaneous prosecutions, because only a prior <em>conviction </em>for the violation of an act will bar a later prosecution for the same act\u201d). I join the majority in analyzing the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b514-8\">. Although in <em>Phillips </em>the appellant only argued that his prosecutions were successive and thus constituted statutory double jeopardy under Code \u00a7 19.2-294, the analysis defining what is a successive or simultaneous prosecution would logically be the same regardless of whether the double jeopardy challenge is a constitutional or statutory one as something either is or is not a successive prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b514-9\">.
