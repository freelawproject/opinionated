Harris was sentenced to five years in the state penitentiary with four years suspended for five years on the credit card theft. The trial court revoked Harris\u2019s five-year suspended sentence for embezzlement and re-suspended four years thereof for five years. On appeal, Harris contends that the trial court erred in holding it lacked jurisdiction to consider his motion for reconsideration of his sentences for credit card theft and, upon revocation, for embezzlement because appellant had noted appeals to the Court of Appeals of Virginia for both cases. For the following reasons, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>reverse the trial court\u2019s decision and remand for further proceedings if the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-303 are applicable at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">On May 27, 2009, the trial court sentenced Harris to five years, with four years suspended for five years, for the felony credit card theft, and revoked a previously suspended five-year sentence for felony embezzlement, but re-suspended four years for five years, giving him a cumulative term of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">On June 10, 2009, Harris\u2019s counsel filed a notice of appeal to this Court in the embezzlement revocation case, and a notice of appeal to this Court on June 25, 2009, in the credit card theft case.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">On August 18, 2009, Harris\u2019s counsel filed a motion in the trial court for reconsideration of the sentences in the trial court on the basis that Harris had qualified for an \u201cin-house treatment program.\u201d Harris asserted in the motion that \u201c[t]his Honorable Court has jurisdiction over your Defendant\u2019s case, as your Defendant continues to reside in a local jail and has not been handed over to the Virginia Department of Corrections.\u201d On September 10, 2009, the Commonwealth filed a response to Harris\u2019s motion for reconsideration of sentences, and in it confirmed that \u201c[apparently thereafter [Harris] was accepted into a community based program\u201d and that \u201cthe Commonwealth would ask for a hearing on this matter.\u201d The Commonwealth did not challenge the assertion that Harris was, at that time, still in the local jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">On October 6, 2009, Harris\u2019s petitions for appeal were filed in this Court in both the embezzlement and credit card theft cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">On November 10, 2009, the Commonwealth filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction with the trial court asserting that \u201c[s]ince this matter is now pending before the Court of Appeals, this [c]ourt lacks jurisdiction to review the sentence which is now the subject of appellate review.\u201d The Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>wealth\u2019s motion further erroneously asserted that \u201c[t]he Appellant\u2019s Brief and the Commonwealth\u2019s Brief in Opposition have been filed with the Court of Appeals.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Also on November 10, 2009, Harris\u2019s counsel filed a motion in opposition to the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in which he again stated that Harris \u201cremains in a local jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">On December 4, 2009, the trial court held a hearing, at which Harris was present, on Harris\u2019s motion for reconsideration of his sentences. Argument was limited at the hearing to the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss Harris\u2019s motion for reconsideration for lack of jurisdiction, since Harris had appealed the final judgments in both of his cases to this Court. At the hearing on Harris\u2019s motion, the trial court agreed with the position of the Commonwealth that it lacked jurisdiction to modify the sentences \u201c[bjecause it\u2019s my view since the writ has been granted from the court of appeals. They have the ease____ I think that, procedurally, once the court of appeals grants the writ, then they should handle it.\u201d The trial court then dismissed Harris\u2019s motion for reconsideration based on lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">On December 30, 2009, Harris\u2019s petitions for appeal were denied by this Court, and he did not appeal the denial of his petitions to the Supreme Court of Virginia. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">A. Custody Status at the Time of the Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Rule 1:1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia provides that \u201c[a]ll final judgments, orders, and decrees, irrespective of terms of court, shall remain under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>control of the trial court and subject to be modified, vacated, or suspended for twenty-one days after the date of entry, and no longer.\u201d \u201c \u2018Thus, once the twenty-one-day time period following the entry of a final sentencing order has run without modification, vacation, or suspension of that order, the trial court loses jurisdiction to disturb the order, unless an exception to Rule 1:1 applies.\u2019\u201d <em>Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 631, 639, 681 S.E.2d 74, 78 (2009) (quoting <em>Patterson v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 610, 614, 575 S.E.2d 583, 585 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u201cAn exception to [Rule 1:1] is found in Code \u00a7 19.2-303.\u201d <em>Russnak v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 317, 325, 392 S.E.2d 491, 495 (1990). \u201cBy its explicit terms,\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-303 \u201cpermits a trial judge to retain jurisdiction to suspend or modify a sentence beyond the twenty-one day limit of Rule 1:1[] if the person sentenced for a felony has not been transferred to the Department of Corrections.\u201d <em>D \u2019Alessandro v. Commonwealth, </em>15 VaApp. 163, 168, 423 S.E.2d 199, 202 (1992). Under Code \u00a7 19.2-303, trial courts may modify a defendant\u2019s sentence if it is \u201ccompatible with the public interest and there are circumstances in mitigation of the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\"><em>Wilson, </em>54 Va.App. at 639-40, 681 S.E.2d at 78 (bracketed parts in original). Code \u00a7 19.2-303 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">If a person has been sentenced for a felony to the Department of Corrections but has not actually been transferred to a receiving unit of the Department, the court which heard the case, if it appears compatible with the public interest and there are circumstances in mitigation of the offense, may, at any time before the person is transferred to the Department, suspend or otherwise modify the unserved portion of such a sentence. The court may place the person on probation for such time as the court shall determine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Thus, Code \u00a7 19.2-303 operates as a statutory exception to Rule 1:1, and if the requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-303 are satisfied, the trial court retains jurisdiction to modify a sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>tence even after twenty-one days from entry of the final order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The burden is thus on the defendant, as the moving party, to prove that the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the matter by showing either that twenty-one days had not elapsed and thus the sentencing order was not yet final, or that the defendant had not been transferred to the custody of the Department of Corrections and \u201cit appears compatible with the public interest and there are circumstances in mitigation of the offense.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-303; <em>see Ziats v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 133, 139, 590 S.E.2d 117, 120 (2003) (holding the trial court did not have jurisdiction to modify a sentencing order when faced with a record that did not show the defendant\u2019s custody status); <em>D\u2019Alessandro, </em>15 Va.App. at 168, 423 S.E.2d at 202 (declining to find the trial court had jurisdiction to modify a sentencing order under Code \u00a7 19.2-303 where the record was silent on the defendant\u2019s custodial location).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Whether [appellant] was in the custody of the local sheriff, and not in the custody of the DOC, when the court entered the ... order is a question of fact which we review in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997). A trial court\u2019s factual determinations are binding on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>unless plainly wrong. <em>Naulty v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 523, 527, 346 S.E.2d 540, 542 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\"><em>Ziats, </em>42 Va.App. at 139, 590 S.E.2d at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Before reaching the merits of Harris\u2019s arguments, we must first address the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the record in this case does not establish whether the trial court still had jurisdiction when it denied Harris\u2019s motion to reconsider his sentence on December 4, 2009, and thus the trial court necessarily reached the right result even if it did so for the wrong reason. Specifically, it contends that the record does not disclose whether Harris had been transferred to the Department of Corrections on December 4, 2009. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">In this case, Harris\u2019s motion to reconsider his sentence was filed on August 18, 2009, which is well after the twenty-one-day mark from the final order entered on May 27, 2009. Thus, Harris had the burden of proving that the trial court had continuing jurisdiction to modify his sentence under Code \u00a7 19.2-303 \u2014 that he had not been transferred to the Department of Corrections. Harris\u2019s motion for reconsideration filed on August 18, 2009, contains the following proffer: \u201c[t]his Honorable Court has jurisdiction over your Defendant\u2019s case, as your Defendant continues to reside in a local jail and has <em>not </em>been handed over to the Virginia Department of Corrections.\u201d Further, in Harris\u2019s response to the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction filed on November 10, 2009, he again stated that Harris \u201cremains in a local jail.\u201d Lastly, the record establishes that the Commonwealth\u2019s response to the motion to reconsider does not dispute, and thus implicitly concedes, that Harris had not yet been transferred to the custody of the Department of Corrections, a fact further corroborated by Harris\u2019s presence in the courtroom on December 4, 2009, when the hearing was held. <em>See Whittaker v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 966, 969, 234 S.E.2d 79, 81-82 (1977) (\u201c[C]ounsel\u2019s avowal, the truth of which was unchallenged by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the Commonwealth, constituted a proper proffer \u2014 \u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; <em>see also Bloom v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 814, 821, 554 S.E.2d 84, 88 (2001) (holding the trial court did not err in relying on the unchallenged pretrial proffer of facts by the Commonwealth).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Based on this evidence, we cannot say that the record was silent or that Harris failed to establish that he had not been transferred to the custody of the Department of Corrections at the time of the hearing. Thus, the trial court did not err in its factual determination with regard to Harris\u2019s custody status at the time of the December 4, 2009 ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">B. Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Harris contends that, having established that he had not been transferred to the custody of the Department of Corrections, the trial court erred when it held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider his motion for reconsideration of his sentences because Harris had filed appeals to this Court in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">\u201cAlthough the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact are binding on appeal unless plainly wrong, we review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d Sink v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 655, 658, 507 S.E.2d 670, 671 (1998) (citing <em>Timbers v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187,193, 503 S.E.2d 233, 235-36 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Here the trial court drew the entirely logical, though erroneous, conclusion that it had lost jurisdiction once Harris had appealed the final judgments in his cases to this Court. Code \u00a7 17.1-406(a) provides that the criminal appellate jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>of this Court applies to a \u201cfinal conviction in the circuit court.\u201d Thus, the trial court\u2019s conclusion makes sense on several levels. First, it is not hard to conceive of the chaos and confusion that would ensue if the judgments and underlying analyses of this Court were based upon conviction and sentencing orders that were not in fact final due to overlapping concurrent jurisdiction with, and pending proceedings in, the circuit courts. Second, by appealing his convictions to this Court, Harris was asserting that the judgments in his cases were final and ripe for review by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">However, the General Assembly ultimately determines the jurisdictional parameters of the Commonwealth\u2019s courts, and however problematic the conceivable consequences may be, we are bound by the statutory scheme. In <em>Stamper v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 707, 324 S.E.2d 682 (1985), the Supreme Court of Virginia addressed six issues on appeal, one of which involved the application of Code \u00a7 19.2-303. The Supreme Court affirmed five of the assignments of error, but remanded the sixth for a hearing on a motion for modification of the sentence after noting that the appellant\u2019s \u201cmotion for a suspension of the sentence ... is still within the [trial] court\u2019s jurisdiction by virtue of Code \u00a7 19.2-303.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 720, 324 S.E.2d at 690. In noting that the motion was still within the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction, the Supreme Court specifically pointed out that the appellant had not been committed to the penitentiary at the time of the opinion due to the continuance of his appearance bond pending appeal. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court then remanded the case to the trial court for consideration of the motion for suspension of sentence and probation \u201cin light of the circumstances found to exist when the matter is heard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In remanding the issue with respect to the motion to suspend the sentence after considering Code \u00a7 19.2-303 while simultaneously deciding the remaining issues on appeal, the Supreme Court implicitly held that the General Assembly intended that a circuit court retains jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 19.2-303 regardless of any pending appeal so long as the requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-303 are met at the time the circuit court addresses the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Therefore, in this case, regardless of when this Court obtained jurisdiction, the circuit court also retained jurisdiction to modify the sentence under Code \u00a7 19.2-303 during and after the appeal so long as Harris had not been transferred to the Department of Corrections at the time of the hearing. Thus, we reverse the trial court\u2019s holding that it lacked jurisdiction when this matter was originally heard, and remand for consideration of Harris\u2019s motion for reconsideration of his sentence \u201cin light of the circumstances found to exist when the matter is heard.\u201d <em>Stamper, </em>228 Va. at 720, 324 S.E.2d at 690.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">C. Harmless Error</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The Commonwealth argues that if the trial court erred in dismissing the motion for lack of jurisdiction, it was harmless error because Harris failed to present evidence that would have justified a modification or suspension of his sentence as is required under Code \u00a7 19.2-303. \u201c[A]n error is harmless if \u2018it plainly appears from the record that appellant\u2019s motion for sentence modification would have been denied had the court entertained it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 631, 641, 681 S.E.2d 74, 79 (2009) (quoting <em>Esparza v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 600, 608, 513 S.E.2d 885, 889 (1999)). \u201cIn order for a trial court to modify a sentence pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-303, the defendant must present the trial court with \u2018circumstances in mitigation of the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Code \u00a7 19.2-303).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The General Assembly has not defined the phrase \u201ccircumstances in mitigation of the offense\u201d for the purposes of Code \u00a7 19.2-303. Generally, mitigating circumstances include \u201c[e]vidence of a good previous record, and extenuating circumstances tending to explain, but not excuse, the commission of\u2019 the crime. <em>Commonwealth v. Shifflett, </em>257 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>34, 44, 510 S.E.2d 232, 236 (1999). A mitigating circumstance is \u201ca fact or situation that does not bear on the question of the defendant\u2019s guilt, but that is considered by the court in imposing punishment, esp. in lessening the severity of a sentence.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>260 (8th ed.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">In this case, the trial court limited the December 4, 2009 hearing to the specific issue of the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to hold a reconsideration hearing in light of the pending appeals, and no evidence was presented or heard on the merits of the motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Given the limited scope of the record before us, we cannot assume that Harris\u2019s motion for sentence modification would have been denied had the court entertained it, thus constituting harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-12\">. The Commonwealth correctly noted in its brief before this Court that this assertion was erroneous and that at the time of the hearing in the trial court on the motion to reconsider Harris\u2019s sentences, Harris had filed petitions for appeal in this Court, which had not yet been acted upon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-6\">. The Virginia Constitution provides in Article VI, Section 5 that the \"general law\u201d established by the General Assembly prevails over conflicting Rules of the Supreme Court. Moreover, Code \u00a7 8.01-3 provides that \"[i]n the case of any variance between a rule and an enactment of the General Assembly such variance shall be construed so as to give effect to such enactment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\">. In <em>McCoy v. McCoy, </em>55 Va.App. 524, 528, 687 S.E.2d 82, 84 (2010) (quoting <em>Watkins v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs., </em>42 Va.App. 760, 771, 595 S.E.2d 19, 25 (2004)), this Court stated the general rule that \"[w]hen a party files a notice of appeal, that notice 'effectively transfers jurisdiction from the lower court to the appellate court and places the named parties within the jurisdiction of the appellate court.\u2019 \u201d However, <em>McCoy </em>is not controlling in this case because Code \u00a7 19.2-303 is an exception to the general rule as noted above, and was not applicable in <em>McCoy.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b262-10\">. We note that the Commonwealth concedes on brief that the contentions that Harris was still in the local jail in Harris\u2019s motion to reconsider the sentence and his response to the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction were not disputed by the prosecutor, and were a proper proffer in light of <em>Whittaker. </em>The Commonwealth then stated that the trial court had jurisdiction to consider Harris\u2019s motions on both August 18, 2009 and November 10, 2009. However, the Commonwealth did not concede that these facts support the conclusion that the trial court still had jurisdiction on December 4, 2009.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\">. Since the record is silent as to whether Harris has since been transferred to a receiving unit of the Department of Corrections, we do not consider whether Harris\u2019s motion to reconsider is now moot, thus rendering any error harmless as a matter of law and remand for the trial court to make that determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b265-16\">. The only evidence in the record of circumstances in mitigation was the acceptance letter from Victory Gospel Chapel that the appellant attached to his motion for reconsideration of sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
