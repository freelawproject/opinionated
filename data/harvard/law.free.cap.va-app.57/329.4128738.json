Powell argues on appeal the court should have suppressed the evidence of his guilt because it was obtained during an unlawful search and seizure. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">When reviewing a denial of a suppression motion, we review the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Glenn v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 413, 416, 642 S.E.2d 282, 283 (2007) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>275 Va. 123, 654 S.E.2d 910 (2008). This standard requires us to \u201cgive due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Malbrough v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 163, 169, 655 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2008) (citation omitted). In doing so, we \u201cconsider facts presented both at the suppression hearing and at trial.\u201d <em>Testa v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>55 Va.App. 275, 279, 685 S.E.2d 213, 215 (2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">One evening in 2008, a police officer with the Danville Police Department conducted surveillance of a suspected drug distribution hub at a home on Twin Oaks Lane in Danville. At the time, the officer had eleven years of law enforcement experience and had conducted over fifty investigations involving crack cocaine. The officer testified the home was a known \u201cdrug house\u201d and he had received \u201cnumerous intelligence\u201d reports that drug sales were ongoing. The officer had also participated in three prior warrant searches of the home for distribution of cocaine. Cocaine was seized during two of those searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Powell drove a vehicle out of the driveway of the drug house, almost hitting the officer\u2019s unmarked vehicle in the process, and sped away. The officer followed. Powell exceeded eighty miles per hour, apparently unaware an unmarked police car was following him.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Powell pulled over to the side of the road in an area near some dumpsters. About ten seconds later, another vehicle pulled alongside Powell\u2019s. Both open driver-side windows faced each other. Watching through binoculars, the officer saw Powell and the driver of the other vehicle engage in a hand-to-hand transaction. The officer testified he saw Powell give the other driver a small item that the officer, based upon his training and experience, believed to be consistent with \u201ca dime or twenty rock\u201d of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Immediately afterwards Powell made a \u201cwiping motion with his thumb across the other fingers\u201d that the officer interpreted to be an effort to wipe off \u201cthe crumbs of crack cocaine which is a real tacky.\u201d The other vehicle left. The officer testified the two vehicles were adjacent to each other for thirty seconds \u201cat the most.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">With the assistance of a marked patrol car, the officer stopped Powell\u2019s vehicle just moments after he left the dumpster area. The officer arrested Powell and searched both his person and his vehicle. On Powell, the officer found marijua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>na and $478 in cash. In Powell\u2019s vehicle, the officer found a .45 caliber handgun, a bag of crack cocaine, a digital scale, and smaller plastic baggies used for packaging. Powell was the only occupant of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Prior to trial, Powell moved to suppress this incriminating evidence arguing the officer lacked probable cause to arrest him and search the vehicle. The trial court denied the motion, conducted a bench trial, and found Powell guilty on all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">On appeal, Powell asserts the officer did not have probable cause to arrest or search him. Powell also claims the officer unlawfully searched his vehicle. We disagree with both assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">As we recently observed, the \u201cvery phrase \u2018probable cause\u2019 confirms that the Fourth Amendment does not demand all possible precision.\u201d <em>Joyce v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 646, 658, 696 S.E.2d 237, 243 (2010) (quoting <em>Herring v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 695, 699, 172 L.Ed.2d 496 (2009)). Courts employ a \u201ccommon sense approach\u201d not a \u201chypertechnical, rigid, and legalistic analysis\u201d when reviewing probable cause determinations. <em>Derr v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 413, 421, 410 S.E.2d 662, 666 (1991). The standard is not calibrated to \u201cdeal with hard certainties, but with probabilities.\u201d <em>Slayton v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 101, 106, 582 S.E.2d 448, 450 (2003) (citation omitted). Nor does it \u201cdemand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false.\u201d <em>Joyce, </em>56 Va.App. at 659, 696 S.E.2d at 243 (quoting <em>Slayton, </em>41 Va.App. at 106, 582 S.E.2d at 450).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Consequently, \u201c[f]inely tuned standards such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance of the evidence, useful in formal trials, have no place in the probable-cause decision.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Pringle, </em>540 U.S. 366, 371, 124 S.Ct. 795, 800, 157 L.Ed.2d 769 (2003) (citation and internal brackets omitted). Not even a \u201cprima facie showing\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>criminality is required. <em>Joyce, </em>56 Va.App. at 659, 696 S.E.2d at 243 (quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 235, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2330, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)). Instead, probable cause \u201crequires <em>only </em>a probability or substantial chance of criminal activity, not an actual showing of such activity.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 245 n. 13, 103 S.Ct. at 2335 n. 13 (emphasis added). \u201cThe Constitution,\u201d after all, \u201cdoes not guarantee that only the guilty will be arrested.\u201d <em>Joyce, </em>56 Va.App. at 659, 696 S.E.2d at 243 (quoting <em>Baker v. McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 145, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 2695, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u201cThe substance of all the definitions of probable cause is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt. And this means less than evidence which would justify condemnation or conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Slayton, </em>41 Va.App. at 107, 582 S.E.2d at 451). \u201cIn other words, even though probable cause means more than a \u2018mere suspicion,\u2019 it is not necessary for the facts to be \u2018sufficient to convict\u2019 the accused of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660, 696 S.E.2d at 243. \u201cUnlike a factfinder at trial,\u201d therefore, \u201creasonable law officers need not resolve every doubt about a suspect\u2019s guilt before probable cause is established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Consistent with these principles, probable cause supported the officer\u2019s decision to arrest Powell for a suspected drug offense. Powell left a known \u201cdrug house\u201d \u2014 where the officer had previously conducted multiple warrant searches yielding drugs, and where \u201cnumerous intelligence\u201d reports had confirmed ongoing drug activity \u2014 and raced to an obviously prearranged meeting with another vehicle on the side of the road by a dumpster.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Powell and the driver of the other vehicle engaged in a hand-to-hand transaction which the officer believed to be consistent with \u201ca dime or twenty rock\u201d of cocaine. The officer then saw Powell make a \u201cwiping motion with his thumb across the other fingers\u201d that the officer interpreted as an effort to wipe off \u201cthe crumbs of crack cocaine which is a real tacky.\u201d The vehicles were together no more than thirty seconds. In their totality, these facts demonstrate the officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>had probable cause to believe he had just witnessed a drug transaction, and thus, had the authority to arrest Powell and search him incident to that arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Powell argues <em>Ross v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 103, 542 S.E.2d 819 (2001), precludes a finding of probable cause under the circumstances of this case. We disagree. In <em>Ross, </em>a deputy sheriff saw what he believed to be a hand-to-hand drug transaction in a high-crime area. He did not observe the drugs directly, but saw what appeared to be an exchange of money for an unknown item in a plastic bag. We held the officer <em>had </em>probable cause to arrest and search Ross because the exchange took place in a high-crime area, the encounter was very brief, and money and plastic bags (with items in them) are often exchanged during drug transactions. <em>Id. </em>at 107-08, 542 S.E.2d at 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u201cStanding alone,\u201d <em>Ross </em>explained, the mere exchange of an unknown item for money would not by itself be a fact justifying probable cause to arrest for a drug transaction. <em>Id. </em>at 107, 542 S.E.2d at 821. Clarifying the point further, <em>Ross </em>cited with approval various cases in which such an exchange coupled with <em>additional </em>circumstances established probable cause to arrest. These examples included cases where an officer saw \u201ca corner of a plastic baggie\u201d which the defendant later \u201cattempted to hide\u201d from the officer;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or saw a \u201cglassine envelope\u201d often used to package heroin;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or witnessed an individual in a \u201cknown drug area\u201d after being signaled by a person in a parked car \u201cput his head and one hand in the vehicle for a few seconds\u201d and make an exchange of unknown objects;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or saw an individual in a \u201cdrug-prone area\u201d conduct a hand-to-hand exchange and then \u201chide a plastic bag immedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>ately after the exchange.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\"><em>Ross </em>also made clear the \u201cfact that [the officer] did not see and could not identify the item that Ross removed from the baggie does not preclude a finding of probable cause under these circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108, 542 S.E.2d at 821. This was true even though the officer \u201chad no drug training and had never served on a drug task force\u201d and had made only six drug-related arrests in his five-and-a-half-year career as a police officer. <em>Id. </em>at 109, 542 S.E.2d at 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">For these reasons, <em>Ross </em>fully supports the conclusion that the officer in this case had probable cause to believe Powell had engaged in a hand-to-hand drug transaction \u2014 thus authorizing the officer to arrest Powell. <em>See generally Atwater v. Lago Vista, </em>532 U.S. 318, 354, 121 S.Ct. 1536, 1557-58, 149 L.Ed.2d 549 (2001) (recognizing the Fourth Amendment permits a warrantless arrest of a suspect who has committed a criminal offense in the officer\u2019s presence). It necessarily follows the officer also had authority \u201cto search the suspect in order to safeguard evidence and ensure [his] own safety.\u201d <em>Virginia v. Moore, </em>553 U.S. 164,178, 128 S.Ct. 1598,1608,170 L.Ed.2d 559 (2008), <em>rev\u2019g, </em>272 Va. 717, 636 S.E.2d 395 (2006). Because a legally justifiable arrest is itself a \u201creasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment,\u201d any contemporaneous \u201csearch incident to the arrest requires no additional justification.\u201d <em>Joyce, </em>56 Va.App. at 657, 696 S.E.2d at 242 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The officer\u2019s search authority also extended to Powell\u2019s vehicle. In <em>Arizona v. Gant, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>1710, 1719, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009), the United States Supreme Court held a vehicle can be searched when it is \u201creasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle.\u201d <em>See generally Armstead v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 569, 576, 695 S.E.2d 561, 564 (2010). As the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">Presumably, the \u201creasonable to believe\u201d standard requires less than probable cause, because otherwise <em>Gant\u2019s </em>evidentiary rationale would merely duplicate the \u201cautomobile exception,\u201d which the Court specifically identified as a distinct exception to the warrant requirement. Rather, the \u201creasonable to believe\u201d standard probably is akin to the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d standard required to justify a <em>Terry </em>search. Accordingly, the officer\u2019s assessment of the likelihood that there will be relevant evidence inside the car must be based on more than \u201ca mere hunch,\u201d but \u201cfalls considerably short of needing to satisfy a preponderance of the evidence standard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-6\"><em>United States v. Vinton, </em>594 F.3d 14, 25 (D.C.Cir.2010) (brackets and internal citations omitted) (relying in part on <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 274, 122 S.Ct. 744, 751, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Applying <em>Gant, </em>we hold it was reasonable for the arresting officer to believe Powell\u2019s vehicle contained evidence related to the suspected drug transaction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court, therefore, did not err in denying Powell\u2019s motion to suppress the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>dence found in his vehicle, including a .45 caliber handgun, bag of crack cocaine, digital scale, and plastic baggies.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The trial court correctly denied Powell\u2019s motion to suppress. We thus affirm his convictions for possession of cocaine, possession of a firearm while in possession of cocaine, possession of a concealed weapon, and possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\">. <em>Ross, </em>35 Va.App. at 108, 542 S.E.2d at 821 (citing <em>In re J.D.R., </em>637 A.2d 849 (D.C.1994)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-8\">. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>People v.
