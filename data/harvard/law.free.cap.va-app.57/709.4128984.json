We also conclude that Horne is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees in defending Counts 2 and 3, which the circuit court denied when it erroneously affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. We further conclude, however, that Horne is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees as to Counts 1 and 4, as those counts were not the subject of an appeal to the circuit court; we thus affirm the circuit court as to that ruling. Accordingly, we remand this case to the circuit court for a determination of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded to Horne on Counts 2 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Kris and Jessica Shreve, the prospective buyers (\u201cbuyers\u201d), and Jerry Hawkins, the prospective seller (\u201cseller\u201d), entered into negotiations over the sale of certain residential property located in Pounding Mill, Virginia. Horne, as a real estate agent with Coldwell Banker Security Real Estate, Inc. (\u201cCold-well Banker\u201d), represented the buyers, and Vicki England, as a real estate agent with Century 21 Prime Properties, represented the seller. After a number of offers and counter-offers were made between the buyers and the seller through their respective agents, Horne and England, the parties \u201cratified\u201d a sales contract for the property on July 12, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The contract provided, <em>inter alia, </em>the following: (i) \u201cupon ratification\u201d of the contract the buyers were to pay to Coldwell Banker an earnest money deposit in the sum of $100; (ii) the buyers were to provide the seller with a \u201cpre-approval letter from [the] lending institution of [buyers\u2019] choice, within 10 business days from date of acceptance of contract,\u201d or the contract would be in \u201cdefault at the option of the [seller]\u201d and the earnest money deposit would be \u201cforfeited to the [seller]\u201d; (iii) the contract was contingent upon the buyers obtaining financing from their lending institution for the purchase of the property; and (iv) in the event the loan to the buyers was not approved the contract could be \u201ccancelled by the buyer(s),\u201d and the buyers would thereby be entitled to return of the earnest money deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">On July 16, 2007, Horne sent to England a facsimile stating that the buyer, Kris Shreve, \u201cis working with Tim at New Peoples Bank who is on vacation until the 23rd of this month; he will not have the [pre-approval] letter until Tim returns.\u201d Horne also called England on July 16th and 18th and advised that Shreve had not yet delivered the earnest money deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">After failing to keep appointments with Horne on July 16th and July 18th for delivery of the earnest money deposit, Shreve called Horne on July 19th (the fifth business day following ratification of the contract) and explained that the bank had denied his loan request and that he therefore wished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>to cancel the sales contract. On the same day, Horne sent to England a facsimile stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-4\">[Shreve] ... did not provide me with an earnest money deposit last night as agreed. He did call me this afternoon to tell me that he had spoken with another loan officer at New Peoples Bank who told him he would have to come up with 20% of the total loan to bring to closing. He has informed me that he will not be able to provide 20% of the funding, and as of today he no longer wishes to proceed with the offer to purchase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">On July 26th, England requested that Horne provide to her, among other things, a letter from the buyers\u2019 bank stating that it had denied financing to the buyers and a \u201csigned release of contract noting that escrow monies were not received.\u201d Horne provided those documents to England on the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The seller subsequently filed a complaint against Horne with the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation (\u201cDepartment\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in regard to her conduct in representing the buyers. Following the Department\u2019s investigation, the Department prepared a report of findings dated September 22, 2008, outlining four counts of Horne\u2019s alleged violations of the Board\u2019s regulations. The Department then held an \u201cinformal fact-finding conference\u201d on July 29, 2009. Board member Sharon Johnson conducted the hearing in which she received documentary evidence from both the Department and Horne, and heard Horne\u2019s testimony. On August 19, 2009, Johnson issued her written recommendations to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">For Counts 1 and 4, Johnson recommended that \u201cthe file be closed\u201d based on her findings that Horne had not violated 18 VAC 135-20-300(6) or 18 VAC 135-20-180(B)(l)(a), as charged in those counts, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>As to Count 2, Johnson concluded Horne had violated 18 VAC 135-20-310(2), as charged, based on her finding that Horne failed to provide written notice to England in a timely manner that the buyers had not paid the earnest money deposit as required by the sales contract. For this alleged violation, Johnson recommended that a penalty of $500 be imposed and that Horne\u2019s license be placed on probation until she completed four hours of specified continuing education.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">As to Count 3, Johnson concluded Horne had violated 18 VAC 135-20-260(10), as charged, based on her finding that Horne did not produce a pre-approval letter from the buyers\u2019 bank within ten days as required by the contract. For this alleged violation, Johnson recommended that a penalty of $1,000 be imposed and that Horne\u2019s license be placed on probation until she completed three hours of specified continuing education.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">At a Board meeting on September 10, 2009, the Board voted to accept Johnson\u2019s recommendations and a final order of the Board to that effect was entered on the same day. Horne appealed the Board\u2019s order to the circuit court, challenging its decision as to both Counts 2 and 3, and seeking an award of attorney\u2019s fees for her defense to all four counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">By final order dated May 21, 2010, the circuit court affirmed the Board\u2019s September 10, 2009 order \u201cin all respects\u201d and dismissed Horne\u2019s appeal. The court specifically found that there was \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d to support the Board\u2019s decision and that the Board\u2019s construction of its regulations was \u201cneither arbitrary nor capricious.\u201d Upon rejecting Horne\u2019s challenge to the Board\u2019s disposition of Counts 2 and 3, the court made no award of attorney\u2019s fees to Horne under Code \u00a7 2.2-4030 for her defense to the alleged violations. The court also rejected Horne\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees on Counts 1 and 4, explaining that, even though Horne succeeded before the Board in her defense against those alleged violations, those two counts \u201cwere not at issue before the [cjourt in this appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">The Virginia Admindstrative Process Act authorizes judicial review of agency decisions. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 2.2-4027. Under settled principles, the burden is upon the party appealing such a decision to demonstrate error. <em>Avante at Roanoke v. Finnerty, </em>56 Va.App. 190, 197, 692 S.E.2d 277, 280 (2010); <em>Carter v. Gordon, </em>28 Va.App. 133, 141, 502 S.E.2d 697, 700-01 (1998). \u201cOur review is limited to determining (1) \u2018[w]hether the agency acted in accordance with law;\u2019 (2) \u2018[wjhether the agency made a procedural error which was not harmless error;\u2019 and (3) \u2018[wjhether the agency had sufficient evidential support for its findings of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Avante at Roanoke, </em>56 Va.App. at 197, 692 S.E.2d at 280 (quoting <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 242, 369 S.E.2d 1, 7 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">On factual issues, the determination to be made by the reviewing court is \u201c \u201cwhether substantial evidence exists in the agency record to support the agency\u2019s decision. The reviewing court may reject the agency\u2019s findings only if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would necessarily come to a different conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>John Doe v. Virginia Bd. of Dentistry, </em>52 Va.App. 166, 175, 662 S.E.2d 99, 103 (2008) (quoting <em>Johnston-Willis, </em>6 Va.App. at 242, 369 S.E.2d at 7). <em>See Virginia Real Estate Comm\u2019n v. Bias, </em>226 Va. 264, 269, 308 S.E.2d 123, 125 (1983) (\u201cThe phrase \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 refers to \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 217, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938))).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Further, when reviewing claims of regulatory interpretive error in an administrative appeal, we are to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVb\">\u201cgive \u2018great deference\u2019 to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations.\u201d <em>Board of Supervisors v. State Bldg. Code Tech. Review Bd., </em>52 Va.App. 460, 466, 663 S.E.2d 571, 574 (2008). \u201cThis deference stems from Code \u00a7 2.2-4027, which requires that reviewing courts \u2018take due account\u2019 of the \u2018experience and specialized competence of the agency\u2019 promulgating the regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Real Estate Bd. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number><em>Clay, </em>9 Va.App. 152, 160-61, 384 S.E.2d 622, 627 (1989)). However, \u201c \u2018deference is not abdication, and it requires us to accept only those principles of agency interpretations that are reasonable in light of the principles of construction courts normally employ.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., </em>499 U.S. 244, 260, 111 S.Ct. 1227 [1237], 113 L.Ed.2d 274 (1991)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><em>Avante at Roanoke, </em>56 Va.App. at 197, 692 S.E.2d at 280; <em>see also Appalachian Voices v. State Air Pollution Control Bd., </em>56 Va.App. 282, 293 n. 2, 693 S.E.2d 295, 300 n. 2 (2010) (\u201c[A]n agency\u2019s interpretation [of its own regulations] must be given controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Avalon Assisted Living Facilities v.

Wescott, </em>254 Va. 218, 224, 492 S.E.2d 146, 150 (1997)); <em>see Clay, </em>9 Va.App. at 161, 384 S.E.2d at 627 (explaining that courts may reverse an administrative agency\u2019s construction of its own regulation if that construction is \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d (citing <em>Johnston-Willis, </em>6 Va.App. at 244, 369 S.E.2d at 8)).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">A. <em>Count %</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Under Count 2, the Board found that Horne violated 18 VAC 135-20-310(2), which provides: \u201cActions constituting improper delivery of instruments include: ... Failing to provide in a timely manner to all principals to the transaction written notice of any material changes to the transaction.\u201d The Board based this finding on Horne\u2019s alleged failure to provide timely written notice to the seller\u2019s agent, England, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>that the buyers had failed to deliver the earnest money deposit of $100 to Coldwell Banker \u201cupon ratification\u201d of the sales contract, as was required of the buyers under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Challenging this determination, Horne argues that 18 VAC 135-20-310(2) is inapplicable because the failure of the buyers to deliver the earnest money deposit was not a \u201cmaterial change[] to the transaction\u201d between the buyers and the seller in light of the insignificant amount of the deposit in comparison to the purchase price of $145,000 for the subject property. 18 VAC 135-20-310(2). That is, the deposit represented less that 7/100ths of one percent of the purchase price. In the alternative, Horne argues that she nevertheless gave England timely written notice of the buyers\u2019 non-payment of the earnest money deposit, as required under the regulation, by way of her July 19, 2007 facsimile to England, which specifically stated that \u201c[Shreve] ... did not provide me with an earnest money deposit last night as agreed.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Assuming -without deciding that the buyers\u2019 non-payment of the earnest money deposit after ratification of the sales contract was a \u201cmaterial change\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to the transaction within the meaning of 18 VAC 135-20-310(2), we agree -with Horne that her July 19, 2007 facsimile to England constituted timely written notice of that development under this regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">As a threshold matter, the Board concedes that Horne\u2019s July 19, 2007 facsimile to England constituted a written notice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We thus turn to the question of whether the notice was \u201ctimely.\u201d 18 VAC 135-20-310(2). Because 18 VAC 135-20-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>310(2) does not define the term \u201ctimely,\u201d the Board points to another one of its regulations, 18 VAC 135-20-180(B)(l)(a), for guidance in defining the term. The latter regulation provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">Upon the ratification of a contract, earnest money deposits and down payments received by the principal broker or supervising broker or his associates must be placed in an escrow account by the end of the fifth business banking day following ratification, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties to the transaction....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">18 VAC 135-20-180(B)(l)(a). Based on this regulation, the Board reasonably concludes, in interpreting its own regulations, that a real estate agent\u2019s written notification of nonpayment of an earnest money deposit due \u201cupon ratification\u201d of the sales contract would be timely under 18 VAC 135-20-310(2) if given within five business days of the date of ratification, i.e., the same time frame given for placing the deposit in escrow under 18 VAC 135-20-180(B)(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">That is precisely what occurred in this case when Horne gave written notification to England on July 19, 2007 \u2014 the fifth business day after ratification of the sales contract between the buyers and the seller \u2014 and specifically stated that she had not received the buyers\u2019 earnest money deposit. Recognizing this fact, the Board, in an attempt to defend its position, challenges the substance of Horne\u2019s notification by asserting in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-8\">Although on the fifth business day after ratification, Horne sent a fax to the listing agent stating that \u201cThe purchaser ... did not provide me with an earnest money deposit last night as agreed,\u201d <em>Home does not in that fax specify what the new status of the [earnest money deposit] will be at the end of that day nor suggest any amended language to insert into the contract.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">(Emphasis added.) The obvious fallacy in this assertion is that 18 VAC 135-20-310(2) requires only that the real estate agent give timely written notice of a material <em>change </em>to the transaction \u2014 not some notice of the agent\u2019s speculation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>what the status of that change might be at some future point in time, nor notice of the agent\u2019s suggestion as to how the parties should respond to that material change through some amendment to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">We thus conclude the Board\u2019s finding that Horne violated 18 VAC 135-20-310(2) under Count 2 was based on an arbitrary and capricious construction of the regulation, and insufficient evidence to support the finding. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court in affirming the Board\u2019s decision on Count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">B. <em>Count 3</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Under Count 3, the Board found that Horne violated 18 VAC 135-20-260(10), which provides: \u201cActions constituting unworthy and incompetent conduct include: ... Failing to act as a real estate broker or salesperson in such a manner as to safeguard the interests of the public.\u201d Here, the contract required that the buyers provide to the seller a pre-approval letter from the buyers\u2019 bank within ten business days from the date the sales contract was ratified. Otherwise, the contract was subject to default at the option of the seller, and, upon such default, the buyers\u2019 earnest money deposit would be forfeited. According to the Board, because Horne had not yet sent a pre-approval letter to England by July 26, 2007, which was the tenth business day following ratification of the contract, the seller\u2019s optional default provision was \u201ctriggered],\u201d and thus, the Board concluded, Horne failed to \u201ctake reasonable steps necessary to safeguard her clients\u2019 interest,\u201d in violation of 18 VAC 135-20-260(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Horne argues the Board\u2019s finding that she violated 18 VAC 135-20-260(10) by her failure to provide to England a preapproval letter from the buyers\u2019 bank within ten business days of ratification of the contract is without merit. Given the reasons Horne did not provide the letter to England, Horne argues there was no basis for the Board\u2019s conclusion that she was remiss in \u201csafeguarding\u201d the buyers\u2019 interest relative to the consequences of non-production of the letter, such as would constitute a violation of the regulation. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>On the fifth business day following ratification of the sales contract \u2014 i.e., six days before the pre-approval letter was due \u2014 the buyers communicated to Horne, and Horne communicated to England by her July 19, 2007 facsimile to England, (i) that the buyers were unable to obtain financing from their bank for the purchase, and (ii) that the buyers were therefore exercising their right to cancel the contract. Furthermore, Horne had already advised England by a facsimile sent on July 16, 2007 that the buyers would not have a pre-approval letter until their banker, \u201cTim at New Peoples Bank,\u201d returned from vacation on the 23rd of that month. Horne thus had no pre-approval letter to provide to England before the buyers\u2019 cancellation on July 19, 2007; that cancellation necessarily terminated what would have been the buyers\u2019 obligation to produce the letter on July 26th, or risk having the contract declared in default by the seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">In any event, there was no indication that Horne failed to \u201ctake reasonable steps to safeguard\u201d the buyers against such default in connection with production of the pre-approval letter from the buyers\u2019 bank. Indeed, the evidence indicated that Horne had no control over the production of the letter, and she obviously could not produce what did not exist. In this context, the obligation of the realtor to \u201csafeguard\u201d her client\u2019s interests, pursuant to 18 VAC 135-20-260(10), cannot mean she is strictly liable for some contractual risk to her clients that was beyond her control and that did not, in fact, materialize. That would be the result, however, under the Board\u2019s application of the regulation to the facts of this case if its decision were to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Thus, like with Count 2, we conclude the Board\u2019s finding that Horne violated 18 VAC 135-20-260(10) under Count 3 was based on an arbitrary and capricious interpretation of the regulation and insufficient evidence to support the finding. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court in affirming the Board\u2019s decision on Count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"Apxq\">C. <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees under Code \u00a7 2.2-4030</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Horne seeks an award of attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A) on all four counts initiated against her by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Department. We conclude that she is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under the statute on Counts 1 and 4, but that she is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees on Counts 2 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A) provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">In any civil case brought under Article 5 (\u00a7 2.2-4025 et seq.) of this chapter ... in which any person contests any agency action, such person shall be entitled to recover from that agency ... reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees if such person substantially prevails on the merits of the case and the agency\u2019s position is not substantially justified, unless special circumstances would make an award unjust. The award of attorneys\u2019 fees shall not exceed $25,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.2-4025 through -4029, in turn, address the statutory framework for judicial review of agency actions instituted in \u201ccourts of original jurisdiction,\u201d and the appeal of the judgments of those courts to \u201chigher courts as in other cases.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-4026.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">In instituting this \u201ccivil case\u201d in circuit court, Horne did not \u201ccontest\u201d the Board\u2019s findings on Counts 1 and 4 because the Board had already dismissed the alleged violations under those two counts. Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A). Thus, as Horne does not meet the threshold requirement of Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A) on Counts 1 and 4, we are without authority to consider awarding her attorney\u2019s fees under the statute for her defense to those counts before the Board. Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court in denying Horne\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees on those two counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">As to Counts 2 and 3, which Horne has contested in this case, the issues under Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A) for determining Home\u2019s entitlement to an award of attorney\u2019s fees on these counts are: (1) whether she has \u201csubstantially prevailed] on the merits of [this] case,\u201d (2) whether the \u201cagency\u2019s position is not substantially justified,\u201d and (3) whether \u201cspecial circumstances would make an award unjust.\u201d <em>See Hollowell v. Virginia Marine Res. Comm\u2019n, </em>56 Va.App. 70, 82-91, 691 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>S.E.2d 500, 506-11 (2010) (applying \u201cthe statute\u2019s three-part test\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">First, in light of our rulings above on Counts 2 and 3 in favor of Horne, she has clearly \u201csubstantially prevailed] on the merits\u201d in this case. <em>See id. </em>at 86, 691 S.E.2d at 508 (a party has \u201c \u2018substantially prevailed on the merits\u2019 of his action\u201d under Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A) if he has \u201cobtain[ed] a judgment in his favor on a significant issue in dispute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Second, because of the Board\u2019s arbitrary and capricious construction of its regulations in making its findings under Counts 2 and 3, coupled with the absence of evidence to support those findings, we conclude that the Board\u2019s position as to each of those counts was \u201cunreasonable, and thus not substantially justified, as a matter of law,\u201d under the second prong of the Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A) three-part test. <em>Id. </em>at 88, 691 S.E.2d at 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Finally, under the third prong of the statute\u2019s three-part test, the Board has presented no purported \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d for consideration that would make an award of attorney\u2019s fees to Horne \u201cunjust.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A). Nor did the circuit court find any such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">We therefore remand this case to the circuit court for a determination of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded to Horne on Counts 2 and 3. As explained in <em>Hollowell, </em>\u201cCode \u00a7 2.2-4030(A) mandates that attorney\u2019s fees \u2018shall\u2019 be awarded where the requirements of the three-part test are met. The actual amount of an award of fees under Code \u00a7 2.2-4030(A) remains, of course, within the \u2018broad discretion afforded to the trial court ... based upon what is reasonable and just.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hollowell, </em>56 Va.App. at 83, 691 S.E.2d at 507 (quoting <em>Department of Med.
