Holloway (\u201cappellant\u201d) was convicted, in a bench trial, of possession with intent to distribute an imitation controlled substance, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(G), and assault and battery of a law enforcement officer, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-57. On a rehearing, a divided panel reversed the possession with the intent to distribute conviction, but affirmed the conviction for assault and battery of a law enforcement officer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Holloway v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 667, 696 S.E.2d 247 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>and stayed the mandate of the panel\u2019s decision. On rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we now lift the stay and conclude the evidence was sufficient to prove an intent to distribute. We affirm appellant\u2019s conviction on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">On the evening of August 19, 2006, Portsmouth police responded to a residence and observed appellant standing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>the porch. They also observed another male standing in front of the porch. As the police pulled up to the residence, the second male began walking to the street. He was not apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The police observed appellant making a \u201cpitching motion\u201d with his left hand toward the front door. The officer was unable to determine what appellant threw. Appellant was ordered to the ground. As one officer advanced toward the house, he observed a plastic bag (\u201ccorner baggie\u201d) resting on the porch, in the area of appellant\u2019s \u201cpitching motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Approximately fifteen to thirty seconds elapsed between the time appellant moved his arm and Officer Riddle\u2019s observation of the corner baggie. The corner baggie contained three smaller corner baggies, each holding what appeared to be $20 worth of crack cocaine. Testing later revealed the substance was not crack cocaine, but an imitation substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">During the officers\u2019 interaction with appellant, no one else entered the porch area. The officers did not find any scales, packaging materials, or ingestion devices, either around the porch or on appellant\u2019s person. Officer Riddle testified that appellant did not have any money on his person, or if he did, it was \u201ca minimal amount, not worth recovering.\u201d Appellant was arrested that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">At trial, Detective K. Gavin qualified, without objection, as an expert in the use, packaging, and distribution of narcotics. He testified that possession of three individually wrapped rocks of an imitation controlled substance, without possession of a smoking device, is inconsistent with personal use. He stated, \u201c[Tjhere is no reason to possess an imitation controlled substance unless [an individual was] either ripped off or ... possessed it to distribute.\u201d Detective Gavin dismissed the possibility that an individual would unknowingly purchase crack cocaine in three individually wrapped baggies apparently worth $20 each, because \u201c[i]t is not cost effective for a user to purchase three twenty-dollar rocks individually, packaged that way, for sixty dollars. They could get a lot more crack if they purchase[d] it in a larger quantity.\u201d Detective Gavin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>opined that a regular cocaine user would know that purchasing three twenty-dollar packages of crack cocaine was not cost effective and that a \u201cnew cocaine user ... wouldn\u2019t have been purchasing three rocks at the same time. That\u2019s a lot more than a new cocaine user would attempt.\u201d However, when asked whether \u201call cocaine users, everyone who buys crack, shops around for the best deal, like Wal-Mart [sic],\u201d Detective Gavin conceded that he could confirm only \u201cthat is what ... most ... users do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Detective Gavin acknowledged that an individual may not carry a crack pipe or other ingestion device on their person if they bought the crack cocaine for later use; however, he stated that \u201cnormal user[s]\u201d \u201cmaintain a stem or crack pipe on their person when they purchase crack cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The trial court found appellant guilty of possession with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled substance. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">A. Standard of Appellate Review</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">On appeal, \u201cwe review the evidence in the \u2018light most favorable\u2019 to the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Pryor v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 1, 4, 628 S.E.2d 47, 48 (2006) (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003)). \u201cViewing the record through this evidentiary prism requires us to \u2018discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cooper v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 558, 562, 680 S.E.2d 361, 363 (2009) (quoting <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">We examine a trial court\u2019s factfinding \u201cwith the highest degree of appellate deference.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 605, 608, 633 S.E.2d 229, 231 (2006). An appellate court does not \u201cask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 190, 193, 677 S.E.2d 280, 282 (2009) (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). Instead, the only \u201crelevant question is, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, whether <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 672, 676, 701 S.E.2d 61, 63 (2010) (citing <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789). We are \u201cnot permitted to reweigh the evidence,\u201d <em>Nusbaum v. Berlin, </em>273 Va. 385, 408, 641 S.E.2d 494, 507 (2007), because appellate courts have no authority \u201cto preside <em>de novo </em>over a second trial,\u201d <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 11, 602 S.E.2d 402, 407 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">This deferential standard \u201capplies not only to the historical facts themselves, but the inferences from those facts as well.\u201d <em>Clanton v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 561, 566, 673 S.E.2d 904, 907 (2009) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted); <em>see also Sullivan, </em>280 Va. at 676, 701 S.E.2d at 63-64. Thus, a factfinder may \u201cdraw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts,\u201d <em>Haskins, </em>44 Va.App. at 10, 602 S.E.2d at 406 (citation omitted), unless doing so would push \u201cinto the realm of <em>non sequitur,\u201d Thomas, </em>48 Va.App. at 608, 633 S.E.2d at 231 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">In a bench trial, a trial judge\u2019s \u201cmajor role is the determination of fact, and with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise.\u201d <em>Haskins, </em>44 Va.App. at 11, 602 S.E.2d at 407 (citation omitted). Consequently, \u201cwe do not substitute our judgment for that of the fact finder,\u201d <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 94, 105, 688 S.E.2d 168, 175 (2010), \u201ceven if our opinion were to differ,\u201d <em>Ferguson v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 427, 435, 658 S.E.2d 692, 696 (2008) <em>(en </em>banc). \u201cIf reasonable jurists could disagree about the probative force of the facts, we have no authority to substitute our views for those of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 180,186, 571 S.E.2d 906, 909 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>B. Sufficiency \u2014 Intent to Distribute</p>\n<p id=\"A7p\">Appellant argues that the evidence is insufficient to prove that he had the intent to distribute<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant essentially contends the evidence gives rise to 3 reasonable hypothesis of innocence, namely that he possessed the imitation crack cocaine for personal use. Correctly observing the entire proof of \u201cintent to distribute\u201d is based on Detective Gavin\u2019s testimony, appellant contends that Gavin\u2019s testimony was ambiguous at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">\u201cWhere an offense consists of an act combined with a particular intent, proof of the intent is essential to the conviction.\u201d <em>Servis v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 507, 524, 371 S.E.2d 156, 165 (1988). \u201cBecause direct proof of intent [to distribute drugs, or imitation drugs] is often impossible, it must be shown by circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cCircumstantial evidence is as competent and is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence, provided it is sufficiently convincing to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 31, 53, 307 S.E.2d 864, 876 (1983). Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">[i]n considering an appellant\u2019s alternate hypothesis of innocence in a circumstantial evidence case, we must determine \u201cnot whether there is some evidence to support\u201d the appellant\u2019s hypothesis of innocence, but, rather, \u201cwhether a reasonable [fact finder], upon consideration of all the evidence, could have rejected [the appellant\u2019s] theories in his defense and found him guilty of [the charged crime] beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>[Commonwealth] v. [Hudson </em>], 265 Va. 505, 513, 578 S.E.2d 781, 785 (2003) (internal quotations omitted). Additionally, \u201ccircumstantial evidence is not viewed in isolation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514, 578 S.E.2d at 786. \u201c \u2018While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>no single piece of evidence may be sufficient, the \u201ccombined force of many concurrent and related circumstances, each insufficient in itself, may lead a reasonable mind irresistibly to a conclusion.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Derr v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 413, 425, 410 S.E.2d 662, 669 (1991) (quoting <em>Stamper v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 273, 257 S.E.2d 808, 818 (1979) (quoting <em>Karnes v. Commonwealth, </em>125 Va. 758, 764, 99 S.E. 562, 564 (1919))). \u201cWhether an alternate hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is a question of fact and, therefore, is binding on appeal unless plainly wrong.\u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 12-13, 492 S.E.2d 826, 832 (1997).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-5\"><em>Emerson v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 263, 277, 597 S.E.2d 242, 249 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Absent a direct admission by the defendant, intent to distribute must necessarily be proved by circumstantial evidence. <em>See Hunter v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 569, 570, 193 S.E.2d 779, 780 (1973). Virginia courts have considered a number of factors alone and in combination when determining if an intent to distribute exists: 1) packaging <em>(see McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 483, 545 S.E.2d 541 (2001) (holding that cocaine packaged in two individually wrapped blocks in a single plastic bag supported a finding of distribution)); 2) quantity <em>(see Early v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 219, 222, 391 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1990) (noting that if the quantity of drugs possessed is greater than that ordinarily possessed for personal use, that fact alone may be sufficient to prove intent; however, where the quantity is small, the fact finder may infer the drugs were intended for personal use)); 3) presence or absence of drug paraphernalia for personal use <em>(see Welshman v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 20, 37, 502 S.E.2d 122, 130 (1998) <em>(en </em>banc) (recognizing the absence of drug \u201cparaphernalia suggestive of personal use\u201d as evidence of an intent to distribute)); 4) expert testimony <em>(see Askew v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 104, 110, 578 S.E.2d 58, 61 (2003) (finding that expert testimony, such as from a police officer, is one factor to be considered by the fact finder in determining whether drugs were possessed with intent to distribute)); 5) a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>large amount of money <em>(see Servis, </em>6 Va.App. at 524, 371 S.E.2d at 165 (\u201cthe presence of an unusual amount of money, suggesting profit from sales, is another circumstance that negates an inference of possession for personal use\u201d)); and 6) paraphernalia consistent with distribution <em>(see Hambury v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 435, 438, 350 S.E.2d 524, 525 (1986) (\u201cthe presence of paraphernalia [e.g., scales, baggie corners, or razor blades] used in the packaging process\u201d is inconsistent with possession for personal use)).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The Commonwealth need not present evidence of each of the above factors; however, the totality of the circumstantial evidence must exclude the reasonable hypothesis of possession for personal use. <em>Compare Dukes v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 119, 122-23, 313 S.E.2d 382, 383-84 (1984) (possession of one-half ounce of marijuana packaged in three small envelopes, without drug paraphernalia or an unusual amount of money, is insufficient to convict a person of possession with intent to distribute), <em>with Askew, </em>40 Va.App. at 111, 578 S.E.2d at 62 (possession of $700 worth of crack cocaine, a pager, and $65 in small bills, coupled with the absence of an ingestion device, is inconsistent with personal use),' <em>and White v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 662, 668, 492 S.E.2d 451, 454 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (possession of a relatively small amount of cocaine, together with possession of a pager, an electronic scale, and $581 in small bills, supports a trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant possessed the cocaine with intent to distribute).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Here, the facts are not in dispute, nor is the credibility of Detective Gavin. The outcome of this case turns on the weight to be accorded the testimony of Detective Gavin, the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Gavin gave three reasons in support of his conclusion that appellant did not possess the substance for personal use: (1) no ingestion devices were found on his person, (2) the packaging was inconsistent with personal use, and (3) the substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>was imitation crack, not crack.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant maintains no evidence proves he knew the substance was an imitation drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Gavin\u2019s testimony, however, dismantled the hypothesis, and the sole defense theory of the case \u2014 that appellant believed he possessed real, not imitation, crack and had indeed been \u201cripped off.\u201d Gavin stated that if appellant was an experienced user he would have purchased crack in bulk rather than in three packages because he would have been able to obtain more of the substance. If, on the other hand, appellant was an inexperienced user, he would not have purchased that quantity of crack because \u201c[t]hat\u2019s a lot more than a new cocaine user would attempt.\u201d Therefore, be he experienced or be he inexperienced, it is unlikely that appellant would have purchased three packages of the substance, believing it to be crack.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">As a result, the hypothesis that appellant believed he purchased crack, not imitation crack, for personal use and was \u201cripped off\u2019 was undermined by Gavin\u2019s testimony. \u201cMerely because defendant\u2019s theory of the case differs from that taken by the Commonwealth does not mean that every reasonable hypothesis consistent with his innocence has not been excluded.\u201d <em>Miles v. Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 462, 467, 138 S.E.2d 22, 27 (1964). Consequently, since appellant was not \u201cripped off,\u201d the only remaining reasonable hypothesis is that he \u201cpossessed it to distribute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Appellant further argues that the evidence failed to exclude another reasonable hypothesis: that appellant purchased three packages of crack cocaine because a bulk quantity was not available at the time. However, the evidence does not support this suggestion, and again, the trial court rejected this theory. It is axiomatic that \u201cthe Commonwealth need only exclude reasonable hypotheses that <em>flow from the evidence </em>.... \u201d <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 751, 755, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>433 S.E.2d 27, 29 (1993) (emphasis added). It is not our task to engage in a game of \u201cwhat if,\u201d or to attempt to create theories that the evidence does not support. This Court should \u201cnot base its holdings on \u201cwhat ifs.\u2019\u201d <em>Newman v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 20, 845 A.2d 71, 99 (2002), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>384 Md. 285, 863 A.2d 321 (2004). Were we to do so there is no limit to the theories that may arise from an inventive mind\u2019s eye \u2014 e.g., what if appellant found the imitation crack or was merely holding it for the other man the police observed in the area?</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The absence of a smoking device is relevant in two respects. First, as noted above, the absence of a smoking device is evidence of an intent to distribute. Second, it is reasonable for the fact finder to conclude that since one cannot \u201csmoke\u201d an imitation drug, there was no need for appellant to possess a smoking device. Therefore, the fact finder could reasonably infer that appellant knew he possessed an imitation substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Appellant characterizes as ambiguous Gavin\u2019s testimony that \u201cmost\u201d users look for the best deal and would not buy three individual rocks for personal use. Gavin also testified \u201cnormal user[s]\u201d maintain some type of smoking device on their person. Thus, appellant contends, Gavin\u2019s equivocation allows for the reasonable hypothesis that he is not the \u201cnormal user\u201d by not being economical in his purchases nor \u201cnormal\u201d in not carrying an ingestion device.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">As fact finder, the trial court rejected this hypothesis of innocence. The trial court\u2019s decision foreclosed the possibility that appellant was merely a drug user, not a drug dealer. The rejection of a hypothesis of innocence \u201cis binding on appeal unless plainly wrong,\u201d <em>Archer, </em>26 Va.App. at 12-13, 492 S.E.2d at <em>832 </em>\u2014 even if there is \u201csome evidence to support\u201d the hypothesis of innocence, <em>Hudson, </em>265 Va. at 513, 578 S.E0000.2d at 785. The expert did not waver in his opinion that the circumstances surrounding appellant\u2019s possession of the imitation substance was inconsistent with personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Appellant relies on <em>Dukes, </em>227 Va. 119, 313 S.E.2d 382, to support his argument that lack of an ingestion device may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>only indicate an intent to smoke the crack at a later time, that a drug packaged for sale may be as consistent with personal use as with an intent to distribute, and that one may possess three pre-wrapped pieces for personal use because that was what was available for purchase. In <em>Dukes, </em>like in the instant case, no unusual amount of money was found and the quantity of drugs was relatively small.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Appellant correctly states the holding in <em>Dukes, </em>but one significant and deciding difference must be noted. In <em>Dukes, </em>unlike this case, there was no expert testimony interpreting the circumstances surrounding the possession of the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Here, the trial judge, sitting as fact finder, weighed Gavin\u2019s testimony. The trial judge found appellant guilty of the offense. This Court must give deference to the fact finder and, <em>a fortiori, </em>his assessment of Gavin\u2019s testimony. Giving proper deference to the fact finder compels us to conclude no reasonable hypothesis of innocence remains. Accordingly, we are unable to say that no \u201crational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789. Nor can we say that no \u201creasonable [fact finder] ... could have rejected [the appellant\u2019s] theor[y] in his defense____\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>265 Va. at 513, 578 S.E.2d at 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">We affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-15\">.

The majority also posits that \u201c[t]he outcome of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>this case turns on the weight to be accorded the testimony of Detective Gavin, the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In reaching this conclusion, the majority recognizes that the facts of this case are similar to those in <em>Dukes v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 119, 313 S.E.2d 382 (1984), in which the Supreme Court of Virginia held the evidence was <em>insufficient </em>to prove possession with intent to distribute. <em>Supra </em>at 667, 705 S.E.2d at 514. According to the majority, the presence of Gavin\u2019s expert testimony alone distinguishes <em>Dukes </em>from the instant case and provides the necessary evidence to determine that a \u201c \u2018rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Supra </em>at 670, 705 S.E.2d at 516 (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Preliminarily, I subscribe to the very measured analysis of the majority that if Detective Gavin had not testified, the evidence would have been insufficient to convict appellant of possession of an imitation controlled substance with the intent to distribute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In order to prove intent to distribute, the Commonwealth may rely on circumstantial evidence, so long as the evidence as a whole excludes every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. <em>See Emerson v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 263, 277, 597 S.E.2d 242, 249 (2004); <em>Servis v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 507, 524, 371 S.E.2d 156, 165 (1988). \u201c \u2018Whether an alternative hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is a question of fact and, therefore, is binding on appeal unless plainly wrong.\u2019\u201d <em>Emerson, </em>43 Va.App. at 277, 597 S.E.2d at 249 (quoting <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 12-13, 492 S.E.2d 826, 832 (1997)); <em>see also Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 9, 602 S.E.2d 402, 406 (2004) (holding that where the fact finder has rejected the hypothesis of innocence, \u201cthat determination cannot be overturned as arbitrary unless no rational factfinder would have come to that conclusion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>To convict an individual of intent to distribute a real or imitation substance, the circumstantial evidence must necessarily prove an intent to distribute the substance. <em>See Adkins v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 437, 439-40, 229 S.E.2d 869, 871 (1976) (citing <em>Hunter v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 569, 570, 193 S.E.2d 779, 780 (1973)). Virginia courts have considered a number of factors alone and in combination when determining if an intent to distribute exists. \u201cWhen the proof of intent to distribute ... rests upon circumstantial evidence, the quantity which the defendant possesse[d] is a circumstance to be considered.\u201d <em>Dukes, </em>227 Va. at 122, 313 S.E.2d at 383. If the quantity of drugs possessed is greater than that ordinarily possessed for personal use, that fact alone may be sufficient to prove intent; however, where the quantity is small, the fact finder may infer the drugs were intended for personal use. <em>Early v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 219, 222, 391 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1990) (citing <em>Dutton v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 762, 765, 263 S.E.2d 52, 54 (1980)); <em>see also Monroe v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 154, 156, 355 S.E.2d 336, 337 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In addition to the quantity of the controlled substance possessed, the Commonwealth may present other circumstances for the fact finder\u2019s consideration, such as the accused\u2019s conduct and statements. <em>Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 198, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989) (citing <em>Hargrave v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 436, 437, 201 S.E.2d 597, 598 (1974)). A trier of fact may also consider how the drugs were packaged. <em>Dukes, </em>227 Va. at 122-23, 313 S.E.2d at 383-84; <em>Monroe, 4 </em>Va.App. at 156, 355 S.E.2d at 337. \u201c \u2018However, even if the substance is packaged for distribution, there must be additional evidence to preclude the inference that it was purchased in the packaged form for personal use[,] rather than being held in that fashion for distribution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Servis, </em>6 Va.App. at 524, 371 S.E.2d at 165 (quoting <em>Monroe, 4 </em>Va.App. at 156, 355 S.E.2d at 337); <em>accord Dukes, </em>227 Va. at 123, 313 S.E.2d at 384. For example, \u201c \u2018the presence of a large, or bulk, quantity from which smaller packages may have been made up for distribution\u2019 \u201d may preclude the inference that the defendant possessed the illegal substance for personal use. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number><em>Servis, </em>6 Va.App. at 524, 371 S.E.2d at 165 (quoting <em>Monroe, </em>4 Va.App. at 156-57, 355 S.E.2d at 337). Likewise, \u201cthe presence of paraphernalia used in the packaging process,\u201d such as scales, baggie corners, or razor blades, is inconsistent with possession for personal use. <em>Hamburg v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 435, 438, 350 S.E.2d 524, 525 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">\u201cThe presence of an unusual amount of money, suggesting profit from sales, is another circumstance that negates an inference of possession for personal use.\u201d <em>Servis, </em>6 Va.App. at 524, 371 S.E.2d at 165 (citing <em>Colbert v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 1, 4, 244 S.E.2d 748, 749 (1978); <em>Dukes, </em>227 Va. at 123, 313 S.E.2d at 384; <em>Wells v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 549, 551-52, 347 S.E.2d 139, 140 (1986)). The absence of an ingestion device and the presence of a firearm are also factors that may be considered. <em>Shackleford v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 307, 327-28, 528 S.E.2d 123, 133 (2000) (citing <em>Langston v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 276, 286, 504 S.E.2d 380, 385 (1998)). Finally, the fact finder may consider the testimony of expert witnesses in determining whether possession of an imitation or controlled substance is for personal use or distribution. <em>Id. </em>at 327, 528 S.E.2d at 133 (citing <em>Rodriguez v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 277, 443 S.E.2d 419 (1994) <em>(en banc), aff'd, </em>249 Va. 203, 454 S.E.2d 725 (1995); <em>Poindexter v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 730, 432 S.E.2d 527 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Here, like in <em>Dukes, </em>appellant possessed a relatively small quantity of an illegal substance. This substance was packaged in three small individual corner baggies. Appellant did not possess any paraphernalia associated with the distribution of illegal substances, i.e., razor blades or scales, nor did he possess an unusually large quantity of money or a firearm. Accordingly, in the instant case, none of the usual factors that overcome the presumption of possession of a small quantity for personal use were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Thus, I agree with the majority that considering all the evidence, except Gavin\u2019s testimony, there was insufficient evidence to convict appellant of intentionally possessing an illegal substance. My consideration of this case diverges from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>majority\u2019s analysis in that I believe the evidence, even <em>with </em>Gavin\u2019s testimony, was insufficient as a matter of law to convict appellant. Not only did Gavin\u2019s testimony fail to foreclose appellant\u2019s hypothesis of innocence, it also contradicted Virginia case law in every respect. I firmly believe that where expert testimony is in opposition to case law, it is our duty to give deference to the prior decisions of Virginia\u2019s appellate courts by concluding that the expert\u2019s testimony, standing alone, fails as a matter of law to establish the fact it purports to prove.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The majority finds that Gavin\u2019s testimony \u201cdismantled\u201d appellant\u2019s hypothesis of innocence, namely, appellant\u2019s claim that \u201c[he] believed he possessed real, not imitation, crack and had indeed been \u2018ripped off.\u2019 \u201d <em>Supra </em>at 668, 705 S.E.2d at 514. Gavin testified that the following circumstances were inconsistent with personal use: the method of packaging the substance; the absence of an ingestion device; and the fact that the \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d was imitation crack cocaine, rather than the authentic drug. Gavin testified that the possession of three baggies of imitation crack was inconsistent with personal use because an experienced individual could get more for his money if he bought one larger rock of cocaine, rather than three smaller rocks. Not only does this determination presuppose that a seller of drugs always sells each bag at market value and that a seller always has a larger rock of cocaine available for purchase, it also assumes that the three baggies of imitation cocaine had been exchanged for $60, rather than for a discounted price based on the total quantity purchased. Further, as the majority acknowledges in its recitation of the facts, \u201cwhen [Detective Gavin] was asked whether \u2018all cocaine users, everyone who buys crack, shops around for the best deal, like Wal-Mart [sic],\u2019 [he] conceded that he could confirm only \u2018that is what ... <em>most ... </em>users do.\u2019 \u201d <em>Supra </em>at 663, 705 S.E.2d at 512 (emphasis added). By admitting his testimony covered only what <em>\u201cmost ... </em>users do,\u201d Detective Gavin established the existence of a reasonable hypothesis of innocence which the trier of fact was not entitled to reject arbitrarily \u2014 that appellant, although a user of crack cocaine, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>not like \u201cmost\u201d users in this particular instance and did not \u201cshop[ ] around\u201d for the best deal by attempting to buy his cocaine in a bulk, undivided quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">More importantly, Virginia\u2019s jurisprudence instructs us that \u201c \u2018even if the substance is packaged for distribution, there must be additional evidence to preclude the inference that it was purchased in the packaged form for personal use[,] rather than being held in that fashion for distribution.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Servis, </em>6 Va.App. at 524, 371 S.E.2d at 165 (quoting <em>Monroe, </em>4 Va.App. at 156, 355 S.E.2d at 337); <em>accord Dukes, </em>227 Va. at 123, 313 S.E.2d at 384. The majority holds Gavin\u2019s testimony necessarily leads to the conclusion that \u201cbe he experienced or be he inexperienced, it is unlikely that appellant would have purchased three packages of the substance, believing it to be crack.\u201d <em>Supra </em>at 668, 705 S.E.2d at 515. I believe this Court must still consider Gavin\u2019s testimony as a single piece of evidence that must be viewed through the prism of Virginia\u2019s case law. <em>See Askew v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 104, 109-10, 578 S.E.2d 58, 61 (2003). As Virginia\u2019s appellate courts have repeatedly held, when a small amount of an illegal substance is possessed in prepackaged form, the method of packaging is not a dispositive indicator of possession for distribution. <em>Dukes, </em>227 Va. at 123, 313 S.E.2d at 384; <em>Servis, </em>6 Va.App. at 524, 371 S.E.2d at 165; <em>Monroe, 4 </em>Va.App. at 156, 355 S.E.2d at 337. It is error for this Court to hold otherwise based on the testimony of an expert witness, particularly where the testimony is equivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Similarly, as to the relevance of the absence of an ingestion device, Detective Gavin testified only that <em>\u201cnormal </em>user[s]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>\u201cmaintain a stem or crack pipe on their person when they purchase crack cocaine.\u201d <em>Supra </em>at 663, 705 S.E.2d at 512 (emphasis added). Again, this testimony leaves open the reasonable hypothesis that appellant, who possessed the imitation crack cocaine while standing on the front porch of a residence, although perhaps not a \u201cnormal user\u201d of crack cocaine as described by Detective Gavin in that he did not have a smoking device on this person at that time, was nevertheless a user of crack cocaine who had a smoking device in close proximity, perhaps inside the residence of the porch on which he stood. This hypothesis requires no additional testimony or leap of faith to constitute a reasonable hypothesis of innocence flowing from the evidence in the record. Thus, it may not be arbitrarily rejected by the fact finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Further, to the extent that Detective Gavin\u2019s testimony may be viewed as asserting that the absence of an ingestion device affirmatively established appellant possessed the imitation cocaine for distribution purposes, that testimony is in direct opposition to Virginia precedent, which recognizes that the absence of a personal ingestion device \u201cdoes not give rise to an inference that [a defendant] was not a drug user.\u201d <em>Dukes, </em>227 Va. at 123, 313 S.E.2d at 384. In <em>Dukes, </em>which the majority cites, the Supreme Court determined it was \u201cmore likely that [the defendant] used the drug elsewhere,\u201d rather than at her place of employment. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, here, it is more likely that appellant used the drug somewhere other than on the porch of a house that was in plain view of the street, such as inside the house itself. Once more, I do not believe we may give Gavin\u2019s opinion greater deference than the authority that binds us.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">When the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence is wholly circumstantial, \u201c \u2018all necessary circumstances proved must be consistent with guilt and inconsistent with innocence and exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dukes, </em>227 Va. at 122, 313 S.E.2d at 383 (quoting <em>Inge v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 360, 366, 228 S.E.2d 563, 567 (1976)). \u201cWhere inferences are relied upon to establish guilt, they must point to guilt so clearly that any other conclusion would be inconsistent therewith.\u201d <em>Dotson v. Commonwealth, </em>171 Va. 514, 518, 199 S.E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>471, 473 (1938). \u201cThere is no stronger presumption afforded than that an accused is presumed to be innocent, which cannot be overthrown except by proof of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 517,199 S.E. at 473. Here, as a matter of law, the evidence and any inferences to be drawn from the evidence do not point so clearly to guilt of possession with intent to distribute as to make unreasonable a conclusion that appellant possessed the substance for his personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">In sum, this record provides a dearth of direct evidence, analytically incomplete circumstantial evidence, and Detective Gavin\u2019s singular expert opinion that the items appellant possessed were indeed possessed with the intent to distribute. I would respectfully suggest that in circumstances involving equivocal expert testimony, and circumstantial evidence that does not support a conviction, even when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence fails to exclude a reasonable hypothesis of appellant\u2019s innocence. <em>See Dukes, </em>227 Va. at 123, 313 S.E.2d at 384. Accordingly, I must dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b719-6\">. I also appreciate that the majority apparently does not suggest that a lack of circumstantial evidence in a case such as this can be salvaged by simply having an expert testify in support of a factual or legal proposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\">. I would respectfully suggest that the majority\u2019s reliance on the analysis in <em>McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 483, 545 S.E.2d 541 (2001) (holding that cocaine packaged in two individually wrapped blocks in a single plastic bag supported a finding of distribution), cannot occur in a vacuum. In my view, the Supreme Court held in <em>McCain </em>that it is appropriate to consider the quantity of the illegal substance, its packaging, and the presence of an unusual amount of cash, distribution equipment, or firearms. As previously noted, appellant herein had three rocks of fake cocaine, no distinctive packaging, no unusual amount of cash, no distribution equipment, and no firearms.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
