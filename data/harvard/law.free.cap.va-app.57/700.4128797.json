Collier for violating its drug-free workplace policy after she tested positive on a drug test. The Virginia Employment Commission (VEC) awarded Collier unemployment benefits. The circuit court reversed the award after concluding the VEC misapplied Code \u00a7 60.2-618(2)(b)(l), which precludes employees fired for testing positive for drug use from receiving unemployment benefits. Agreeing with the circuit court\u2019s reasoning, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">In August 2007, Collier began working for Community Alternatives, Inc. The employer maintained a drug-free workplace policy and required employees to submit to random drug screening. Collier signed the policy, verifying: \u201cI understand procedures for testing and reviewing of results are conducted in accordance with recognized standards of the National Institute of Drug Administration.\u201d App. at 14. Randomly selected for a drug test, Collier tested positive for marijuana use in September 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">The Sentara Medical Group collected the sample and forwarded it to Quest Diagnostics. Quest Diagnostics issued a report identifying the specimen tested, the test results, the date and time the sample was collected, received, and reported, and the \u201cCertifying Scientist\u201d who verified the results. The report also confirmed the specimen was received by Quest Diagnostics and processed in its \u201cDHHS\u201d certified lab. DHHS is an acronym for the United States Department of Health and Human Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">Based on the drug test results, the employer fired Collier for violating the drug-free workplace policy. Collier filed a claim with the VEC seeking unemployment benefits. In response, the employer argued Collier was ineligible for benefits under Code \u00a7 60.2 \u2014 618(2)(b)(l) because she had been fired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>for misconduct. A VEC deputy claims examiner awarded benefits. The employer sought review by a VEC appeals examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">During the telephone conference hearing, the VEC appeals examiner asked for a chain-of-custody affirmation \u2014 which she explained as the \u201cform the Claimant would sign-off on before giving her specimen to whoever\u2019s conducting ... taking the specimen.\u201d App. at 172. The employer\u2019s representative replied, \u201cI can try to find that and ... fax it to you if you want me to.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The appeals examiner answered, \u201c[i]f you do have it in her file, I would like for you to fax it please----\u201d <em>Id. </em>The employer\u2019s representative telefaxed the separate chain-of-custody affirmation to the VEC about an hour after the evidentiary hearing. Collier did not participate in the proceeding. Nor did she file any later statements contesting the authenticity of the chain-of-custody form or her signature on it. The VEC appeals examiner reversed the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Collier then requested a full VEC review of her claim. Acting with delegated power from the full VEC, a \u201cspecial examiner\u201d reversed the appeals examiner and reinstated the award. The special examiner refused to consider the employer\u2019s chain-of-custody affirmation because the telefax was received after the telephonic hearing. Because the appeals examiner did not expressly \u201chold open the record,\u201d the special examiner concluded, the VEC would not treat the chain-of-custody affirmation as an exhibit. The VEC special examiner then held the drug test was \u201cinsufficient\u201d as a matter of law to establish a statutory <em>prima facie </em>case of misconduct because the test was not accompanied by a separate chain-of-custody affirmation. App. at 10. The VEC reached this conclusion even though Collier never challenged the chain of custody for her test specimen.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">The employer appealed to the circuit court arguing that neither the statute nor the VEC administrative regulations required a separate chain-of-custody affirmation. The employer\u2019s Petition for Judicial Review also pointed out that \u201cCollier never challenged the chain of custody of her test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>specimen.\u201d App. at 3. The VEC expressly admitted this fact in its Answer to Petition for Judicial Review. <em>See </em>Tr. Ct. R. at 24.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a commendable abundance of judicial caution, the circuit court nonetheless remanded the case to the VEC to clarify whether it rejected the drug test as factually unreliable given the specific circumstances of this case or as insufficient as a matter of law to constitute a statutory <em>prima facie </em>showing of misconduct. <em>See </em>App. at 33-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">On remand, the VEC restated its view that the statute required an employer in all cases (even cases in which no one contests the reliability of the drug test) to file a chain-of-custody affirmation in order to establish a <em>prima facie </em>showing of misconduct. The failure to do so, the VEC believed, was a fatal omission in any misconduct case based upon a positive drug test. In a detailed and thorough letter opinion, the circuit court reversed the VEC\u2019s decision as inconsistent with Code \u00a7 60.2-618(2)(b)(l). The VEC appeals to us, asserting the circuit court erred in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Under the Unemployment Benefits Act, \u201c[t]he legislature intended unemployment benefits to be paid only to those who find themselves unemployed \u2018without fault on their part.\u2019 \u201d <em>Va. Emp\u2019t Comm\u2019n v. Trent, 55 </em>Va.App. 560, 568, 687 S.E.2d 99, 103 (2010) (quoting <em>Israel v. Va. Emp\u2019t Comm\u2019n, </em>7 Va.App. 169, 172, 372 S.E.2d 207, 209 (1988)). \u201cFurthering this policy goal, Code \u00a7 60.2-618(2)(a) prohibits benefits \u2018if the Commission finds such individual is unemployed because he has been discharged for misconduct connected with his work.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Code \u00a7 60.2-618(2)(b) provides examples of disqualifying misconduct. By statute, misconduct includes, but is not limited to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>An employee\u2019s confirmed positive test for a nonprescribed controlled substance, identified as such in Chapter 34 (\u00a7 54.1-3400 et seq.) of Title 54.1, where such test was conducted at the direction of his employer in conjunction with the employer\u2019s administration and enforcement of a known workplace drug policy. Such test shall have been performed, and a sample collected, in accordance with scientifically recognized standards by a laboratory accredited by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or the College of American Pathology, or the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, or the equivalent, or shall have been a United States Department of Transportation [DOT]-qualified drug screen conducted in accordance with the employer\u2019s bona fide drug policy. The Commission may consider evidence of mitigating circumstances in determining whether misconduct occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Code \u00a7 60.2-618(2)(b)(l) (added to Code \u00a7 60.2-618 by 1998 Va. Acts ch. 241 and 2008 Va. Acts ch. 719). Subsection 2(b)(1) breaks down into a simple premise: An employer makes a <em>prima facie </em>showing of misconduct by presenting a \u201cconfirmed positive test\u201d that satisfies three requirements:</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">\u2022 the test was conducted pursuant to a \u201cknown workplace drug policy,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">\u2022 the testing and sampling were performed \u201cin accordance with scientifically recognized standards,\u201d and</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">\u2022 the testing lab was \u201caccredited\u201d or the test was a DOT qualified drug screen.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\"><em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Once the employer presents a <em>prima facie </em>case, the burden shifts to the claimant to present \u201cmitigating circumstances\u201d which the VEC may consider \u201cin determining whether misconduct occurred.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>The question we must answer is whether this statute expressly or implicitly requires the employer to present a separate chain-of-custody affirmation to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of misconduct. Our analysis should begin, \u201cas always, with the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Meador v. Va. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Program, </em>44 Va. App. 149, 153-54, 604 S.E.2d 88, 90 (2004) (citation omitted). Working from the statutory text, \u201cwe strive to give that language a \u2018literal construction\u2019 unless doing so \u2018would involve a manifest absurdity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cent. Va. Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Assocs., P.C. v. Whitfield, </em>42 Va.App. 264, 276, 590 S.E.2d 631, 638 (2004) (citation omitted); <em>see also Evans v. Evans, </em>280 Va. 76, 82, 695 S.E.2d 173, 176 (2010) (restating \u201cmanifest absurdity\u201d caveat). \u201c[B]y literal, we mean the words should be given their common, ordinary and accepted understanding.\u201d <em>Meador, </em>44 Va.App. at 154, 604 S.E.2d at 91 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). This textualist approach presumes \u201cthe legislature \u2018chose, with care,\u2019 the specific words of the statute.\u201d <em>Kane v. Szymczak, </em>41 Va.App. 365, 371, 585 S.E.2d 349, 352-53 (2003) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The text of Code \u00a7 60.2-618(2)(b)(l) nowhere states the drug test results are <em>per se </em>invalid without a separate chain-of-custody affirmation. Instead, subsection (2)(b)(l) merely requires the test be performed, and the sample collected, in accordance with \u201cscientifically recognized standards.\u201d Conspicuously absent from subsection (2)(b)(l) is any freestanding statutory requirement that the drug test be accompanied by a separate chain-of-custody affirmation. Nor can the putative requirement be implied from the procedural guidelines governing VEC evidentiary hearings. By statute, they \u201cneed not conform to common law or statutory rules of evidence and other technical rules of procedure.\u201d Code \u00a7 60.2-623(A); <em>see also </em>16 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 5-80-20(F), 5-80-30(D).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>It is not as if the General Assembly has never addressed the chain-of-custody concept in the context of scientific testing. Code \u00a7 19.2-187.01, for example, considers certificates of analysis issued by the \u201cDivision of Consolidated Laboratory Services, the Department of Forensic Science or any of its regional laboratories, or by any laboratory authorized by such Division or Department, ... [as] prima facie evidence that the person receiving the material was an authorized agent and that such receipt constitutes proper receipt by the laboratory for purposes of this section.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-327.1(A) addresses the \u201cchain of custody\u201d showing necessary for a felon seeking a new post-conviction scientific investigation of any human biological evidence. Code \u00a7 20-49.3 states the \u201cdocumentary evidence of the chain of custody\u201d essential for admission of genetic tests in parentage proceedings. That the General Assembly has specifically addressed the chain-of-custody concept on several occasions, but did not do so here, implies a specific legislative choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">In response, the VEC contends that even though \u201cCode \u00a7 60.2-618(2)(b)(l) does not mention \u2018chain of custody\u2019 by name,\u201d it can be implied from the statutory requirement that the testing and sample collection be performed pursuant to \u201cscientifically recognized standards.\u201d App. at 43-41. We agree with the thread of reasoning underlying this argument but fail to see how it leads to the VEC\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">It stands to reason that \u201cscientifically recognized standards\u201d \u2014 if truly scientific and well recognized \u2014 would seek to ensure the sample collected for testing is in fact the sample actually tested. <em>See, e.g., </em>DHHS\u2019s Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs, 69 Fed.Reg. 19644 (April 13, 2004) (requiring testers to ensure the sample\u2019s chain of custody) (later revisions summarized at 75 Fed.Reg. 22809 (April 30, 2010)). That truism, however, does not mean an accredited laboratory cannot provide certified test results without separately verifying this assertion. If we were to infer anything, it would be that an accredited laboratory would not certify its findings if they did <em>not </em>rest upon a secure chain-of-custody foundation. The absence of a separate document in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>addition to the certified lab results does not necessarily imply the lab failed to follow proper chain of custody protocols.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">However one parses the statutory language, the VEC concludes, it has consistently imposed a separate-document requirement affirming the chain of custody and, thus, we should defer to its interpretation of the statute. We decline the invitation to do so. While VEC factfinding receives the highest degree of appellate deference, <em>Trent, </em>55 Va.App. at 567-68, 687 S.E.2d at 103, no such deference applies to questions of law. \u201cPure statutory construction, a matter within the \u2018core competency of the judiciary,\u2019 requires <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Citland, Ltd. v. Commonwealth ex rel. Kilgore, </em>45 Va.App. 268, 275, 610 S.E.2d 321, 324 (2005) (citation omitted). \u201cThis axiom stems from basic principles of separation of powers. It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cVirginia courts do not delegate that task to executive agencies.\u201d <em>Finnerty v. Thornton Hall, Inc., </em>42 Va.App. 628, 635, 593 S.E.2d 568, 571 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The narrow nature of our holding, however, should not be overlooked. Like the circuit court, we reject only the VEC\u2019s broad view that a positive drug test can never constitute a <em>prima facie </em>case of misconduct under Code \u00a7 60.2-618(2)(b)(l) unless accompanied by a separate chain-of-custody affirmation. We hold only that a positive drug test, without any additional chain-of-custody affirmation, presents a <em>prima facie </em>case of misconduct if the test complies with Code \u00a7 60.2-618(2)(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">That said, we do not mean to invert the VEC\u2019s error by implying chain-of-custody affirmations can play no role in the decisionmaking process. In cases where, unlike here, the evidence calls into question the chain of custody of the sample tested, then the VEC \u2014 like any other factfinder \u2014 may consider the presence or absence of a separate chain-of-custody affirmation in determining the probative weight of the drug test. Our holding that such affirmations are not legally essential to a <em>prima facie </em>case of misconduct leaves untouched <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>the factual relevance they may have in cases where the claimant specifically disputes the chain of custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Because the circuit court correctly interpreted Code \u00a7 60.2-618(2)(b)(l), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-8\">.
