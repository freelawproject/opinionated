(collectively \u201cemployer\u201d) appeal a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201ccommission\u201d) awarding temporary partial disability compensation benefits payable to Lois H. Plunkett (\u201cclaimant\u201d). Employer presents eleven assignments of error on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It contends the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>erred in finding that <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Favinger, </em>275 Va. 83, 654 S.E.2d 575 (2008), was not applicable to bar claimant\u2019s award of temporary partial disability compensation benefits, arguing that decision applied only to loss of overtime wage cases. Employer further asserts the commission erred in determining claimant met any requirement that she market her residual work capacity by accepting the light-duty job offered to her by employer. It also contends the commission erred in finding that credible evidence in the record supported its conclusion that employer limited claimant\u2019s work hours when it had additional work hours available within employee\u2019s work capacity. For the following reasons we conclude that the commission erred in denying employer\u2019s change-in-condition application and in awarding temporary partial disability compensation benefits to claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">On appeal of a decision of the commission, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party before the commission, here claimant. <em>See Dunnavant v. Newman Tire Co., </em>51 Va.App. 252, 255, 656 S.E.2d 431, 433 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Claimant suffered a compensable injury to her right elbow and left arm on January 30, 2007 while working for employer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On February 6, 2007, the commission awarded temporary total disability compensation benefits to claimant in the amount of $258.59 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>On April 14, 2008, claimant\u2019s treating physician released her to light-duty work, with restrictions that she not lift objects over ten pounds and that she not operate the drive-through window at the pharmacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">On September 24, 2008, employer sent a letter to claimant offering her a position as a pharmacy associate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The position offered was \u201cpart time\u201d at claimant\u2019s \u201cpre-injury rate of $9.57 an hour.\u201d On October 16, 2008, claimant contacted the store manager, William Ellis, as instructed by employer\u2019s letter. Ellis asked claimant when she was available to work. Claimant responded, \u201ctwenty [hours] or less.\u201d She told Ellis that she would need to leave every day to pick up her great-grandson from school at 4:00 p.m. Claimant also told Ellis that she could not work nights because she had trouble driving at night due to eye problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">On October 22, 2008, claimant returned to work for employer as a pharmacy associate, working Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., averaging fifteen hours of work per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">On November 13, 2008, employer filed a change-in-condition application with the commission to terminate claimant\u2019s temporary total disability compensation benefits effective October 22, 2008, the date claimant returned to work for employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">On December 9, 2008, claimant filed an application for temporary- partial disability compensation benefits effective October 22, 2008, and continuing.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">At the deputy commissioner\u2019s hearing on employer\u2019s change-in-condition application and claimant\u2019s application for temporary partial disability compensation benefits, employer argued claimant was not entitled to temporary partial disability compensation benefits because she failed to market her residual work capacity as required by <em>Favinger, </em>275 Va. at 91, 654 S.E.2d at 579 (holding employee has a duty to reasonably market residual work capacity after accepting a job offered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>employer). Here, employer contended that claimant\u2019s wage loss resulted from the self-limitation she placed on her work hours. Claimant, on the other hand, argued that by accepting the only job offered to her by her pre-injury employer, she had no duty to market her residual work capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The deputy commissioner awarded claimant temporary partial disability compensation benefits beginning October 22, 2008, the day she returned to work. In awarding claimant temporary partial disability compensation benefits, the deputy commissioner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">Given the specific offer of part-time employment by letter dated September 24, 2008, the Commission finds that the claimant was justified in her dealings with Ellis in seeking a return to work. Given that she returned to work for the employer, who has the ability and discretion to offer more employment, the Commission concludes that the claimant did not need to market her remaining work capacity. Therefore, the claimant\u2019s request for temporary partial disability benefits is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Employer appealed to the full commission, asserting the same arguments it made to the deputy commissioner. The full commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s award, denying employer\u2019s change-in-condition application and granting temporary partial disability compensation benefits to claimant. In doing so, the commission concluded that our decisions in <em>ARA Servs, v. Swift, </em>22 Va.App. 202, 468 S.E.2d 682 (1996), and <em>Falls v. Virginia Mennonite Ret., </em>No. 1326-98-3, 1998 WL 886917, 1998 Va.App. LEXIS 672 (Va.Ct.App. Dec. 22,1998), controlled its decision. It found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">claimant had permanent light-duty restrictions, and accepted the only position offered by the employer. We find that her acceptance of this limited position shows that she adequately marketed her residual capacity. The claimant was not required to further market her residual capacity, because she acted reasonably in accepting the light-duty work offered by her pre-injury employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>The commission concluded that <em>Favinger </em>did not apply to require claimant to market her residual work capacity, concluding that <em>Favinger </em>\u201cdealt with an employee\u2019s entitlement to temporary partial disability benefits for overtime hours.\u201d The commission distinguished <em>Favinger, </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">Here, however, the claimant accepted a position offered by the pre-injury employer. The employer had full-time work available within her restrictions, but restricted the number of hours and type of work offered. If the claimant had not accepted the selective employment, she would have been subject to termination of benefits. Therefore, where a preinjury employer offers selective employment that does not encompass all of the employee\u2019s residual capacity, their acceptance of the position should evidence a good faith effort to market their residual capacity where the employer does not offer additional work or hours.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The commission noted in a footnote that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">[t]o hold otherwise would create an incentive for employers to offer limited selective employment that does not fulfill all of the employee\u2019s residual capacity. This would require them to accept the position, or risk termination of benefits, based on refusal of selective employment, and additionally require them to continue to market remaining capacity beginning the day the position is offered, or risk termination of temporary partial disability benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Commissioner Williams dissented, concluding that <em>Favinger </em>required claimant to make a reasonable effort to market her residual work capacity. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">Employer asserts that the commission erred in finding <em>Favinger </em>not applicable and in concluding that claimant had no duty to reasonably market her residual work capacity. We agree with employer\u2019s assertion that <em>Favinger </em>applies and that claimant had a duty to reasonably market her residual work capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Code \u00a7 65.2-502(A) requires an employer to pay an injured employee, who suffered a compensable injury and who returns to work with partial work capacity, \u201ca weekly compensation equal to 66 2/3 percent of the difference between [her] average weekly wages before the injury and the average weekly wages which [s]he is able to earn thereafter, but not more than 100 percent of the average weekly wage.\u201d. \u201cIn a claim for temporary partial disability, the employee \u2018[has] the burden of proving that he [has] made a reasonable effort to procure suitable work but [is] unable to market his remaining work capacity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Favinger, </em>275 Va. at 89, 654 S.E.2d at 578 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. v. Harrison, </em>228 Va. 598, 601, 324 S.E.2d 654, 656 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">In sum, an employee \u201cmust present \u2018some evidence that he [has] engaged in a <em>good faith </em>effort to obtain work within the tolerance of his physical condition\u2019 and has failed to find a job, either due to his injury or because no such work was available in the community.\u201d <em>National Linen Serv[. v. McGuinn], </em>8 Va.App. [267,] 271, 380 S.E.2d [31,] 34 [ (1989) ] (quoting <em>Dunkin Donuts of America, Inc. v. Watson, </em>366 A.2d 1121,1126 (Me.1976) (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"ATN\"><em>Favinger, </em>275 Va. at 90, 654 S.E.2d at 579 (first alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Here, claimant made no effort to reasonably-market her residual work capacity. However, the commission reasoned that, by accepting employer\u2019s only offer of selective employment, a position that met claimant\u2019s work restrictions and her request to work twenty hours or less per week, claimant had no duty to further market her residual work capacity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The commission erred as a matter of law in applying our prior holdings in <em>ARA Services </em>and <em>Falls </em>to deny employer\u2019s change-in-condition application and in awarding temporary partial disability compensation benefits to claimant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Supreme Court stated in <em>Favinger, </em>\u201c[t]he fact that [claimant] accepted the light duty job and was willing to work [more hours] ... did not negate the requirement that [she] make a <em>reasonable effort </em>to market [her] residual work capacity.\u201d 275 Va. at 91, 654 S.E.2d at 579 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">We conclude the commission erred in finding that claimant marketed her residual work capacity. She accepted the only position offered by employer, a position consistent with her post-injury work restrictions and her self-limited hours of availability due to family responsibilities and reluctance to drive at night. Accordingly, we conclude that the commission erred in denying employer\u2019s change-in-condition application and awarding temporary partial disability compensation benefits to claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Because \u201can appellate court decides cases \u2018on the best and narrowest ground available,\u201d\u2019 <em>Luginbyhl v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 58, 64, 628 S.E.2d 74, 77 (2006) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Air Courier Conference v. Am. Postal Workers Union, </em>498 U.S. 517, 531, 111 S.Ct. 913, 922, 112 L.Ed.2d 1125 (1991) (Stevens, J., concurring)), we need not reach employer\u2019s additional assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we find the commission erred in awarding claimant temporary partial disability compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-14\">. Assignments of error I through IV and VIII assert error on the part of the commission in failing to apply the Supreme Court's holding in <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Favinger, </em>275 Va. 83, 654 S.E.2d 575 (2008). Assignment of error V asserts that the commission erred in applying marketing principles outlined by <em>ARA Servs. v. Swift, </em>22 Va.App. 202, 468 S.E.2d 682 (1996), and <em>Falls v. Virginia Mennonite Ret., </em>No. 1326-98-3, 1998 WL 886917, 1998 Va.App. LEXIS 672 (Va.Ct.App. Dec. 22, 1998), rather than applying <em>Favinger. </em>Assignments of error VI and VII assert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>error by the commission in awarding temporary partial disability compensation benefits when claimant was able to work more hours. Assignments of error IX through XI assert that there was no credible evidence to support the commission's conclusion that employer restricted claimant\u2019s hours. Because each of employer\u2019s assignments of error asserting the commission\u2019s finding that <em>Favinger </em>was not applicable to bar claimant\u2019s award of temporary partial disability compensation benefits are interconnected, we address them together.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\">.

We applied the same rationale in <em>Falls. </em>1998 WL 886917, at *2, 1998 Va.App. LEXIS 672, at *7-8. Those cases, however, were decided prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Favinger, </em>which held that in accepting a light-duty job offered by his pre-injury employer, an employee still had a duty to reasonably market his residual work capacity. 275 Va. at 91, 654 S.E.2d at 579.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
