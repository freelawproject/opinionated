Mother contends the reason given by the court in refusing to register and enforce the decree is not among the reasons listed in the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (\u201cUCCJEA\u201d) for a court\u2019s refusal to register and enforce custody orders from other jurisdictions. Adam Morrison (\u201cfather\u201d) responds that this Court should dismiss mother\u2019s appeal pursuant to the fugitive disentitlement doctrine. On the merits, father alleges the circuit court did not err in refusing to register the decree because it was modified in 2008. For the following reasons, we find that the fugitive disentitlement doctrine does not compel dismissal in this case. However, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s refusal to register the 2003 Michigan order because it was subsequently modified in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">Mother and father were married on March 21, 2002. Their daughter, J.M., was born on October 14, 2002. The family resided at that time in Michigan. Mother filed for divorce in the Circuit Court for Washtenaw County (\u201cMichigan court\u201d) on February 21, 2003. The Michigan court entered a Default Judgment for Divorce on September 17, 2003 (\u201c2003 Michigan decree\u201d), awarding mother sole legal and physical custody of J.M., and providing that father \u201cshall have reasonable parenting time as the parties mutually agree until further order of the Court or until [J.M.] reaches the age of 18.\u201d The 2003 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Michigan decree also provided that mother could not relocate the residence of the minor child more than 100 miles from the child\u2019s residence in Michigan without prior approval from the Michigan court, and it ordered mother to provide twenty-one days written notice to the Michigan court of any relocation of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">In November 2007, mother relocated to Bad Ischl, Austria, with J.M., without first seeking prior approval from the Michigan court as required by the 2003 Michigan decree. She also did not provide the Michigan court with her new address in Austria within twenty-one days as also required by the decree. Rather, mother provided the Michigan court with written notice of her Austrian address nearly a year later on July 1, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">On January 7, 2008, the Probate Court for the County of Washtenaw in Michigan entered an order for judgment against mother, finding that mother had converted her father\u2019s funds, and had impermissibly left the United States for an undetermined period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">On July 3, 2008, the Michigan court entered an order modifying father\u2019s visitation schedule with J.M. (\u201cJuly 2008 visitation modification order\u201d). The July 2008 visitation modification order provided additional telephone contact between father and J.M., along with bimonthly visitation from Virginia where father was then living. Shortly thereafter, on August 15, 2008, father filed in the Michigan court a motion seeking to enforce the July 2008 visitation modification order, to modify custody, for an order for the immediate return of the child to Michigan, to abate child support, and for an order to show cause and hold mother in contempt of court. Because mother\u2019s residence in Austria was unknown to father, service of process for father\u2019s motion was at mother\u2019s last known address in Michigan, and upon her counsel named in the 2003 Michigan decree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There was no actual notice to mother in Austria regarding the August 2008 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>On September 16, 2008, the Michigan court entered an order (\u201c2008 Michigan custody modification order\u201d) awarding temporary physical custody of J.M. to father, and ordering that J.M. be returned to the United States pending resolution of a criminal complaint for kidnapping against mother. The Michigan court also issued a bench warrant against mother. On March 23, 2009, an amended criminal complaint was filed against mother in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. An indictment for International Parental Kidnapping and Passport Fraud was issued against mother on April 22, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">In April 2009, father traveled to Austria to bring J.M. back to the United States. On April 15, 2009, mother was arrested in Austria, and the Austrian police removed J.M. from her kindergarten class and delivered J.M. to father. On April 16, 2009, the Austrian court released mother from police custody and determined that extradition of mother to the United States would require an additional hearing. The 2008 Michigan custody modification order was never registered in Austria.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">On June 4, 2009, without notice to father, the Austrian court issued a declaratory decision and order (\u201c2009 Austrian order\u201d) determining that the Austrian court had jurisdiction to make a custody determination of J.M. and prohibiting father from removing J.M. from Austria. Nevertheless, father had already removed J.M. from Austria and returned with her to Virginia. Father and J.M. currently reside in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Upon father\u2019s return to the United States with J.M., mother filed a request to register the 2003 Michigan decree and the 2009 Austrian order in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court for Floyd County in Virginia (\u201cJ &amp; DRC\u201d). Father contested the registration, and the J &amp; DRC held a hearing on June 9, 2009. Mother\u2019s counsel appeared on behalf of mother, and father appeared <em>pro se. </em>By order dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>October 9, 2009, the J &amp; DRC granted mother\u2019s request and ordered that the 2003 Michigan decree and the 2009 Austrian order be \u201cregistered as orders of the Commonwealth of Virginia for purposes of enforcement.\u201d The J <em>&amp; </em>DRC ordered that J.M. be returned to mother on or before October 24, 2009. Father appealed the matter to the Circuit Court for Floyd County and requested that the circuit court register the 2008 Michigan custody modification order.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">On December 11, 2009, mother filed a motion in the circuit court for the return of J.M.\u2019s passport to her. On December 14, 2009, the circuit court entered an order denying both parties\u2019 requests for registration of the various orders. The circuit court explained that it declined to register the 2003 Michigan decree because mother had violated the decree when she removed J.M. from Michigan without prior approval of the Michigan court. The court declined to register the 2009 Austrian order because it had been entered without notice and opportunity for father to be heard in Austria. The circuit court also denied father\u2019s request to register the 2008 Michigan custody modification order because it found that order had been issued without notice and opportunity for mother to be heard in Michigan. Finally, the court ordered the case continued for a hearing on the issue of the return of J.M.\u2019s passport.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Mother objected to the circuit court\u2019s December 14, 2009 order on the basis that the 2003 Michigan decree was held to be a valid order, that no contempt proceeding for mother\u2019s alleged violation of that order had ever occurred, that even if mother was in contempt, such contempt was not a valid reason under the UCCJEA for refusal to register the order, that she has met the conditions for registration of the order under the UCCJEA, and, \u201cfor the other reasons cited in the memorandum filed by\u201d mother. Mother filed a notice of appeal from the December 14, 2009 order to this Court on January 13, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">On April 20, 2010, the circuit court entered a final order providing that J.M.\u2019s passport remain held by the clerk, of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>circuit court pending the resolution of mother\u2019s appeal in this matter. Mother filed a notice of appeal from that order on May 20, 2010. On June 14, 2010, mother filed a written statement of facts in lieu of transcript. The circuit court, after making a number of corrections, adopted the statement of facts as \u201caccurate and complete\u201d on July 15, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Mother\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the circuit court erred in refusing to register the 2003 Michigan decree in Virginia based only on mother\u2019s purported violation of the decree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mother argues her alleged contempt of the order is not a valid reason to refuse registration of the order under the UCCJEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">\n<em>A. Motion to dismiss</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Father filed a motion to dismiss this appeal under the fugitive disentitlement doctrine. In support of his motion, father contends mother is a fugitive from justice because \u201csometime in 2007, [she] absconded from Michigan to Austria in violation of Orders from two Michigan courts and the laws of the United States of America.\u201d Father asserts mother \u201chad been ordered to turn in her passport to the Michigan probate court because she was a flight risk in a case where she had been found to have stolen over a million dollars.\u201d Father\u2019s motion also asserts that mother \u201cfraudulently obtained a duplicate passport and fled Michigan\u2019s jurisdiction violating the relocation provision\u201d of the 2003 Michigan decree, which prohibited her both from removing J.M.\u2019s domicile from the State of Michigan and from changing J.M.\u2019s legal residence to a location more than 100 miles away without court approval. Father reasons that \u201cthrough her unlawful and contemptuous kidnapping of the parties\u2019 daughter from Michigan, mother also violated the [July 2008 visitation modification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>order] which granted parenting time to father and which set a review date to consider expansion of father\u2019s parenting time.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Father also underscores mother\u2019s refusal to submit to the United States of America on an indictment charging her with parental kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">\u201cFugitive disentitlement is a doctrine that springs out of the inherent power of courts to enforce their judgments and protect their dignity.\u201d <em>Matsumoto v. Matsumoto, </em>171 N.J. 110, 792 A.2d 1222, 1227 (2002) (citation omitted). \u201cIn essence, it provides that a fugitive from justice may not seek relief from the judicial system whose authority he or she evades.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe fugitive disentitlement doctrine, although traditionally applied to criminal cases, extends to civil cases as well,\u201d <em>Moscona v. Shenhar, </em>50 Va.App. 238, 250, 649 S.E.2d 191, 196 (2007), <em>aff'd sub nom, Sasson v. Shenhar, </em>276 Va. 611, 667 S.E.2d 555 (2008), since \u201cit is the flight or refusal to return in the face of judicial action that is the critical predicate to fugitive disentitlement,\u201d <em>Matsumoto, </em>792 A.2d at 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">\u201cIn order to employ the doctrine,\u201d the record must show that \u201c(1) the appellant [is] a fugitive, (2) there [is] a nexus between the current appeal and the appellant\u2019s status as a fugitive, and (3) dismissal [is] necessary to effectuate the policy concerns underlying the doctrine.\u201d <em>Sasson, </em>276 Va. at 623, 667 S.E.2d at 561 (citations omitted). Some of the policy concerns underlying the doctrine \u201cinclude prejudice to the opponent, delay, frustration, and unenforceability.\u201d <em>Walsh v. Walsh, </em>221 F.3d 204, 215 (1st Cir.2000). A court may also consider \u201cthe inequity of allowing [the] fugitive to use the resources of the courts only if the outcome is an aid to him,\u201d and \u201cthe discouragement of flights from justice.\u201d <em>Moscona, </em>50 Va.App. at 251, 649 S.E.2d at 197 (citation omitted). A court\u2019s use of the doctrine \u201cmust \u2018be a reasonable response to the problems and needs that provoke it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sasson, </em>276 Va. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>623, 667 S.E.2d at 561 (quoting <em>Degen v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 820, 823-24, 116 S.Ct. 1777, 1781, 135 L.Ed.2d 102 (1996)). Because \u201c[t]he sanction of disentitlement is most severe and could actually disserve the dignitary purposes for which it is invoked,\u201d <em>Degen, </em>517 U.S. at 828, 116 S.Ct. at 1783, an appellate court \u201cmust exercise discretion in determining whether to apply the doctrine, which is equitable rather than jurisdictional in nature,\u201d <em>Moscona, </em>50 Va.App. at 252, 649 S.E.2d at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Applying these principles, we first find that mother is clearly a fugitive. We note that, \u201calthough a litigant may qualify as a fugitive by fleeing the jurisdiction, a litigant may also, \u2018while legally outside the jurisdiction, constructively flee by deciding not to return.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 251, 649 S.E.2d at 197 (quoting <em>Matsumoto, </em>792 A.2d at 1228). While several of the assertions underlying father\u2019s contention that mother is a fugitive are plainly disingenuous in that mother had already left Michigan before any of the 2008 orders were entered against her, mother concedes she is aware of the outstanding warrant for her arrest for violating the 2003 Michigan decree, and she has knowledge of a federal indictment charging her with parental kidnapping. And yet, mother has refused to submit to the jurisdiction of the Michigan court, and she has failed to turn herself in to federal authorities on the indictment for kidnapping. Therefore, mother is, constructively speaking, a fugitive from justice for purposes of applying the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">However, any nexus between mother\u2019s status as a fugitive and the current appeal is tenuous. To begin with, and contrary to father\u2019s assertion in his motion to dismiss, mother\u2019s status as a fugitive from Michigan\u2019s <em>probate </em>court has nothing whatsoever to do with her appeal in this Court. Neither does her current appeal relate in any meaningful sense to the indictment taken out against her in the federal system. While it is true that mother would likely not be in a position to have to request registration and enforcement of the 2003 Michigan decree absent her status as a fugitive from the Michigan court, mother\u2019s request to register the 2003 Michigan decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>in Virginia resulted, not from mother\u2019s actions, but from father\u2019s actions in taking J.M. from Austria and bringing her to Virginia. It appears mother\u2019s appeal is, thus, a direct result of father\u2019s actions, rather than mother\u2019s refusal to submit to the jurisdiction of the Michigan courts. Indeed, we are mindful that mother is a fugitive on a bench warrant issued against her in <em>Michigan; </em>she is not a fugitive from any judgment entered against her in this Commonwealth. Such a nexus may be \u201ctoo slim a reed to support so weighty a doctrine,\u201d since it is \u201cnot connected in the classic sense of being part of the <em>same </em>criminal [or civil] proceeding as to which\u201d mother is a defendant. <em>Walsh, </em>221 F.3d at 215 (emphasis added); <em>see also Lazaridis v. Wehmer, </em>288 Fed.Appx. 800, 802-03 (3d Cir.2008) (holding \u201cthat the District Court [in Delaware] erred in relying on the fugitive disentitlement doctrine to dismiss [Lazaridis\u2019s] complaint\u201d in part because \u201calthough Lazaridis\u2019s alleged fugitive status may be an affront to the dignity of the Michigan courts, it is not an affront to this Court or to the District Court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Even if there is a sufficient nexus between mother\u2019s appeal and her status as a fugitive, application of the doctrine is not necessary in this case to effectuate the policy concerns underlying the doctrine. While \u201c[a]n appreciation of the pragmatic concerns\u201d governing the fugitive disentitlement analysis \u201crequires a case-by-case analysis,\u201d <em>Walsh, </em>221 F.3d at 215, cases involving custody are \u201cin an entirely different category than other issues for fugitive disentitlement purposes,\u201d <em>Matsumoto, </em>792 A.2d at 1235. In cases involving child custody \u201c \u2018the best interests of the child are paramount and form the lodestar for the guidance of the court in determining the dispute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bailes v. Sours, </em>231 Va. 96, 99, 340 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1986) (quoting <em>Walker v. Brooks, </em>203 Va. 417, 421, 124 S.E.2d 195, 198 (1962)). In fact, \u201c[p]arenthood is one of the greatest joys and privileges of life, and, under the Constitution, parents have a fundamental interest in their relationships with their children.\u201d <em>Walsh, </em>221 F.3d at 216 (citing <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000)). Thus, \u201c[t]o bar a parent who has lost a child from even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>arguing that the child was wrongfully removed to another country is too harsh. It is too harsh particularly in the absence of any showing that the fugitive status has impaired the rights of the other parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This is not to say the doctrine would <em>never </em>be applicable in child custody cases; it is simply to say the doctrine should be used in such cases only sparingly and where there is no significant negative impact on the best interests of any children.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Additionally, none of the other articulated policy concerns giving rise to the application of the fugitive disentitlement doctrine appear to be present here. As to any prejudice to father, we first note that \u201c[prejudice may take many forms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216 n. 9. For example, prejudice to one\u2019s opponent may occur in cases in which the fugitive refuses to submit to discovery. <em>Id. </em>Prejudice may also occur in cases in which the fugitive refuses to pay costs, or in cases in which the plaintiffs fugitive status results in the mere harassment of his adversaries, or even in cases in which \u201cthe plaintiffs fugitive status places him entirely beyond judicial control.\u201d <em>Sarlund v. Anderson, </em>205 F.3d 973, 975 (7th Cir.2000). None of these scenarios are implicated in the instant case. First of all, mother\u2019s appeal does not involve civil litigation or implicate the merits of an actual lawsuit; it merely addresses the question of whether Virginia should afford full faith and credit to the 2003 Michigan decree. No discovery will be propounded, and no trial will occur. Moreover, mother will be responsible only for costs associated with her appeal, and mother\u2019s status as a fugitive would not place her entirely beyond the control of our judiciary. More importantly, father, and not mother, currently has physical custody of J.M. in Virginia. Father also has temporary legal custody of J.M. under the 2008 Michigan custody modification order. Thus, father has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>failed to show that mother\u2019s status as a fugitive has impaired his rights. There is simply no prejudice to father in allowing mother\u2019s appeal in this Court to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">There is also no reason to believe that our refusal to dismiss this case under the fugitive disentitlement doctrine will result in any delay to father\u2019s case. Father prevailed in the circuit court, and it does not appear that he has filed for custody in the Commonwealth. We will not impose such a severe sanction merely because our refusal to apply the doctrine may theoretically result in frustrating father\u2019s battle for custody of J.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Finally, the fugitive disentitlement doctrine is not applicable in cases such as this one, where \u201cno enforcement issue exists.\u201d <em>Matsumoto, </em>792 A.2d at 1236. Again, this case does not involve a custody determination, which necessarily invokes the enforcement powers of the court. Rather, mother\u2019s appeal requires the application of full faith and credit to a prior custody order entered by a sister state. Also, because father, and not the fugitive mother, currently has custody of J.M., no prejudice results from this Court\u2019s unwillingness to exercise the fugitive disentitlement doctrine. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>(\u201cTo be sure, like courts in other jurisdictions, we would impose the doctrine in a case in which the fugitive parent has removed or hidden the child, thereby making enforcement [of the court\u2019s custody order] improbable in the event of a decision unfavorable to the fugitive parent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">In sum, we find that application of the fugitive disentitlement doctrine is not appropriate in this case and we, therefore, deny father\u2019s request to dismiss mother\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">\n<em>B. Whether the trial court erred in refusing to register the 2003 Michigan decree</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Mother alleges the circuit court\u2019s reason for refusing registration and enforcement of the 2003 Michigan decree is not a valid reason for refusal under the UCCJEA. She, thus, maintains the circuit court abused its discretion in refusing to register the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>The UCCJEA is comprised of four articles. \u201cArticle 1 sets forth definitions and other general provisions. Article 2 defines the circumstances in which the trial court may exercise jurisdiction concerning child custody determinations. Article 3 establishes the procedures for the [registration and] enforcement of child custody determinationsf, and] Article 4 consists of miscellaneous provisions.\u201d <em>Tyszcenko v. Donatelli, 53 </em>Va. App. 209, 218, 670 S.E.2d 49, 54 (2008). Article 3 of the UCCJEA \u201c\u2018requires the courts of this Commonwealth to \u201crecognize and enforce\u201d appropriate child custody determinations of the courts of other states.\u2019 \u201d <em>Prashad v. Copeland, 55 </em>Va.App. 247, 260, 685 S.E.2d 199, 205 (2009) (quoting <em>Tyszcenko, 53 </em>Va.App. at 218, 670 S.E.2d at 54). To that end, Code \u00a7 20-146.24 provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-5\">A court of this Commonwealth <em>shall </em>recognize and enforce a child custody determination of a court of another state if the latter court exercised jurisdiction in substantial conformity with this act or the determination was made under factual circumstances meeting the jurisdictional standards of this act and the determination <em>has not been modified </em>in accordance with this act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Code \u00a7 20-146.24(A) (emphases added). \u201cThe first step in the recognition and enforcement of a foreign child custody determination is registering that order with \u2018the appropriate juvenile and domestic relations district court in this Commonwealth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Prashad, 55 </em>Va.App. at 260, 685 S.E.2d at 205-06 (quoting Code \u00a7 20-146.26(A)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Upon receipt of the required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>documents, \u201cthe registering court <em>shall </em>[c]ause the determination to be filed as a foreign judgment.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-146.26(B)(1) (emphasis added). \u201c[D]uring registration, \u2018the scope of the enforcing court\u2019s inquiry is limited to the issue of whether the decreeing] court had jurisdiction and complied with due process in rendering the original custody decree. No further inquiry is necessary----\u2019\u201d <em>Prashad, 55 </em>Va.App. at 261, 685 S.E.2d at 206 (quoting UCCJEA Prefatory Note, 9 U.L.A. 649, 653 (1997)). Upon registration, the court <em>\u201cshall </em>recognize and enforce\u201d the \u201cregistered child custody determination.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-146.27(B) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">In the instant case, the parties agree that the Michigan court had jurisdiction and that it complied with due process in rendering the 2003 Michigan decree. Thus, \u201cunless some other statutory or constitutional provisions dictate otherwise,\u201d the circuit court was required to register and enforce the order. <em>See Prashad, 55 </em>Va.App. at 261, 685 S.E.2d at 206. Father suggests the circuit court could refuse to register the order under what he refers to as the \u201cclean hands\u201d component to the UCCJEA found in Code \u00a7 20-146.19. That code section provides in relevant part,</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Except as otherwise provided in \u00a7 20-146.15 or by other law of this Commonwealth, if a court of this Commonwealth has jurisdiction under this act because a person seeking to invoke its jurisdiction has engaged in unjustifiable conduct, the court shall decline to exercise its jurisdiction unless:</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">1. The parents and all persons acting as parents have acquiesced in the exercise of jurisdiction;</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">2. A court of the state otherwise having jurisdiction under \u00a7\u00a7 20-146.12, 20-146.13 or \u00a7 20-146.14 determines that this Commonwealth is a more appropriate forum under \u00a7 20-146.18; or</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">3. No court of any other state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in subsection B. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Code \u00a7 20-146.19(A). Assuming father is correct in his assertion that the circuit court could refuse to exercise its jurisdiction to register the orders for mother\u2019s misconduct under Code \u00a7 20-146.19(A), we find Code \u00a7 20-146.19(A) is not applicable to the facts of this case. Indeed, in the instant case, the circuit court did not \u201cdecline to exercise its jurisdiction.\u201d Rather, the court exercised its jurisdiction and simply decided not to register the various orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The problem in mother\u2019s case arises from the fact that the record clearly indicates the 2003 Michigan decree was modified as to visitation by the July 2008 visitation modification order, and as to custody by the 2008 Michigan custody modification order, which awarded father \u201ctemporary sole physical and sole legal custody\u201d of J.M. Although the circuit court did not rely on this reason in refusing to register the 2003 Michigan decree, Code \u00a7 20-146.24(A) expressly states that the Commonwealth will only recognize and enforce custody determinations of another state \u201cif ... the determination <em>has not been modified </em>in accordance with this act.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The 2003 Michigan decree was modified by both the July 2008 visitation modification order and the 2008 Michigan custody modification order. For that reason, the circuit court did not err in refusing to register and enforce the 2003 Michigan decree. \u2018\u201cWe do not hesitate, in a proper case, where the correct conclusion has been reached but the wrong reason given, to sustain the result and assign the right ground.\u2019\u201d <em>Harrison &amp; Bates, Inc. v. Featherstone Assocs. Ltd. Pshp., </em>253 Va. 364, 369, 484 S.E.2d 883, 886 (1997) (quoting <em>Robbins v. Grimes, </em>211 Va. 97, 100, 175 S.E.2d 246, 248 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny father\u2019s request to dismiss this case under the fugitive disentitlement doctrine, since that doctrine is not applicable to the facts presented here. On the merits, however, although we agree with mother that the circuit court\u2019s reason for refusing to register the 2003 Michigan decree based upon mother\u2019s misconduct was errone<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>ous, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s refusal to register and enforce the 2003 Michigan decree because the decree was subsequently modified in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-8\">. Although mother had provided the Michigan court with her Austrian address on July 1, 2008, father asserted he did not know mother\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>address in Austria. He explained that he served mother at her last known address in Michigan. The Michigan court accepted this explanation in finding mother had been properly served.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-9\">. Mother does not appeal the trial court\u2019s refusal to register the 2009 Austrian order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b685-7\">. Father did not attempt to register the July 2008 visitation modification order, nor does he appeal the circuit court\u2019s refusal to register and enforce the 2008 Michigan custody modification order; thus, neither order is before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b688-6\">. We recognize that this is not a child custody case in the classic sense, in that mother is merely seeking registration of the 2003 Michigan decree rather than a determination on the custody of J.M. We, nevertheless, believe the underlying policy considerations pertaining to custody are relevant to the applicability of the fugitive disentitlement doctrine in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\">. Code \u00a7 20-146.26(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">A child custody determination issued by a court of another state may be registered in this Commonwealth, with or without a simultaneous request for enforcement, by sending to the appropriate juvenile and domestic relations district court in this Commonwealth:</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">1.
