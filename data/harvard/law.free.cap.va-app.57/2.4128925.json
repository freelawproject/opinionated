On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in: 1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>finding he had no standing to challenge the search of the automobile in which he was a passenger; 2) denying his motion to suppress the heroin and the gun; 3) finding the evidence sufficient to prove he possessed the firearm while simultaneously in possession of heroin; 4) denying his motion to dismiss the felony firearm indictment for containing a fatal variance; and 5) finding the evidence sufficient to prove possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. For the reasons stated, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Special Agent P.N. Gallaceio of the Virginia State Police and Norfolk Police Officer W.K. Winningear, on September 3, 2008, stopped a vehicle for a defective equipment violation because the license plate bulb was burned out. While the stop was in progress, appellant, the right rear passenger, \u201cturned around\u201d several times and Gallaceio lost sight of appellant\u2019s head \u201cas if he was bending over in the seat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">After approaching the car, Gallaceio asked appellant for identification. Appellant stated that he had none. Gallaceio asked the front seat passenger for her identification, and she gave him a driver\u2019s license. Appellant then handed his license to Gallaceio. Gallaceio noticed that appellant did not appear nervous at that time. Gallaceio gave the licenses to Officer Winningear. It was then discovered that the front female passenger had outstanding warrants. For that reason, she was removed from the car. During this time, appellant was \u201cconstantly turning around and observing [the police] and [their] actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">While appellant was still in the car, Gallaceio watched him as he tried to light a cigarette. Gallaceio observed that appellant was having difficulty doing so because he was \u201cshaking unbelievably in his seat.\u201d Gallaceio testified, \u201cin my 13 years of experience watching traffic stops, I\u2019d never seen anybody struggle to light a cigarette as much as [appellant] did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Winningear returned appellant\u2019s license to him and asked the driver for consent to search the vehicle. The driver did not consent. The officers told the occupants they were going to screen the vehicle with a drug dog.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At that point, the officers asked appellant and the driver to get out of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">After the driver got out of the vehicle, he and Officer Winningear engaged in a brief conversation before the driver abruptly retrieved his keys from the console and started the engine. In trying to keep the driver from leaving, Winningear struggled with the driver, and the driver fled. The driver was not apprehended that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">When appellant got out of the car, Gallaccio observed needle marks on appellant\u2019s arms. He also saw that appellant\u2019s hands were \u201cballed up,\u201d there was \u201ctension in his arms,\u201d and he appeared nervous. When asked why, appellant responded, \u201cbecause cops around here beat people up for no reason.\u201d Appellant then placed his hands in his pockets. Gallaccio advised him to take his hands out of his pockets and that he was going to pat him down for weapons. Appellant was instructed to walk to the back of the police vehicle, but he continued to walk past that vehicle. When he was passing another police vehicle, Special Agent Gallaccio grabbed him by the back of his shirt because he \u201cthought something was afoot.\u201d Gallaccio testified that he thought appellant was going to run. As Gallaccio grabbed him, appellant took his hands out of his pockets and dropped a white pill bottle that contained eleven capsules of heroin. After a brief struggle with appellant, Gallaccio placed appellant under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">At the suppression hearing, Gallaccio testified without objection that he searched the vehicle \u201cincident to arrest.\u201d He also testified at trial that he searched the car because the driver ran, so the car was going to have to be towed and he was \u201cinventorying the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Inside the car, the officers recovered one firearm from under the driver\u2019s seat. Another firearm was found in the back seat area under the right passenger seat. The barrel was facing forward \u201cwith the magazine port facing toward the right as if someone was sitting there and stuck it right there.\u201d Gallaccio testified that he believed it would have been visible to someone sitting in the rear passenger seat. A DNA test was performed on the gun found in the back seat area, and no DNA was recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\n<em>Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in ruling that he did not have standing to challenge the illegal search of the vehicle and the seizure of the weapons. As a result of the court\u2019s ruling, reasons appellant, the guns recovered from the car were erroneously admitted into evidence. The Commonwealth argues that the trial court properly found that <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978), prevents appellant, as a passenger, from challenging the search of the vehicle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">At oral argument, we asked counsel to file supplemental briefs to address the applicability of <em>Rakas </em>and <em>Brendlin v. California, </em>551 U.S. 249, 127 S.Ct. 2400, 168 L.Ed.2d 132 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">At the suppression hearing, the Commonwealth initially raised the argument that appellant, as a passenger, would not have standing to challenge the search of the vehicle pursuant to <em>Rakas. </em>Appellant agreed, stating that he has \u201cvery little standing to contest the search.\u201d The trial court, citing <em>Rakas, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>ruled that appellant, as a passenger, could not challenge the search and recovery of the firearms. Appellant responded, \u201cyes, sir.\u201d In a timely filed motion to vacate, appellant cited <em>Brendlin </em>and contended that contrary to the trial court\u2019s ruling, appellant does have standing to contest the search of the vehicle and the seizure of the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">We agree with the trial court that <em>Rakas </em>controls. Rakas was a passenger in an automobile in which police found a box of rifle shells in a locked glove compartment and a sawed-off rifle under the front passenger seat. 439 U.S. at 130, 99 S.Ct. at 423-24. The Supreme Court rejected Rakas\u2019 argument that simply being a passenger in the vehicle afforded him standing to contest the search of the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 148, 99 S.Ct. at 432-33. Rakas neither owned nor leased the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 140, 99 S.Ct. at 428-29. Significantly, the Supreme Court found Rakas \u201casserted neither a property nor a possessory interest in the automobile, nor an interest in the property seized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148, 99 S.Ct. at 433. The Court then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">Judged by the foregoing analysis, petitioners\u2019 claims must fail. They asserted neither a property nor a possessory interest in the automobile, nor an interest in the property seized. And as we have previously indicated, the fact that they were \u201clegitimately on [the] premises\u201d in the sense that they were in the car with the permission of its owner is not determinative of whether they had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the particular areas of the automobile searched.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">sj: :}: &amp;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">But here petitioners\u2019 claim is one which would fail even in an analogous situation in a dwelling place, since they made no showing that they had any legitimate expectation of privacy in the glove compartment or area under the seat of the car in which they were merely passengers. Like the trunk of an automobile, these are areas in which a passen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>ger <em>qua </em>passenger simply would not normally have a legitimate expectation of privacy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 148-49, 99 S.Ct. at 433 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Appellant argues <em>Brendlin </em>supports his position. We find that his reliance is misplaced. <em>Brendlin </em>does not address a defendant passenger\u2019s right to contest the search of the vehicle; <em>Brendlin </em>addresses only a passenger\u2019s challenge to the stop itself. The Supreme Court concluded a passenger may bring a Fourth Amendment challenge to the legality of a traffic stop because the passenger is seized as a result of the traffic stop. <em>Brendlin, </em>551 U.S. at 255, 127 S.Ct. at 2405-06. The Court reasoned, \u201cA traffic stop necessarily curtails the travel a passenger has chosen just as much as it halts the driver, diverting both from the stream of traffic to the side of the road....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257, 127 S.Ct. at 2407. The Court added,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUV\">If the likely wrongdoing is not the driving, the passenger will reasonably feel subject to suspicion owning to close association; but even when the wrongdoing is only bad driving, the passenger will expect to be subject to some scrutiny, and his attempt to leave the scene would be so obviously likely to prompt an objection from the officer that no passenger would feel free to leave in the first place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqh\"><em>Id. </em>By its own language, <em>Brendlin </em>does not address whether a passenger can challenge the legality of a search of the vehicle in which he is a passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Appellant further cites <em>Arizona v. Johnson, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 781, 172 L.Ed.2d 694 (2009), to support his contention. However, <em>Johnson </em>simply reiterates the <em>Brendlin </em>ruling that \u201c[a] passenger therefore has standing to challenge a stop\u2019s constitutionality.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>129 S.Ct. at 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Under <em>Rakas, </em>we begin our analysis by noting that appellant bears the burden of proving that he has standing to assert the constitutional right. <em>Abell v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 607, 614, 272 S.E.2d 204, 208 (1980). In keeping with <em>Rakas, </em>\u201c[t]he test is whether the appellant objectively had a reasonable expectation of privacy at the time and place of the disputed search.\u201d <em>McCoy v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 309, 311, 343 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>S.E.2d 383, 385 (1986). In determining whether an expectation of privacy is objectively reasonable, a court looks to the totality of the circumstances,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\">\u201cinclud[ing] whether the defendant has a possessory interest in ... the place searched, whether he has the right to exclude others from that place, whether he has exhibited a subjective expectation that it would remain free from governmental invasion, whether he took normal precautions to maintain his privacy and whether he was legitimately on the premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 312, 343 S.E.2d at 385 (quoting <em>United States v. Haydel, </em>649 F.2d 1152, 1155 (5th Cir.1981)). <em>See also Barnes v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 130, 135, 360 S.E.2d 196, 200 (1987) (discussing that defendant failed to meet his burden where he showed he had permission to be present in the place searched but did not have a key, did not keep property there, and could not exclude others), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 1036, 108 S.Ct. 763, 98 L.Ed.2d 779 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The Commonwealth argues, and we agree, that appellant asserted neither a property nor a possessory interest in the vehicle. Because appellant asserted a Fourth Amendment violation, it was his burden to show he had standing to challenge the search of the vehicle. At no point did he claim any interest in the vehicle or in the weapons found inside. From this record, it is clear that appellant did not own the vehicle and was in the vehicle to purchase heroin. All that appellant has shown is that he was a passenger in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Appellant contends <em>Arnold v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 313, 437 S.E.2d 235 (1993), modifies <em>Rakas. </em>We disagree. In <em>Arnold, </em>we held that a passenger had an expectation of privacy in a shopping bag found on the vehicle\u2019s floor at his feet. <em>Id. </em>at 316, 437 S.E.2d at 237. We distinguished <em>Rakas </em>in two respects. First, we found that in <em>Rakas, </em>the question was \u201ca narrow one: Did the search of their friend\u2019s automobile after they had left it violate any Fourth Amendment right of the petitioners?\u201d <em>Id. </em>We further distinguished <em>Rakas </em>be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>cause there, \u201cthe defendants asserted no interest in the property seized.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Also of note in <em>Arnold, </em>Arnold never denied ownership of the items seized. In the instant case, unlike Arnold, appellant denied any interest in the weapon seized. While such a denial is not determinative of the issue, it clearly is a factor as part of the totality of the circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Under a totality of the circumstances approach, we find appellant did not have standing to challenge the search of the vehicle. He made no showing that he had a possessory interest in the car, that he had the right to exclude others from the vehicle, that he had exhibited a subjective expectation that the vehicle and its contents would remain free from governmental invasion, that he exercised control over the vehicle, or that appellant took any precautions to maintain his privacy. As in <em>Rakas, </em>appellant has not shown he has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area under the seat where the guns were located. Appellant was nothing more than a temporary passenger in another\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Appellant\u2019s contention that simply being a legitimate passenger affords him an expectation of privacy was clearly rejected in <em>Rakas. </em>\u201c[T]he fact that they were \u2018legitimately on [the] premises\u2019 in the sense that they were in the car with the permission of its owner is not determinative of whether they had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the particular areas of the automobile searched.\u201d <em>Rakas, </em>439 U.S. at 148, 99 S.Ct. at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Since we conclude appellant failed to meet his burden, we do not address the legality of the seizure of the weapon in the vehicle. We find the trial court did not err in determining appellant had no standing to challenge the search of the vehicle and the seizure of the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\n<em>Duration of the Stop</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Appellant argues that once his identification was returned to him, there was no justification to detain him further, reasoning that there was no independent reasonable suspicion to detain appellant once he left the vehicle. Appellant also contends that Officer Winningear had no further particularized information of ongoing criminal activity when he chose to have the car checked by a drug dog.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Appellant cites a variety of cases in support of his position that the officers detained the occupants of the vehicle after the traffic stop had ended, thereby turning the detention into a non-consensual encounter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s argument ignores the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Johnson, </em>where the Court found that police officers may detain a driver and any passengers \u201cpending inquiry into a vehicular violation,\u201d without \u201ccause to believe any occupant of the vehicle is involved in criminal activity.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>129 S.Ct. at 784. The Court recognized</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">temporary seizure of the driver and passengers ordinarily continues, and remains reasonable for the duration of the stop. Normally, the stop ends when the police have no further need to control the scene, and inform the driver and passengers that they are free to leave. An officer\u2019s inquiries into matters unrelated to the justification of the traffic stop, this Court has made plain, do not convert the encounter into something other than a lawful seizure, so long as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>those inquiries do not measurably extend the duration of the stop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Winningear estimated the entire encounter took between five and seven minutes, including the time to process the female passenger with her outstanding warrants. Investigator Glenn Gardiola, who was present at the traffic stop, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">During the course of [the] traffic stop, I encountered a female in the vehicle who was later identified as [having] outstanding warrants in Nassau County [New York] and LA county [California]---- I was taking her off to the side and verifying the facts of the warrants making sure they were still active and still valid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">;\u00a1: # # H\u00ed &amp;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-10\">As I was speaking to her and awaiting for verification for these warrants, I then observed Investigator Gallaccio and Investigator Measel in a physical struggle with [appellant] and at that time left my position to assist them in taking him into custody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">It is well established that a police officer making a routine traffic stop may order a passenger out of the car for safety reasons, even if the officer has no reason to suspect the passenger of criminal behavior. <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 111, 98 S.Ct. 330, 333-34, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977). However, \u201cwhen an officer makes a lawful traffic stop, the scope of the temporary detention may not exceed the purpose of the stop.\u201d <em>Dickerson v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 172, 177-78, 543 S.E.2d 623, 626 (2001) (citing <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 500, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 1325-26, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983) (plurality opinion)), <em>aff'd, </em>266 Va. 14, 581 S.E.2d 195 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">Here, Gallaccio asked appellant to step out of the car while Investigator Gardiola was still in the process of verifying the outstanding warrants on the female passenger. Because Gardiola observed Gallaccio struggle with appellant before the warrant check was complete, the evidence clearly shows that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Gallaccio\u2019s interaction with appellant occurred during the duration of the ongoing traffic stop, namely, securing the female passenger who had outstanding arrest warrants. It was not unreasonable for the officers to continue to detain appellant for a \u201creasonable period of time\u201d awaiting the results of the warrant check on the female passenger. <em>See Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 665, 674, 691 S.E.2d 801, 806 (2010) (\u201c[T]he temporary continued seizure of [appellant] did not amount to an unlawful detention because determining [appellant\u2019s] true identity was within the scope of the unchallenged investigatory stop and was not unreasonable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">We conclude that any detention of appellant was reasonable and took place while the investigation was ongoing, as the police had further need to control the scene. <em>Johnson, </em>129 S.Ct. at 788. Further questioning of appellant or the driver regarding possession of contraband did not constitute an illegal detention in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\n<em>Fruit of the Poisonous Tree</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Appellant claims that the drugs found in his possession should not have been admitted into evidence, as they were the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree,\u201d flowing from the unlawful search of the car. Appellant\u2019s argument presupposes that the search of the vehicle came first. Factually, this is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u201cIf evidence is seized during an illegal stop, it is not admissible at trial under the doctrine known as \u2018the fruit of the poisonous tree.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 666, 672, 594 S.E.2d 595, 598 (2004); <em>see Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 484-88, 83 S.Ct. 407, 415-18, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963) (excluding evidence obtained as the result of illegal police action). \u201c \u2018The exclusionary rule operates ... against evidence seized and information acquired during an unlawful search or seizure ... [and] against derivative evidence discovered because of the unlawful act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Watson v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 659, 662, 454 S.E.2d 358, 360 (1995) (quoting <em>Warlick v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 263, 265, 208 S.E.2d 746, 748 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Clearly, even if the search of the car was unlawful, which we do not decide, the drugs found on appellant did not flow from that search, but occurred prior to the search of the car. We cannot find, under these facts, that Gallaccio\u2019s recovery of the drugs was a fruit of the poisonous tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\n<em>Seizure of Appellant Outside the Vehicle</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In the alternative, appellant contends that Special Agent Gallaccio did not have reasonable suspicion to seize him once appellant exited the vehicle.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because of this illegal police action, argues appellant, the drugs should not have been admitted at trial. Because this issue does not involve a determination of whether appellant had standing to challenge the seizure and search of the vehicle, we address independently the seizure of his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u201cwe are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). The burden is on the defendant to show that the denial of his suppression motion, when the evidence is considered in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was reversible error. <em>McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 483, 489-90, 545 S.E.2d 541, 545 (2001). \u201c \u2018Ultimate questions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause to make a warrant-less search\u2019 \u201d involve questions of both law and fact and are reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>McGee, 25 </em>Va.App. at 198, 487 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>S.E.2d at 261 (quoting <em>Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 691, 116 S.Ct. at 1659).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">The Fourth Amendment prohibits only unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>James v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 740, 745, 473 S.E.2d 90, 92 (1996). If a police officer has reasonable, articulable suspicion that a person is engaging in, or is about to engage in, criminal activity, he may detain the person to conduct a brief investigation without violating the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). The reason for stopping an individual need not rise to the level of probable cause, but must be more than an \u201cinchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u201cReasonableness is judged from the perspective of a .reasonable officer on the scene allowing for the need of split-second decisions and without regard to the officer\u2019s intent or motivation.\u201d <em>Scott v.

While the traffic stop was in progress, Gallaccio observed appellant bobbing up and down in the car as if he was bending over the seat. Then, appellant began to behave strangely as soon as he was removed from the car. His hands were balled into fists and he continued to move in circles, ultimately in the direction of the police vehicle. Appellant\u2019s arms indicated he was a heavy drug user; his manner was very nervous. He did not comply with Special Agent Gallaccio\u2019s request to remove his hands from his pockets. <em>See Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>782, 792, 595 S.E.2d 30, 35 (2004) (finding appellant\u2019s refusal to remove his hand from his pocket is a factor to be considered in finding reasonable suspicion).

Hodges, </em>43 Va.App. 427, 430, 598 S.E.2d 760, 762 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in convicting him of possession of a firearm while in possession of heroin pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B). Appellant\u2019s argument appears to be twofold. First, he reasons that the evidence was insufficient to establish he constructively possessed the firearm. In the alternative, he argues that even if he was in constructive possession of the firearm, a conviction pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B) requires that he be in actual possession of the firearm. We disagree with appellant and find that appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>constructively possessed the firearm and was properly convicted under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4 provides in relevant part the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">A. It shall be unlawful for any person unlawfully in possession of a controlled substance classified in Schedule I or II of the Drug Control Act (\u00a7 <em>54.1-3400 </em>et seq.) of Title 54.1 to simultaneously with knowledge and intent possess any firearm. A violation of this subsection is a Class 6 felony and constitutes a separate and distinct felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">B. It shall be unlawful for any person unlawfully in possession of a controlled substance classified in Schedule I or II of the Drug Control Act (\u00a7 <em>54.l-3400 </em>et seq.) to simultaneously with knowledge and intent possess any firearm <em>on or about his person. A </em>violation of this subsection is a Class 6 felony and constitutes a separate and distinct felony and any person convicted hereunder shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of two years. Such punishment shall be separate and apart from, and shall be made to run consecutively with, any punishment received for the commission of the primary felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">(Emphasis added). \u201cWhere the General Assembly uses the word \u2018possess,\u2019 Virginia courts have typically held that proof of actual or constructive possession are both permissible.\u201d <em>Hunter v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 50, 58, 690 S.E.2d 792, 795 (2010). Therefore, by using the word \u201cpossess\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4, the General Assembly intended to \u201cproscribe either actual or constructive possession of the firearm.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Clearly, the evidence here does not prove actual possession, therefore our first inquiry is whether the facts support appellant\u2019s constructive possession of the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ\">\u201cTo establish constructive possession of the firearm by a defendant, the Commonwealth must present evidence of acts, statements, or conduct by the defendant or other facts and circumstances proving that the defendant was aware of the presence and character of the firearm and that the firearm was subject to his dominion and control. While the Commonwealth does not meet its burden of proof simply by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>showing the defendant\u2019s proximity to the firearm, it is a circumstance probative of possession and may be considered as a factor in determining whether the defendant possessed the firearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><em>Smallwood v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 625, 630-81, 688 S.E.2d 154, 157 (2009) (quoting <em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 144, 148, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008)) (other citations omitted). Further, \u201c[possession and not ownership is the vital issue. Possession may be joint or several. Two or more persons may be in possession where each has the power of control and intends to exercise control jointly.\u201d <em>Burnette v. Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 785, 792, 75 S.E.2d 482, 487 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Appellant was the only passenger in the back seat of the vehicle. While the traffic stop was in progress, Special Agent Gallaecio observed appellant turn around several times, then bend over such that Gallaecio lost sight of appellant\u2019s head. The firearm was located under the seat in front of appellant with the magazine port \u201cfacing forward as if someone was sitting there and stuck it right there.\u201d In addition, Gallaecio testified that he believed it would have been visible to someone sitting in the rear passenger seat. This evidence, coupled with appellant\u2019s nervous behavior, gave the trial court a reasonable basis to infer that appellant had knowledge that the firearm was under the seat in front of him and that it was within his dominion and control.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Turning to appellant\u2019s second argument, we now address whether appellant\u2019s constructive possession of the firearm places him within subsection (B) of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4. The statute proscribes two separate offenses, each of which is defined therein as a Class 6 felony. The offenses in subsections (A) and (B) are defined with almost identical language as the unlawful possession of certain enumerated controlled substances while \u201csimultaneously with knowledge and intent possessing] any firearm.\u201d Subsection (A) proscribes any such possession of a firearm, while subsection (B) proscribes such possession if the firearm is \u201con or about [the] person.\u201d Subsection (B) also provides a heightened penalty under those circumstances: \u201ca mandatory minimum term of imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>of two years.\u201d \u201c \u2018There can be no dispute that the purpose of the legislation was to establish [different] categories of crimes relating to possession of controlled substances and firearms at the same time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hunter, </em>56 Va.App. at 57, 690 S.E.2d at 795 (quoting <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 754, 759, 685 S.E.2d 655, 657 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Appellant contends that the additional language \u201con or about his person\u201d contained in subsection (B) requires the Commonwealth to prove actual, not constructive, possession. The Supreme Court has long interpreted the phrase \u201cabout his person\u201d to mean that a weapon must be \u201c \u2018so connected with the person as to be readily accessible for use or surprise, if desired.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pruitt v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 382, 388, 650 S.E.2d 684, 686 (2007) (quoting <em>Sutherland v. Commonwealth, </em>109 Va. 834, 835, 65 S.E. 15, 15 (1909)).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">This Court addressed the same issue in <em>Hunter, </em>56 Va.App. 50, 690 S.E.2d 792, and interpreted the language of subsection (B) to require either actual possession of the firearm, or constructive possession of the firearm in a vicinity about the person. <em>Id. </em>at 64, 690 S.E.2d at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">In other words, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, who possessed certain controlled substances, actually possessed the firearm \u201con ... his person\u201d; <em>or </em>that the defendant was aware of both the presence and character of the firearm, that the firearm was within the accused\u2019s dominion and control, and that the firearm was readily accessible for prompt and immediate use.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 65, 690 S.E.2d at 799 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">In <em>Hunter, </em>appellant was a front seat passenger in a car that was subject to a traffic stop. While lawfully searching the vehicle, Deputy Onderko recovered a firearm in the locked glove compartment. <em>Id. </em>at 55, 690 S.E.2d at 794. Hunter later told Onderko that he bought the gun in North Carolina for eighty dollars. <em>Id. </em>Appellant challenged his conviction pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B) arguing that the firearm was not \u201con or about\u201d his person. This Court found that even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>though Hunter constructively possessed the firearm, the General Assembly \u201cintended \u2018to require something more than constructive possession\u2019 of the firearm in subsection (B).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 690 S.E.2d at 797 (quoting <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 266, 280, 670 S.E.2d 772, 779 (2009)). We concluded that under the facts of that case, the evidence was insufficient to sustain Hunter\u2019s conviction pursuant to subsection (B). The Court reasoned that Hunter did not have a key to the locked glove compartment, therefore Hunter was not \u201cso connected with the firearm \u2018for any appreciable period of time\u2019 so as to make the firearm \u2018so accessible ... as to prompt and immediate use.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65, 690 S.E.2d at 799 (quoting <em>Pruitt, </em>274 Ya. at 388, 650 S.E.2d at 687).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Here, the facts support a contrary conclusion. The firearm, which was recovered from the back seat area under the right passenger seat, was visible to someone sitting in the rear passenger seat. The barrel was facing forward, and it appeared as though someone had just placed it there. The evidence proves that the firearm was \u201creadily accessible for prompt and immediate use\u201d to whoever was sitting in the passenger seat. Further, appellant was seen making furtive gestures in that seat, corroborating the fact finder\u2019s reasonable conclusion that he had immediate dominion and control over the weapon. At trial, Special Agent Gallaccio testified that he located the firearm under the passenger seat \u201cas if it\u2019s in my hand and I placed it underneath the seat to the right.\u201d Pursuant to <em>Hunter, </em>we find that the trial court did not err in convicting appellant of possession of the firearm under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\n<em>The Indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Appellant argues the trial court committed reversible error in convicting him of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon because a fatal variance existed between the amended indictment<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the proof offered at trial. In partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>ular, he asserts that because the indictment omitted the words \u201cwithin ten years\u201d the indictment did not plead specific charging information that would demand a mandatory sentence upon conviction. Appellant asks that this indictment be dismissed, or in the alternative remand for re-sentencing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The Commonwealth contends appellant\u2019s fatal variance argument is waived because appellant agreed to the amended indictment that deleted the words \u201cviolent felony.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">While appellant\u2019s question presented contends there was a fatal variance between the indictment and the proof, the question presented also appears to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence as to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. It is not clear if the sufficiency contention is an independent argument or simply part of the fatal variance contention. Thus, we will address both issues separately.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\u201c \u2018The function of an indictment ... is to give an accused notice of the nature and character of the accusations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>against him in order that he can adequately prepare to defend against his accuser.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sloan v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 240, 246, 544 S.E.2d 375, 378 (2001) (quoting <em>Morris v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 664, 668, 536 S.E.2d 458, 460 (2000)) (other citations omitted). Accordingly, Code \u00a7 19.2-220 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\">The indictment or information shall be a plain, concise and definite written statement, (1) naming the accused, (2) describing the offense charged, (3) identifying the county, city or town in which the accused committed the offense, and (4) reciting that the accused committed the offense on or about a certain date. In describing the offense, the indictment or information may use the name given to the offense by the common law, or the indictment or information may state so much of the common law or statutory definition of the offense as is sufficient to advise what offense is charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">When a statute contains more than one grade of offense carrying different punishments, \u201c \u2018the indictment must contain an assertion of the facts essential to the punishment sought to be imposed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sloan, </em>35 Va.App. at 246, 544 S.E.2d at 378 (quoting <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 192, 198, 497 S.E.2d 908, 910 (1998)). However, Code \u00a7 19.2-220 does not require an indictment to affirmatively set forth the punishment for the offense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Appellant argues that because the amended indictment did not contain the words \u201cwithin ten years\u201d that would require a two-year mandatory sentence, the indictment did not allege specific information that would allow the trial court to convict and sentence him for a Class 6 felony with a mandatory sentence of two years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) contains several distinct punishments. One who knowingly and intentionally possesses any firearm shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. However, the same section requires a mandatory sentence if the person has previously been convicted of a violent felony or has been previously convicted of any felony within ten years. Our inquiry is whether the mandatory sentences are grades of the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>carrying different punishments or simply different punishments for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">This Court addressed and resolved this very issue in <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 748, 561 S.E.2d 56 (2002). In <em>Thomas, </em>appellant was convicted of being in possession of a firearm as a convicted felon in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. At trial, the Commonwealth introduced appellant\u2019s prior conviction for burglary, a violent felony. Although the indictment did not so state, the \u201csentencing guidelines\u201d upon which the trial court based it sentence, referred to the burglary conviction as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d that triggered a \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d period of incarceration prescribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. Appellant challenged the indictment, arguing that the indictment did not \u201cspecifically allege the existence of a previous \u2018violent felony conviction as an element of the offense\u201d necessary to result in the mandatory sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 754, 561 S.E.2d at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The indictments in <em>Thomas </em>and in the instant case are almost identical. Thomas argued, as does appellant here, that the language requiring a mandatory sentence is a separate grade of offense that carries a different punishment. We rejected that argument in <em>Thomas, </em>concluding that the mandatory sentencing provisions simply define punishments within the Class 6 felony range. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">Defendant\u2019s argument, however, is belied by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A), a statute intended to \u201cprevent[ ] a person, who is known to have committed a serious crime in the past, from becoming dangerously armed, regardless of whether that person uses, displays, or conceals the firearm.\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 354, 358, 429 S.E.2d 615, 617, <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>17 Va.App. 233, 436 S.E.2d 192 (1993). The proscribed conduct, together with the attendant elements, is clearly defined in the initial sentence of the statute and punishable as \u201ca Class 6 felony.\u201d Consistent with the intendment of the enactment, an accused having been previously convicted of a \u201cviolent felony\u2019 is subject to a period of mandatory incarceration, a sentence within the range of a Class 6 felony but beyond trial court discretion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, such disparate penalties do not spawn gradations of the offense. The crime is not defined by the penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><em>Id. </em>(other citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Appellant seeks to distinguish <em>Thomas </em>from <em>McKinley v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 1, 225 S.E.2d 352 (1976), <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 350, 352, 381 S.E.2d 512, 513 (1989), and <em>Moore, </em>27 Va.App. 192, 497 S.E.2d 908. However, each of these cases involves grades of offense. In <em>Thomas, </em>we distinguished these three cases on that basis. Distinguishing Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 from the statutes addressed in those three cases, we concluded, \u201c[i]n each instance, unlike Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, the legislature criminalized discrete <em>conduct, </em>oftentimes aggravated by a \u2018gradation or nexus crime,\u2019 but always differentiated both by elements and penalty.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>37 Va.App. at 755, 561 S.E.2d at 59 (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, </em>263 Va. 13, 18, 557 S.E.2d 223, 225 (2002)) (emphasis in original). Thus, we conclude the indictment need not allege the \u201cwithin the prior ten years\u201d language to authorize the imposition of a mandatory sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Finally, appellant argues the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for possession of a firearm as a convicted felon. Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 makes it unlawful for any person who has been convicted of a felony to knowingly and intentionally possess or transport any firearm or ammunition for a firearm. Appellant argues that the evidence here was insufficient to sustain his conviction because he did not \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d possess the firearm. As discussed previously, we conclude that appellant constructively possessed the firearm because it was within appellant\u2019s immediate dominion and control, and therefore we found that he possessed the weapon within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4(B). Based upon the same rationale, we conclude that appellant also possessed the weapon for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. Because proof of appellant\u2019s prior 2001 felony conviction for distribution of imitation cocaine was admitted into evidence without objection, we find all the elements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 were met and affirm appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of a firearm as a convicted felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the trial court did not err in finding appellant guilty of possession of heroin, possession of a firearm while in possession of heroin, and possession of a firearm as a convicted felon. Accordingly, the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b57-8\">.

This contention is moot, as the record does not reflect that any contraband was recovered as a result of the drug dog's presence at the scene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b63-9\">. In both <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 28, 32, 581 S.E.2d 206, 209 (2003), and <em>Reittinger v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 232, 236, 532 S.E.2d 25, 27 (2000), cases cited by appellant in support of his position, the traffic stop had terminated when the officers continued the detention of the stopped vehicle's occupants. In each case, a reasonable person would not have known that the investigation of the traffic offense had ended and would not have felt free to disregard the officer\u2019s questions or have felt free to leave. Such is not the case here, and we do not find these decisions persuasive in our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b66-8\">. At the hearing on the motion to suppress the trial court ruled, \"I don\u2019t believe that the Court can find today that the stop and seizure or the part that he does have the constitutional standing to challenge today was unlawful and in violation of his constitutional rights.\u201d From this statement, we conclude that the trial court ruled that appellant did have standing to challenge the seizure of his person after he exited the vehicle. Therefore, we address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b73-7\">. The amended indictment provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>On or about September 3, 2008, in the City of Norfolk, KENTORA DELVONTAE ATKINS did feloniously, knowingly and intentionally possess or transport a firearm, after having been previously convicted of a felony, under the laws of this Commonwealth, another state, the District of Columbia, the United States or any of its territories. Va.Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b74-8\">. While appellant frames his argument as a \u201cfatal variance\u201d requiring the indictment to be dismissed, the proper analysis is whether a mandatory sentence is proper under the language of the amended indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b74-9\">. The Commonwealth contends appellant invited this error by agreeing to the amended indictment at trial. Given our holding, we need not rule on this contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b74-10\">. Appellant\u2019s question presented asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">Did the trial court commit reversible error and/or abuse its discretion and/or commit plain error when it ruled that the evidence was sufficient to convict Defendant on the amended indictment of Possession of Firearm by Non-violent felon (18.2-308.2) because there was not sufficient evidence that Defendant possessed said firearm and/or because there exists a reversible error variance between the indictment and proof in that the amended indictment did not contain the words \"within ten years\u201d that would be required for the two year mandatory sentence that the court ruled it had to impose?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
