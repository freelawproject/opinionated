In the absence of proof, it will not be presumed the corporation newspaper, in which such notices are published, was a Sunday paper, but rather, that the ten consecutive days mentioned in the printer\u2019s certificate of publication were secular days.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b298-9\" pgmap=\"298\">3.

The proof shows it has no foundation, as the notice was published six consecutive days, excluding Sunday, and, therefore, in compliance with the ordinance.</p> <p id=\"b299-13\" pgmap=\"299\">The second point made is, that the notice given by the collector, upon receipt of the warrant for collecting the assessment, was not published the length of time required by law.</p> <p id=\"b299-14\" pgmap=\"299(20) 300(71)\">The record shows this notice was published ten days consecutively, commencing with the 2d of October. Were it shown the paper, in which this notice was published, was published on Sunday, then, in view of the case of Scammon v. The City of Chicago, 40 Ill. 147, as two Sundays intervened, the notice would be insufficient; but there is no proof the corporation newspaper was a Sunday paper, and we can not presume it, but would rather presume the ten consecutive days mentioned in the printer\u2019s certificate were secular days.</p> <p id=\"b300-5\" pgmap=\"300\">Besides, the collector\u2019s report, verified by his oath, shows the notice was published ten days, which will be taken to mean secular days, and his affidavit is,prima facie evidence of the fact.</p> <p id=\"b300-6\" pgmap=\"300\">The remaining point made by appellants is, that the assessment was levied upon the front foot, and not according to the special benefits to each lot, and they should have been allowed to show this fact to the court, citing City of Chicago v. Larned, 34 Ill. 282, and City of Ottawa v. Spencer, 40 ib. 211.</p> <p id=\"b300-7\" pgmap=\"300\">The,record shows that the assessment was upon property * specially; benefited, in the judgment of the commissioners, and \u2022 tlieir-;ju9gment could not be impeached, except for fraud. This ppint is fully disposed of by the case of Wright v. Chicago, and Eva Lawrence v. same, ante pp. 285, 292. These :cases also dispose of the objection to the exclusion of Bailey\u2019s testimony.</p> <p id=\"b300-10\" pgmap=\"300\">Objections of the character here presented should be made at the proper time, before the common council. If they disallow them, he might enjoin the proceedings, if there had been fraud in the assessment, or made on a wrong basis. It is not fair, or just, that a party should lie by until the improvement is made, and then, by his objections, impose the whole burden of the improvement upon .the city or upon other property holders, the full benefit of which he enjoys.</p> <p id=\"b300-11\" pgmap=\"300\">Perceiving no error in the record, the judgment must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b300-12\" pgmap=\"300\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
