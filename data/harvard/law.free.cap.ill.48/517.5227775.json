That a plea in abatement, and several pleas in bar, were .filed ip that cause; that under the advice of counsel, she relied upon, \"and prepared proof under the plea in abatement, and her attorney, having taken offense at her husband, abandoned \u25a0the case ;\u2022 at the trial she was compelled to employ other counsel- nqt familiar with the case, and when the trial was had, the court-held, that by filing the pleas in bar the plea in abatement was waived; that appellee, owing to the want of preparation on the part of appellant, recovered judgment, which appellant removed to the supreme court by appeal, and the same was argued at the April term, 1867, of that court, and a decision was subsequently rendered reversing the judgment of the court below, but giving appellee the right, if she should choose, to remit $300, and enter judgment for the balance of the verdict.</p> <p id=\"b522-8\" pgmap=\"522\">The prayer is for an injunction to restrain the entry of the judgment at law, or the further prosecution of the suit, and that the partnership matters be closed up and settled. Appellee filed a demurrer to the bill, which was sustained by the court and the bill dismissed, and the case is now brought to this court, and a reversal is asked upon the ground that the bill presented grounds for equitable relief.</p> <p id=\"b523-5\" pgmap=\"523\">The doctrine is well settled, that courts of equity will restrain courts of law from proceeding to judgment, or, if judgment has been rendered, from its collection, if the defendant has a defense in equity which could not be made at law, and which renders the judgment, when obtained, inequitable and unjust; or, where the judgment is obtained and the defendant had a good legal defense, but has been deprived of it by accident, mistake or fraud, a court of equity will decree a new trial at law. But in this case it is not claimed that the defense is equitable. It consists, according to the allegations of the bill, in claims for the value of property sold, damages sustained by breach of warranty on the sale of property, and for money loaned. For any and all of these a suit at ..-law-\"' could be maintained, or the damages which are claimed. to have arisen out of the contract upon which appellant wads\u00fa'\u00e9d,with other indebtedness, were proper matter of set-off /bi||at;; suit. As to the damage claimed to have arisen fromAhe wrongful attachment of appellant\u2019s property, the rem^A?lSl ample and complete on the attachment bond. So of damages^ sustained, if the writ was improperly sued out, by garnisheeing Fleming. Hone of these grounds give jurisdiction to a court of equity to stay the collection of the judgment.</p> <p id=\"b523-6\" pgmap=\"523(147) 524(37)\">FTor does it appear that there was accident, mistake or fraud, such as would authorize a court of equity to decree a new trial at law. Appellant appeared, filed pleas, introduced evidence, and had a trial of the cause, and the mere fact that her attorney gave her advice which turned out to be opposed to the judgment of the court, or the fact that her attorney abandoned the case before the trial, does not constitute accident or mistake of the character upon which a court of equity acts. It might have afforded ground for delaying the trial below, if application had been made for the purpose. Such mistakes as giving advice that is not sustained by the court, has never been held to be such a mistake as will afford equitable relief. Flor has the abandonment of the cause by the attorney of a party, where other counsel has been employed and a trial had, been held to be an accident affording ground for relief, These defenses, so far as they could be interposed, should have been set up at law.</p> <p id=\"b524-6\" pgmap=\"524(338) 525(45)\">It remains to determine, whether the court below should have denied the injunction and retained the bill for the statement of the accounts between the parties, alleged to have been made while the partnership existed. The bill does not appear to have been framed with a view to having a statement of accounts, but rather and only with the purpose of obtaining an injunction to stay the proceedings at law. It is true, that the bill alleges that the books were to have been balanced and accounts settled, which had not been done; that Grosvenor ascertained, from an examination, that he was indebted to appellant, and designed to prevent a settlement of the accounts for the purpose of defrauding her. There is no positive averment that Grosvenor or appellee is indebted to appellant on account of the firm business ; nor is there any allegation that she ever called upon appellee for a settlement, or that appellee designed to defraud her. The allegation is, that it was her husband, who was her agent, who had that design, hior does the prayer indicate that the bill proceeded for a settlement of accounts. It is that the partnership matters may be closed up and settled. There is no prayer that they be required to make out and submit an account, and that the balance on their partnership dealings may be ascertained, and for a decree for the balance to appellant. And in the bill it is alleged that appellant had purchased out Grosvenor\u2019s interest, or that which he represented, in the firm, and took a bill of sale, and that she then paid him $3,230. This allegation seems to be repugnant to the claim that there was not a settlement of the firm business. Also that there remained about four hundred dollars unpaid on the bill of. sale. If Grosvenor had been indebted to her on account of firm matters, why pay him over three thousand dollars and say that there still remained over four hundred dollars unpaid on the purchase ? This, certainly, is a clear admission that nothing was owing her from that source, and, unexplained, fully warranted the court below in sustaining the demurrer, if it was claimed that the bill was filed for an account.</p> <p id=\"b525-6\" pgmap=\"525\">We perceive no error in this record, and the decree of the court below is, therefore, affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b525-7\" pgmap=\"525\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
