Permission was granted to file an amended petition, on filing and reading of which the court is of the opinion that the application should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Two points are presented for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-9\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> If it be true, as alleged, that petitioner is being again prosecuted for an offense for which he was once in jeopardy, he may upon the trial of his case plead such conviction and establish the identity of the cases by evidence, the burden being on him. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Faust, </em>113 Cal. 172,176, [45 Pac. 261].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-10\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Petitioner also contends that he is being held to answer in the superior court of the city and county of San Francisco on excessive bail. If this be true, it does not appear that he has made timely or any application to the court below for a reduction of the amount. Until he has done so and been denied any relief, we do not feel that this court is in a position to entertain an application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>on that ground.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">The writ is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
