Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>tion 580 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: \u201cThe relief granted to the plaintiff, if there be no answer, cannot exceed that which he shall have demanded in his complaint.\u201d (St<em>aacke </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>125 Cal. 309, [57 Pac. 1012].) And in <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Forington, </em>117 Cal. 219, [48 Pac. 1073], it is said: \u201cThe relief \u2018demanded in his complaint\u2019 is held to refer to the relief asked in the prayer\u2014the feature of the pleading to which alone reference may be had in default cases, to ascertain what relief plaintiff seeks1; and the rule of the statute applies in its strictness to actions of foreclosure alike with those of any other character.\u201d <bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Under the rule \u2018stated, plaintiff was not entitled to judgment for interest other than as demanded at the rate of seven per cent per annum from the nineteenth day of October, 1918; nor, since no demand was made for any sum on account of taxes paid, was-he entitled to judgment therefor in the sum of $120.22. It thus appears that in rendering judgment the court erred in allowing $441 for interest, when the amount should have been $233.33, and likewise erred in allowing $120.22 for taxes, the total of which is $327.89 in excess of the amount which should have been awarded to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Conrey, P.
