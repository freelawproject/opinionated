Ferguson, an Alabama prisoner proceeding <em>pro </em>se, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habe-as corpus petition. We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following two issues: (1) whether the district court erred when it denied appellant\u2019s self-representation claims in the absence of the trial transcript; and (2) whether the district court erred when it found that appellant\u2019s claim concerning the withdrawal of his waiver of the right-to-counsel had been adjudicated on the merits in state court. Ferguson argues that the district court erred when it denied his claim that the state court violated his right to due process by (1) failing to insure that he had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel and had elected to represent himself at trial, and (2) failing to conduct a Faretta<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing. Ferguson concedes that he told the state court that he wanted to represent himself, but alleges that the state trial court failed to apprise him of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. Ferguson also alleges that standby counsel was appointed to assist him, but that counsel interfered with his right to self-representation by refusing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>assist him in subpoenaing three witnesses and refusing to allow him to cross-examine a state witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">Second, Ferguson argues that the district court erred when it found that the state court of appeals had adjudicated on the merits his claim concerning the withdrawal of his waiver of the right-to-counsel. He asserts that the state court of appeals never addressed this issue and contends that, for this reason, the district court should have reviewed the claim <em>de novo. </em>Ferguson further argues that the state trial court did not inform him of his ability to withdraw his waiver of counsel at any time during the proceeding, as it was required to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">For the reasons set forth more fully below, we vacate and remand to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-7\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition <em>de novo </em>but are \u201chighly deferential\u201d to the state court\u2019s decision. <em>Davis v. Jones, </em>506 F.3d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir.2007). As amended by the AEDPA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) forbids federal courts from granting habeas relief on claims that were previously adjudicated in state court, unless the adjudication</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1168-8\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1168-9\">(2) resulted in a decision based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1168-11\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). We have held that a state court\u2019s summary rejection of a claim qualifies as an adjudication on the merits under \u00a7 2254(d) so as to warrant deference. <em>Wright v. Moore, </em>278 F.3d 1245, 1253-54 (11th Cir.2002). In <em>Wright, </em>the defendant argued, as does Ferguson, that the district court erroneously gave deference under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) to the state court\u2019s rejection of his constitutional claim where the state court issued a two-sentence opinion affirming the defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1252-54. We concluded, however, that the defendant\u2019s federal claim was \u201craised on direct appeal and rejected on the merits without discussion\u201d by the state appellate court and the state appellate court\u2019s summary rejection of the claim was thus an adjudication on the merits. <em>Id. </em>at 1253-54. We reasoned that the plain language of the statute only required \u201ca rejection of the claim on the merits, not an explanation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1254-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-12\">Ferguson raised his Sixth Amendment claim in a Rule 32 petition for post-conviction relief. The state appellate court summarized the claim in a memorandum order before expressly rejecting all of Ferguson\u2019s claims. Under <em>Wright, </em>Ferguson\u2019s argument that the claim was never directly addressed on the merits is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-14\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition, we \u201creview questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact <em>de novo, </em>and findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Nyland v. Moore, </em>216 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cA district court\u2019s conclusion that a defendant\u2019s waiver [of assistance of counsel] is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>valid\u2014that it is knowing, voluntary, and intelligent\u2014is a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo.\u201d United State v. Kimball, </em>291 F.3d 726, 730 (11th Cir.2002) (per <em>curiam). </em>In a habeas proceeding challenging a conviction, the petitioner has the burden of proving that the waiver did not meet constitutional standards. <em>Strozier v. Newsome, </em>926 F.2d 1100, 1104 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">The Supreme Court has held that a defendant has a right to represent himself but, in order to represent himself, he must \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d waive his right to counsel. <em>Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. at 2541. We have held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1169-6\">To invoke his Sixth Amendment right under <em>Faretta </em>a defendant does not need to recite some talismanic formula hoping to open the eyes and ears of the court to his request. Insofar as the desire to proceed <em>pro se </em>is concerned, petitioner must do no more than state his request, either orally or in writing, unambiguously to the court so that no reasonable person can say that the request was not made. In this Circuit, the court must then conduct a hearing on the waiver of the right to counsel to determine whether the accused understands the risks of proceeding <em>pro se.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtL\"><em>Stano v. Dugger, </em>921 F.2d 1125, 1143 (11th Cir.1991) (citations omitted). The purpose of the <em>Faretta </em>inquiry is to allow the trial court to determine whether the defendant understands the risks of self-representation, and the trial court should inform the defendant of the nature of the charges against him, possible punishments, basic trial procedure and the hazards of representing himself. <em>United States v. Kimball, </em>291 F.3d 726, 730 (11th Cir.2002). The Supreme Court algo has held that \u201cthe <em>pro se </em>defendant is entitled to preserve actual control over the case he chooses to present to the jury- If standby counsel\u2019s participation over the defendant\u2019s objection effectively allows counsel to make or substantially interfere with any significant tactical decisions, or to control the questioning of witnesses, or to speak instead of the defendant on any matter of importance, the <em>Faretta </em>right is eroded.\u201d <em>McKaskle v. Wiggins, </em>465 U.S. 168, 178, 104 S.Ct. 944, 951, 79 L.Ed.2d 122 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-10\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(f), where the petitioner challenges the sufficiency of the evidence used to support the state court\u2019s factual determinations, the petitioner has the burden to provide the district court with the relevant portions of the state trial court record. Nevertheless, if the petitioner \u201cbecause of indigency or other reason is unable to produce such part of the record, then the State shall produce such part of the record and the Federal court shall direct the State to do so.\u201d <em>(Id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-11\">Here, the district court ordered the state to provide those portions of the state trial court record, including transcripts, relevant to the issues addressed in its answer. Although the state provided several exhibits from the state court record, it failed to provide any transcripts of the trial proceedings. Nevertheless, the state did provide the district court with a copy of the state court of appeals\u2019 opinion affirming the denial of Ferguson\u2019s Rule 32 petition for post-conviction relief, which extensively references the state trial court transcript. Although the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) requires that district court\u2019s review factual determinations by \u201ca State court\u201d with deference, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), (e)(1),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the question of whether</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>a defendant\u2019s waiver of assistance of counsel is knowing, voluntary, and intelligent is a mixed question of law and fact, <em>see Kimball, </em>291 F.3d at 730. This raises the question: is it sufficient in a habeas case for the district court to review and defer to a state appellate court record in lieu of the state trial court record?</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">We have declined to address on appeal the merits in a habeas ease where the district court was without the benefit of the state court record. <em>See Wyzykowski v. Dep't of Corrs., </em>226 F.3d 1213, 1219 (11th Cir.2000) (remanding to the district court for a factual determination of actual innocence where the state court record was not included in the record on appeal and the district court did not address the issue). Other circuits have held that a district court must consider relevant portions of the state court record in habeas cases in order to conduct a meaningful review. <em>See Beck v. Bowersox, </em>257 F.3d 900, 901-02 (8th Cir.2001) (holding that the district court erred in reaching the merits of petitioner\u2019s Fifth and Sixth Amendment claims without reviewing the state court suppression hearing transcript); <em>Magouirk v. Phillips, </em>144 F.3d 348, 362-63 (5th Cir.1998) (finding that the absence of relevant portions of the state court record, specifically, trial transcripts, prevented meaningful review of a \u00a7 2254 petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">In <em>Stewart v. Erwin, </em>503 F.3d 488 (6th Cir.2007), the Sixth Circuit remanded a \u00a7 2254 petition to the district court after determining that the state failed to provide portions of the state trial court record that were essential for meaningful federal review of Stewart\u2019s due process claim. <em>Id. </em>at 498-504. In that case, Stewart claimed that his due process rights were violated because he was not granted an opportunity to rebut any of the evidence the state trial court relied upon in sentencing him, specifically, the victim impact statements. <em>Id. </em>at 491. On direct appeal, the Ohio Court of Appeals stated that it had reviewed the state court record and determined that, while the trial court had considered the victim impact statements, it ultimately based Stewart\u2019s sentence on the facts contained in the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) and Stewart\u2019s psychological evaluations. <em>Id. </em>at 492 (citation omitted). The record on appeal, however, did not contain either the victim impact statements or the psychological evaluations and the PSI. <em>Id. </em>at 499-500. Instead, in denying Stewart\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, the district court relied extensively on the state court of appeals\u2019 decision and found that any due process violation that occurred was harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 492, 500. However, the district court ordered the state to supplement the record with copies of the victim impact statements and the PSI. <em>Id. </em>at 491-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-11\">The Sixth Circuit held that, although the state court of appeals stated that it had reviewed the state court record and the state court\u2019s factual findings were \u201ccloaked with a presumption of correctness,\u201d the district court was unable to conduct a meaningful review of Stewart\u2019s claim because the record on appeal \u201c[did] not contain any of the pertinent materials reviewed by the Ohio Court of Appeals in making its findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 500, 502. Accordingly, the court determined that the state was responsible for supplementing the record with the previously requested documents and directed the district court to grant Stewart\u2019s petition on remand if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>the state did not comply within 45 days. <em>Id, </em>at 501, 503-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-4\">Waiver of assistance of counsel is an issue with constitutional implications. In light of Ferguson\u2019s self-representation claims, which (1) were fact intensive; (2) required the state court to ensure that Ferguson had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel; and (3) required the state court to determine whether standby counsel substantially interfered with tactical decisions or the questioning of witnesses, the absence of the trial record precluded the district court <em>from </em>conducting a meaningful review of the state court decision, even under the deferential standard imposed by the AEDPA. To review the actions of a state trial court with respect to self-representation claims, federal habeas courts must examine the state trial record, rather than rely solely on the state appellate court\u2019s findings as to what the trial record contains. Therefore, we remand Ferguson\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim to the district court for reconsideration in light of the state trial transcript.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">In light of the foregoing, we VACATE the district court\u2019s denial of Ferguson\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition and REMAND to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1167-12\">. <em>Faretta v.
