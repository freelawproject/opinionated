Young argues that his prior criminal history does not qualify him for the career offender enhancement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, because his Florida state court conviction for \u201cBattery of a Child Involving Bodily Fluids\u201d is not a crime of violence. Looking at the statutory definition of the offense, and not the facts underlying the conviction, Young claims that the offense is not categorically a crime of violence. Young contends that commission of the offense does not necessarily involve a serious potential risk of physical injury. He also argues that based on a recent Florida Supreme Court decision, the use or threat of physical force or violence is not a necessary element of battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-21\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1214, 126 S.Ct. 2911, 165 L.Ed.2d 931 (2006). The decision to classify a defendant as a career offender is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>a \u201cquestion of law that we also review <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>\u201cThe burden of proof for establishing that a sentence enhancement is warranted lies with the prosecution and it is the duty of the district court to insure that the prosecution carries its burden of proof.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d 1433, 1440 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">A defendant is a career offender if: (1) he is at least 18 years old at the commission of the offense of conviction; (2) the offense of conviction is a felony crime of violence or controlled substance offense; and (3) he has at least two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a). The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined in \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>Id. </em>at comment. (n.1). Under that section, a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is a crime punishable by a year\u2019 or more of imprisonment, that has as an element \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d or is a \u201cburglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Crimes of violence include aggravated assault and forcible sex offenses. <em>Id. </em>at comment, (n.l). The court should focus on the offense of conviction to determine if the crime is a crime of violence. <em>Id. </em>at comment, (n.2). We consider the guidelines commentary as authoritative. <em>United States v. Searcy, </em>418 F.3d 1193, 1195 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-7\">When determining if a crime is a crime of violence, a court should \u201clook only to the elements of the convicted offense, and not to the conduct underlying the conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Rutherford, </em>175 F.3d 899, 905 (11th Cir.1999). In limited circumstances, the district court may examine the conduct surrounding a conviction, but only if the \u201cjudgment of conviction is ambiguous on its face[,]\u201d and it is impossible to determine whether or not it is a crime of violence from the judgment itself. <em>United States v. Owens, </em>447 F.3d 1345, 1347 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2934, 168 L.Ed.2d 265 (2007) (construing \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4) enhancement). Typically, however, a court looks \u201cno further than the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Llanos-Agostadero, </em>486 F.3d 1194, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2007) (construing \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1) enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-15\">Young pled guilty to violating Florida Statute \u00a7 784.085, \u201cBattery of a Child by Throwing, Tossing, Projecting, or Expelling Certain Fluids or Materials,\u201d which is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.085<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.082(3)(d). According to the statute, it is \u201cunlawful for any person ... to knowingly cause or attempt to cause a child to come into contact with blood, seminal fluid, or urine or feces by throwing, tossing, projecting, or expelling such fluid or material.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.085.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-16\">According to Florida law, a battery occurs when a person \u201c[\u2018a]ctually and intentionally touches or strikes another person ... [or] [intentionally causes bodily harm to another person.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Glover, </em>431 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 784.03, 784.07 (defining battery and battery of a law enforcement officer)). We have held that battery of a law enforcement officer is a crime of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>violence. <em>Id. </em>at 749. Recently, however, the Florida Supreme Court held that battery of a law enforcement officer is not a forcible felony, and does not necessarily involve the use or threat of physical force or violence. <em>See State v. Hearns, </em>961 So.2d 211, 218-20 (Fla.2007) (discussing Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.07).</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">We interpret the sentencing guidelines according to their plain meaning. <em>See United States v. Shenberg, </em>89 F.3d 1461, 1475 (11th Cir.1996). \u201cThe plain meaning of physical force is [p]ower, violence, or pressure directed against a person consisting in a physical act.\u201d <em>United States v. Griffith, </em>455 F.3d 1339, 1342 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2028, 167 L.Ed.2d 771 (2007) (quotation <em>&amp; </em>citation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Ivory, </em>475 F.3d 1232, 1234-35 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cA person cannot make physical contact \u2014 particularly of an insulting or provoking nature \u2014 with another without exerting some level of physical force.\u201d <em>Griffith, </em>455 F.3d at 1342. In interpreting a similar statute, we have rejected an argument that physical force requires violent force. <em>See id. </em>at 1343 (interpreting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9) requirement that the prior offense of conviction have as an \u201celement, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon\u201d). We disagreed with interpretations of physical force that required more than \u201c \u2018Newtonian mechanics\u2019 ... [or] <em>\u2018de </em>minimis\u2019 touching,\u201d stating Congress could have inserted \u201c \u2018violent\u2019 before the words \u2018physical force\u2019 \u201d but did not do so. <em>Id. </em>at 1343-45 (disagreeing with <em>United States v. Belless, </em>338 F.3d 1063 (9th Cir.2003), <em>Flores v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 666 (7th Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-10\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that a conviction for violating Florida Statute \u00a7 784.085, \u201cBattery of a Child by Throwing, Tossing, Projecting, or Expelling Certain Fluids or Materials,\u201d is a crime of violence for purposes of the career offender enhancement. The use of physical force against another is an element of the statute. The statute at issue, while nominally entitled a battery, requires the violator to cause the child to come into contact with bodily fluids, by \u201cthrowing, tossing, projecting, or expelling\u201d the fluids. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.085. These actions require a physical act and are directed against a person. Thus, the only remaining requirement for physical force is that it involve \u201cpower, violence, or pressure.\u201d <em>Griffith, </em>455 F.3d at 1342. The impact of the fluids against the child creates pressure and this minimal contact satisfies the requirement of physical force. Therefore, we conclude that the offense is a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-12\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Young\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1299-8\">.
