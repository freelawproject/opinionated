The mere fact that a juror, is a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows does not disqualify him from sitting in a case where a subordinate Lodge of said order is a party to the suit; such disqualification to sit being confined to members of the particular Lodge concerned in the suit.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b168-8\">2.

In an action against a Lodge of Odd Fellows for sick benefits,-the Constitution and By-Laws of the society constitute the contract between the parties ; and the plaintiff can recover only by showing compliance with the provisions thereof. \"Where the Constitution or By-Laws of the society provide that the right of a member to benefits shall be ascertained in a particular mode, that mode must be pursued before he can enforcfe his supposed rights in courts ; unless by the action, of the society he is prevented from taking such a course.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b168-10\">4.

Where the plaintiff claims as an excuse for not pursuing his remedies in the lodges, that the matter was referred to, heard and determined by the Lodge <em>ex parte, </em>and without notice to him, and that he was thereby unlawfully prevented from proceeding in the Lodge according to the Constitution and By-Laws, that fact must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence to the satisfaction of the jury, or the plaintiff cannot recover. The report of the Relief Committee that they had declared the plaintiff off the sick-benefit list, and the mere acceptance or adoption of such report by the Lodge, would not in law amount to such a reference, hearing and determination.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b168-12\">6.

This the Court refused to do, but limited such disqualification to serve upon the jury to members of the defendant Dodge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-7\">At the trial it was proved on the part of the plaintiff that he was a member in good standing of the defendant Dodge, that up to and for some time prior to October 14th, 1895, he had been receiving sick benefits from the Dodge but that on that date while he was still sick and under the Doctor\u2019s care, payments to him were stopped, upon the report of the members of the Relief Committee to the Dodge that in their judgement he was not sick enough to entitle him to benefits; that he was informed by a member of the Dodge, delegated to come to him and speak for the Dodge, that they had held a meeting and decided that he was no longer entitled to sick benefits, assigning the reason of the Dodge for so doing and telling the plaintiff he hoped he would not bring suit over the affair and that he would go to the Dodge and see if he could not have the matter opened up for him; that thereafter the plaintiff wrote two letters to the Dodge asking what they had done in the matter or what they were going to do, and received no reply.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-8\">The plaintiff claimed that he had no notice of the meeting of the Dodge at which his name was stricken from the sick list; that the hearing was therefore an illegal one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-9\">The defendant contended that there was no hearing of any kind. The only action ever taken by the Dodge was merely the passing of a resolution to accept the weekly report of the Relief Committee made to the Dodge at the regular meeting, in which report the Relief Committee said that they considered the plaintiff no longer entitled to benefits.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-10\"><em>Mr. Harman </em>offered to produce John.

O. O. F:, he had not put himself in the position to maintain his action in Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The Court held the matter under advisement over night, and upon the re-assembling of Court the next day rendered the following decision:</p>\n<author id=\"b170-8\">Robe, C. J:\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"ABX\">After due consideration of the motion for a non suit in the case now on trial, the Court are of the opinion that the non suit ought to be refused; the points raised can be very properly considered in our charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">The plaintiff below prayed as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\"><em>First. </em>If the Rodge held a meeting without notice to Mr. Alim\u00f3n, and, without giving him a hearing, decided he was not entitled to sick benefits; or, if it was guilty of any act refusing, hindering or delaying Mr. Alim\u00f3n in taking an appeal if he so desired; or. if it wrongfully broke its contracts with Mr. Alim\u00f3n, \u2014then he was justified at once in invoking the assistance of the Courts. <em>Bacon on Ben.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_j\">charging the Jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b172-14\">Gentlemen of the Jury:\u2014In this action George Alim\u00f3n the plaintiff, seeks to recover from the Delaware Dodge No. 1, I. O. O. F., the corporation defendant, a balance of $81.00 for sick benefits, which he claims is due to him under the constitution and by-laws of the society, for the period of time from October 14th, 1895, to March 6th, 1896.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-17\">It is conceded, that the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover depends upon the constitution and by-laws of the society. They constitute the contract between the parties and govern the case. By them each party is bound. The plaintiff can recover only by showing compliance with the provisions thereof. Where the constitution or by-laws of the society, provide that the right of a member to benefits shall be ascertained in a particular mode, that mode must be pursued before he can enforce his supposed right in the courts; unless by the action of the society he is prevented from taking such a course.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-18\">This rule is founded both on the.authority of well considered cases and upon reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-19\">If a member was permitted to refuse or neglect to establish his right to benefits by the methods provided, by the rules of the society, the operations of such societies would be thrown into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>confusion, their usefulness impaired and the courts would be burdened by a multitude of suits about contentions which should have been settled elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">It seems that under the report of the Relief Committee of the society, the plaintiff had been receiving sick benefits for some weeks theretofore, up to October 14th, 1895. He claims that the sum so paid amounted to thirty dollars. The society claims it amounted to fifty dollars. At that date, upon the report of the Relief Committee, the payment of sick dues to the plaintiff was stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Section 6 of Article 3 of the constitution of the society provides that should any dispute arise between the Relief Committee and the brother as to sick benefits, the matter should be referred to the Dodge for its decision. Should the decision of the Dodge be adverse to the member, the constitution provides a further remedy by an appeal to the Grand Dodge of Delaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">It is conceded by the counsel for the plaintiff, that it was the duty of the plaintiff to pursue his remedy in the subordinate and Grand Dodges; and that he has no standing in this Court unless he was prevented from so doing by the unlawful act or proceeding of the Dodge itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">We say to you that that is the law. The plaintiff was bound to exhaust his remedy under the constitution and by-laws within the lodges: and if he failed so to do, he cannot recover in this action unless he was unlawfully prevented from pursuing such remedy by the lodges themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">You will note that this case is thus brought within very narrow limits; that is, the solution of this one question: was the plaintiff prevented from pursuing and exhausting his remedies within the lodges by any unlawful action of the Del\u00e1w\u00e1re Dodge, which was a subordinate lodge ? If the plaintiff was so unlawfully prevented, the Dodge cannot set up its own unlawful act as a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. This would be permitting a person to take advantage of his own wrong, which the law will never suffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">The claim is that the matter was referred to, heard and determined by the lodge <em>ex parte, </em>and without notice to the plaintiff, and that he thereby was unlawfully prevented from proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>in the lodge according to the constitution and bylaws. This being the excuse of the plaintiff for not pursuing his remedies in the lodges, it must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence in this case to your satisfaction, or the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Such a reference and determination by the lodge means something. It means a dispute, raised between the relief committee and the member, which is referred to the lodge for settlement, which matter is heard and determined by the lodge. It is for you to say whether any such reference of a dispute was ever made to the lodge, either by the plaintiff or by the Relief Committee. If there was no such reference, hearing and determination by the lodge, the plaintiff cannot recover. The report of the relief committee that they had declared the plaintiff off the sick benefit list,- and the mere acceptance or adoption of such report by the lodge would not in law amount to such a reference, hearing and determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">If the jury shall believe from the evidence that the plaintiff received notice that he had been declared no longer entitled to sick benefits, then it was his duty to apply to the lodge for a hearing, and if he did not do so, he cannot maintain his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Verdict for defendant below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
