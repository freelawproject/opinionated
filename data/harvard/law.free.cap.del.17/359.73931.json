And we pray your honorable Court to appoint five suitable persons to go upon and view the said lands and premises, and to make return of their proceedings to the next term of this honorable Court, in accordance with an act of the General Assembly in such cases made and provided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-5\">The order was issued on the form for the laying out of a new public road'; the return of the commissioners was made in accordance with the prayer of the petitioners, recommending the widening of said road. At the May Term, 1898, counsel for petitioners appeared in Court, and admitted that the Court could not confirm the return, for the reason that the order was not agreeable to the petition, nor was the return in obedience to the order. But in view of the fact that the case was before the Court, counsel asked for a construction of Section 4 of Chapter 60 of the Revised Code, which provides that \u2018 \u2018 The Court of General Sessions of the Peace and Jail Delivery within each county, shall have jurisdiction to lay out public roads, and to change or vacate the same.\u201d</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b368-6\">The Court</author>\n<p id=\"A6F\">decided that the language of Section 4, standing alone, was broad enough to admit of such a construction as counsel contended for ; that is, that the word \u20181 change \u2019 \u2019 could be construed to mean alter ; but that the language of Section 5 restricted the word \u2018 \u2018 change \u2019 \u2019 in section 4, to mean change the course of. While there was authority given in the statute to lay out a new road, to change the course of a road already laid out, or to vacate a road, yet that there was no power given therein to widen a road.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The return of the commissioners was therefore set aside; and the Court refused to make an order taxing the costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
