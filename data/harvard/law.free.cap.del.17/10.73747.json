Our objection is that the petitioner is not the owner of the land for which he seeks an outlet through another\u2019s land. The question as to whether or not he is the legal owner is not such a question as the commission can pass upon, but is a question for the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number><em>Mr. Hayes-. </em>It has been the uniform practice in this Court, that all questions of fact that arise by reason of this proceeding, come before the freeholders, and the questions are brought before the Court on exceptions to their report. The statute governing the matter is found in <em>Sections </em>5, <em>6, </em>7 <em>and 38, Chap. 60, Rev. Code, </em>(1874.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b19-5\">Lore, C. J:\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"Am\">We understand there is no objection as to the sufficiency or regularity of any of the papers. On the face of this paper, the petitioner is clearly entitled to this commission. The time to object, it occurs to the Court, is when the return is made by the freeholders. You take your commission subject to the right of the other parties to except at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">The freeholders were then appointed by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
