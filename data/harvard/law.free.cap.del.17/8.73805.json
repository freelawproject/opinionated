Vail, and it comes to you as an issue by an order of this Court. The sole question you are to try is, whether Clarence C. Vail is or is not the father of the child of Anna M. Wolf.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-6\">The counsel for the State have asked us to charge you that in order to find that Clarence C. Vail is the father of this child, it is not necessary that you should be satisfied of that fact, from the testimony, beyond a reasonable doubt, but that it is sufficient if the preponderance of the testimony establishes it.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-7\">We will say to you that in criminal cases the law requires that the jury should be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused before they can find a verdict against him, but in civil cases a different rule prevails, and a preponderance of testimony is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-8\">The Legislature of this State has made this issue triable only in this Court\u2014a court of criminal jurisdiction- -and it is difficult therefore to see why it should not be governed by the same principles as obtain in the trial of other criminal cases. And besides, such a proceeding as this has been declared by this Court, in several cases, to be a criminal action, and governed by the rules of criminal trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-9\">In the case of <em>James L. Smith vs. The State, 1 </em>Houston, <em>(Criminal Cases), 108, </em>which was an appeal in bastardy like the case at bar, the Court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b17-10\">\u2018 \u2018 This is a quasi-criminal proceeding and solely cognizable in this, a court of criminal jurisdiction, in which the State is the party complainant, and not a civil suit between the individuals concerned in it, and for which reason the father was a competent witness for the State. \u2019 \u2019 He was competent because, although a quasi-criminal proceeding, it was triable in a criminal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-11\">This Court having heretofore taken such a position, we are not disposed to hold a different one, or one which would be inconsistent therewith, and we shall adhere to the principle established in that case until it is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-12\">We say to you, therefore, that if in this case you are satisfied, from the testimony, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Clarence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>C. Vail is the father of this child, your verdict should be that he is the father. If, on the other hand, you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, after a careful consideration of all the testimony, that he is the father, you should find that he is not the father of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-5\">With these instructions, we leave the case in your hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">Verdict: \u201cWe find him to be the father of the child.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
