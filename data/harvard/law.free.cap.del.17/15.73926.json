An affidavit of defence was filed, setting forth the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-16\">\u201c The defendant verily believes that he has a defence to the whole of the cause of action, the nature and character of which defence is payment. \u2019 \u2019</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>Mr. Ward </em>moved for judgment, notwithstanding the affidavit of defence ; contending that the statute requiring the setting out of the nature and character of the defence means the setting forth of certain facts. That payment was a conclusion of law and not an averment of facts ; while payment was a good defence, it must be set out. There was no averment of payment to anybody or of anything. The affidavit did not show to whom payment was made, or how, when or by whom it was made.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b24-5\">Tore, C. J:\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"Au\">It is settled in this court that an affidavit of defence alleging payment simply is sufficient. The rule is that snap judgments are never granted if there is a doubt. The court has recognized the word \u201c payment <em>\u201d </em>as being sufficient in affidavits of defence. It has a specific and clear meaning, which is that the claim has been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\"><em>Mr. Ward </em>asked leave to note an exception to the above ruling. The court held that no exception would lie, as it was not a final judgment and no writ of error could be taken.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
