The plaintiff filed a bill of particulars in which there were set out numerous charges on sundry dates for \u201cMdse.,\u201d without specifying the nature, character or quantity of the merchandise.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number><em>Mr. </em>Hayes, for defendant below, objected to the bill of particulars as insufficient and asked that a further bill of particulars be filed; contending that until this was done he was not obliged to plead.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-5\"><em>Mr. </em>Ward:\u2014My recollection is that the bill of particulars .is in the shape in which the plaintiff kept his book of account, and that the charges are as made against Mrs. O\u2019Hara, the defendant, from time to time. A bill of particulars is a statement filed for the purpose of giving information to the parties in the suit. The plaintiff did not deal in anything but meat and sold nothing else, and the bill of particulars filed, in my judgment, is sufficient information to the defendant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b147-6\">Spruancb, J:\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AFE\">The purpose of a bill of particulars is to give</p>\n<p id=\"AyA\">to the defendant reasonable notice of the claim he is required to meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The bill of particulars in this case shows the dates and prices of the alleged sales, and describes the property sold as \u201cmdse.,\u201d meaning merchandise. This is not sufficient. The defendant is \u25a0 entitled to know with reasonable certainty what kind of merchandise is claimed, to have been sold to him. Under this paper the plaintiff might prove a claim for meat, dry-goods, groceries or any other property answering the general description of merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Ret a new bill of particulars be filed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
