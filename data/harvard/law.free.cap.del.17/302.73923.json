At the trial the State called David W. Cush, the prosecuting witness, who was asked by the Deputy Attorney-General what was the occasion of his going to the house of the defendant. The witness proceeded to state in reply that he had an execution against her husband. Counsel for defendant objected on the ground that the execution, which was the authority of the constable, must be proved by the production of the paper itself and could not be proved by parol testimony.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b310-13\">Rore, C.
