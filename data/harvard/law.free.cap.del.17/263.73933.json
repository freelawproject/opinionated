The calendar was published April 6th. When the case came on for trial, counsel for plaintiff moved for a continuance, on the ground of the absence of a material witness. It was admitted that the said witness had gone to Philadelphia on Wednesday morning April 6th and was there in a hospital being treated for cancer. That on Saturday April 9th summons was issued for his attendance upon court on April 12th. The plaintiff was produced and stated that he expected to prove by the absent witness that the defendant had on one occasion sent for plaintiff\u2019s wife to meet defendant at a neighbor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>house, that she there met him about eight o\u2019clock in the evening and that they together drove off in defendant\u2019s carriage. The defendant refused to admit that fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-5\">Defendant\u2019s counsel objected to a continuance on the ground of laches on the part of plaintiff.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b272-6\">EorB, C. J:\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"Aol\">The rule is that as soon as the calendar is published and announced by the ' Court, subpoenas should be issued for the witnesses, and unless this is done, the party takes the risk of being guilty of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The calendar was made out in this case on Tuesday afternoon April 5th, yet the announcement was not made until Wednesday morning April 6th, after court convened. It is agreed here that this witness went to Philadelphia at eight o\u2019clock a. m. April 6th, and therefore he could not have been served after the calendar was announced.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Under the circumstances, the plaintiff has brought himself within the rule. We. therefore order the case continued to the October term under a peremptory rule.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
