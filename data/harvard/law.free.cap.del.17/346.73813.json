D., 1898, the defendant failing to appear, the plaintiff present ; after hearing the proofs and allegations, and maturely considering the same, the service of the summons being first verified by the oath of the Constable in writing, I thereupon give judgment by default in favor of the plaintiffs Albert Buehler, trading as Albert Buehler and Company, and against the defendant Minnie Harris, for thirty eight dollars debt and one 66-100 dollars costs of suit.\u2019\u2019</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-12\">The attorney for the plaintiff in error filed the following exceptions to the above record :</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-13\">1.
