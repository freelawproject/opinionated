He thought a while and then he said, \u2018 There lays a dollar, pick it up. \u2019 He asked me after I picked up the dollar if I would now get registered. I told him yes. I found the dollar I reckon about \u2022 \u00e1 foot and a half from the carriage. It was a paper dollar. I did not see the dollar before he came there. I had been walking around there where I picked the dollar up and had not seen any money. I got registered with the dollar at Frederica the next day.

Will you state to the Court briefly and in your own way what you know about it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-10\">A. Yes, sir. On Saturday the sixteenth of September last I went out to my camp ground where I was holding a church camp. It rained on a Thursday night and I wanted to see if everything was all right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-11\">R. You mean on Friday?</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-12\">A. The sixteenth, on a Friday. Because I say it rained on Thursday night, and I stopped at Mr. Lewis Downes\u2019 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>had a talk with him. He was whitewashing his house ; and I thought to myself and I said, I would go down to the camp ground to see if the lumber was all right; it was borrowed lumber ; and I started, and I said to myself just before I got to the ground, \u201cNo; I will not go down there, I suppose it is all right.\u201d And after I had gotten possibly 100 yards below Mr. Henry\u2019s house I turned around and came back and he was standing around the house by the wood-pile or somewhere there. I said, \u201cHeigh-ho Father Henry\u201d\u2014everybody around there calls him father\u2014and he spoke to me and I shook hands with him and we began to talk. First our talk was about the ladies being so kind to him. They had been to his house and whitewashed it and put him down carpets and fixed him up comfortable. We talked about fifteen minutes, and just before going on I said to Father Henry, \u201811 suppose you are going to register to-morrow, \u2019 \u2019 he said \u201cI don\u2019t know Brother Collins, I have not money enough.\u201d I said, \u201cPap Henry, how much money have you?\u201d and he said, \u201cI have ninety-three cents.\u201d I said, \u201cWho owes you that Pap Henry?\u201d He said, \u201cMr. Read.\u201d I said, \u201cO my dear time of life, you can get the other seven cents,\u201d I said, \u201cYou go to Mr. Read and tell him to pay you your money,\u201d and he said, \u201cAll right, I will be there to-morrow and see if he will not pay me.\u201d I said, \u201cGood-bye Pap Henry,\u201d and I drove on to Mr. Downes\u2019 and stopped there and ate a few grapes. , The next morning Pap Henry came in, I am informed. I never saw Pap Henry any more until Saturday morning between nine and ten o\u2019clock. At that time I was standing in the stairway . of the town-hall with nineteen men ahead of me to register. Naturally I was at the first step, and when I saw Pap Henry again he came in the hallway and I said to him, \u201cHeigh-ho Pap Henry.\u201d He spoke to me as usual, but I did not shake his hand, there was another man between me and him. ,1 gradually went up and he complained of having a headache and of being tired. I said to Mr. Miller, the gentleman that kept the stairway to keep them from rushing up, \u201cWon\u2019t you allow Father Henry to come up and sit down. He is an old man about seventy and he is sick.\u2019 \u2019 He said, \u201ccertainly.\u201d And he went up and sat down on the steps where the head men were and gradually we went up and up until we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>got about the top and he complaining and I was with him. * * * I said to him, \u201cFather Henry, you may take my turn to register if it will help you any, \u201d and he took my turn and he went up and I suppose registered and he passed me right while he was going down; there was another gentleman registered ahead of me but how that is I won\u2019t say. However, as he started down there was a crowd behind me and got Father Henry by the hand after he had registered and held his hand after he came down from the registration as far as I could reach and then he left.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-6\"><em>Q. </em>You have no knowledge where he got the money to register ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-7\">A. No sir ; not a bit more than you have.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-8\"><em>Q. </em>Where do you live ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-9\">A.

I said, \u201cI will go on back home.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-23\">Q. How was it you did not say to yourself before you started to the camp ground that it was not necessary ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-24\">A. I was just going down there but it was about an hour by sun, and I saw that it was near night.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-25\">Q. Why did you not think of that before ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>A. I did not absolutely leave home to go to the camp ground but I went up to see Mr. Downes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-4\">Q. \u25a0 Who is he ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-5\">A. A colored gentleman.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-6\"><em>Q. </em>A member of your church ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-7\">A.

When I saw him probably it was an hour and a quarter or such a matter, but it was about an hour by sun when I saw Mr. Henry.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-12\">Q. How far did Henry live from the main road on which you were traveling ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-13\">A. He lived immediately on the road.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-14\"><em>Q. </em>You stopped there and talked with him ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-15\">A. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-16\">Q. You were in your carriage ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-17\">A. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-18\"><em>Q. </em>You had some conversation before you approached the subject of registration?</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-19\">A.

I drew of him one dollar of the money which the stewards had given me, and the simple trouble was I had not been up there after it. I don\u2019t generally take up my money Sunday but have it deposited with the treasurer and I drove there and got it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-26\"><em>Q. </em>You were on business relating to the church and your camp meeting and yourself ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-27\">A. Yes ; and that only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>, Q. You did not mention the matter of registration to Alfred Henry ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-4\">A. I happened to mention it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-5\"><em>Q. </em>How came you to do it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-6\">A. Well, I knew he was an aged man and just merely thought of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-7\">Q. What has his being an aged man to do with it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-8\">A. I don\u2019t know that that has anything to do with it but I just merely thought of it and that is about as good a reason as I can give. I spoke of it to him and said that Mr. Downes and I were speaking of the registration, and he said that he was going in to-morrow to register and he said he wanted to go in as early as possible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-9\"><em>Q. </em>Was that the first or second registration day ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-10\">A. That was the <em>second </em>registration day to my knowledge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-11\"><em>Q. </em>You did speak to Alfred Henry about registering ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-12\">A. I' just asked him. I knew he had not registered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-13\">Q. How did you know it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-14\">A. Because he told me two or three weeks or a week before. There had not been a dozen men in the neck registered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-15\"><em>Q. </em>You inquired about it?</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-16\">\u25a0 A. No, sir ; nothing more than I heard men talking about it in the streets ; as I passed along I often heard things.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-17\">Q. Did he tell you ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-18\">A. I heard him say possibly two or three weeks, at least ten or twelve days before that time that he had not been registered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-19\">O. How long had the registration begun ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-20\">A. I don\u2019t remember when the first registration was because I was away from home. I heard he had not registered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-21\"><em>Q. </em>And you asked him about it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-22\">A. I did not ask him if he had not registered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-23\">Q. When you asked him about registering what was it he said about having but ninety-three cents?</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-24\">A. He had not quite money enough. Then I asked him how much he had and then he said ninety-three cents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-25\">Q. And you said to him, \u201cwho owes you that ?\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>A. I said, \u201cOh my dear Father Henry, you certainly can get the balance of the dollar,\u201d and I said, \u201cWho owes you that money,\u201d and he said, \u201cMr. Read.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-5\">Q. He told you he had ninety-three cents ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-6\">A. Yes sir ; that is true. I am on my oath.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-7\">Q. Then you said to him, \u201cOh Father Henry you certainly can get the other seven cents ?\u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-8\">A. I said, \u201cOh my dear Father Henry, you certainly can get the other seven cents.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-9\">Q. Then you immediately asked him who owed him the money ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-10\">A. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-11\">Q. And he told you he had ninety-three cents ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-12\">A. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-13\"><em>Q. </em>Why did you think somebody owed him ? ;\u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-14\">A. He said he did not have the money, and he said here he did not have the money, and he said there he hadn\u2019t enough money, and I asked him how much he had and he said he had ninety-three cents, and I asked him who owed him the ninety-three cents, and he said, Mr. Read. And I said, \u201cOh my dear Father Henry, you certaintly can get the other seven cents.\u201d Then I said, \u201cwho owes you that.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-15\">Q. Why did you ask him the question who owed him, if he said he had ninety-three cents ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-16\">A. Merely a matter of talk with him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-17\"><em>Q. </em>What gave you the idea that notwithstanding he said he had ninety-three cents that some man owed him ninety-three cents ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-18\">A. I know he worked occasionally.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-19\">O. Had you reason to believe that he had not the ninety-three cents when he told you he had ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-20\">A. Not any more reason to believe that he had or he had not, but it merely came to my mind to ask who owed it to him <em>; </em>and he could just as well have said that no one owed it to him as not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-21\">Q. Why did you ask him, who owed it to him ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>A. Just merely because I thought of it, not because I had any idea of giving it to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-4\"><em>Q. </em>You deny that you said, \u201cThere is a dollar lying down there ?\u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-5\">A. Yes ; there is no truth in that. I am a minister of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-6\">Qf You tell us that the next day you were in line registering with nineteen men ahead of you ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-7\">A. Nineteen men because I counted them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-8\">Q. What were these men, white or colored ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-9\">A. It was a mixed multitude,</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-10\">Q. You were there.?</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-11\">A. I was.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-12\"><em>Q. </em>What time of day was it ? '</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-13\">A. Between 9 and 10 o\u2019clock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-14\"><em>Q. </em>You were anxious to get registered ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-15\">A. Yes, sir ; because I had other business to attend to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-16\"><em>Q. </em>You were anxious for Uncle Alfred to get registered?</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-17\">A. I was anxious for every man to get registered. I thought it was his duty, not more anxious for him than any other man to get registered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-18\"><em>Q. </em>You paid particular attention to Alfred Henry, took him by the hand ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-19\">A. Not because he was registered.

J:\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"Adn\">Charles G. Collins, you are charged in the information now before us with giving to one Alfred Henry, at South Murderkill Hundred, in this County, one dollar, the amount of his registration fee ; thereby unlawfully using money to influence and induce him to be registered as a qualified elector, in the Eighth Election District of this county, on the seventeenth day of September last.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Your case has been heard by the Court, sitting under the new Constitution as judges both of law and the facts, without the intervention of a jury. The testimony in the case has been heard by us not only in an open court, but the official stenographic report thereof has been carefully reviewed and examined by each of us. After the most thoughtful consideration, we have been unable to arrive at any other conclusion than that of your guilt. We therefore have all adjudged you to be guilty of the offence as charged against you in the information. We have reached this determination from the testimony before us, which only we may consider in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Mr. Smithers, have you anything to say why sentence should not be pronounced against the prisoner ?</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\"><em>Mr. Smithers </em>:\u2014No, sir ; nothing to say.</p>\n<author id=\"b439-8\">Eorb, C. J:\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AGy\">Section 7 of Article 5 of the Constitution, which went into effect June' 10th, 1897, relating to election bribery, under which this information was framed, defines several of such offences ; among them the one with which you are charged. In order to adapt the penalty to the offence in each particular case, the Constitution gives a liberal discretion to the Court; ranging from a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five thousand dollars, or imprisonment for a term of not less than one month nor more than three years, or both fine and imprisonment at the discretion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">In this instance we will not impose the extreme penalty. You may have had no corrupt motive in giving Henry the money; you may have intended merely to furnish the money needed by him for his registration. But so jealously has the Constitution guarded the purity of elections that even such action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>is within its terms ; and a just enforcement of its provisions even to that extent is necessary to prevent unlawful interference with the freedom and the purity of elections in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The Court ha,s determined your sentence, after giving the most charitable construction to your conduct. This is the first case under the new Constitution, and therefore one of great interest and importance. We take occasion now to emphasize this point; that it is the intention of the Court jealously to guard and vigorously to enforce the constitutional provisions respecting elections, to the end that hereafter free and equal elections may be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The sentence of the Court is, that you forfeit and pay a fine of one thousand dollars ; that you be imprisoned for the term of six months ; commencing on this day and ending on the third day of May, 1899 ; that you pay the costs of the prosecution, and you are now committed to the custody of the sheriff until this sentence is carried into execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The case was thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court and the prisoner was released on bail. At the January term of the Supreme Court, 1899, consisting of Chancellor Nicholson and associate Judges Spruance and Boyce the said appeal was abandoned, and judgment below affirmed. The defendant was produced in Court and resentenced as above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
