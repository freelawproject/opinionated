But if the jury are satisfied from all the facts and circumstances of the case, that the sale was made-by the proprietor, his agent or servant, directly or indirectly to the minor, or to the minor and the adult, and not to the adult alone, or if they believe from the evidence that the proprietor knew or ought to have known from the circumstances that the person purchasing the beer was used simply as a screen to conceal the participation of the minor in the purchase, then they should find a verdict of guilty.</syllabus>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b533-8\">\n<em>(February 10, 1899.)</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b533-9\">Tore, C.

We must look to the words employed to gather the intention of the legislature. A penal statute will not be extended by implication or construction to cases which may be within the mischief which the statute was designed to cure, if they are not at the same time within the limits of the act fairly and reasonably interpreted. Hence an act not expressly prohibited by such a statute cannot be reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>by it, merely because it resembles the offences provided against, or may be equally and in the same way demoralizing or injurious. <em>Black on Inter. of Laws, 287.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u2018\u2018A sale is the transfer of a property in a thing sold for a price in money.\u201d <em>Tiffany on Sales. </em>It is \u201ca contract for the transfer of property from one person to another for a valuable consideration,\u201d <em>2 Kent Com., 468. </em>To \u201c sell \u201d a thing is to part with the ownership thereof to the buyer for a compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The word \u201c sell\u201d is used in the most ordinary transactions of life, and it has a well defined meaning. We must assume that the legislature employed it with its usual signification and legal import.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">In the case of <em>Siegel vs. The People (106, Ill. 86), </em>being similar to the one at bar in all respects, the court said : \u2018 \u2018 the word \u2018 sell \u2019 has a well known legal signification, and in the absence of anything to the contrary appearing in the statute we must assume that it is here intended to have that signification. There is nothing exceptional in a sale that distinguishes it from other contracts, as respects the concurrence or coming together of the minds of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">\u2018\u2018We cannot extend the terms of a criminal act beyond its clear legal meaning. We cannot construe the word \u2018sell\u2019 in such a statute to mean something different from its ordinary legal import, and we can, therefore, only understand a prohibition against persons selling to minors to extend to those who, in legal estimation, occupy the position, and are under all the obligations of contractors with minors. The prohibition against selling is only as to the excepted class, and no liability of a criminal nature is imposed upon the vendor on account of the motives with which the vendor shall purchase, or the uses to which he shall apply the same.\u201d We think the conclusion reached by the Illinois court is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">The case of <em>People vs. Newmann, (85 Mich. 98) </em>was cited to us by the counsel for the state. But the Michigan statute is broader and more comprehensive in the language employed than in our statute. It punishes for the 1 \u2018 furnishing \u2019 \u2019 of liquor to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>a minor. We do not feel that we can apply the reasoning of the Michigan case to our statute without doing violence to the most elementary rules of construction with reference to penal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In our statute it is simply \u2018 \u2018 <em>sell or give away </em>liquor at any time to a minor.\u201d We may note that the statute makes it an offence \u201c to sell, give away or <em>dispense </em>any liquor on the Rord\u2019s day, commonly called Sunday\u2019 \u2019 or \u201c on the day of any general, special or municipal election.\u201d The omission of the word \u201c dispense \u201d in the clause relative to minors, etc., seems to have been by legislative design and the fact that a word of broader signification should have been thus omitted is quite significant, and it has the effect to confine us in our interpretation of the word \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>sell \u2019 \u2019 to its common and approved usuage.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">And we must .consider the word \u2018 \u2018 sell \u2019 \u2019 as used in the statute in its ordinary meaning and signification whether in doing so the spirit of the statute as applicable to this case may be defeated or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Basing our judgment upon sound and well established principles of law with the respect to the interpretation of criminal statutes, we think it infinitely safer for the rights of citizens, and, therefore, less dangerous to. the public good that, in determining the real scope and extent of a penal statute in legal contemplation, the court should not by subtle reasoning or strained construction, invade the domain of legislative authority, and undertake by judicial interpretation to enlarge the meaning of the words thereof beyond their natural import and legal signification, or attempt to read into it words which it does not contain, in order to reach a kindred mischief to the one which the Statute clearly makes an offence, although the mischief which is sought to be reached may appear to fall within the spirit of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">In the language of Chief Justice Marshall ( <em>U. S. vs. Wittberger, 5 Wheat. 96), </em>\u201cIt would be dangerous, indeed, to carry the principle that a case which is within the reason or mischief of a statute, is within its provision so far as to punish a crime not enumerated in the statute because it is of equal atrocity, or of kindred character, with those which are enumerated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>It is for the legislature to define crime and to provide for its punishment. It is not the province of the court to bring acts within the scope of the punishment of the law simply because it may be thought that such acts fall within the spirit of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The legislature is now in session, and doubtless it would be an easy matter to have the statute, so far as it relates to minors, etc., so amended as that the mischief complained of would clearly fall within the terms thereof. And public policy demands that \u25a0the correction of the law should be left for the legislature rather than that the court should attempt to cure the defect therein by an unwarranted interpretation thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">If you are satisfied from all the testimony in the case that the beer was sold to Kavanaugh by Peo in good faith, if it was sold at all, and without intending to evade the law, and was not sold to the minor girls, or either of them, then your verdict should be \u201c not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">In order to determine to whom the sale was made by Peo, if you believe any sale was made at all, you should consider all the facts and circumstances of the case; and if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the sale of the beer, or any part of it, was made by Peo, his agent or servant, directly or indirectly, to the minor girls, or either of them, or to the girls and Kavanaugh, and not to Kavanaugh alone ; or again adopting the Illinois case, if you find from the evidence that Peo knew or ought to have known from the circumstances that the person purchasing the beer was used simply as a screen to conceal the participation of the minors in the purchase, then your verdict should be \u201cguilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Verdict, \u201c Not guilty.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
