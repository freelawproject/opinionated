Hilles, attorney for plaintiff, and Walter H. Hayes, attorney for the, defendants, that the above stated case was heard before Thomas B. Smith, John P. Doughten and James S. Dobb, as referees, on the 9th and 10th days of December, A. D. 1897 ; that the facts set forth in the defendants\u2019 exceptions, filed in this case, Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4, are true ; that at said hearing an offer was made on behalf of the plaintiff to prove by competent testimony that repeatedly during the five years immediately preceding his death, which occurred March 9, 1897, Richard B. Duncan promised to pay the plaintiff for her care and attention of and to him, and admitted his liability for care and attention previously given by plaintiff to him, and promised to pay therefor, and the said promises and admissions continued until within a month or six weeks before the death of the said Richard B. Duncan; that the referees admitted this testimony against the objections of the defendants\u2019 counsel. That it was further proved during all of said period of five years that the said Richard B. Duncan paid to the said plaintiff for board the sum of six dollars per week with the exception of the last three weeks of his life.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxQ\"><em>Mr. </em>Hayes-.\u2014Under the pleadings in this case, there only being a general traverse to the plea of the statute of limitations, evidence was not admissible of any promises made in relation to the services performed by the plaintiff that were barred by the statute. If the plaintiff intended to introduce such evidence, she should have replied specially to the plea of the statute of limitations:</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-28\">\n<em>Wood on Limitations of Actions, 16; 2 Greenleaf' s Evidence, Sec. 440; Kemp vs. Gibbon, 58 E.

Whatever might be our opinion on the point as an abstract question, it has been settled by the decisions of this State, following the older decisions in England, that it is not necessary to reply a new promise or an admission in order to entitle the plaintiff to rely upon such promise or admission to remove the bar of the statute or prevent its operation as a bar, the cause of action in such cases being not upon the new promise, but upon the original promise and the defendant having waived any right to avail himself of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-6\">\n<em>1 Chitty Pleading, 614; 3 Chitty Pleading, 940-1 and Note; Upton vs. Else, 12 Moore, 303; Leaper vs. Tatton, 16 East, 420; Newlin vs. Duncan, 1 Harr., 204.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b182-7\">Spruancb, J:\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AOz\">This is an action of assumpsit, commenced April 5th, 1897, against the administrators of Richard B. Duncan, who died March 9, 1897, to recover for services rendered to the deceased more than three years before the commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The second plea of the defendants is the statute of limitations, which is drawn out, and denies that the cause of action accrued at any time within three years next before the commencement of the action. To this there is a general replication, also drawn out, which avers that the cause of action did accrue within three years next before the commencement of the action. On this replication the defendants join issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">At the trial before referees they, against the objection of the defendants, received testimony of services rendered prior to three years before the death of Duncan and of acknowledgments by Duncan at stindry times during five years immediately before his death of his liability for such services, and of promises by him during the same period to pay for the same: such admissions and promises continuing until a few weeks before his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">On behalf of the defendants it is contended that under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>general traverse to the plea of statute of limitations, testimony was not admissible as to any -admissions or promises in relation to services performed more than three years before the commencement of the action, and that such testimony could only have been received under a special replication setting forth the new promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The law applicable to this subject was fully discussed and settle by the Court of Errors and Appeals in 1883 in <em>Newlin vs. Duncan, 1 Harr., 204.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">It was there held that an acknowledgment of a subsisting demand, or any recognition of an existing debt, is evidence of a promise to pay it; that the ground on which the statute operates is that after a certain time it is presumed that the debt is discharged, but that an acklowedgment of the debt rebuts that presumption, and the plaintiff recovers not on the ground of having a new right of action, but that the statute does not apply to bar the old one; that a new promise revives the old debt, but does not create a new one. This the Court declared had been the law and practice in this State from time immemorial, notwithstanding the then later decisions in England showing fluctuation and confusion upon the subject. \u25a0 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The Court of Errors and Appeals in 1858, in <em>Robinson vs. Burton, 1 Houst., 540, </em>say: \u201cIt was decided by the Court in <em>Newlin vs. Duncan </em>in conformity with the uniform decisions and practice, that an acknowledgment of a debt as a subsisting demand will take it out of the act of limitations without an express promise to pay it. There has been no vacillation in the courts on this principle, but some conflict in its application to the facts in each case.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Whether it be an acknowledgment of a subsisting or existing debt and of an obligation to pay it\u2014from which a promise to pay may be implied\u2014or an express promise to pay, the rule is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">In neither case is the plaintiff required to reply specially the acknowledgment or new promise. If he recovers it is on the old promise and not on the new.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">Lord Ellenborough remarked that if this was an entirely new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>question, and the pleadings were to be made strictly logical, a replication of the new promise might be required, but\u2019 he thought the practice had in his day been too long otherwise to change it.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Surely, in view of the decision and practice in the courts of this State, it would be most-unwise for us to, adopt the rule insisted on by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">We are of the opinion that, under the pleadings in this case, the testimony objected to by the defendants was properly admitted by the referees, and therefore the rule is discharged and the report of the referees confirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
