Bates of nearly $4000. He promised to deliver 260 eases of \u201cThe Living End,\u201d a \u201crectal cleaning agent,\u201d though he never did. The jury found him guilty on both counts, and he was sentenced to five years in prison on each count, sentences to run concurrently. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">Appellant brings forward four points, none of which have any merit. He claims that the trial judge should have granted a judgment of acquittal because use of the wires was never proved; that the testimony of several witnesses was erroneously admitted; that the court should have granted \u00a3 mistrial after accepting the testimony of George T. Wilson; and that the court should not have admitted evidence of a tape procured by an Agent which allegedly was one of Uptain\u2019s sales pitches.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-5\">First, the government clearly proved all elements establishing appellant\u2019s violation of the statute, including the use of the wires. Second, the testimony of the other witnesses, stating that similar acts of conduct had been perpetrated by the appellant, were admissible under Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence to show knowledge, intent, and a consistent pattern and scheme of operation. The trial judge made the proper limiting instructions. Third, the witness\u2019 comment that the president of a company was in jail for bank robbery was completely unpredicted by both sides. Any prejudicial effect was minimal, and the judge used limiting instructions. Finally, the cassette tape was found in an abandoned office, and thus, appellant cannot complain of its seizure. <em>Abel v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 217, 80 S.Ct. 683, 4 L.Ed.2d 668 (1960). Further, the tape was useful in establishing the requisite fraudulent intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-6\">Accordingly we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
