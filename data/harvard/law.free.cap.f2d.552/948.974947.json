First, we are required to consider whether a district judge may vacate and reenter a certification order so as to allow an interlocutory appeal, when the appellants initially failed to proceed in a timely manner because they lacked notice of the original certification order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If that question is answered affirmatively, we then must determine whether the trial court erred when it declined to dismiss the complaint on the ground that \u201cstate action,\u201d the essential predicate for jurisdiction under \u00a7 1983 of the Civil Rights Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-19\">1. POWER OF A DISTRICT COURT TO VACATE AND REENTER A CERTIFICATION ORDER SO AS TO ALLOW AN INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-20\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-21\">This employment discrimination suit was instituted by Dr. Ina Braden, on behalf of herself and other women similarly situated, against the University of Pittsburgh (\u201cUniversity\u201d or \u201cPitt\u201d) and against Dr. Wesley W. Posvar, the Chancellor of the University.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-22\">The district court, however, dismissed the complaint. It did so, with respect to the \u00a7 1983 claim, on the ground that the relationship between the Commonwealth and the University was not such as to render the alleged discrimination \u201cstate action.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>On initial appeal to this Court, the dismissal was vacated and the case remanded for further consideration of the \u00a7 1983 issue\u2014 more particularly, the state action question.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">After extensive discovery had been concluded in the district court, and an evidentiary hearing held solely on the issue of state action, at the directive of this Court, the trial judge denied the defendants' renewed motions to dismiss the \u00a7 1983 claim for lack of jurisdiction. Rather, the district court indicated that state action might well exist.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It proceeded, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), to certify the order denying the motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">A panel of this Court then granted the defendants permission to appeal under Appellate Rule 5,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and referred the interlocutory appeal to a second panel for disposition on the merits. At that point, Dr. Braden challenged our jurisdiction, alleging that the defendants had not filed their application for an appeal within ten days of the district court certification, as prescribed by Rule 5. Since resolution of that issue required reexamination of a decision of a prior panel, we elected to consider the question en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">The problem confronting us here stems from the failure of the district court to give the defendants notice of its certification order, as provided by Fed.R.Civ.P. 77(d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It was only after expiration of the ten-day filing period that the defendants learned of the entry of the order. Immediately thereafter, the defendants moved this Court for permission to appeal out of time, simultaneously obtaining a similar extension from the district court. Although the defendants were informed that this Court lacked authority to extend the time to appeal by virtue of Appellate Rule 26(b),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we suggested that they request the district judge to vacate his earlier certification order and to enter another. Upon submission of such a request, the district court vacated its original order and entered a new one containing the requisite \u00a7 1292(b) certification. Defendants thereupon filed their petition for permission to appeal within the time specified in Rule 5, and the new petition was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-15\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-16\">Dr. Braden now maintains that we lack authority to permit the present interlocutory appeal. She claims that the district court\u2019s reentry of the certificate was ineffective to cure the defendants\u2019 failure to pursue their appeal within ten days of the original order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-17\">It is well-settled that the neglect of a party to petition for leave to appeal within ten days of the entry of the certification order deprives an appellate court of juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>diction to consider the petition,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that Rule 26(b) forbids appellate courts to enlarge the time for filing such a petition. Nevertheless, the present appeal poses a different and more difficult question\u2014 namely, whether a trial judge may vacate and reenter his own certification order so as to start the ten-day period running again. When, as here, a party has received no notice of the certification order and, therefore, has been prevented from asserting its right to appeal by an error of the trial court, the ability of such court to correct its own mistake might seem manifest. Yet, on cursory examination, there would appear to be no remedy available to an innocent party who fails to receive the requisite notice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-5\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 77(d) expressly provides: Lack of notice of the entry by the clerk does not affect the time to appeal or relieve or authorize the court to relieve a party for failure to appeal within the time allowed, except as permitted in Rule 4(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">Rule 4(a), which allows a district court to extend the time to appeal for thirty days upon a showing of \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d applies \u2014 at least on its face \u2014 only to appeals as of right. By contrast, Rule 5 which deals with permissive appeals contains no comparable provision. Nor are permissive appeals referred to in Rule 77(d). If Rule 77(d) had specified that Rule 4(a) were the sole vehicle by which a district court may provide relief from lack of notice,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it might well follow that a \u00a7 1292(b) petitioner would have no remedy for failure to receive notice.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The proviso of Rule 77(d), applicable only to appeals as of right, contains no authorization for relief in permissive appeals, such as the one at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-10\">The question thus arises whether a district court may accomplish indirectly what it may not do directly. At least one court of appeals has sanctioned such a procedure. In <em>In re La Providencia Development Corp., </em>the First Circuit upheld a district court which had vacated and reentered its certificate \u201c \u2018in order that the parties not be deprived of a timely appellate decision.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-11\">On the other hand, two courts appear to have indicated that vacation and recertification are tantamount to enlarging the time for appeal, and that such a maneuver (Vis proscribed by Rule 77(d). In Woods <em>v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad,</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the appealing party neglected to file a timely petition, even though he apparently had received adequate notice. After the district court had vacated and reentered its certification order, the appellate court held that such action could not confer jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeal because a district court has no power to extend the time for appeal, either directly or indirectly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-12\">The reasoning of the Woods court was embraced in <em>Nakhleh v. Chemical Construction Corp.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There the appellant was not aware that an interlocutory order had been entered, because the order had been listed under the wrong initial letter in the local law journal. The district judge stated that, while he could vacate his order should new facts or new decisional law necessitate reconsideration,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> he could not vacate and refile a certification order merely to extend the time for appeal. It should be noted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>however, that no attempt was made by the <em>Nakhleh </em>court to distinguish between the plight of the hapless party who, through inadvertence, received no notice, and that of the neglectful party, such as the party in <em>Woods, </em>who simply is remiss in pursuing his appeal. <em>Nakhleh </em>thus did not explore the outer limits of the rules which do not literally authorize extension of the time for appeal in the latter context, nor did it even purport to consider whether a remedy may be found in the former situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">In addition to <em>Woods </em>and <em>Nakhleh, </em>Dr. .Braden refers to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Milbert v. Bison Laboratories, Inc.,</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to support the proposition that a district court has no authority to vacate and reenter a certification order. Yet, any attempted reliance on <em>Milbert </em>would appear to be misplaced. That case concerned the timeliness of the grant by a court of appeals of permission to appeal from an interlocutory order, the petition for leave to appeal having been filed within the prescribed time period. Moreover, whatever applicability <em>Milbert </em>might once have had to the present situation has been subverted by the subsequent amendment of Rule 5, a change which now expressly allows a grant of permission to appeal by a court of appeals \u201cat any time\u201d after entry of the interlocutory order.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">In short, in support of her thesis, Dr. Braden proffers only two cases which even deal with the problem of reentry of a \u00a7 1292(b) certificate by a district court\u2014 <em>Woods </em>and <em>Nakhleh. </em>Nonetheless, we believe that both of these cases are distinguishable from that at hand. This is so because neither <em>Woods </em>nor <em>Nakhleh </em>concerned a situation in which an appealing party, solely because of dereliction on the part of a court officer, failed to receive the requisite notice of a certification order that had been entered by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-12\">It may be contended, on behalf of the position advanced by Dr. Braden, that the restricted time authorized for launching an interlocutory appeal reflects an interest in the speedy determination of such appeals. After all, the district court grants certification because it believes an immediate appeal \u201cmay materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> To extend the ten-day period by vacation and reentry, goes the reasoning, would defeat the interest in an expedited review of the interlocutory order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-13\">Understandable as this argument may seem, it is substantially undercut by the provision in Rule 5 which permits an application for certification at any time before final judgment. This proviso allows an extended period of time between the entry of an interlocutory order and an appeal therefrom so that considerable delay in prosecuting an appeal under \u00a7 1292(b) is, quite evidently, countenanced by the rule. In addition, when petitioned to vacate and reenter its certification, a district judge may determine anew whether such action will bring the litigation closer to an end. If there already has been excessive delay, the trial court can guard against additional delinquency by refusing to vacate and reenter its original certification order.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-14\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-15\">Aside from these considerations, we believe that the evolution of Rules 77(d) and 4(a) lends support to the proposition that a district court is not foreclosed from vacating and reentering its own order \u2014 at least when the court has neglected to provide a litigant with notice of its actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-16\">The Supreme Court precipitated several amendments to these rules when it decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number><em>Hill v. Hawes.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Hill, </em>the district court clerk failed to send notice of a final judgment to the parties, and so the time for appeal expired. Thereafter, the district judge vacated the judgment and entered a second judgment from which an appeal was taken in a timely manner. Treating the later judgment as ineffective, the appellate court dismissed the appeal on the ground it was a nullity. But the Supreme Court reversed, declaring that litigants were entitled to rely on Rule 77(d), which specifies that notice be sent to the parties. The Court posited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-5\">It may well be that the effect to be given to the rule [77(d)] is that, although the judgment is final for other purposes, it does not become final for the purpose of starting the running of the period for appeal until notice is sent in accordance with the rule.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">Because <em>Hill </em>allowed a judgment to be vacated, despite the passage of a protracted period of time, Rule 77(d) subsequently was amended to counteract the impact of that decision on the finality of judgments.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The revised Rule 77(d) then provided that lack of notice of an order of judgment \u201cdoes not affect the time to appeal or relieve or authorize the court to relieve' a party for failure to appeal within the time allowed, except as permitted in Rule 73(a).\u201d However, the Advisory Committee believed that the benefits of <em>Hill </em>would be preserved. The Committee asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-7\">[I]n considering an application for extension of time for appeal as provided in Rule 73(a), the court may take into account, as one of the factors affecting its decision, whether the clerk failed to give notice as provided in Rule 77(d) or the party failed to receive the clerk\u2019s notice. It need not, however, extend the time for appeal merely because the clerk\u2019s notice was not sent or received.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-12\">Rule 73(a), whose substance later was incorporated into Appellate Rule 4(a), was amended concurrently with Rule 77(d) to \u201c[allow] the sort of relief that was brought about in <em>Hill v. Hawes, </em>but [to avoid] the difficulty of indefinite lack of finality of the judgment. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Rule 73(a) applied to all appeals \u201cpermitted by law\u201d and specified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-14\">[U]pon a showing of excusable neglect based on a failure of a party to learn of the entry of the judgment the district court in any action may extend the time for appeal not exceeding 30 days from the expiration of the original time herein prescribed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-15\">Thus, as the arrangement originally was designed, Rule 77(d) would preserve the finality of judgments, while Rule 73(a) would protect the right to appeal by those who inadvertently were not notified of the entry of a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-16\">Subsequent to passage of the Interlocutory Appeals Act in 1958, one leading commentator expressed the view that the language of Rule 73(a) was sufficiently flexible to encompass interlocutory appeals.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Nonetheless, Rule 73(a) was amended in 1966 to deal specifically with appeals under \u00a7 1292(b), one of the sections governing non-final judgments. But Rule 73(a) still retained the broad language allowing a thirty-day extension for appeals \u201cin any action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-17\">When the substance of Rule 73(a) was subsumed in Appellate Rule 4(a), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>thereby necessarily limited to appeals as of right, Rule 77(d) also was modified to refer to Rule 4(a). The elimination of a remedy for excusable neglect in taking an interlocutory appeal seemingly was the result of an oversight. It follows that Rule 77(d) should not be read woodenly so as to preclude such relief in the interlocutory situation, particularly given its limited purpose \u2014 to protect the <em>finality </em>of judgments. This would appear to be so inasmuch as the finality interest is in no way affected by the vacation and reentry of a certification under \u00a7 1292(b) before a final judgment has been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Even final judgments have not been totally shielded from the interlocking relationship between Rules 77(d) and 4(a). Courts, in certain circumstances, have been willing to ignore the apparent restriction on the type of relief that they can afford for lack of notice. Some courts, for example, have utilized Rule 60(b)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> to vacate final judgments where the parties have not received actual notice, the successful litigant has not been prejudiced, substantial rights are involved, and a petition for vacation has been made promptly.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> These tribunals rationalize that they are not abrogating the basic principle underlying the need for finality of judgments since a party cannot rely on finality when he lacks knowledge of the judgment itself. Another court has said that the policy of finality must give way in limited situations, including those in which there is an absence of prejudice to one party and the presence of prejudice to the other.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">Certainly, if an appellant may, for good reason, escape the effect of Rule 77(d) with regard to final judgments, the type of judgments that the rule was narrowly tailored to protect, there is no sound reason why he may not also avoid its effect on interlocutory orders. The rationale of <em>Hill v. Hawes </em>is still instructive, even though its result no longer obtains. After acknowledging that Rule 60(b) did not apply to that case, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-10\">[W]e think it was competent for the trial judge, ... in the exercise of a sound discretion, to vacate the former judgment and to enter a new judgment of which notice was sent in compliance with the rules. . . . [T]he judgment was still within control of the trial judge for such action as was in the interest of justice to a party to the cause.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoV\">Just as in <em>Hill, </em>Rule 60(b) would appear to be inapplicable here because its operation is confined to judgments, orders and proceedings that are final. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court suggested in <em>Hill </em>that a district court retains broad power over its interlocutory orders before a final judgment is entered. It may modify, vacate, or set them aside at any time before the final decree.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Consequently, we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>read Rule 77(d) and its precursors to forestall the district court from granting relief because of its own failure to provide adequate notice to the defendants. It was in response to defendants\u2019 petition that the district court entered the certification in the first instance. As a result, it was not unreasonable for the defendants to await notice of any action which had been taken on their petition \u2014 especially since no party has been prejudiced by the reentry of the certification order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">We hold, therefore, that the district court did not err when it vacated and reentered its certification order so as to allow a timely appeal when neither party had actual notice of the entry of the order because of dereliction on the part of the district court, the party prevailing in the district court was not prejudiced, and the losing parties had moved promptly to vacate the order after learning of its entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">II. STATE ACTION.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">Having decided that this Court had the power to entertain the interlocutory appeal, we now turn to the obdurate question of state action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">Because every claim based on \u00a7 1983 requires state action as a jurisdictional prerequisite,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> we must determine whether the district court erred in refusing to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the University of Pittsburgh was not acting \u201cunder color of\u201d state law.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In so doing, we recognize that, since the dismissal motion was submitted by Pitt, Dr. Braden, as the opposing party, is entitled to the benefit of all reasonable doubts and inferences which may arise in connection with the consideration of such motion.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-13\">In support of their motion to dismiss the complaint, the appellants contend that the University is a private educational institution and is not so involved with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that its activities fall under the concept of color of state law. Dr. Braden, in response, maintains, in effect, that the University is a state-related school with such a close and continuing relationship with the Commonwealth that it cannot be concluded, at this stage in the proceedings, that state action is lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-14\">Declining to dismiss Dr. Braden\u2019s complaint, the district judge ruled that the relationship between Pitt and the Commonwealth is such as to preclude a summary determination that the activities of the edu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>cational institution occur outside the ambit of state action. As we do not believe that such a disposition is erroneous, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">' At the inception of our analysis of the state action issue, we recognize the consequences of sustaining the refusal by the trial judge to declare that Pitt is not clothed with the mantle of the Commonwealth. Should this case be allowed to proceed, and state action ultimately be held to exist, then the University may be subjected to some of the constitutional and statutory strictures ordinarily applied to the state. Not only may Pitt have to answer for alleged violations of portions of the Bill of Rights and the 14th Amendment, but it may be liable under the statutory counterparts to such constitutional provisions as well. Because the burdens that may radiate from a decision upholding the district court may be potentially quite far-reaching, this issue should be dealt with in a full and thoughtful fashion.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">Also, it should be observed that the difficulties of drawing a line between state and private action are by now well-recognized.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> This is so because the realms of the government and the private sector are not as clearly defined as they were during the epoch in which the 14th and 15th Amendments \u2014 the sources of the statutory claim in question \u2014 were adopted. Today, the federal courts, with ever-increasing frequency, are called upon to judge whether the conduct of ostensibly nongovernmental entities is such as to warrant the application of constitutional and statutory requirements to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">It becomes our task to consider whether, given the legal precedents and factual setting at hand, the relationship between the University of Pittsburgh and the Commonwealth supports the decision of the trial judge that, at least on the available record, the activities of that educational institution cannot be deemed to be devoid of state action. In undertaking such a consideration, we must, of course, be aware that, although we are required to decide the controversy before us, this does not mean that the present case may be disassociated from the past or unrelated to the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">On several occasions, the Supreme Court has endeavored to decide when the participation of a state in an otherwise private activity is so significant that the acts of the seemingly private enterprise are to be considered state action. While the leading cases may serve as guidelines for our inquiry here, no attempt has been made by the Supreme Court, as of yet, to reconcile what may appear to be conflicting pronouncements on state action. Nor has the Court thus far sought to delineate a unitary theory of state action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-13\">Although the Supreme Court frequently has written on the subject of state action, the two opinions most pertinent to the case at bar <em>are-Burton v. Wilmington Parking </em>Authority<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Edison Co</em><footnotemark><em>39</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Not only did the Court reach divergent results in these cases, finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>state action in the former though not in the latter, but the mode of analysis in each opinion is dissimilar. It is incumbent upon this Court to determine which, if either, of these <em>cases </em>\u2014 Burton or <em>Jackson </em>\u2014 may control the present situation and, in so doing, whether <em>Jackson </em>has superseded <em>Burton </em>as the preeminent declaration on state action with respect to circumstances such as we have here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">In <em>Burton, </em>the Court held that a private restaurant owner who refused service to a customer because of his race, violated the Fourteenth Amendment where the restaurant was located in a building owned by a state-created parking authority and leased from that authority. After a thorough review of the relationship between the restaurant and the authority, the Supreme Court concluded that the state had \u201cso far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with [the restaurant] that it must be recognized as a joint participant in the challenged activity, which, on that account, cannot be considered to have been so \u2018purely private\u2019 as to fall without the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> It is thus apparent that the dispositive factor in <em>Burton, </em>with respect to the state action issue, was the extent and nature of the overall relationship between the state agency and the private enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Decided thirteen years after <em>Burton, Jackson </em>concerned a different type of nongovernmental entity, namely, a privately owned and operated utility corporation.' The utility was, however, subject to extensive state regulation in many particulars of its business. When the utility company terminated the electric service of a customer without notice, without a hearing, or without an opportunity to pay any amounts due, the customer charged that she had been denied due process. The Supreme Court rejected the due process claim on the ground that, since state action was not present, the utility was exempt from constitutional commands. It held that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was not sufficiently connected with the challenged termination to make the conduct of the private utility corporation attributable to the state for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">Important to the inquiry here is the analytical formula set forth in <em>Jackson </em>respecting state action. For the Supreme Court stated there that, when considering the vexing state action issue, the \u201cinquiry must be whether there is a sufficiently close nexus between the state and the challenged action of the regulated entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">Appellants maintain that this \u201cclose nexus\u201d test, rather than the \u201crelationship\u201d approach of <em>Burton, </em>should be applied in the case at bar. They contend that, for state action to exist, the Commonwealth must bd closely involved with the challenged employment practices of the University. In so arguing, appellants imply that the vitality of <em>Burton </em>has been severely undermined by <em>Jackson, </em>and that the existence of a pervasive relationship between the Commonwealth and the University is not, standing alone, sufficient to undergird a ruling of state action.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> While <em>Jackson </em>may invite some concern as to the present status of <em>Burton, </em>we do not find appellants\u2019 reading of these cases to be convincing. To the contrary, in our view, <em>Burton </em>retains viability, and so its teachings may well bear on the present inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">Based on a review of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Jackson, </em>we believe that that decision would not preclude application of the precepts of <em>Burton </em>here, <em>should the appropriate state-private relationship exist. </em>Instead of overruling <em>Burton, </em>the <em>Jackson </em>Court merely distinguished the earlier opinion, finding \u201cabsent in <em>[Jackson </em>] the symbiotic relationship presented in <em>Burton . </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The implication arising from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>such efforts at differentiation is not that <em>Burton </em>was supplanted by <em>Jackson, </em>but rather that <em>Burton </em>remained as a powerful precedent with which the Court had to contend. Moreover, the <em>Jackson </em>opinion repeatedly cites <em>Burton </em>with apparent approval,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> hardly sounding the death knell for <em>Burton </em>that the appellants would have us perceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">It may be that only in the absence of an inextricably-linked relationship between the state and a private entity does the \u201cclose nexus\u201d test of <em>Jackson </em>come into play. Where a private enterprise stands, in its operations, as a veritable partner with the state, then it seems proper to hold such enterprise subject to the same constitutional requirements to which the state is accountable. But the situation may be otherwise where no pervasive state-private relationship exists. For without such an arrangement, there would appear to be no basis for holding a private entity to constitutional strictures, unless the state is closely involved in the very activity challenged by a litigant.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Thus, as we understand it, <em>Burton </em>and <em>Jackson </em>stand as two models of state-action analysis that have been designed by the Supreme Court to date, with the applicability of either approach resting on the type of setting which may be present.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">Having concluded that <em>Burton </em>retains vitality, we must examine the available materials concerning the nature and extent of the connection between the University of Pittsburgh and the Commonwealth. We do so to resolve whether the principles of <em>Burton </em>may control this appeal as well as to ascertain whether the district court\u2019s conclusion as to state action should be upheld. Such determinations often depend largely on the factual matrix that obtains. Indeed, the Supreme Court declared in <em>Burton </em>that \u201conly by sifting facts and weighing circumstances . . .\u201d can matters turning on state action be resolved.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> And such emphasis on the factual elements was echoed in <em>Jackson </em>as well.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-13\">Pursuant to instructions rendered by this Court during the previous appeal, the district judge conducted an extensive evidentiary investigation respecting the factual facets of the state action question. As the trial court set forth its findings in an exhaustive fashion, it is not necessary to restate them at length. Rather, we shall highlight only those facts that are critical to the issue whether this action should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-14\">With respect to the overall relationship between the University and the Commonwealth, a most telling factor is the Univer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>sity of Pittsburgh-Commonwealth Act<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> and the manner in which that legislation has been implemented. Such evidence would appear to indicate that the state is deeply enmeshed in operations of the University, including but not limited to its financing and its basic decision-making processes. Indeed, in light of the Act and the history of its effectuation, it is highly questionable whether the University may be described as a \u201cpurely private\u201d institution, a characterization that would substantially immunize it from the dictates of the Constitution and the statutory progeny of that document.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Prior to the passage of the Act, Pitt was a private educational institution in dire financial straits.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> At the initiative of the University, overtures were made to the State Board of Education in an effort to ameliorate Pitt\u2019s monetary troubles. While agreeing to afford the requested aid, the Commonwealth was not content merely to inject public funds into the ailing institution. Instead, as will become evident, it conditioned a massive infusion of moneys on a comprehensive restructuring of the University to reflect the needs of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">In connection with the pre-enactment consideration of the legislation, the State Board of Education adopted a resolution in March, 1966 which called for increased enrollment of and reduced tuition for Pennsylvania students at Pitt. The resolution also stated that \u201cthe University\u2019s program must be responsive to the educational needs of the Commonwealth. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Similarly, in testimony before the district court regarding the statutes, a former Pitt Chancellor expressed the opinion that the Act represented a \u201ccommitment that the University has made to perform certain services for the state.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Such comments in the legislative history and elsewhere demonstrate that the relationship between the University and the Commonwealth was intended to be a close one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-13\">That the University of Pittsburgh-Commonwealth Act is especially damaging to the appellants\u2019 contention that state action is lacking becomes immediately clear. The Pennsylvania legislature in. its statutory program boldly announces:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-14\">[I]t is hereby declared to be the purpose of this act to extend Commonwealth opportunities for higher education by establishing University of Pittsburgh as an <em>instrumentality </em>of the Commonwealth to serve as a <em>State-related </em>institution in the Commonwealth system of higher education.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-15\">And the body of the Act discloses that the proclamation of legislative policy, making the University a state \u201cinstrumentality\u201d as well as a \u201cstate-related institution,\u201d is not empty verbiage. We are inclined to take the Commonwealth at its word, and, indeed, may well be obligated to do so at this point in the proceedings. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-16\">Examination of the Act, as adopted and implemented, suggests that the line of demarcation between the University and the Commonwealth was blurred, if not obliterated. Significantly, the legislation changed the name of the University to the \u201cUniversity of Pittsburgh \u2014 Of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Pitt\u2019s charter also was amended so that trustees appointed by the Governor of Pennsylvania, by the President Pro Tempore of the Senate and by the Speaker of the House constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>one-third of the voting members of the Board of Trustees.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> In addition, the Act names several state officials as ex <em>officio </em>trustees, including the Governor, the State Secretary of Education, and the Mayor of Pittsburgh, thus seeming to ensure that governmental representation on the Board is rather substantial.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">The statutory program is not limited to a modification of the University\u2019s name or the composition of its Board of Trustees. It promises that there will be annual appropriations for Pitt.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> And since the passage of the legislation, public funds have poured into the coffers of the University, averaging more than one-third of its total operating budget.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> In fiscal year 1973-74, for example, the state appropriated roughly $48 million for Pitt, an amount representing over thirty-five per cent of the school\u2019s budget. And the generosity of the Commonwealth has increased with each passing year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">Under the University of Pittsburgh-Commonwealth Act, the state does not appear to provide annual appropriations with only minimal requirements respecting their use. Rather, Pitt may have surrendered much of its fiscal autonomy to the state, with the Commonwealth holding both the purse-strings as well as extensive financial control over the University.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">In exchange for public funds, Pitt agreed to submit to stringent regulations of its fiscal and other affairs.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Under the Act, then, the Commonwealth has reserved the right to specify the purposes for or areas in which public funds may be spent. Substantial powers are vested in the Auditor General as well. Not only may that official audit the use of state funds and disallow any expenditures therefrom which he deems improper, but he retains the right to review the University\u2019s expenditures of non-state moneys.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Moreover, so as to ensure \u201cproper accountability\u201d on the part of Pitt, a comprehensive report detailing the amounts and purposes of <em>all </em>expenditures, from both state and private funds, must be filed with the Commonwealth. Consultations between the University and the state also are to be held respecting the <em>entire </em>budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">In addition to the above features, the Act directs the Chancellor to submit an annual report to the Commonwealth regarding all University activities \u2014 instructional, admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>istrative and financial.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Furthermore, a 1972 amendment to the statutory arrangement requires detailed reports concerning, <em>inter alia, </em>the numbers of faculty and students as well as faculty teaching loads and salaries.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The information required under this addendum to the Act must be provided by each school and each department within the University.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Finally, the University of Pittsburgh-Commonwealth Act pledges capital development assistance to Pitt.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> In essence, the benefits that state and authority programs for capital development bestow on wholly-owned state colleges are to be accorded the University as well. The state is authorized to acquire lands, construct facilities and lease or loan them to Pitt, and it has in fact done so. Through its General State Authority, the Commonwealth has provided about one-third of the University\u2019s buildings. Between 1966 and 1974, the cost of the construction for such building projects has totaled approximately $94 million. In addition, the Pennsylvania Higher Education Facilities Authority has financed various capital improvements for Pitt, including one project costing $6.5 million and another, roughly $600,000.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">All in all, the comprehensive statutory arrangement, carefully interweaving the functions of the University of Pittsburgh and the Commonwealth, and the manner in which it has been effectuated hardly suggests that state action does not exist. If anything, there would appear to be adequate grounds for believing that Pitt is vested with a status more closely akin to that of a state college rather than that of a private institution of higher education.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-12\">As we see it, there is an ample basis for concluding, at least at this time, that the relationship between Pitt and the Commonwealth may be \u201csymbiotic\u201d in a manner similar to that present in <em>Burton. </em>For the two entities, once denizens of separate societal realms, apparently are now dependent upon one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-13\">As discussed above, prior to adoption of the Act, the University desperately needed a source of funds to maintain its operations. The situation was described by Pitt officials and trustees as grave.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> At the same time, the Commonwealth desired to satisfy the needs of the populace for expanded facilities for higher education. As the existing state educational institutions were insufficient to satisfy the public demand, and because the creation of new state universities would have been extremely expensive, the decision was made to incorporate established, but financially ailing private institutions into the Commonwealth system of higher education.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The state thus was able to satisfy the educational needs of its citizens at a cost considerably lower than would have been entailed by the creation of wholly new institutions. Concomitantly, Pitt was able to survive as an institution of higher education, even though it may have been forced to relinquish its traditional autonomy as a private facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-14\">Since the facts adduced thus far indicate that the relationship between the University of Pittsburgh and the Commonwealth is symbiotic in nature, or at least pervasive, we believe that the precepts of <em>Burton </em>may be applicable to the present appeal. Not only does it appear that the state in this situation, as in <em>Burton, </em>has \u201cinsinuated itself into a position of interdependence\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>with Pitt, but it seems to be a \u201cjoint participant\u201d in the educational enterprise as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">Moreover, the restaurant involved in <em>Burton </em>was situated in a public building, and the private entity leased its premises from the state.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> In <em>Jackson, </em>the Supreme Court suggested that the \u201cactual holding\u201d of <em>Burton </em>might be limited to lessees of public property.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Even so, as previously indicated, many of the buildings within the Pitt complex were built by the state or its agencies with public funds and are leased to the University, including the very building within which Dr. Braden worked.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> It follows that even if <em>Burton </em>and its \u201crelationship\u201d theory of state action should be limited to a \u201clease\u201d situation, the present appeal still may be governed by the teachings of that landmark decision.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Consequently, the district court did not commit error when it declined to dismiss the complaint for a purported absence of state action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">Although the factual matrix as presented here, considered against the backdrop of <em>Burton, </em>supports the district court's refusal to dismiss the complaint, it still is appropriate to consider the pronouncements of the small number of courts which have confronted situations similar to the one at hand. Two such opinions fortify the decision that we reach today.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-12\">Of these cases, the more pertinent is <em>Isaacs v. Board of Trustees of Temple University,</em><footnotemark><em>72</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a case which also concerned sex discrimination claims. In denying a motion for summary judgment raised by Temple University, Judge Higginbotham indicated that the activities of that educational institution constituted state action. He did so on facts which closely parallel those in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-13\">The <em>Isaacs </em>opinion places substantial weight on the Temple University-Commonwealth Act, an identical twin to the statutory program enacted on behalf of Pitt. Not only do the provisions of the Temple legislation virtually duplicate those of the Pittsburgh enactments, but both Acts were drafted with the same objectives in mind and at roughly the same time.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Like the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>Pitt Act, the Temple legislation was promulgated so that Temple could transcend crushing financial woes, while obligating that university to operate as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth and to serve the citizenry at large. After carefully reviewing the Temple-Commonwealth Act and the degree of state participation in that university, as we have done in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the <em>Isaacs </em>court stated that the \u201cCommonwealth of Pennsylvania has so significantly involved itself in the affairs of Temple University that the latter\u2019s activities [constitute] \u2018state action\u2019 and action \u2018under color of\u2019 state law . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> In our view such a conclusion may prove to be appropriate in the present appeal which closely tracks <em>Isaacs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">It should be observed that <em>Jackson </em>was decided immediately after the opinion in <em>Isaacs </em>was rendered. Since <em>Isaacs </em>so heavily relies, quite properly, on <em>Burton, </em>the analysis presented by Judge Higginbotham remains valid only so long as <em>Jackson </em>is not construed to overrule or devitalize <em>Burton. </em>As we fail to so read <em>Jackson, </em>the principles espoused in <em>Isaacs </em>remain supportive of the conclusion reached by the trial judge that state action cannot be ruled out summarily in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Because Pennsylvania\u2019s system of state-related universities, which includes Pitt and Temple, seems to be relatively distinctive, it is not surprising that other legal precedents pertinent to the case at hand are lacking. However, one court of appeals has considered a situation which may be an analogue to the present one. In <em>Powe v. </em>Miles,<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> the Second Circuit dealt with an appeal from a dismissal of a complaint. The <em>Powe </em>suit challenged the suspension of students by Alfred University, a private educational institution, and by the New York State College of Ceramics, a school administered by Alfred under a contract with the State of New York. Speaking for a unanimous panel, Judge Friendly declared that the university administration was not acting under color of state law when it suspended students at Alfred proper, but was acting under color of state law when it disciplined students at the College of Ceramics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-14\"><em>Powe </em>bears on our inquiry here because of its factual features as well as the method of analysis exhibited in that portion of the opinion focusing on the claims of the ceramics students. In evaluating whether the activities of the College of Ceramics could constitute state action, Judge Friendly relied quite heavily on a statutory program which set forth the arrangement between Alfred University and the State of New York.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-15\">The legislation deemed to be so crucial in <em>Powe </em>is, in several important respects, markedly similar to the University of Pittsburgh-Commonwealth Act. For example, under the New York enactments, the State is to provide substantial funds as well as major buildings and facilities for the ceramics school.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Similarly, as in the case before us, the statutory scheme in <em>Powe </em>expressly denominates the College of Ceramics as a state institution. Finally, the New York legislation declares that Alfred is to serve as \u201cthe representative of the state university trustees\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> \u2014 a statement quite parallel to its correlative in the Pitt statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-16\">In <em>Powe, </em>then, state legislation, and the manner in which it was implemented, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>proved to be the critical factor in the disposition of the state action issue regarding students at the College of Ceramics. We believe that <em>Powe </em>supports our emphasis on the statutory arrangement between Pitt and the Commonwealth. And it would appear that the result we reach today is consonant with that obtained in the <em>Powe </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">While there are many other eases which have raised the question of state action with respect to institutions of higher education,<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> none of them contained a factual configuration similar to that here. Perhaps the most important of these cases, and one which is illustrative of the group, is <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Illinois Institute of </em>Technology.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> In <em>Cohen, </em>Judge (now Justice) Stevens, writing for a panel of the Seventh Circuit, sustained the dismissal of a complaint which tendered a \u00a7 \u25a0 1983 claim. Although the defendant university used the name \u201cIllinois\u201d in its institutional title, received some financial and other support from the state and was subject to certain regulations,<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> the <em>Cohen </em>court declined to rule that state action existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">Nevertheless, <em>Cohen </em>would appear to be distinguishable from the case at hand\u2014 chiefly because there is no statutory program which inextricably links I.I.T. to the State of Illinois. Contrary to the Pitt situation, the level of financial support offered I.I.T. by the state is minimal. Judge Stevens expressly stated that \u201cthe funds contributed by the State represent only a small fraction of the cost of educating the students . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> In addition, I.I.T. selected its own institutional name, unlike the statutory designation of the University of Pittsburgh as a Commonwealth school. Moreover, the regulations imposed by the state are far less extensive in <em>Cohen </em>than in the present case. Basically, the Illinois provisions speak to the issue of accreditation and little else, whereas the University of Pittsburgh-Commonwealth Act is far more sweeping in its scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-11\">Perhaps the most important basis for distinguishing <em>Cohen </em>from this case is the absence there of other indicia of a close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>relationship between the state and the university, including, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) governmental participation in determining the composition of the board of trustees, (2) the review of the expenditure of private funds by state officials, (3) onerous reporting requirements; (4) a legislative history which discloses that the state desired to utilize the educational facilities of an existing institution rather than create new ones itself; and especially (5) the statutory declaration that Pitt is an \u201cinstrumentality\u201d of the Commonwealth. Indeed, the <em>Cohen </em>opinion vigorously emphasizes that there was no \u201cevidence that [I.I.T.] is . .a State instrumentality . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> Had there been such evidence in <em>Cohen, </em>the Seventh Circuit may well have reached an opposite result and found state action. By its own terms, then, <em>Cohen </em>constitutes a case considerably different from the one with which we are now concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">As a final point, we recognize that <em>Cohen </em>appears to have utilized the \u201cclose nexus\u201d test of <em>Jackson. </em>The analysis of Judge Stevens turns, in part, on the absence of \u201csome nexus between the State . and defendants\u2019 wrongful conduct. . . \u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Yet, it is important to bear in mind that <em>Cohen </em>applied the \u201cclose nexus\u201d approach only after a careful evaluation of the facts revealed the absence of a tight bond between the state and the university. Following such factual scrutiny, Judge Stevens expressly concluded: \u201cIt is plain that the school is not so heavily dependent on the State as to be considered the equivalent of a public university . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> By contrast, as discussed above, sufficient facts may have been produced here to undergird an eventual finding that there is a symbiotic relationship between the state and Pitt so as to bring the present case within the ambit of <em>Burton, </em>not <em>Jackson </em>or <em>Cohen. Cohen </em>thus would appear to lend limited support to the appellants\u2019 arguments that state action is lacking here. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">In sum, we believe that the district court did not commit error in declining to dismiss the complaint for a purported want of state action. In our view, there were adequate grounds for refusing to rule that the relationship between the University of Pittsburgh and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is such as to forbid the application of the constitutional commands, and the statutory derivations therefrom, to the University-</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court will be affirmed and the case remanded for action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1007-14\">.

The district court believed that the \u201cclose nexus\u201d formula of <em>Jackson </em>might well be satisfied on the facts as proffered. 392 F.Supp. at 125-126. And there is some evidence of state participation in the activity specifically challenged by Dr. Bra-den \u2014 to wit, the University\u2019s employment policies and practices. In addition to the Snyder Amendment, to which we earlier referred, <em>see </em>text accompanying note 59 <em>supra, </em>the Board of Trustees confronted the issue of sex discrimination when it adopted a Resolution in 1970 proscribing such discrimination at Pitt, <em>see </em>392 F.Supp. at 122.

I also concur in the result reached in Part II of that opinion, which, after discussing the issue of state action, leaves the ultimate determination of whether state action exists to the final hearing on the merits. I have written separately on the issue of state action, however, for two reasons. First, I believe several aspects of the opinion of the Court deserve special emphasis. Second, I wish to explain why I disagree with the Court\u2019s analysis of the relevant state action precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-16\">In light of the opinion of the district court and the arguments advanced in this appeal by counsel for Dr. Braden, I think it is extremely important to emphasize the limited nature of this Court\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-17\">As the opinion of the Court makes clear, this case is before us on interlocutory appeal from an order of the district court which did no more than to deny Pitt\u2019s motion to dismiss Dr. Braden\u2019s complaint under Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 12(b)(6). Since the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>trict court, in ruling on that motion, considered matters outside the pleadings, Pitt\u2019s motion was converted by Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 12(c) into a motion for summary judgment. On appeal from the denial of that motion, it is obvious that the only question which is properly before us is the following: did the district court err in refusing to enter summary judgment in favor of Pitt on the issue of state action?</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Despite the limited nature of the question presented by the denial of Pitt\u2019s motion for summary judgment, counsel for Dr. Braden has called our attention to certain dicta in the opinion of the district court and has urged us to decide a much broader question. Although the district court did no more than to deny Pitt\u2019s motion, its opinion concluded with the categorical statement that \u201cPitt was acting under \u2018color of state law\u2019 when it engaged in the activity challenged by Dr. Braden.\u201d 392 F.Supp. at 126. <em>See also id. </em>at 124 \u2014 25. In this Court, counsel for Dr. Braden has pointed to this language as the \u201cfinding\u201d of the district court and has urged us to affirm it. Brief for Appellee at 67. <em>See also id. </em>at 6, 49-50. In effect, therefore, counsel for Dr. Braden has asked this Court to treat the order of the district court as one which not only denied-Pitt\u2019s motion for summary judgment but as one which also granted partial summary judgment in favor of Dr. Braden, even though she did not file a cross-motion and could not have been granted that relief even if she had.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">In view of this background, I believe it is important to emphasize that this Court has <em>not </em>treated the order of the district court as one granting partial summary judgment for Dr. Braden but merely as one denying Pitt\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Maj.Op. 949, 954, 955 and 965. This Court has decided <em>only </em>that \u201cthe district court did not commit <em>error in </em>declining to dismiss [Dr. Braden\u2019s] complaint for a purported want of state action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 965. <em>This Court has not decided either that state action is or is not present in this case. Id. </em>at 955, n.35, 965. <em>That question remains completely open. </em>As I understand it, nothing in the opinion of this Court would preclude the district court on remand from determining either that state action is or is not involved in this case. Nor is there anything in that opinion which would preclude this Court from reaching either result should this case again come before us on appeal from the final judgment of the district court. It goes without saying, therefore, that, as the opinion of the Court notes, our affirmance of the order of the district court <em>may not </em>and <em>should not </em>be taken as any indication that we approve of \u201ccertain language in the opinion of the district judge\u201d which \u201cseems to indicate affirmatively that state action exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 955 n.35. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">Finally, I think that one of this Court\u2019s observations in <em>Braden v. University of Pittsburgh, </em>477 F.2d 1 (3d Cir. 1973) <em>[Bra-den </em>I], also deserves emphasis. In <em>Braden I, </em>it seems to me, this Court recognized that the state action issue which this case presents is not suited for resolution by means of summary judgment. We concluded by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-8\">This is an important case and we are entitled to a carefully prepared record after <em>full hearing </em>in the trial court and to the <em>views of the trial court upon such a record.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 8. <em>Accord Weise v. Syracuse University, </em>522 F.2d 397, 408 (2d Cir. 1975) (relying on <em>Braden I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"AfC\">I believe that this observation is as true today as it was when <em>Braden I </em>was decided. The Supreme Court has frequently warned that \u201c[o]nly by <em>sifting facts </em>and <em>weighing circumstances </em>can the nonobvious involvement of the State in private conduct be attributed its true significance.\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, </em>365 U.S. 715, 722, 81 S.Ct. 856, 860, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961). <em>See also Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, </em>407 U.S. 162, 172, 9S.Ct. 1965, 32 L.Ed.2d 627 (1972). Since a district court, in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, is required to give the party opposing the motion the \u201cbenefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>all reasonable doubts and inferences,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court is not entitled to and cannot \u201csift\u201d the facts it believes to be important from those it regards are insignificant. Nor can the court attribute to each fact the weight which it believes it deserves. Every fact must be \u201csifted\u201d and \u201cweighed\u201d against the moving party. As a result, it seems obvious to me that summary judgment procedures are poorly suited for deciding state action questions such as that posed by this case. Where the nub of a state action claim rests upon statutes, case law, or regulations, summary judgment may well be proper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But where, as in this case, the practical working relationship between the state and the private entity is at issue, it seems clear that summary judgment will be proper only in the most obvious cases. This is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">I believe that it is also important to emphasize that the summary of the relationship between Pitt and the Commonwealth contained in Part IIC of the opinion of the Court must not be read out of context.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">At the beginning of its discussion of the state action question, the opinion of the Court recognizes that \u201csince the dismissal motion was submitted by Pitt, Dr. Braden, as the opposing party, is entitled to the benefit of all reasonable doubts and inferences which may arise in connection with the consideration of such motion.\u201d Maj.Op. at 955. As I understand Part IIC of the opinion of the Court, it represents an application of this rule to the facts of this case. As a result, in that portion of its opinion, the Court gives Dr. Braden the benefit of all reasonable doubts and inferences with respect to every fact which bears upon the relationship between the Commonwealth and the University. I believe it is important, therefore, to emphasize that Part IIC of the opinion of the Court must be read <em>only </em>as a summary of that relationship <em>as we are obliged to view it at this stage of the proceedings. </em>At the final judgment stage, the district court may and undoubtedly will be required to view the facts quite differently. In addition, should this case again come before this Court on appeal from the final judgment of the district court, we will then be constrained to consider the facts from a very different perspective. . A few illustrations will make this point clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-14\">The opinion of the Court, giving Dr. Bra-den the benefit of all reasonable doubts and inferences, apparently attaches considerable significance to the language of Pa.Stat. Ann. Tit. 24, \u00a7 2510-202 (Supp.1976), which characterizes Pitt as an \u201cinstrumentality of the Commonwealth\u201d and a \u201cState-related institution.\u201d Maj.Op. at 959. At the same time, the Court ignores the testimony of the trustees concerning the effect which this provision has on the actual administration of the University, presumably because that testimony was highly damaging to Dr. Braden.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>392 F.Supp. at 121-22. While this treatment of the evidence is unobjectionable at this stage of the proceedings, at the final judgment stage the district court will obviously have to view the evidence quite differently. It will have to consider both the language of the statute and the testimony of the trustees which <em>Braden I </em>required the district court to take.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, since Dr. Braden will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>not automatically be given the benefit of all reasonable doubts and inferences at that stage, the district court will be free to give the language of the statute and the testimony of the trustees the weight which it believes they deserve.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">The opinion of the Court places great emphasis upon the Commonwealth\u2019s authority to appoint one-third of Pitt\u2019s board of trustees (Maj.Op. at 959), while failing to mention the evidence concerning the trustees which <em>Braden I </em>required the district court to assemble.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Braden I, </em>this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-6\">We cannot decide this case in a semi-vacuum. We do not know, for example, the number of trustees which the University actually has, their names, their tenure of office, and who and what they are, their occupations and connections, and whether or not they are paid for their services or meetings or receive salaries or emoluments, and if so, by whom are these emoluments or salaries paid and what do they amount to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-12\">477 F.2d at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-13\">On remand, the district court took evidence on all these points. That evidence revealed that the backgrounds and occupations of the trustees appointed by the Commonwealth were remarkably similar to those of the other trustees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is also showed that most of the trustees in both groups were prominent private citizens with few ties to the Commonwealth. In addition, as the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-14\">4. The voting record of individual trustees is not kept, but, according to the testimony, the trustees appointed by the Commonwealth have never acted in a bloc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-15\">5. All trustees, except the Chancellor, serve without compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-16\">392 F.Supp. at 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-17\">At the final judgment stage, the district court will be required to take all this evidence into account and to give it the weight which it merits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">The opinion of the Court concludes that \u201cPitt may have surrendered much of its fiscal autonomy to the state, with the Commonwealth holding both the purse-strings as well as extensive financial control over the University.\u201d Maj.Op. at 960. It must be emphasized, however, that the Court reaches that conclusion only because it gives Dr. Braden the benefit of all reasonable doubts and inferences, as it is required to do at this stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">The opinion of the Court, for example, infers that the Auditor General\u2019s authority to review the University\u2019s expenditure of non-state moneys gives him considerable control over the University\u2019s finances. Maj.Op. at 960. At the same time, the Court gives little weight to the testimony in the district court which suggested that the Auditor General \u201creviewed\u201d the expenditure of Pitt\u2019s private funds only in order to determine how much the Commonwealth should contribute. Appendix at 101a. At the final judgment stage, the district court will be required to weigh all this evidence and to make a finding on this disputed issue of fact.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">The opinion of the Court also infers from the fact that Pitt is required to make various annual reports to the Commonwealth that the Commonwealth exercises significant control over Pitt\u2019s finances. Maj.Op. at 960. At the final judgment stage, however, when Dr. Braden will not automatically be given the benefit of all reasonable doubts and inferences, the district court will be required to weigh the evidence and to make findings with respect to whether the Commonwealth has utilized these reporting requirements to \u201ccontrol\u201d Pitt.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">The opinion of the Court fails to give any significance to Pa.Stat.Ann., tit. 24, \u00a7 2510\u2014 205 (Supp.1976), which vests the \u201centire management, control and conduct of the . financial affairs of the university in the board of trustees.\u201d Maj.Op. at 960 n.59. It also fails to mention the testimony in the district court which revealed that the Commonwealth places no restrictions on Pitt\u2019s freedom to use its private funds as it sees fit. Appendix at 478a-79a. At the final judgment stage, this evidence will obviously have to be taken into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-11\">Finally, the opinion of the Court places heavy reliance upon the percentage of Pitt\u2019s annual budget which the Commonwealth contributes. While I believe that it is permissible to rely upon that factor at this stage of the proceedings, at the final judgment stage the district court will have to consider this Court\u2019s twin warnings in <em>Hollenbaugh </em>v. <em>Carnegie Free Library, </em>545 F.2d 382 (3d Cir. 1976). In <em>Hoilenbaugh, </em>this Court cautioned that \u201c \u2018receipt of mon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>ey from the State is not, without a good deal more, enough to make the recipient an agency or instrumentality of the Government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385, <em>quoting Grossner v. Trustees of Columbia University, </em>287 F.Supp. 535, 547-48 (S.D.N.Y.1968). <em>Accord, </em>Maj.Op. at 960 n.58. This Court also warned that state action questions ought not to turn upon the precise percentage of an institution\u2019s budget which is contributed by the state. <em>Hollenbaugh v. Carnegie Free Library, supra, </em>at 384-85. At the final judgment stage, these two principles will, in my view, preclude extensive reliance upon the percentage of Pitt\u2019s operating budget contributed by the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">In short, it must be stressed that the Court\u2019s conclusion with respect to the financial control which the Commonwealth exercises over the University will not necessarily be valid at subsequent stages of this litigation. That conclusion as well as all the factual statements contained in Part IIC must not and cannot be read out of the context of a 12(b)(6) or summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">While I agree with the majority of the Court that the district court was correct in denying Pitt\u2019s motion for summary judgment <em>(see </em>Part IV of my opinion), I do not agree with the state action standards employed by the Court in reaching that conclusion. I therefore feel compelled to express the reasons for my disagreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-11\">I am, to be frank, rather perplexed by the Court\u2019s analysis of the state action standards which apply in this case. After identifying <em>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Au</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number><em>thority, </em>365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961), and <em>Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 95 S.Ct. 449, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974), as the two most pertinent Supreme Court precedents and after summarizing the holdings of those two cases (Maj.Op. at 956 \u2014 957), the Court observes that <em>Burton </em>was not overruled by <em>Jackson. Id. </em>at 957. The Court then virtually ignores <em>Jackson </em>and proceeds to apply <em>Burton </em>to the facts of this case. I believe there are two flaws in the majority\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">First, I think the Court has greatly oversimplified the evolution of the <em>Burton </em>theory of state action by flatly equating <em>Burton </em>with the \u201coverall relationship\u201d test. The majority constructs that equation by focusing upon a single sentence in the <em>Burton </em>opinion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But the <em>Burton </em>Court stated specifically and at some length that it was <em>not </em>announcing a state action \u201ctest\u201d of general applicability. 365 U.S. at 725-26, 81 S.Ct. 856. More importantly, the facts in <em>Burton </em>were such that state action could certainly have been found under either the \u201coverall relationship\u201d test or the \u201cnexus\u201d test. While the state and the restaurant undoubtedly had a close overall relationship, the state was also deeply implicated in the very acts of the restaurant which were challenged, <em>i. e., </em>its refusal to serve blacks. <em>Burton </em>states that \u201cit [cannot] be ignored especially in view of Eagle\u2019s affirmative allegation that for it to serve Negroes would injure its business, that profits earned by discrimination not only contribute to, but also are indispensable elements in, the financial success of a governmental agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 724, 81 S.Ct. at 861. As a result, it is not at all \u201capparent that the dispositive factor in Burton . . . was the extent and nature of' the overall relationship between the state agency and the private enterprise.\u201d Maj.Op. at 957.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-13\">The second flaw in the majority\u2019s analysis is its failure to consider the gloss which subsequent opinions have placed upon <em>Burton. </em>The majority opinion, after noting that <em>Burton </em>has not been overruled by subsequent cases, apparently leaps to the conclusion that <em>Burton </em>can now be applied without even considering the interpretations of <em>Burton </em>contained in more recent Supreme Court opinions. Although <em>Moose Lodge No. 107 </em>v. <em>Irvis, </em>407 U.S. 163, 92 S.Ct. 1965, 32 L.Ed.2d 627 (1972), and <em>Jackson </em>both discussed <em>Burton </em>at length, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>majority for the most part ignores that discussion. I must take exception to this approach. We cannot turn the clock back 16 years and read <em>Burton </em>as if <em>Moose Lodge </em>and <em>Jackson </em>had never been decided. Any discussion of <em>Burton </em>in 1977 must consider the extent to which subsequent Supreme Court cases have clarified or modified the meaning of that decision. I believe that a brief examination of those cases reveals that the question which <em>Burton </em>left open\u2014 whether the \u201coverall relationship\u201d test <em>or </em>the \u201cnexus\u201d test is the correct one \u2014 has now been answered in favor of the \u201cnexus\u201d standard.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>In <em>Jackson, </em>the Supreme Court suggested that the \u201cactual holding\u201d of <em>Burton </em>might be limited to lessees of public property. Even so, as previously indicated, many of the buildings within the Pitt complex were built by the state or its agencies with public funds and are leased to the University, including the very building within which Dr. Braden worked. It follows that even if <em>Burton </em>and its \u201crelationship\u201d theory of state action should be limited to a \u201clease\u201d situation, the present appeal still may be governed by the teachings of that landmark decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>The first Supreme Court case to analyze <em>Burton </em>closely was <em>Moose Lodge No. 107 </em>v. <em>Irvis, </em>407 U.S. 163, 92 S.Ct. 1965, 32 L.Ed.2d 627 (1972), in which the Court reversed <em>Irvis v. Scott, </em>318 F.Supp. 1246 (M.D.Pa.1970) (three-judge court).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Irvis v. Scott, supra, </em>had relied upon <em>Burton </em>in holding that the acts of racial discrimination of a private club were infused with state action. Writing for the three-judge court, Judge Freedman had noted that Pennsylvania had granted the club a liquor license and had regulated its activities extensively. He had concluded that \u201c[i]t would be difficult to find a more pervasive interaction of state authority with personal conduct.\u201d 318 F.Supp. at 1250. As a result, the district court had held that \u201c[a]s in <em>Burton </em>the state has \u2018insinuated itself into a position of interdependence\u2019 with its club licensees . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1251. In reversing the district court, the Supreme Court did not dispute the pervasive nature of the \u201coverall relationship\u201d between the state and the club. The Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-9\">The District Court was at pains to point out in its opinion what it considered to be the \u201cpervasive\u201d nature of the regulation of private clubs by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-10\">However, detailed this type of regulation may be in some particulars, it cannot be said to in any way foster or encourage racial discrimination. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-11\">We therefore hold that, with the exception hereafter noted, the operation of the regulatory scheme enforced by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board <em>does not sufficiently implicate the State in the discriminatory guest policies </em>of Moose Lodge to make the latter \u201cstate action\u201d within the ambit of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 176-77, 92 S.Ct. at 1973. If, as the majority suggests, state action can now be found based solely upon a pervasive \u201coverall relationship,\u201d then the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Moose Lodge </em>is hard to understand.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-13\">In <em>Gilmore v. City of Montgomery, </em>417 U.S. 556, 94 S.Ct. 2416, 41 L.Ed.2d 304 (1974), the Court stated flatly that the <em>Burton </em>test requires a nexus between the state and the very activity challenged. In <em>Gilmore </em>the Court affirmed an order enjoining the city from allowing private segregated schools to have the exclusive use of municipal recreational facilities. Discussing <em>Burton </em>and <em>Moose Lodge </em>in his opinion for the Court, Justice Blackmun wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>Because the city makes city property available for use by private entities, this case is more like <em>Burton </em>than <em>Moose Lodge. </em>The question then is <em>whether there is significant state involvement in the private discrimination alleged. Reitman v. Mulkey, </em>387 U.S. 369, 87 S.Ct. 1627, 18 L.Ed.2d 830 (1967); <em>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, supra; Evans v. Newton, </em>382 U.S. 296, 86 S.Ct. 486, 15 L.Ed.2d 373 (1966); <em>Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, supra. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">The Court\u2019s most extensive discussion of <em>Burton </em>occurred in <em>Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 95 S.Ct. 449, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974), which held that state action was not present when a privately owned and operated utility company terminated a customer\u2019s electric service without giving her notice, a hearing, or an opportunity to pay amounts due. <em>Jackson </em>reached this conclusion despite the fact that the state was involved \u201cin virtually every phase of the company\u2019s business.\u201d 419 U.S. at 368, 95 S.Ct. at 462 (Marshall, J., dissenting). In .addressing the <em>Burton </em>theory of state action, <em>Jackson </em>first pointed out the factual distinctions between that case and <em>Burton. </em>Then, after summarizing the substantial connections between the state and the utility, it concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-6\">Under our decision this is not sufficient to <em>connect the State of Pennsylvania with respondent\u2019s action </em>so as to make the latter\u2019s conduct attributable to the State for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 358, 95 S.Ct. at 457. <em>Jackson </em>also observed that the proper \u201cinquiry must be whether there is a sufficiently close <em>nexus between the State and the challenged action </em>of the regulated entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 351, 95 S.Ct. at 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">In conclusion, it appears to me that <em>Moose Lodge, Gilmore, </em>and <em>Jackson </em>place a gloss upon <em>Burton </em>which we are not free to ignore. The teaching of those cases is that \u201cneither general government involvement nor even extensive detailed state regulation is sufficient for a finding of state action. Rather, the state must affirmatively support and be directly involved in the specific conduct which is being challenged.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Cannon v. University of Chicago, </em>Nos. 76-1238/9 (7th Cir., filed August 27,1976) at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">With the exception of <em>Hollenbaugh v. Carnegie Free Library, supra, </em>which is discussed below, this Court\u2019s recent state action opinions have all employed the \u201cnexus\u201d test rather than the \u201coverall relationship\u201d approach. <em>Broderick v. Associated Hospital Service of Philadelphia, </em>536 F.2d 1, 4-6 (3d Cir. 1976) (per Garth, J.); <em>Magill v. Avonworth Baseball Conference, </em>516 F.2d 1328, 1332-33 (3d Cir. 1975) (per Aldisert, J.); <em>Gibbs v. Titelman, </em>502 F.2d 1107, 1111-12 (3d Cir. 1974) (per Hunter, J.); <em>Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>483 F.2d 754, 756 (1973) (per Weis, J.), <em>aff\u2019d., </em>419 U.S. 345, 95 S.Ct. 449, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-12\">In <em>Broderick </em>this Court stated: \u201cFor state action to be found where the impetus for the discrimination is private, the record must demonstrate that the state has become significantly involved <em>with the discriminatory action alleged.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 536 F.2d at 4. <em>Broderick </em>never even referred to the \u201coverall relationship\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-14\">In <em>Magill </em>we grouped the Supreme Court\u2019s state action cases into three general categories. 516 F.2d at 1331. <em>Magill </em>placed <em>Burton </em>in the second group \u2014 cases in which \u201cthe state \u2018significantly\u2019 involved itself with the private party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1331-32. Describing the test applicable to cases falling into the second group, <em>Magill </em>stated that \u201cthe polestar of our analysis must be whether the state involvement <em>in the challenged action </em>is \u2018significant.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 1332. <em>Magill </em>refers to the \u201cnexus\u201d test [Id.], but it never even mentions the \u201coverall relationship\u201d test. <em>Gibbs </em>and this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Jackson </em>treated the issue of state action similarly. The majority makes no attempt to reconcile its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>state action analysis with the language or the holdings in <em>Broderick, Magiil, Gibbs, </em>or this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Jackson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">In short, I believe that the recent state action cases decided by this Circuit, as well as those decided by the Supreme Court, all establish that in order for state action to be found \u201cthe record must demonstrate that the state has become significantly involved <em>with the discriminatory action alleged.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Broderick v. Associated Hospital Service of Philadelphia, supra, </em>at 4. In most cases, it will be impossible to conclude that state action is present under this standard unless there is proof which connects the state with the very activity challenged. However, it seems obvious to me that such proof would not be necessary in one limited situation, <em>viz., </em>where the state\u2019s involvement with a private entity is \u201cso dominant as to afford basis for a contention that the state is merely utilizing private trustees to administer a state activity.\u201d <em>Powe v. Miles, </em>407 F.2d 73, 81 (2d Cir. 1968). <em>See also Cohen v. Illinois Institute of Technology, </em>524 F.2d 818, 825 &amp; n.19 (7th Cir. 1975) (per Stevens, J.); <em>Wahba </em>v. <em>New York University, </em>492 F.2d 96, 101 (2d Cir. 1974); <em>Kerr v. Enoch Pratt Free Library of Baltimore, </em>149 F.2d 212 (4th Cir. 1945). In a situation of that nature, I believe that state involvement in the challenged activity could simply be assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">This Court recently considered a situation of this type in <em>Hollenbaugh v. Carnegie Free Library, supra, in </em>which a library received approximately 90 per cent of its financial support from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and its subdivisions and in which a large segment<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of the library\u2019s board of trustees was composed of government officials. In that case this Court reviewed a district court order which dismissed a complaint raising Fourteenth Amendment claims for failure to allege facts constituting state action. In reversing, this Court suggested that the extreme state involvement which was alleged in that case could without more constitute state action. It went on to say that \u201cit is impossible to distinguish the state\u2019s involvement in the allegedly discriminatory employment determination from the state\u2019s involvement in the general operation of the library.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385. <em>Hollenbaugh </em>is consistent with the analysis above. I read it to say that where a state has funded an institution to the extent of almost 100 per cent of its financial requirements, it is reasonable to assume that with such massive funding the state must be chargeable with all activities undertaken by the institution. However, short of the type of involvement alleged in <em>Hollenbaugh, </em>I believe that proof of state involvement in the very activity challenged is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-8\">In sum, I interpret the Supreme Court\u2019s and this Circuit\u2019s recent state action decisions to require either (a) state involvement with a private entity which is \u201cso dominant as to afford basis for a contention that the state is merely utilizing private trustees to administer a state activity\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and therefore has necessarily participated in the challenged activity, or (b) <em>proof </em>that* the state has affirmatively supported or is directly involved in the specific conduct challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-10\">I must also express my disagreement with the discussion contained in Parts II D and E of the opinion of the Court. Those sections, in my view, constitute a wholly inadequate analysis of the manner in which other federal courts have dealt with state action claims lodged against private universities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-11\">First, the Court\u2019s heavy reliance upon <em>Isaacs v. Board of Trustees of Temple University, </em>385 F.Supp. 473 (E.D.Pa.1974), appears to me to be misplaced. As the Court notes, <em>Isaacs </em>was decided prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jackson. </em>There is good reason to believe that the analysis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number><em>Isaacs </em>would have differed significantly had that case been decided after <em>Jackson. </em>The analysis in <em>Isaacs </em>rests on the premise that \u201c[t]he leading case in the entire \u2018state action\u2019 area is <em>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority. . . </em>385 F.Supp. at 487. In light of <em>Jackson, </em>the notion that <em>Burton </em>is the \u201cleading case in the entire \u2018state action\u2019 area\u201d is plainly untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">Second, the Court\u2019s treatment of <em>Powe </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>407 F.2d 73 (2d Cir. 1968), simply will not bear analysis. In <em>Powe </em>the Second Circuit held that the suspension of students enrolled in Alfred University\u2019s four private colleges was not state action but that the suspension of students enrolled at the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University, a state college affiliated with Alfred, was action under color of state law. The Court attempts to analogize the relationship between the Commonwealth and Pitt to the relationship between the State of New York and the New York State College of Ceramics. In doing so, the Court neglects to mention several significant facts. Most important, the Court fails to note that New York State paid <em>100 per cent </em>of the direct expenses of the New York State College of Ceramics.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 76. The Court also fails to note that the New York State College of Ceramics, which was founded as a state institution,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> remains a \u201cstate school\u201d under New York law,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> as distinguished from a \u201cstate-related institution\u201d such as Pitt.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">Although the Court relied upon <em>Powe </em>to support its state action analysis, that case may actually be quite damaging to the Court\u2019s position. In <em>Powe, </em>the Second Circuit held that the suspension of students enrolled in Alfred\u2019s private colleges was not state action despite the fact that during the year in question the State of New York paid 20.75 per cent of the total Alfred budget. 407 F.2d at 76. As one commentator has noted, <em>Powe </em>also concluded that the suspension of the Alfred students was not state action even though \u201cthe <em>state </em>paid about a third of the salary of the Dean of Students who imposed the suspension.\u201d (Emphasis in original). O\u2019Neil, Private Universities and Public Law, 19 Buffalo L.Rev. 155, 160 (1970). In addition, the state action test employed in <em>Powe </em>by Judge Friendly was a precursor of the \u201cnexus\u201d standard enunciated in <em>Moose Lodge </em>and <em>Jackson. </em>In Judge Friendly\u2019s words, under his test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-10\">The state must be involved not simply with some activity of the institution alleged to have inflicted injury upon a plaintiff but with the activity that caused the injury. Putting the point another way, the state action, not the private action, must be the subject of complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1an\">407 F.2d at 81. This \u2019 test, as Professor O\u2019Neil has noted, \u201cput aside [Alfred\u2019s] interdependence and close involvement with the state.\u201d O\u2019Neil, <em>supra, </em>at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-11\">Third, I agree with the Court that <em>Cohen v. Illinois Institute of Technology, </em>524 F.2d 818 (7th Cir. 1975) (per Stevens, J.), is highly relevant, but I believe that Judge (now Justice) Stevens\u2019s analysis of the appropriate state action standards is exactly the same as mine and consequently at odds with the view expressed by the majority of the Court. In <em>Cohen, </em>Judge Stevens employed a two-part state action test. As the Court acknowledges, one part of his formulation was the \u201cnexus\u201d test of <em>Jackson. </em>Maj.Op. at 965. The second part of the test, as the Court notes, is whether the ostensibly private institution is \u201cso heavily dependent on the State as to be considered the equivalent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>of a public university for all purposes and in all its activities.\u201d 524 F.2d at 825, <em>quoted </em>in Maj.Op. at 965. To explain what he meant by that statement, Judge Stevens cited Judge Friendly\u2019s observation in <em>Powe v. Miles, supra, </em>at 82, that state action could be found, even absent a \u201cnexus\u201d between the state and the specific conduct challenged, \u201cwhere the wholly state-supported activity is so dominant that the private activity could be deemed to have been swallowed up.\u201d 524 F.2d at 825 n.19, <em>quoting Powe v. Miles, </em>407 F.2d 73, 82 (2d Cir. 1968). <em>See Hollenbaugh v. Carnegie Free Library, supra. </em>This language was simply a restatement by Judge Friendly of the point he had made earlier that state action could be found where the state\u2019s involvement with the private entity was \u201cso dominant as to afford basis for a contention that the state is merely utilizing private trustees to administer a state activity.\u201d 407 F.2d at 81. As I noted earlier, in a case of that nature, I agree that proof of a nexus need not be shown. But that is quite different from saying, as the Court does, that a nexus need not be shown whenever there is simply a close overall relationship between the state and the private entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">Fourth and finally, I must disagree with the Court for failing to appreciate the relevance of our sister Circuit\u2019s recent state action cases involving private universities. It seems to me that, in addition to <em>Cohen v. Illinois Institute of Technology, supra, </em>the following cases are particularly pertinent: <em>Cannon v. University of Chicago, </em>Nos. 761238/9 (7th Cir., filed August 27,1976) at 5; <em>Berrios v. Inter American University, </em>535 F.2d 1330 (1st Cir. 1976); <em>Greenya v. George Washington University, </em>167 U.S.App.D.C. 379, 512 F.2d 556 (1975); <em>Spark v. Catholic University of America, </em>167 U.S.App.D.C. 56, 510 F.2d 1277 (1975). While I will not discuss these cases at length, their general perspective can perhaps best be summarized by the First Circuit\u2019s words in <em>Berrios: </em>\u201cwe approach with some caution any labelling that might incidentally contribute to the erosion of the autonomy and diversity of private colleges and universities.\u201d 535 F.2d at 1333.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">Although I disagree with the state action analysis contained in the opinion of the Court, I believe that affirmance of the order of the district court is required even under the correct state action \u201cnexus\u201d standard described in Part III <em>supra. </em>I reach this conclusion because I believe that genuine issues of material fact exist with respect to the state action requirements. In addition, as I stated above, I am convinced that summary judgment procedures are poorly suited for deciding state action questions when the <em>practical </em>rather than the <em>formal </em>relationship between the state and the private entity is at issue. When the practical working relationship is at issue, it seems obvious that, except in the most clear-cut instances, the issue of state action should not be decided until after the district court has made its required findings of fact. For example, the district court opinion summarizes some of the evidence which has already been introduced but as to which it has made no findings. That testimony in part is:</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">6. Concerning the views of the trustees respecting the import of the word \u201cinstrumentality\u201d in 24 P.S. \u00a7 2510-202(6), the following testimony is typical:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-8\">\u201cI do not regard the University as an agency of the State. I consider it purely autonomous. I don\u2019t believe the State has any role in any of the personnel practices of the University.\u201d (Harbaugh Miller, Esq., former Commonwealth Trustee. Tr. 205).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-9\">\u201cI do not view the University as an agency of the State, nor do I view the State as having any role in dealing with the management of the University. I view this as the prerogative of the Board of Trustees, and the Chancellor who is appointed by that Board of Trustees.\u201d (Alexandria W. Chauss, Alumni Trustee. Tr. 160).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-10\">\u201cI think we look on our relationship with the State as a contractor for services to the State for which the University is compensated and for which the Universi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>ty has some responsibility or has \u2014 let me correct that \u2014 has responsibility for accounting to the State for state funds, as would any contractor.\u201d (William H. Rea, Charter Trustee, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, member of the State Board of Education, Chairman of the State Council of Higher Education. Deposition 20).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-6\">\u201cWell, I have always considered that relationship both as Chancellor of the University and as the Secretary of Education, that the University is primarily a private institution, with a relationship to the State under which they agreed to meet certain requirements as far as giving Pennsylvania residents, for example, for admission, and having State representation on the Board of Trustees. . [T]he instrumentality is that, as I interpret it, it is a commitment that the University has made to perform certain services for the State.\u201d (Dr. David H. Kurtzman, former Pitt Chancellor and Commonwealth Secretary of Education. Tr. 46).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">Dr. Kurtzman further testified that the Commonwealth does not exercise any control over the hiring, promotion, tenure, or firing of either faculty members or other personnel. (Kurtzman, Tr. 48-49, 63-64). Similarly, Warren E. Ringler, Commonwealth Deputy Commissioner for Higher Education, testified that the Department of Education does not review individual Pitt faculty appointments. (Ringler, Deposition 77; Tr. 22).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">It is evident to me that on remand the district court will be hard pressed to find state involvement if limited to the testimony taken to date<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u2014 which of course it will not be. The testimony to date may be supplemented or possibly contradicted. But at least on this record with the showing heretofore made by the defendants, it would appear unlikely that the required state involvement can be found \u2014 thus revealing the wisdom of making no state action determination until the entire record is closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-13\">I must therefore agree that the district court did not err when, on this record and at this stage of the proceeding, it denied Pitt\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">. 10 C.

In <em>Braden I, </em>this Court was aware of Pa.Stat. Ann. Tit. 24, \u00a7 2510-202 (Supp.1976). Nevertheless, we remanded because we felt that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>views of the trustees respecting- this unusual provision, <em>i. </em>e., how they interpret it \u2014 might be of great value in resolving the difficult issue presented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. We believed, in other words, that the interpretation placed upon this provision by the persons who govern the University ought to be considered in ascertaining the statute\u2019s practical effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">. The opinion of the Court relies to some extent upon the fact that the Governor, the Mayor of Pittsburgh, and the Secretary of Education of the Commonwealth are <em>ex officio </em>members of Pitt\u2019s Board of Trustees. I am not sure that that reliance is justified even at this stage of the proceedings. The record shows that these officials very rarely attended trustees\u2019 meetings. Appendix at 314a, 445a-46a. More important, it is a very old and very common practice for private universities to make one or two high state officials <em>ex officio </em>trustees. As <em>Braden I </em>noted, the distinction between public and private educational institutions under American law dates from <em>Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, </em>17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 518, 4 L.Ed. 629 (1819). 477 F.2d at 6. <em>See generally </em>Friendly, The Dartmouth College Case and the Public Private Penumbra, 12 Texas L.Q. 9 (1969). It is therefore interesting to note that the original charter granted to Dartmouth College in 1769 by King George III named as trustees the colonial governor and several other New Hampshire officials. 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) at 523-24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1026-19\">. Of the 16 Commonwealth appointees who served between 1966 and 1976, six were corporate executives, one was general counsel to the United Steel Workers, four were privately employed professionals, one was a retired state judge, one was an active state judge, and three were members of the legislature, Supp.App. at 144a. This group is demographically quite similar to the group of trustees elected by the Board. For example, the 11 persons chosen as term trustees during the same period included four corporate executives, one lawyer in private practice, one doctor, the president of a private college, one judge, one Congressman, and one retired governor. <em>Id. </em>at 144aa-45aa.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1026-20\">. It would appear to me that on remand the district court should compare the statute which authorizes the Commonwealth to appoint one-third of the members of Pitt\u2019s Board of Trustees with several provisions in the By-Laws of Blue Cross of Greater Philadelphia which were called to our attention in <em>Broderick v. Associated Hospital Service of Philadelphia, </em>536 F.2d 1 (3d Cir. 1976). Under those by-laws, various Pennsylvania public officials are empowered to nominate seven of the 34 members of the Board of Directors of Blue Cross of Greater Philadelphia. By-Laws of Blue Cross of Great<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>er Philadelphia \u00a7 3.04(a). In addition, the bylaws require under the usual circumstances that at least two of the seven members of the organization\u2019s executive committee be nominated by public officials. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3.17(a). The executive committee is empowered to \u201cexercise all of the powers and authority of the Board of Directors\u201d with a few exceptions. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3.17(b). All of these provisions were called to the Court\u2019s attention in <em>Broderick. </em>Brief for Amicus Curiae American Civil Liberties Foundation of Pennsylvania in <em>Broderick v. Associated Hospital Service of Philadelphia </em>at exhibit A at 5. Nevertheless, tested against the requirements of <em>Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 95 S.Ct. 449, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974), we found them insufficient to show the presence of state action. <em>Broderick v.

In my view, the district court on remand should compare the Commonwealth\u2019s authority to audit Pitt with its extensive authority to audit Blue Cross [Pa.Stat.Ann., tit. 40, \u00a7 6125(b) (Supp.1976)] and public utilities such as the Metropolitan Edison Company [Pa.Stat.

It would appear to me that on remand the district court will have to compare these requirements with the detailed reporting requirements which Pennsylvania law imposes upon Blue Cross.

Without these two salutary principles, federal courts would soon be drawn into a morass. First, courts would inevitably be required to determine precisely how much state aid is permitted before state action can be found. The District of Columbia Circuit has already held that governmental aid totalling approximately 25 per cent of a private university\u2019s budget is not by itself enough to implicate the government in the actions of the institution. <em>Spark v. Catholic Univ. of America, </em>167 U.S.App.D.C. 56, 510 F.2d 1277 (1975). If Pennsylvania\u2019s annual aid to Pitt \u2014 approximately 35 per cent of the University\u2019s operating budget \u2014 is viewed as strong evidence of state action, that holding together with <em>Spark </em>would establish the maximum amount of aid permitted at somewhere between 25 and 35 per cent. It would not be long before courts would be required to determine the precise percentage where the critical line would be drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">Second, if the percentage of an institution\u2019s budget contributed by the government were to be accorded that significance, courts would soon be required to scrutinize the institution\u2019s financial affairs in order to ascertain the relevant figures for each relevant category. Courts would be required to decide whether to focus upon an institution\u2019s operating budget, its capital grants, or its \u201chard core\u201d budget, <em>see Rackin v. Univ. of Pa., </em>386 F.Supp. 992, 996-97 (E.D.Pa.1974), and whether to include state aid given directly to students or their parents as part of their calculations. <em>Cf. Comm. for Public Education v. Nyquist, </em>413 U.S. 756, 93 S.Ct. 2955, 37 L.Ed.2d 948 (1973) (granting tuition reimbursements and tax benefits to parents of students attending church-related schools implicates the state in the religious activities of those schools). For a description of state aid to college students and the benefits such aid provides for private colleges, <em>see </em>Carnegie Commission on Higher Education, Higher Education: who pays? who benefits? who should pay? 183-85 (1973); O\u2019Neil, Private Universities and Public Law, 19 Buffalo L.Rev. 155, 174-75 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-13\">Finally, while this case concerns <em>state </em>aid, significant reliance upon that assistance at the final judgment stage would raise serious questions with respect to the <em>federal </em>government\u2019s massive payments to major private universities. For a number of years, those payments have averaged more than 40 per cent of the annual budgets of the recipient institutions. W. Bowen, The Economics of the Major Private Universities 35 (1968). <em>See also Grossner v. Trustees of Columbia Univ., supra </em>at 547 n.17 (federal aid totalled approximately 42 per cent of budget for fiscal year 1967). Federal assistance, of course, is not evidence of action \u201cunder color of\u2019 state law and would not be relevant in an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. But sufficient federal involvement in private activity which violates constitutional rights forms the basis for a claim against the private entity for equitable relief and possibly for money damages. <em>Greenya v. George Washington Univ., </em>167 U.S.App.D.C. 379, 512 F.2d 556, 562-63 n.13 (1975); <em>Spark v.

In upholding the district court\u2019s dismissal of Pitt\u2019s motion, the majority relies almost exclusively on Pennsylvania\u2019s legislative enactments, ignoring almost wholly the testimony and evidence introduced at the hearing which we ordered in <em>Braden I. </em>As I have observed, however, these statutes had been enacted and were in force long before <em>Braden I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-11\">I believe as the panel in <em>Braden I </em>obviously believed, that a good deal more than mere reference to the Commonwealth\u2019s statutes will be required to determine the existence of the necessary \u201cnexus\u201d and other mandated factors for a finding of state action. Doubtlessly the <em>Braden I </em>panel had in mind the determination of this issue on a final record with evidence and testimony fleshing out the legislative intent, and with findings of fact made by the district court. (It could not have believed otherwise for, as we have noted, the statutes in issue were the same both before and since <em>Braden I). </em>This circumstance, if no other, bolsters my views which are expressed here that the state action issue posed by this case should not be made on less than a complete record \u2014 and certainly not on a naked reading of inconclusive statutory enactments with no factual context on which findings of the court can be predicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
