The bankruptcy judge entered an order in favor of the trustee and denying BVA\u2019s petition. That ruling was affirmed by the district court, and its order is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-10\">The question before us is whether a party can have an enforceable security interest in equipment covered by a lease agreement (intended as security) in which the description, otherwise sufficient, of the equipment includes an incorrect serial number. We hold that a mere error in the serial number does not affect the enforceability of the creditor\u2019s security interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-14\">In 1974, BVA\u2019s predecessor, Cavanagh Leasing Corporation, entered into an equipment lease (with option to purchase) with Elcee Printing Company, Inc., Vintage Press\u2019 apparent predecessor. The bankruptcy court correctly found that the lease was intended for security and therefore is subject to Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The equipment, a Miller offset press, was described in the equipment lease between Cavanagh and Elcee as follows: Miller TP, 1968, 4C Perfector Offset Press, model number TP 38, serial number 15489. After the lease was assigned by Elcee Printing to Vintage Press, a new financing statement, showing Vintage Press as the debtor, was filed in Superior Court Records, DeKalb County, Georgia, which described the property as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzN\">1 Ea. Miller TP 38, 1968, 4C Perfector Offset Press</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1204-15\">THIS EQUIPMENT IS THE SUBJECT OF A LEASE AND FILING IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1204-16\">The financing statement did not include a serial number of the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-17\">The printing press which was delivered to Elcee\u2019s facility actually bore the serial number 15885, rather than 15489. Thus, two of the five digits in the serial number given in the security agreement were incorrect. Responsibility for the error belonged to the printing press\u2019 manufacturer. The equipment which bore serial number 15489 was, in fact, a two-color press located in Oklahoma, while the machine purchased by Elcee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>located in Georgia, was a four-color press, serial number 15885. BVA picked up the latter press on March 12, 1975, nine days before Vintage Press filed for bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">Section 9-203 of the U.C.C. provides in pertinent part that a security interest is not enforceable against the debtor or third parties unless the debtor has signed a security agreement which contains a description of the collateral. Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 109A-9-203 (1973). In the instant case, the equipment lease serves as a security agreement. As for the sufficiency of the description, \u201cany description ... is sufficient whether or not it is specific if it reasonably identifies what is described.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 109A \u2014 9\u2014110.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">The bankruptcy judge found that an accurate description of the equipment herein in contention required the stating of the correct serial number because similar presses were in existence and serial numbers were necessary to distinguish one press from another. He therefore held the statement on the agreement of an incorrect serial number to be fatally defective. That conclusion was unfounded and incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-7\">The bankruptcy judge appeared to base his conclusion in part on a letter, admitted into evidence, from the equipment manufacturer, Miller Printing Machinery Company, to BVA. The letter explained that Miller\u2019s credit department was responsible for the discrepancy in serial numbers. It was this letter which stated that serial number 15489 was carried by a two-color Miller press in Oklahoma, unlike Vintage\u2019s four-color press, located in Georgia and bearing serial number 15885. We need not quote the letter, for it plainly lends no support to the conclusion that the serial numbers were necessary to distinguish the presses. Obviously, the two presses could be told apart as two different models in two different locations. One could make that determination without reference to their serial numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-8\">Moreover, we are unable to agree with the reasoning of the district judge herein in stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-9\">The Court does not necessarily agree with the bankruptcy judge\u2019s determination that a correct serial number is an essential element of an adequate description of the Miller Press. Arguably, if the serial number was completely omitted from the security agreement the description might be deemed sufficient. However, if a serial number is included in the description, then that serial number becomes the most uniquely descriptive ingredient of that description, and an erroneous description is fatal. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1205-12\">This holding ignores the Code\u2019s rul\u00e9 of reasonable identification. The problem, we think, is that the court misdirected its attention. The district judge focused on, <em>inter alia, </em>the similarity of pieces of equipment produced by the manufacturer. However, this case centers on the equipment located not at the manufacturer\u2019s facility, but at the lessee/bankrupt\u2019s place of business. The district judge also considered the question of notice to a bona fide purchaser. However, this is a case involving the priority between a secured creditor and a trustee in bankruptcy. In other words, the district judge missed the basic issue in the case, <em>viz., </em>the sufficiency of the description of the collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-13\">The Code\u2019s draftsmen explicitly rejected the approach taken by the district court. The Official Comment to section 9-110, contained in the uniform version of the U.C.C., states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1205-14\">Under this rule courts should refuse to follow the holdings, often found in the older chattel mortgage cases, that descriptions are insufficient unless they are of the most exact and detailed nature, the so-called \u201cserial number\u201d test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1205-15\">U.C.C. \u00a7 9-110, Official Comment (West U.L.A.1968). This commentary is in accord with Georgia decisional law. <em>See Yancey Bros. Co. v. Dehco, Inc., </em>1964, 108 Ga.App. 875, 877 &amp; n. 1, 134 S.E.2d 828, 830 &amp; n. 1. \u201cMerely stating an incorrect serial number will not vitiate the contract if the key [to the identity of the property] is there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 877, 134 S.E.2d at 830. The equipment lease and financing statement provided such a key in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-16\">Accordingly, we reverse the order of the district court, which affirmed the bankrupt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>cy judge\u2019s order that BVA pay the trustee $75,000, which sum constituted the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and which BVA was then holding by stipulation of the parties, and we direct such additional relief as may be necessary to effectuate our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1204-11\">. Under the lease, the lessee had an option to purchase the property at the end of the lease period for 10% of the original cost of the equipment. The original cost of the equipment (that is, the cost of the basic press) was $100,000. However, total payments under the lease were to amount to over $202,000. Thus, the option could be exercised for $10,000 \u2014 less than 5% of the gross payout. The bankruptcy judge held that this amount was nominal in comparison to the total lease price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-12\">This finding of a nominal option price triggered the application of Article 9, for section 1-201(37) of the Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1204-18\">Unless a lease ... is intended as security, reservation of title thereunder is not a \u201csecurity interest\u201d . . . . Whether a lease is intended as security is to be determined by the facts of each case; however, (a) the inclusion of an option to purchase does not of itself make the lease one intended for security, and (b) an agreement that upon compliance with the terms of the lease, the lessee shall become or has the option to become the owner of the property for no additional consideration or for a nominal consideration does make the lease one intended for security.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1204-20\">Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 109A-1-201(37) (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
