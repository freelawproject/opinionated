At Uptain\u2019s trial for jumping bail, two court-appointed attorneys acted as counsel, and he also questioned some of the witnesses. The jury returned a verdict of guilty as charged. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-12\">Uptain now brings forward four points, none of which have any merit. He objects to the trial judge\u2019s ruling permitting his attorney to testify as to notice of the trial date given to him; to the attorney\u2019s testimony concerning FBI Agent Cox who was not called as a witness; to the failure of the trial judge to enter a judgment of acquittal; and to the judge\u2019s action in admitting an out-of-court statement Uptain allegedly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-13\">Counsel\u2019s message to his client concerning the date of trial was not a privileged communication. <em>See, e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Bourassa, </em>411 F.2d 69 (10 Cir. 1969), cert. <em>denied, </em>396 U.S. 915, 90 S.Ct. 235, 24 L.Ed.2d 192 (1969); <em>United States v. Hall, </em>346 F.2d 875 (2 Cir. 1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 910, 86 S.Ct. 250, 15 L.Ed.2d 161 (1965). The attorney\u2019s testimony concerning his comments to Agent Cox only uncovered what was already known; <em>i. e., </em>that he had written two letters to Uptain informing him of the date and time of trial. The judge certainly made no error by not granting a judgment of acquittal. Uptain\u2019s guilt was clearly proven. Finally, Uptain\u2019s statement was a volunteered, unsolicited statement that he blurted out during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-14\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
