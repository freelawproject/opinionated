Taccino appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Defendant in this civil action alleging breach of the duty of fair representation. For the reasons set forth below, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-23\">A review of the record discloses that Defendant moved for summary judgment, and that Defendant submitted affidavits and other materials in support of its motion. Citing, <em>inter alia, </em>Taccino\u2019s failure to present evidence, the district court granted Defendant\u2019s motion. The district court did not provide Taccino with the notice required by <em>Roseboro v. Garrison, </em>528 F.2d 309, 310 (4th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-24\"><em>Roseboro </em>prohibits the entry of summary judgment based on a pro se party\u2019s failure to submit affidavits supporting his allegations unless such party is given a reasonable opportunity to file counter-affidavits or other appropriate materials and is informed that failure to file such a response may result in dismissal of the action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-25\">Although Taccino responded to Defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion, he did not submit any affidavits in support of his claims. The district court granted Defendant\u2019s motion, in part, based on Taccino\u2019s failure to produce such supporting evidence. On this record, we cannot find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>the district court\u2019s failure to provide <em>Roseboro </em>notice was harmless error. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 61; Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Defendant and remand this case to the district court with instructions to provide Taccino with the notice and opportunity to respond to which he is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process. The reason for remand is entirely procedural and is unrelated to the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
