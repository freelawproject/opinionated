The \u00a7 2241 petition, filed by Redina Perez, Billuk\u2019s fianc\u00e9 seeking to act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>as his \u201cnext friend,\u201d seeks to enjoin the Department of Homeland Security from deporting Billuk to his native country of Guam. The district court dismissed the action stating that Perez lacked standing, and that she failed to establish her status as Billuk\u2019s \u201cnext Mend\u201d because she offered no explanation as to why Billuk was unable to file on his own behalf. Billuk now appeals. However, because Billuk was not a party to or an intervenor in the proceeding filed by Perez, he lacks standing to challenge the decision on appeal. <em>Davis v. Scott, </em>176 F.3d 805, 807 (4th Cir.1999) (holding that a prisoner lacked standing to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of a habeas petition filed by his wife, acting \u201con behalf of\u2019 her husband). Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
