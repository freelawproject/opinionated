Quimby filed a petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>for a writ of mandamus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 and a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Fed.R.CivP. 60(b) challenging the legality of the sentence she received. The district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction over her pleadings and dismissed them on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Quimby argues on appeal that the All Writs Act found at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 authorized the district court to grant her a writ of mandamus requiring that her guideline sentencing range be recalculated. However, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a) does not provide an independent grant of jurisdiction. <em>Texas v. Real Parties In Interest, </em>259 F.3d 387, 392 (5th Cir.2001). Because the relief sought by Quimby would not be in aid of the jurisdiction of a federal court, the district court correctly dismissed the petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a); <em>see Texas v. Real Parties In Interest, </em>259 F.3d at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Quimby\u2019s argument against the district court\u2019s dismissal of her Rule 60(b) motion is conclusional at best. It does not acknowledge the district court\u2019s construction of her motion as an unauthorized successive motion filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Accordingly, Quimby has abandoned her challenge to the district court\u2019s dismissal of her motion. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Finally, Fed. R.App. P. 21 is inapplicable to the instant appeal. That rule does not confer jurisdiction upon this court to grant the relief sought by Quimby in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
