We have reviewed the record and the immigration judge\u2019s order and find that the immigration judge did not abuse her discretion in denying Ijomah\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). We find that Ijomah\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely filed, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 3.23(b)(1) (2001), and that Ijomah failed to qualify for any of the exceptions to the timeliness requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Additionally, to the extent that Ijomah claims that the Board\u2019s use of the summary affirmance procedure as set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2004) violated her rights under the Due Process Clause, we find that this claim is squarely foreclosed by our decision in <em>Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272 (4th Cir.2004). We further find that summary affirmance was appropriate in this case under the factors set forth in \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We also deny Ijomah\u2019s motion for summary reversal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
