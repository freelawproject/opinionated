The motion was denied on June 12, 2003, rendering Stone\u2019s petition moot. Thus, Stone requests that his petition be construed as a notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s June 12 order. However, even if we construed the petition as Stone requests, the notice of appeal would be untimely. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1). Moreover, although Stone contends that he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>receive timely notice of the denial of his motion, we are without jurisdiction to extend the time to appeal. <em>See United States v. Little, </em>392 F.3d 671, 2004 WL 2955027, *7 (4th Cir. Dec.22, 2004). Accordingly, we grant Stone\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, deny Stone\u2019s petition for writ of mandamus, and deny his request to construe the petition as a notice of appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
