Though she does not dispute the Board\u2019s finding that her motion to reopen was untimely filed, Smith contends that the Board abused its discretion in failing to employ its sua sponte authority to grant the motion to reopen. We find that we lack jurisdiction to review this claim. <em>See Calle-Vujiles v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 472, 474-75 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Luis v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 36, 40-41 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Smith also contends that the Board violated her right to due process when it granted her voluntary departure pursuant to its order of January 11, 2001, but failed to advise her of the consequences of failure to depart. In addition, she asserts that the Board exceeded its authority in granting her voluntary departure pursuant to the same order. As the January 11, 2001 order is not before us in this appeal, we lack jurisdiction over these claims as well. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">We accordingly dismiss the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
