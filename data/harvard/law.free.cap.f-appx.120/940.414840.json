Johnson, Acting Director of the Virginia Department of Corrections (the state),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals the district court\u2019s condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>tional grant of Carnell Draughn\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition for writ of habeas corpus. The district court ruled that Draughn\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel because, during a motion to withdraw from the case, he revealed confidential client communications. Specifically, Draughn\u2019s counsel informed the trial court that Draughn wanted to move for the trial judge\u2019s recusal on the ground that the judge was biased against African-Americans. In the opinion of the district court, counsel\u2019s behavior failed the standard set by <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and the state habeas court was objectively unreasonable in concluding otherwise. Because, even assuming Draughn\u2019s counsel was constitutionally deficient, Draughn cannot show that his counsel\u2019s actions resulted in actual prejudice, we reverse the conditional grant of Draughn\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">At approximately 8:40 p.m. on the evening of March 31, 1997, an African-American male entered a Blockbuster Music store in Newport News, VA. The individual approached the front register, placed his hand on the counter, and told the employee working at the register, William Workinger, that he had \u201c30 mother-f* * *king seconds to clear that register before I pop a cap in your ass.\u201d (J.A. at 39.) After Workinger removed the cash from the front register and then opened the next register for the individual only to find that it was empty, the individual ordered Workinger to take him to the room where the night deposit was kept. Workinger and the individual went to the back of the store and knocked on the door where Heather Shaffer, another employee, was putting together the night deposit. Workinger told Shaffer to open the door because there was a problem. Shaffer did so, and the individual stood in the doorway and told Shaffer that she had \u201c20 mother-f* * *king\u201d or \u201c15 mother-f* * *king seconds to put the money in the bag.\u201d (J.A. at 45, 68.) Shaffer complied, turning over somewhere between $1500.00 and $2000.00 to the individual. The individual then had Workinger follow him to the door. Once outside, the individual ran towards a Firestone Tire establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">Workinger testified that the individual was approximately his height, around 5'7\" to 5'9\", and that the individual had a mustache but no other facial hair. Shaffer testified that the robber was also about 5'7\", the same height as Workinger.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Workinger initially told police that the robber was wearing a black baseball cap, but he testified at trial that the individual was wearing a black stocking cap. Workinger blamed the discrepancy on the fact that he first thought the robber was simply wearing a baseball cap with the bill turned backwards. In contrast, Shaffer testified that the individual wore a baseball cap with the bill in front. Both Workinger and Shaffer testified that the individual wore a dark, bulky jacket, and that the robber did not produce a gun but kept his right hand in his jacket pocket, where there was a noticeable bulge.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">After the robbery, Workinger immediately called the police, who responded within five minutes. Later that evening, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>at approximately 1:00 a.m., the police showed Workinger a page from a high school yearbook and asked Workinger if he could identify the individual who robbed the Blockbuster. Workinger, after four or five minutes, picked out Carnell Draughn as the robber. Several days later, the police showed Shaffer a spread of approximately ten photos and she also picked Carnell Draughn as the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">On the basis of these eyewitness identifications, the Commonwealth of Virginia indicted Draughn on June 9, 1997, for two counts of robbery and two counts of use of a firearm during the commission of a felony. A one-day bench trial was conducted on January 28, 1998 in the Circuit Court for the City of Newport News (trial court). Draughn took the stand in his own defense, maintaining his innocence. He testified that he and a friend went to the Blockbuster Music at 8 p.m., he had left the store shortly thereafter, and he was on the telephone with two female acquaintances at the time the robbery took place. Draughn also testified that, while driving his friend home between 10:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., he passed the Blockbuster Music but did not notice any police vehicles there. Draughn had earlier told police, however, that he passed the Blockbuster Music after the robbery and saw the police cars in front of the store. The trial court found Draughn guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">On April 21, 1998, following Draughn\u2019s conviction but prior to his sentencing, Draughn moved for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. In support of this motion, Draughn argued that Workinger testified falsely at trial when he stated that he had never seen Draughn before that evening. Draughn presented evidence that he and Workinger had attended the same high school and that Draughn was a well-known basketball star at the school. The trial court heard arguments on the motion on April 21,1998, and at one point stated, \u201cif that\u2019s the only thing you base it on, I\u2019m prepared to go forward with sentencing.\u201d (J.A. at 162.) Draughn\u2019s counsel, Larry King, continued pressing the matter, however, and the trial court then stated, \u201cI\u2019ll give you an opportunity to get him in here to testify whether or not he knew him or not ... but I think the testimony would reveal he just simply said he had not seen him previously.\u201d (J.A. at 163-64.) The case was continued to June 10, 1998, for further consideration of Draughn\u2019s motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">In the interim, however, Draughn requested that King withdraw as his counsel. On May 21, the trial court held a hearing on King\u2019s motion to withdraw. During that hearing, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-9\">The Court: Give this Court, whoever wants to testify, give me a reason why you should withdraw or why I should allow you to withdraw, then I\u2019ll do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-10\">Mr. King: I think some of the reasons would be prejudicial to Mr. Draughn if I tell the Court some of the reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-11\">The Court: Well, I have a decision right on my desk that came in yesterday that says allowing withdrawal is within the discretion of the Court and unless you give me a reason to allow you to withdraw, I\u2019m not going to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-12\">Mr. King: First of all, they want a guarantee I can win the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-13\">The Court: Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-14\">Mr. King: Secondly, they question the Court\u2019s prejudicial attitude towards black defendants. They want me to press that matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b977-15\">(J.A. at 172.)</p>\n<p id=\"b977-16\">The trial court denied the motion to withdraw but permitted Draughn to have substitute counsel appear on record at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>motion for new trial and sentencing. (J.A. at 175.) During that hearing, the trial court also reversed its earlier ruling that Draughn could question Workinger during the hearing on the motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, the trial court said, \u201cI am not going to extend this case now for additional evidence.... This is not new, something new that he couldn\u2019t have produced at the time of trial.\u201d (J.A. at 174.)</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">At the hearing on the motion for a new trial, the trial court did not permit Draughn to question Workinger. The court explained, \u201cI made it plain to Mr. King when he came before me that I would not hear any further evidence in this case.\u201d (J.A. at 181.) \u201cI told you you could put it on the record for whatever good, but I was not going to hear the evidence.\u201d (J.A. at 181.) \u201cI am not reopening this case for a new trial. There is no new evidence that\u2019s been presented to the Court.\u201d The trial court did permit Draughn\u2019s new counsel to proffer, for the record, that Workinger was one year ahead of Draughn in high school, and that Draughn was well known in high school because he was a standout basketball player.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Counsel also proffered that a different Blockbuster Music was robbed the day before the one in question by an individual also wearing a black jacket and black baseball cap; although Draughn\u2019s photograph was shown to eyewitnesses to that crime, the did not identity Draughn as the perpetrator. The trial court denied the motion for a new trial and later sentenced Draughn to a total of ten years imprisonment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">Draughn appealed the denial of the motion for new trial, but the Court of Appeals of Virginia affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling, finding that the evidence Draughn proffered during that motion failed to meet the standard for granting a motion for a new trial. The Supreme Court of Virginia declined to hear Draughn\u2019s direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">On July 25, 2000, Draughn filed a petition under Virginia law for habeas corpus in the state habeas court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Draughn contended that Bong provided ineffective assistance of counsel by (1) failing to advise him of his right to a jury trial; and (2) mishandling the motion for withdrawal by violating Draughn\u2019s attorney-client privilege. The state filed a motion to dismiss the petition, arguing that Draughn could not meet either prong of the <em>Strickland v. </em>Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) test. Included with the motion to dismiss was an affidavit from King. King stated that, following the trial \u201cMr. Draughn and his father began expressing views regarding a corrupt and biased judge, police department, witnesses, and criminal justice system.\u201d (J.A. at 280.) According to King, Draughn and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>father \u201cwanted me to ask [the trial judge] to remove himself from the case because of the trial judge\u2019s alleged prejudicial beliefs against African-American defendants.\u201d (J.A. at 281.) After King refused to make such a motion, \u201cMr. Draughn, and his father, told me to withdraw from the case. I explained to Mr. Draughn that, at that stage, the court would require good reason for me to withdraw. Mr. Draughn told me to do what was necessary to withdraw from his case, and that he would find another lawyer to do things his way.\u201d (J.A. at 281.)</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">The state habeas court heard arguments on Draughn\u2019s habeas corpus petition on September 27, 2001. Following oral argument, that court dismissed Draughn\u2019s petition \u201cfor the reasons stated in the motion to dismiss.\u201d (J.A. at 306.) On July 18, 2002, the Supreme Court of Virginia summarily declined to hear Draughn\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Following the exhaustion of his state court remedies, on August 14, 2002, Draughn filed a 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254 petition in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, reasserting his ineffective assistance of counsel claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Draughn\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was referred to a magistrate judge, who, on June 10, 2003, issued a report and recommendation concluding that Draughn\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition should be granted as to the claim that King was constitutionally deficient in handling the motion to withdraw from the case because the disclosure of Draughn\u2019s confidential conversations \u201cfell below the range of competence that the United States Constitution demands.\u201d (J.A. at 401.) The magistrate judge found that Draughn suffered actual prejudice because, following the denial of the motion to withdraw, the trial court reversed its earlier ruling and refused to permit Draughn to question Workinger as part of his motion for a new trial. The magistrate judge\u2019s report concluded that \u201c[t]he findings and statements by the state court judge gave the appearance of anger and support Draughn\u2019s contention that the state court judge became hostile and did not properly consider his post trial motion.\u201d (J.A. at 404.) Accordingly, in the magistrate judge\u2019s view, Draughn established that \u201cthe outcome of his motion for a new trial and sentencing <em>may </em>have been different.\u201d (J.A. at 404) (emphasis added). To remedy the ineffective assistance of counsel, the magistrate judge recommended a conditional grant of habeas corpus requiring Virginia to appoint a new state trial judge to hear Draughn\u2019s motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">The state filed objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, and on August 5, 2003, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation conditionally granting Draughn\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. The state filed a notice of appeal on September 3, 2003, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to grant a habeas petition based on a state court record, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Whittlesey v. Conroy, </em>301 F.3d 213, 216 (4th Cir.2002). Pursuant to the Anti Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the scope of our review, and that of the district court, is highly constrained. Under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), we may grant a petition for habeas corpus, with respect to any claim adjudicated on the merits in state court, if the state court decision was contrary to clearly established federal law or the decision was an unreasonable application of federal law as determined by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">A decision of a state court is contrary to clearly established federal law if \u201cthe state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A state court adjudication is an unreasonable application of federal law when \u201cthe state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme Court\u2019s] decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The state court\u2019s application of clearly established federal law must be \u201cobjectively unreasonable,\u201d and \u201ca federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Although the state habeas court did not offer an independent rationale in denying Draughn\u2019s habeas corpus petition, that court\u2019s ruling is still \u201can \u2018adjudication\u2019 of the merits of the claim and must be reviewed under the deferential provisions of 2254(d)(1).\u201d <em>Bell v. Jarvis, </em>236 F.3d 149, 158 (4th Cir.2000) (en banc). \u201cIn such cases, we conduct an independent examination of the record and the clearly established Supreme Court law, but we must still conf\u00edne our review to whether the court\u2019s determination resulted in a decision that ... involved an unreasonable application of[ ] clearly established Federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">Draughn\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition alleged that his counsel provided ineffective assistance, in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights. Under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), a criminal defendant must make two showings to prove that his counsel\u2019s deficient performance deprived the defendant of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-10\">First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-12\">We do not address whether Draughn\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance was deficient because we hold that, even assuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>King\u2019s representation was constitutionally deficient, Draughn cannot prove that counsel\u2019s errors resulted in actual prejudice.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">The <em>Strickland </em>Court explained that \u201c[i]t is not enough for the defendant to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding. Virtually every act or omission of counsel would meet that test.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Instead, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In making that determination, courts must \u201cpresume ... that the judge or jury-acted according to law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, to prevail under this prong of <em>Strickland, </em>Draughn must show at least that, but for King\u2019s disclosure, there was a reasonable probability that the trial court would have granted the motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And, in order to grant Draughn\u2019s habeas petition, we must find that the state habeas court was objectively unreasonable in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">Applying this deferential standard of review, we conclude that the state habeas court was not objectively unreasonable in finding that Draughn did not suffer any prejudice, because the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion for a new trial was correct as a matter of Virginia law.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">Under Virginia law, motions for new trial based upon newly discovered evidence are \u201cnot looked upon with favor\u201d and are \u201cawarded with great reluctance.\u201d <em>Odum v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 123, 301 S.E.2d 145, 149 (1983). The defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-10\">bears the burden to establish that the evidence (1) appears to have been discovered subsequent to the trial; (2) could not have been secured for use at the trial in the exercise of reasonable diligence by the movant; (3) is not merely cumulative, corroborative or collateral; and (4) is material, and such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>should produce opposite results on the merits at another trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">Draughn cannot show a reasonable likelihood that the trial judge would have granted the motion for a new trial but for King\u2019s performance because Draughn\u2019s evidence fails to meet the standard announced above. The evidence Draughn wished to press as newly discovered, that Workinger and Draughn attended the same high school and that another Blockbuster was robbed the night before, fails at least the second, and arguably the fourth, requirement under <em>Odum. </em>That was the conclusion drawn by the Court of Appeals of Virginia on Draughn\u2019s direct appeal. Evidence that Workinger and Draughn attended the same large high school could have been discovered prior to trial with reasonable diligence, especially given that Draughn\u2019s high school record and athletic prowess were mentioned several times during the trial. Moreover, it is not clear that the evidence was of the type that should change the result at trial. At most, the fact that the two attended the same high school permits the impeachment of Workinger\u2019s statement that he had never seen Draughn before. It does not mean that Workinger did not see Draughn that evening in the store. Such evidence also does not cast doubt on Shaffer\u2019s positive identification of Draughn. Likewise, evidence that another Blockbuster was robbed the night before by an individual wearing a black jacket and baseball cap also could have been discovered by diligence before trial and, again, does not tend to disprove that Draughn robbed the Blockbuster in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">Thus, even assuming King was deficient in handling the motion to withdraw, Draughn cannot show that he was prejudiced by the deficiency because the trial judge\u2019s ruling on the motion for new trial was <em>correct </em>There is no reasonable probability that, but for King\u2019s errors, the result of the motion for new trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">The district court concluded that the trial judge\u2019s anger with Draughn after the motion to withdraw was denied met the <em>Strickland </em>prejudice inquiry. The district court\u2019s approach presupposes the inability of trial judges to separate personal feelings from their judicial duties. We will not lightly assume that a trial judge, faced with an allegation of racial bias, will shirk his duties to apply the law to the case before him. As the record here indicates, the trial judge performed his duties properly in refusing to grant Draughn\u2019s motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-12\">The decision of the district court, conditionally granting Draughn\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-13\">\n<em>REVERSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b975-15\">. At the time Draughn filed his habeas corpus petition in the Virginia courts, Ronald Ange<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>lone was the named respondent. (J.A. at 260.) Gene Johnson was substituted as the named party when Draughn filed his \u00a7 2254 petition in the district court. (J.A. at 347.) To remain consistent, the opinion refers to \"the state\u201d as the party in interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b976-10\">. Draughn is approximately six feet tall and testified that he had a full beard as of March 31, 1997. (J.A. at 115.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b978-5\">. At the beginning of the hearing on the motion for a new trial, the trial court ruled that the motion would be limited to the question of whether another individual had, in fact, confessed to the crime. Counsel for both parties then reminded the trial court that the individual who \"confessed\u201d was in jail at the time of the robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b978-6\">. The high school Draughn and Workinger attended had approximately 2,000 students.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b978-7\">. Draughn\u2019s sentence was imposed as follows: 3 years imprisonment for the first use of firearm during the commission of a felony conviction; 5 years for the second firearm conviction; and 15 years each, suspended to one year, for the two robbery counts. The sentences ran concurrently, resulting in a total of ten years imprisonment. The trial court also ordered Draughn to pay $3,600.00 in restitution to Blockbuster.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b978-13\">. Draughn\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus in Virginia was heard by the trial court. For ease of nomenclature, we will refer to the trial court as the \"state habeas court\u201d when referencing its analysis of Draughn\u2019s habeas corpus petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b979-7\">. Draughn raised a total of three ineffective assistance of counsel claims. The magistrate judge recommended denying the \u00a7 2254 petition as to the first two claims, and the district court adopted that recommendation. In addition, the district court then declined to grant Draughn a certificate of appealability (COA) as to those claims. Draughn failed to request a COA in this court as to those two claims, so the denial of relief on those claims is not before us. <em>See Manokey v. Waters, </em>390 F.3d 767 (4th Cir.2004) (holding that a habeas petitioner must obtain a COA before an appellate court can review alternate theories supporting a grant of habeas relief.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b979-12\">. Because the state, and not the habeas petitioner, is appealing the ruling of the district court, we do not require a certificate of appealability. See Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(3) (\"A certificate of appealability is not required when a state or its representative or the United States or its representative appeals.\")</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b980-6\">. Draughn does not suggest that the state habeas court's decision was contrary to clearly established federal law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b981-6\">. <em>Strickland </em>permits reviewing courts to address the prejudice prong of the inquiry first in appropriate cases. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (\"[i]f it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice ... that course should be followed.\u201d) We briefly note, however, that it is <em>not </em>at all clear that the state habeas court was objectively unreasonable in concluding that Draughn\u2019s counsel was not constitutionally deficient. First, Draughn's principal argument is that King\u2019s performance was deficient because he violated Virginia's Professional Code of Responsibility by revealing a confidential communication. <em>See </em>Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia, Pt. 6 \u00a7 II Canon 4 (1997). The Supreme Court has cautioned \u201cbreach of an ethical standard does not necessarily make out a denial of the Sixth Amendment guarantee.\u201d <em>Nix v. Whiteside, </em>475 U.S. 157, 165, 106 S.Ct. 988, 89 L.Ed.2d 123 (1986). \u201c[A] court must be careful not to narrow the wide range of conduct acceptable under the Sixth Amendment so restrictively as to constitutionalize particular standards of professional conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the alleged confidence, that Draughn believes the trial judge was biased, was communicated to King with the intent that it would be disclosed in open court as a motion requesting the trial judge\u2019s recusal. Thus, it is far from clear that King revealed a confidential communication to the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b981-12\">. The state argues that Draughn was not prejudiced because Draughn cannot show either a reasonable probability that the motion for a new trial would have been granted or that Draughn would have prevailed at a new trial. We need not decide which is the proper \u201cproceeding\u201d with the meaning of <em>Strickland </em>because Draughn cannot show a reasonable probability that the motion for a new trial would have been granted but for King\u2019s performance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b982-8\">. We further note that the trial court sentenced Draughn to a total of two years imprisonment out of a possible thirty years on the robbeiy counts \u2014 hardly the picture of a vindictive judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
