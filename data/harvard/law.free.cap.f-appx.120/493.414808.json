Ware seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment for defendants in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) action. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-23\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-24\">The district court\u2019s judgment was entered on the docket on March 1, 2004. The notice of appeal was filed on Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>ber 7, 2004.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Ware failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b528-17\"> Because Ware was in prison at the time he filed his notice of appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date on which it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court. <em>See </em>Fed.
