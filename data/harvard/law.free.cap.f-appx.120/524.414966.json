He argues that the condition of supervised release prohibiting him from possessing \u201cany other dangerous weapon\u201d must be vacated because it is impermissibly vague and overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>We interpret Jones\u2019s \u201coverbreadth\u201d argument to mean that the \u201cany other dangerous weapon\u201d condition violates the requirement that a condition of supervised release involve \u201cno greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary ... to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\u201d and \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d <em>See United States v. Paul, </em>274 F.3d 155, 165 <em>&amp; </em>n. 12 (5th Cir.2001); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(2); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B) &amp; (C). Jones was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). Under these circumstances, the \u201cany other dangerous weapon\u201d condition is not overbroad because it does not involve a greater deprivation of liberty than is necessary to afford adequate deterrence of criminal conduct and to protect the public form further crimes by him. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(2); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B) &amp; (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">As to Jones\u2019s vagueness challenge, this court has held that \u201c[c]onditions of probation \u2018may afford fair warning even if they are not precise to the point of pedantry. In short, conditions of probation can be written \u2014 and must be read \u2014 in a <em>commonsense </em>way.\u2019\u201d <em>See Paul, </em>274 F.3d at 167 (citation omitted; emphasis added). When the definition of a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d is read in the requisite commonsense manner, this definition reflects that intent to cause harm is required in order to characterize as a dangerous weapon an instrument which is not dangerous when used in its customary manner. <em>Id.; see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment, (n.1(d)) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Jones argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional on its face because it does not require a \u201csubstantial\u201d effect on interstate commerce. As Jones concedes, this issue is foreclosed; he raises it to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review. <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Jones has filed an opposed motion to file a supplemental brief. This motion is GRANTED. In his supplemental brief, Jones argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , should be applied to sentences determined under the federal sentencing guidelines. As Jones also concedes, this argument is foreclosed by our opinion in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-73 (5th Cir.2004), <em>cert. granted, judgment vacated by, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1003, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -, 2005 WL 124197 (2005) , but he raises it to preserve it for possible further review. Accordingly, Jones\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b559-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
