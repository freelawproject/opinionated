In criminal cases, the defendant must file his notice <em>of </em>appeal within ten days of the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a motion, the district court may grant an extension of time of up to thirty days upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-25\">The district court entered its order on May 18, 2004; the ten-day appeal period, which excludes weekends and holidays, expired on June 2. Kennedy filed his notice of appeal after both the ten-day period and the thirty-day excusable neglect period expired. The notice of appeal is therefore untimely, and the appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 227, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960) (holding appeal period \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d). We dispense with oral argument be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>cause the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
