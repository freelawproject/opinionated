Cortez was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 63 months to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. Cortez was also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $805,083.55 and a fine of $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The Government argues that Cortez waived his right to appeal his sentence in his plea agreement. Cortez responds that he did not waive his right to appeal a sentence above the statutory maximum and that, under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the constitutional statutory maximum sentence that could be imposed upon him was 41 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">The record reflects that Cortez knowingly and voluntarily executed the waiver contained in his plea agreement and, thus, the waiver was validly executed. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517 (5th Cir.1999). However, the Supreme Court in <em>Blakely </em>held \u201cthat the \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for Apprendi<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2537 (italics omitted). The waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b570-13\">in Cortez\u2019s plea agreement contained an exception for sentences imposed above the statutory maximum. Thus, out of an abundance of caution and because appellate-waiver provisions are to be construed against the Government, <em>see United States v. Somner, </em>127 F.3d 405, 408 (5th Cir. 1997), the court will consider Cortez\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">Relying on <em>Blakely, </em>Cortez argues that his 63-month sentence was unconstitutional because there was no proof beyond a reasonable doubt presented to a jury to support the enhancements of his offense level based on the abuse of trust or obstruction of justice. He further argues that under <em>Blakely, </em>the restitution order is unconstitutional because it was based on facts not submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-15\">This court has held that <em>Blakely </em>does not apply to the federal sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 473 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert, denied, denied, filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004). Therefore, Cortez\u2019s arguments under <em>Blakely </em>are foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-16\">Cortez argues that the district court erred in failing to grant his motion for a downward departure based on his physical condition. He also alleges that the fine imposed is erroneous because the district court did not consider whether the fine would impair Cortez\u2019s ability to make restitution. Neither of these issues are included in the exceptions to Cortez\u2019s voluntary waiver of his right to appeal his sentence. Thus, the departure ruling and the fine are not subject to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>The motion is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b570-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
