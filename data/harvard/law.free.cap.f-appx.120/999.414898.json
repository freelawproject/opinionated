Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999). Therefore, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1033-19\"> Leandre\u2019s petition for review is timely only as to the Board\u2019s April 1, 2004 order denying a motion to reopen. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2000) (petition for review must be filed within thirty days of final order of removal); <em>see Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (holding order of removal and denial of motion to reconsider are separate final orders, each subject to relevant time limit for review). Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to consider the Board's August 29, 2003 order affirming the immigration judge, the January 16, 2004 order denying the motion to reconsider, or the August 5, 2004 order denying the motion to reconsider the April 1, 2004 denial of the motion to reopen.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
