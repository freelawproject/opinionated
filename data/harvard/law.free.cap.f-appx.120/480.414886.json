Staley appeals from the orders of the district court in these three actions, filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000). The district court referred these cases to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(3) (2000). In each case the magistrate judge recommended that the complaint be dismissed as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) (2000), and advised Staley that failure to file specific objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based on the recommendation. Despite this warning, in each case Staley failed to file specific objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to object will waive appellate review. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Staley has waived appellate review by failing to file specific objections after receiving proper notice. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
