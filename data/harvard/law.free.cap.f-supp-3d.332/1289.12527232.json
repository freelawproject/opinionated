Little Butte seeks summary judgment in its favor for injunctive relief and damages against Defendant and Counterclaimant Ken Bradley. ECF No. 40. The Chelan County Defendants seek an order of dismissal with prejudice of Mr. Bradley's counterclaims against Little Butte. ECF No. 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Although Mr. Bradley requested oral argument for Little Butte's summary judgment motion, the Court finds that it would not be assisted by oral argument from the parties on the matters raised by that motion and declines to schedule the matter for argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, having reviewed all submitted documents related to the motions, and the relevant law, the Court grants both motions for summary judgment, and enters judgment for the Chelan County Defendants and Little Butte.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Mr. Bradley's Failure to File Controverting Statements of Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Chelan County Defendants request that the Court accept as undisputed their statement of facts in support of their motion for summary judgment because Mr. Bradley did not file an opposing statement of material fact as required by Local Rule 56.1, nor any exhibits to rebut the Chelan County Defendants' statement of material facts. Similarly, Little Butte argues that the two unsigned, undated, and unsworn declarations that Mr. Bradley submitted with his response to Little Butte's summary judgment motion, one from Mr. Bradley and the other from his counsel, do not comply with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and do not provide any admissible evidence to controvert Little Butte's statement of material facts in support of its motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A party must support an assertion that a fact is genuinely disputed by citation to particular materials in the record, including pleadings, discovery, and affidavits.

The previous owners of the property sought a judicial determination of the property's relationship with the Little Butte water system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 46 at 2, 7-10. The result of that litigation was a judgment, issued in 1982, finding that Little Butte is obligated to provide water to the residential property and, in return, the property owners are required to pay the fees and assessments associated with water service from Little Butte.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Little Butte's potable water delivery system was developed in approximately 1960 and involves pumping water from Lake Chelan through \"a pipeline easement that runs over 3000 linear feet ... to the [Little Butte] pump station, water filtration plant, and storage tanks.\" ECF No. 46 at 2. Mr. Bradley's property is subject to a portion of that pipeline easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   By summer 2013, the Little Butte water system had begun to deteriorate and fail, including a leak around July 2013 that caused mud to run onto a local highway. On or around September 21, 2013, Little Butte determined that it would need to replace portions of the system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The replacement work was scheduled to begin on October 4, 2013, with an anticipated nineteen work days needed to complete the project. However, Mr. Bradley inhibited Little Butte's contractor's access to his property on October 4. In a letter that indicates on its face that it was emailed to Little Butte on October 4, Mr. Bradley listed fifteen items that would be required for him to allow access to his\n   property for the work on the pipeline. ECF No. 46 at 12. On October 8, 2013, Mr. Bradley conveyed to Little Butte, through a representative, that he would allow access to his property once he received proof of insurance and a copy of the easement from Little Butte. ECF No. 46 at 3. Little Butte asserts that it provided that documentation to Mr. Bradley on October 10, 2013. ECF Nos. 46 at 3; 50 at 2. However, Mr. Bradley did not allow access, and work on the pipeline replacement stopped on October 8, 2013. ECF No. 46 at 4. Contractor Elite Excavation &amp; Services notified Little Butte that while standing by waiting to complete the work on the pipeline, the company would bill the water association for the costs associated with retaining the specialty equipment in the area. ECF No. 54 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On approximately October 22, 2013, Little Butte filed a lawsuit against Mr. Bradley in Chelan County Superior Court, and, on October 24, 2013, the court issued a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") authorizing immediate access for Little Butte and its contractor to the pipeline and directing removal of \"any obstructions such as vehicles, locks or other objects that may interfere with the replacement of that pipeline.\" ECF No. 42-3 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The same day that the restraining order was entered, Elite Excavation \"re-mobilized\" its crews to restart the pipeline. ECF No. 54 at 3. The contractor built an access road along the route of the pipeline across Mr. Bradley's property to facilitate access to a location between Mr. Bradley's property and the shoreline of Lake Chelan, where Elite Excavation was constructing a booster pump. ECF No. 41 at 7-8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On November 11, 2013, Elite Excavation invoiced Little Butte in the amount of $23,868.00 for the costs incurred during the 18-day delay in the pipeline construction \"due to the ... actions caused by Mr. Bradley.\" ECF No. 54 at 4. Little Butte paid the invoice on November 14, 2013. ECF No. 54 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Throughout fall 2013, Chelan County Sheriff's Deputies responded to Mr. Bradley's property on five or six occasions in response to claims that Mr. Bradley was interfering with work related to replacing the pipeline. ECF No. 59-1 at 12-15. Mr. Bradley also called law enforcement when individuals from Little Butte came to the property. ECF No. 59-1 at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Before construction, a professional line locator had identified the location of the original Little Butte pipeline across Mr. Bradley's property. ECF No. 52 at 3. Elite Excavation followed the line location while performing the pipeline replacement work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 42-7 at 2; 43 at 9. Mr. Bradley and his acquaintances insisted that the contractor's employees were digging in the wrong place.

ECF Nos. 41 at 8-9; 42-7 at 2. On November\n   20, 2013, Elite Excavation called for a \"line locate\" to identify Mr. Bradley's personal utilities in order to avoid them while replacing the pipeline across his property. ECF No. 41 at 9. However, Mr. Bradley refused the line locator access to his property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The next day, Little Butte returned to Chelan County Superior Court to move for an order finding Mr. Bradley in contempt for violating the temporary injunction, arguing that \"time [was] of the essence\" in completing the work because \"the onset of winter could stop construction.\" ECF No. 42-7 at 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 42-6 at 1-2. On November 25, 2013, the Chelan County Court Commissioner found Mr. Bradley in contempt of the TRO; ordered the Chelan County Sheriff to incarcerate Mr. Bradley, and any other individual blocking access to Mr. Bradley's property, until Mr. Bradley allowed access to his property; and sanctioned Mr. Bradley in the amount of the reasonable attorney's fees that Little Butte incurred in moving for contempt, $2000. ECF No. 42-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On August 15, 2014, the Chelan County Superior Court entered judgment against Mr. Bradley and in favor of Little Butte for $23,868 for the costs resulting from a delay in construction, plus attorney fees and taxable costs in the amount of $2,665. ECF No. 42-11. Shortly thereafter, the same court ordered supplemental proceedings in the form of a judgment debtor exam to allow Little Butte to ascertain what property Mr. Bradley may have had that could satisfy the judgment.

When Deputy Mutch shined his light into Mr. Bradley's residence, Mr. Bradley \"didn't say anything at that point and just stepped away from the window.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Having observed Mr. Bradley inside the residence, the deputies knocked on the door, announced their presence, and advised Mr. Bradley that they had a warrant.

Mr. Bradley was lying face-up in the hallway. ECF Nos. 60-1 at 3; 61 at 3; 62 at 3.

ECF Nos. 60 at 4; 60-1 at 3; 61 at 3. Mr. Bradley did not display any difficulty breathing. ECF Nos. 61 at 3; 62 at 3. Deputy Lamon performed a sternum rub to see whether Mr. Bradley would react or wake up. ECF No. 62 at 4. Deputy Lamon also performed a \"drop test\" in which he lifted Mr. Bradley's arm up over Mr. Bradley's face and dropped the arm.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The rationale of the test is that an unconscious person's arm will drop on his face.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. Bradley moved his arm each time Deputy Lamon dropped it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 60 at 3.

He recalled peering through blinds on a sliding door to find a \"bright light shined in his face\" and hearing someone yell \"Bradley, we're going to get you.\" ECF No. 59-1 at 19-20. He described next hearing \"pounding all around the house,\" and then regaining consciousness briefly on the floor of his house, unable to talk, while people who had \"gained access to his house ... kept on inflicting pain on [him].\" ECF No. 59-1 at 20-21.

Little Butte does not dispute that the service of process for the complaint that the water association filed on October 22, 2013, was defective. ECF No. 69 at 6.
