Presently pending before the Court are four Motions to Dismiss filed by Elbaz in which she argues that the Indictment fails to state an offense, the charged offenses are improperly based on extraterritorial conduct, the conspiracy charge exceeds Congress's power under the Commerce Clause to criminalize a foreign conspiracy, and the Indictment fails to allege proper venue in the District of Maryland. Elbaz has also filed a Motion to Strike Paragraph 10 of the Indictment and a Motion, in the Alternative, for a Bill of Particulars. After briefing, the Court held a hearing on all six Motions on July 30, 2018. For the reasons set forth below, the Motions to Dismiss are denied, the Motion to Strike is denied, and the Motion for a Bill of Particulars is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Indictment alleges the following facts, which the Court accepts as true for purposes of the Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Elbaz, a resident of Israel, was the Chief Executive Officer of Yukom Communications, an Israel-based business that provided sales and marketing services for two internet-based businesses with the brand names BinaryBook and BigOption (\"the Companies\"). BinaryBook and BigOption sell financial instruments known as \"binary options,\" consisting of bets on the outcome of a particular event, that result in the payment of either a pre-determined amount of money or nothing. Indictment \u00b6 9, ECF No. 37. Elbaz identified herself as the \"Trading Floor Manager\" for BinaryBook and BigOption.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n    \u00b6 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Count One of the Indictment charges Elbaz with conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The fraud was allegedly perpetrated in several ways. Sales representatives of the Companies (\"Representatives\") would misrepresent their personal financial incentives to investors by stating that they were paid a commission based on investor profit, when in fact they were paid a commission based on investor deposits. The Indictment alleges that Elbaz trained and encouraged Representatives to make such claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Representatives also misrepresented the average investment return on binary options. Representatives were given a script that included false statements such as that investor returns averaged 15-25 percent per month and that there was an average success rate of 70 percent. Elbaz allegedly trained and encouraged employees of the Companies to make such misrepresentations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Furthermore, Representatives, following scripts provided by Elbaz, made false statements about their educational background, claiming to have a master's degree in economics; their location, stating that they were in London; and their names, using \"stage names\" or other aliases. Elbaz allegedly trained and encouraged Representatives to make such statements and personally approved the stage names.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Indictment also alleges that Representatives misstated to investors how easy it was for investors to withdraw their funds. When an investor sought to withdraw funds, the Representatives instead offered the investor an \"Academy\" class that was purportedly designed to improve trading performance, but did not, in fact, do so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n    \u00b6 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Elbaz allegedly trained and encouraged employees to make misrepresentations that funds could be withdrawn easily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Finally, Representatives did not disclose material information about various proposed investment terms, including \"bonuses,\" \"risk free trades,\" and \"insured trades.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 36-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although these terms implied that investors would receive additional money or decreased risk, these tools were actually mechanisms used to make it more difficult to withdraw deposits. Elbaz allegedly trained and encouraged employees to make misrepresentations about the ability to withdraw funds invested in these instruments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Counts Two, Three, and Four charge Elbaz with three counts of wire fraud. In these counts, the Indictment charges that on three separate occasions, Elbaz caused, or aided and abetted, the sending of wire transmissions from Representatives to victims in Maryland for the purpose of executing a scheme to defraud. The Indictment identifies three Maryland victims through pseudonyms as Victims A, B, and C, and it provides specific dates on which a Representative of BinaryBook or BigOption communicated with the victim through a wire transmission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court will first address Elbaz's Motions to Dismiss, then consider the Motion\n   to Strike, and finally examine the Motion for a Bill of Particulars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Failure to State an Offense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Elbaz seeks dismissal of the Indictment for failing to state an offense. According to Elbaz, the Indictment does not set forth the essential facts that would fairly inform her of the conduct forming the offense charged in Count One. In her view, the Indictment fails to allege any facts that link her to the perpetrators of the fraud, or that show that she was aware of the fraud at all. Elbaz further argues that Counts Two, Three, and Four are deficient because there is no factual allegation that she made or caused to be made a materially false statement, or that the individuals who communicated with the Maryland victims were connected to Elbaz. Finally, she argues that there are no facts that support the charge that she aided and abetted wire fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   When a defendant challenges the sufficiency of an indictment, courts apply a \"heightened scrutiny to ensure that every essential element of an offense has been charged.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Perry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4124844\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/166/#p171\">\n    757 F.3d 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 171 (4th Cir. 2014). \"An indictment must contain the elements of the offense charged, fairly inform a defendant of the charge, and enable the defendant to plead double jeopardy as a defense in a future prosecution for the same offense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4124844\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/166/#p171\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

An indictment is allowed to set forth the offense in the words of the statute itself, so long as it includes all of the necessary elements of the offense, but the statutory language must also be accompanied by a \"statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.\"\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4124844\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/166/#p171\">\n    757 F.3d at 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, while an indictment is intended to be \"concise,\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c), there is no requirement that it \"include every fact to be alleged by the government,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Moyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049405\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/192/#p203\">\n    674 F.3d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 203 (3d Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   When the charged crime is conspiracy, \"all that is necessary in the indictment is that the object of the conspiracy be set forth sufficiently to identify the offense which the defendant is charged with conspiring to commit.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Matzkin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530280\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/1014/#p1019\">\n    14 F.3d 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1019 (4th Cir. 1994). The sufficiency of the indictment is determined by \"practical, as opposed to purely technical considerations,\" with the key question being whether it tells the defendant all that is needed to show for his defense, and whether it provides enough information that the defendant will not be placed in double jeopardy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530280\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/1014/#p1019\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On Count One, the elements of conspiracy to commit wire fraud are \"(1) two or more persons made an agreement to commit wire fraud; (2) the defendant knew the unlawful purpose of the agreement; and (3) the defendant joined in the agreement willfully.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Kuhrt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230447\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/788/403/#p414\">\n    788 F.3d 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414 (5th Cir. 2015). The Indictment clearly states these elements. In paragraph 17, the Indictment alleges that Elbaz \"and others known and unknown to the Grand Jury, did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire, confederate, and agree with each other and others ... to commit wire fraud.\" Indictment \u00b6 17. The object of the conspiracy was explicitly identified as the commission of the federal crime of wire fraud, which was described as \"knowingly and with the intent to defraud, having devised ... a scheme and artifice to defraud binary options investors in BinaryBook and Big Option, ... knowingly transmit and cause to be transmitted by means of wire communication in interstate and foreign commerce, writings, signs, pictures, and sounds for the purpose of executing the scheme and artifice in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230447\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/788/403/#p414\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Thus, each element of conspiracy, as well as the object of the conspiracy, is fairly stated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4124844\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/166/#p171\">\n    757 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   171 ;\n   <em>\n    Matzkin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530280\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/1014/#p1019\">\n    14 F.3d at 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although this description largely tracks the statute, the Indictment is not limited to the statutory language. It also includes the \"essential facts constituting the offense charged,\" including the dates of the offense (from May 2014 to June 2017) and the location (the District of Maryland and elsewhere). Indictment \u00b6 17. It describes the object of the conspiracy as wire fraud relating to a scheme to defraud \"binary options investors in BinaryBook and Big Option.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530280\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/1014/#p1019\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Beyond those basic facts, which are typically sufficient to state a conspiracy charge, the Indictment sets forth a detailed description of the manner and means of the conspiracy, including that Elbaz and her co-conspirators induced investors to deposit funds based on four different categories of misrepresentations made by BinaryBook and BigOption personnel, specifically misrepresentations that Representatives were paid based on total investor profits, when in fact they were paid based on total investor deposits, misrepresentations about the profitability of their accounts, misrepresentations about the location and education of particular Representatives, and misrepresentations\n   about investors' ability to withdraw their funds. These additional facts are more than enough to identify the offense Elbaz is charged with conspiring to commit and to allow Elbaz to understand whether she is being subjected to double jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Elbaz claims that the Indictment does not provide sufficient facts to connect her to the perpetrators of the fraud or to show that she was aware of the actual acts of wire fraud. Elbaz further claims that the Indictment \"must contain factual allegations from which a reasonabl[e] jury could conclude that the defendant made or caused to be made a materially false statement.\" Mot. Dismiss (Failure to State an Offense) at 9, ECF No. 58. First, these claims misunderstand the purpose of an indictment, which is to put the defendant on notice of the charge against her, not to demonstrate that the Government has sufficient facts to convict the defendants. Unlike for a civil complain, there is no requirement that an indictment offer sufficient facts, which if true, would establish the offense. Rather, an indictment must merely identify those essential facts necessary to inform her of the charge, prepare a defense, and avoid double jeopardy, not layout the whole of the Government's case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049405\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/192/#p203\">\n    674 F.3d at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, as Elbaz has argued, the essential element of the offense is the agreement to commit a crime, which the Indictment has alleged. There is no requirement that a defendant know the identity of all other co-conspirators in order to sustain a conviction. Indeed, an indictment charging conspiracy does not need to name co-conspirators because it is \"the existence of the conspiracy, rather than the particular identity of the conspirators\" that is the essential element of the crime.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Am. Waste Fibers Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1643453\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/809/1044/#p1046\">\n    809 F.2d 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1046 (4th Cir. 1987). It is also not required, to establish a conviction for conspiracy, to show that the defendant was aware of any particular criminal act. Even if a member of a conspiracy did not know of certain criminal acts by co-conspirators, that member \"is responsible for the acts of the others in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Snead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1084124\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/527/590/#p591\">\n    527 F.2d 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 591 (4th Cir. 1975). Thus, facts showing the defendant's knowledge of particular criminal acts are not essential elements that must be stated in a conspiracy indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Third, to the extent that Elbaz argues that certain facts about her involvement must be alleged in order to allow her to prepare her defense, the Indictment further describes her alleged role in the conspiracy by stating, among other things, that Elbaz supervised the representatives who made false statements in furtherance of the fraud, that she trained and encouraged the representatives to make misrepresentations, and that she used an alias in interacting with investors and approved stage names for representatives to use. The Indictment provides specific examples of such activities by alleging that she taught a \"retention class\" on February 24, 2016, received a \"Course Manual\" on August 24, 2016, received a communication from a manager stating that \"there is a lot more money to take from\" investors, and directed a representative to place a small bonus in an investor account on April 10, 2015. Indictment \u00b6\u00b6 22a, 22e, 24a. These facts are sufficient to provide notice to Elbaz of the conspiracy charge against her, to allow her to prepare her defense, and to permit her to assess whether she is subject to double jeopardy. To the extent that any additional facts are needed, they will be discussed in relation to the Motion for a Bill of Particulars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As for the substantive wire fraud charges in Counts Two, Three, and\n   Four, the Indictment likewise states all of the elements of the offense and provides notice of the charges against Elbaz. To convict a person of the crime of wire fraud, the Government must show that the defendant \"(1) devised or intended to devise a scheme to defraud and (2) used ... wire communications in furtherance of the scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Wynn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5881091\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/684/473/#p477\">\n    684 F.3d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 477 (4th Cir. 2012). As charged in the Indictment, a person who aids and abets the crime of wire fraud may also be found guilty of the substantive offense.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Paragraph 41 of the Indictment states that Elbaz:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [K]nowingly and with the intent to defraud, having devised and intending to devise, and willfully participated in, a scheme and artifice to defraud binary options investors in BinaryBook and BigOption, and for obtaining money and property by means of materially false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises, transmitted and caused to be transmitted, and aided and abetted the transmission, by means of wire communication in interstate and foreign commerce, writings, signs, pictures, and. sounds for the purpose of executing the scheme and artifice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Indictment \u00b6 41. The Indictment therefore stated all of the elements of a wire fraud offense.

Again, there is no requirement that the Indictment provide more, or include sufficient facts to establish a violation of the statute. For example, in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Under the\n   <em>\n    Pinkerton\n   </em>\n   theory of liability, if Elbaz is convicted of the conspiracy\n   count, she would be liable for all reasonably foreseeable acts of co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy, including the wire fraud charges in Counts Two, Three, and Four, even if she was not specifically aware of those transmissions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pinkerton v.

That defect is not present here, where there is no significant dispute that the Indictment alleges all of the necessary elements for both the conspiracy charge and the substantive wire fraud counts.

Specifically, Elbaz argues that since a wire fraud conspiracy requires proof only of an agreement to commit wire fraud, and since that agreement occurred overseas, the agreement is not within the scope of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201349\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the substantive wire fraud counts, Elbaz argues that the allegations of three wire transmissions to victims in the United States do not establish the crime as domestic because the \"focus\" of the wire fraud statute is not the wire communications, but the broader scheme to defraud, which she claims was foreign in nature, and in any event the allegations do not tie Elbaz to the wires. Mot. Dismiss (Extraterritoriality) at 10-11, ECF No. 57. Elbaz further argues that even if the Court finds that the wire fraud and wire fraud conspiracy statutes apply to Elbaz's extraterritorial conduct, applying those provisions to her conduct would violate due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The United States Supreme Court has outlined a two-step framework for analyzing extraterritoriality issues.

As these cases illustrate, it does not matter if the bulk of the scheme to defraud involves foreign activity.

A drug kingpin overseeing drug activity in the United States, but who entered into the conspiratorial agreement in Mexico, would be untouchable for that crime. Such a result illustrates the absurdity of the Elbaz's position. Accordingly, the Court concludes, as in\n   <em>\n    Kim\n   </em>\n   , that if wire fraud counts charge a domestic violation based on wires were sent to or from victims in the United States, the wire fraud conspiracy count also charges a domestic application of \u00a7 1349.\n   <em>\n    Kim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11107030\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/246/186/\">\n    246 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   191 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, Elbaz argues, without persuasive authority, that the application of the wire fraud and conspiracy statutes to her conduct violates due process.

Notably, this is not a case involving foreigners defrauding foreigners in which there was incidental use of U.S. wires. The Indictment alleges that there were victims in the United States, specifically in Maryland, and that Elbaz caused wires to be sent to them in furtherance of a scheme to defraud. Thus, there is a significant U.S. interest in preventing the defrauding of U.S. persons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Elbaz does not seriously dispute that point, but instead argues that she did not personally take actions that affected United States interests.

The Indictment alleges that Elbaz supervised and trained Representatives to make false statements to defraud investors, and some of those Representatives then directly engaged with Americans over U.S. wires.

Paragraph 17 specifically alleges that over a three year period from May 2014 to June 2017, in the District of Maryland and elsewhere, Elbaz conspired to commit the federal crime of wire fraud, a crime which specifically involves the use of wire communications in interstate or foreign commerce. The fact that the conspiracy has, as its object, the transmittal of wire communications \"in interstate or foreign commerce,\" for the purpose of executing a scheme to defraud,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201343\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , on its face implicates foreign commerce because it is an agreement to, in part, to use wires between states or between the United States and a foreign country to engage in fraud. By criminalizing conspiratorial agreements to misuse such wires for fraudulent activity, Congress operates well within its authority to regulate instrumentalities of foreign commerce, since phones and internet connections are plainly used to engage in such commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   From the additional description of the conspiracy in the Indictment, there is no question that the allegations specifically involve wires directly related to commerce between the United States and foreign countries. The alleged scheme involved the marketing of financial instruments, through the use of false statements, by an Israel-based company, through internet-based businesses (BinaryBook and Big Option), to victims which specifically included the individuals in the United States referenced in the Indictment. The marketing included using emails and phone calls to individuals in the United States to discuss potential transactions and notably identifies at least three specific wires to victims in the United States. The Indictment thus squarely alleges a crime that directly implicates commerce between the United States and foreign countries, not only commerce between two or more foreign nations, and thus alleges conduct squarely within Congress's authority to regulate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Elbaz argues that the application of the wire fraud conspiracy statute here violates the Commerce Clause because the conspiracy \"did not target the United States and is therefore, at best, only tangentially related to U.S. commerce.\" Mot. Dismiss (Commerce) at 6, ECF No. 59. Even if the conspiracy focused more on other countries, the Indictment clearly alleges a conspiracy directed in part at the United States by virtue of allegations that the marketing of the financial instruments was directed at U.S. customers and victims. The fact that the impact of a criminal scheme on the United States may have been less than on other countries does not provide a basis to conclude that Congress cannot regulate such schemes to protect American victims, however many there are as compared to foreign victims. The fact that Elbaz caused these transmissions from overseas, if anything, strengthens this argument by bringing the conduct within the scope of the more expansive foreign commerce power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Elbaz's contention that the Indictment does not allege that she personally directed activity toward the United States, or was aware that it was being so directed, does not support her constitutional claim. In light of the seriousness of conspiratorial activity, Congress may deem a conspiratorial agreement to use wires between the\n   United States and foreign countries to further a scheme to defraud as worthy of regulation by criminal statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Indictment \u00b6 42. It does not matter that these wires were not necessarily themselves fraudulent in nature.

In so ruling, the court rejected the argument that the specific overt acts were \"\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   in context\" and \"completely legal,\" because the relevant question is whether an overt act furthers a conspiracy, not how much the overt act furthers the conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3637473\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/700/713/#p727\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Day\n   </em>\n   , the Indictment does not allege that the identified communications with the victims in the District of Maryland included fraudulent statements, or that Elbaz was the sender or recipient of the wire communication. But where these wire communications were alleged to have been caused by Elbaz in order to further the conspiracy to defraud investors,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Indictment \u00b6 42, they sufficiently allege an overt act that, under\n   <em>\n    Day\n   </em>\n   , establishes venue in Maryland.\n   <em>\n    Day,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3637473\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/700/713/#p727\">\n    700 F.3d at 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In light of such allegations, Elbaz's citation to unpublished district court cases in which the court assessed whether such an overt act was alleged in the indictment does not alter the Court's conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Where Elbaz\n   is alleged to have been part of the conspiracy, and a member of a conspiracy is responsible for the acts of others in furtherance of the conspiracy,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Singh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555901\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/518/236/#p253\">\n    518 F.3d at 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , she would still be responsible for wires sent by others in furtherance of the conspiracy, even if she was not specifically aware of or directly involved in their transmission. Therefore, the Court finds that venue for Count One has been sufficiently pleaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As for the substantive counts, Counts Two, Three, and Four, wire fraud is a \"continuing offense,\" such that venue on a substantive wire fraud count is established when the defendant causes a wire communication to be transmitted in furtherance of the fraud.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As discussed above, the allegations that Elbaz supervised and trained representatives to make false statements in order to induce more investor deposits supports the allegation that she either caused or aided and abetted the sending of these wires for the stated purpose. The Court thus finds that venue for the substantive wire fraud counts has been sufficiently pleaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Motion to Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Elbaz has filed a Motion to Strike Paragraph 10 of the Indictment, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   While some binary options were listed on registered exchanges or traded on a designated contract market that were subject to oversight by U.S. regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, neither BinaryBook nor BigOption sold binary options that were traded on a legal and regulated designated contract market in the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Indictment \u00b6 10. Elbaz argues that paragraph 10 has no probative value for Count One of the Indictment, is disconnected from Counts Two, Three, and Four, and risks prejudicing jurors against her. Elbaz argues that the allegation in paragraph 10 is unrelated to whether she entered into a conspiracy to commit wire fraud and does not help the Government prove that Elbaz committed wire fraud or aided and abetted the commission of wire fraud. Elbaz further argues that the Government only included paragraph 10 to trigger a negative reaction by the jury by implying that Elbaz's companies should have been registered with U.S. regulators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d), courts \"may strike surplusage from the indictment.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d). Courts should grant motions to strike surplusage \"only if it is clear that the allegations are not relevant to the charge and are inflammatory and prejudicial.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2779394\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/724/#p733\">\n    445 F.3d 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 733 (4th Cir. 2006) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Cir. 1998) ). A court can avoid any potential prejudice by not giving the indictment to the jury and specifically instructing the jury that the indictment is not evidence.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2779394\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/724/#p733\">\n    445 F.3d at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Court finds that Elbaz has failed to establish that the allegations are irrelevant. The Government asserts that paragraph 10 was included because the fact that the binary options sold by BinaryBook and BigOption should have been, but were not, listed on registered exchanges or traded on a designated contract market regulated by the SEC arguably\n   made it more likely that there was a scheme to defraud, because a decision not to meet such a requirement may tend to reveal an intent to evade detection of the fraudulent scheme by federal authorities, and may also tend to increase the likelihood of the success of the fraud based on a lack of regulatory oversight. Although there may be other potential inferences from these facts, there is nothing impermissible about these inferences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The allegations in paragraph 10 are neither inflammatory nor unduly prejudicial, where the failure to meet a regulatory requirement is far less inflammatory than the primary allegation of defrauding investors. Notably, in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , the court refused to strike from an indictment for a felon-in-possession charge the significantly more inflammatory allegation that the defendant was responsible for an uncharged murder.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2779394\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/724/#p733\">\n    445 F.3d at 733-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fourth Circuit found that evidence of the uncharged murder was not unfairly prejudicial, was probative of the charged offense, and was mitigated by the fact that the jury was instructed to consider the evidence for the limited purpose of showing that the defendant possessed the firearm.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2779394\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/724/#p733\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   As trial approaches, Elbaz is free to argue that the Indictment should not be shared with the jury, or to propose a limiting instruction to prevent the jury from drawing any inappropriate inferences from paragraph 10. As for the pending Motion, however, the Court will deny the Motion to Strike because paragraph 10 is relevant and not unduly prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Bill of Particulars\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Elbaz seeks a bill of particulars on the grounds that because of the alleged deficiencies in the Indictment, and the Government's production of 2.5 million pages of discovery, more information is needed to allow her to prepare her defense. She requests that the bill of particulars include four classes of information. First, Elbaz seeks the identities of the individuals referenced in the Indictment as having performed acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, such as the Representatives who engaged in the three charged wire transmissions. Second, Elbaz seeks the identities of the alleged victims of the offense. Third, Elbaz seeks identification of the allegedly fraudulent statements that Elbaz made or caused to be made in furtherance of the scheme. Fourth, Elbaz seeks the identification of the location where the conspiratorial agreement was entered and of any overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy committed in Maryland, in order to assess whether venue is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure require that the \"indictment ... be a plain, concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1). The defendant may \"move for a bill of particulars before or within 14 days after arraignment or at a later time if the court permits.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(f). \"The purpose of a bill of particulars is to enable a defendant to obtain sufficient information on the nature of the charge against him so that he may prepare for trial, minimize the danger of surprise at trial, and enable him to plead his acquittal or conviction in bar of another prosecution for the same offense.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Schembari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"238476\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/484/931/#p935\">\n    484 F.2d 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 935 (4th Cir. 1973). However, \"[a] bill of particulars is not to be used to provide detailed disclosure of the government's evidence in advance of trial.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Automated Medical Labs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"332854\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/770/399/#p405\">\n    770 F.2d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 405 (4th Cir. 1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As to the first request, the Indictment does not identify Elbaz's co-conspirators except through pseudonyms. As discussed above, a conspiracy indictment does\n   not need to name all co-conspirators because it is \"the existence of the conspiracy, rather than the particular identity of the conspirators\" that is the essential element of the crime.\n   <em>\n    Am. Waste Fibers Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1643453\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/809/1044/#p1046\">\n    809 F.2d at 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But where specific individual co-conspirators are referenced in the Indictment in relation to specific acts, including the substantive wire fraud counts, Elbaz would be unable to prepare her defense without knowing who these individuals are. The Government asserts that many of these individuals have already been identified through its voluminous document production. Although the Government has produced a smaller collection of documents specifically referenced in the Indictment and contends that those documents reveal the identities of most, but not all, of the Managers and Representatives referenced in the Indictment, Elbaz still asserts that she is not certain of the identities of some of these co-conspirators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In a Supplement to the Government's Response to the Defendant's Motion for a Bill of Particulars, ECF No. 82, the Government reports that it has provided Elbaz with a key identifying the Managers and Representatives referenced in the Indictment. Based on this representation, the Court finds that there is no need for a Bill of Particulars on this point and will deny the Motion on this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Urban\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9015298\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/404/754/#p772\">\n    404 F.3d 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 772 (3d Cir. 2005) (noting that access to materials through discovery weakens the argument for a bill of particulars). If Elbaz disagrees that the identities of these alleged co-conspirators have been produced, it may renew its motion on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Second, as to the identity of victims, the scheme as described in the Indictment may have had a very significant number of victims. The Government need not identify them all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Butler v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"165220\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/317/249/#p256\">\n    317 F.2d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 256 (8th Cir. 1963). However, where the Indictment specifically references three victims in Maryland, Elbaz should have those names in order to prepare her defense. In the absence of safety concerns, the Court will require the Government to state the names of Victims A, B, and C referenced in the Indictment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Magalnik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328908\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/160/909/#p918\">\n    160 F.Supp.3d 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 918 (W.D. Va. 2015) (in a case charging the crime of harboring aliens illegally, requiring a bill of particulars stating the names of all foreign nationals allegedly harbored illegally).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Third, as to false statements made or caused to be made by Elbaz, the voluminous discovery makes it difficult for the defense to identify which statements by Elbaz will be at issue at trial. In\n   <em>\n    Magalnik\n   </em>\n   , the court ordered the Government to file a bill of particulars to list the specific documents out of 4,125 pages that \"it intends to introduce at trial and explain[ ], in general terms, how each application is believed to be false or fraudulent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328908\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/160/909/#p918\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In its Supplement, the Government reports that it has provided an index identifying all emails sent by Elbaz that have been produced, as well as two recorded statements. It has not reported how many emails are listed on that index. Although such disclosures are consistent with the discovery requirements of Rule 16, they do not address Elbaz's specific request for identification of the false statements made by or caused by Elbaz in furtherance of the wire fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Given the volume of discovery and the broad time frame of the alleged conspiracy, the Court concludes that a bill of particulars is warranted. Although the Court will not require the Government to identify all false statements caused by Elbaz, it will direct the Government to include in its bill of particulars a list of the allegedly false statements made directly by Elbaz, if any, that it intends to introduce at trial, including\n   the date of the statement and the person to whom it was made.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3791720\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/617/1024/#p1029\">\n    617 F.Supp. 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1029 (D. Colo. 1985) (requiring a bill of particulars on the allegedly false statements made by defendants).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Fourth, Elbaz's identification in a bill of particulars of overt acts performed in Maryland is not necessary. The Court has already determined, based on the facts alleged in the Indictment, that venue is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Elbaz's Motions to Dismiss are DENIED, the Motion to Strike is DENIED, and the Motion for a Bill of Particulars is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. A separate Order shall issue.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
