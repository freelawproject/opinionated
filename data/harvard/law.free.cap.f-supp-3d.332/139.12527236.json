Crisman does not allege that the dissemination of these lists has resulted in \"ongoing injury,\" such as the inability to travel or recurring, intrusive delays while traveling. Nor does she allege that there is a threat that such harms will occur in the immediate future. Rather, she asserts that after allegedly being placed on a watch list in 2004, her \"belongings were searched,\" \"she was escorted out of FRB Headquarters,\" \"[h]er contract was terminated\" and \"she was subsequently fired by CNI.\" Compl. \u00b6 15.

Pls. Second Opp. at 12; ECF No. 50-4 (Pls. Second Opp., Ex. D) \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. All of these alleged harms-the search, contract termination, job termination, and \"extra screenings\"- occurred at least a year before Plaintiffs filed their Complaint, and are therefore not sufficiently \"imminent\" or \"ongoing\" to demonstrate that \"a present case or controversy\" exists.\n   <em>\n    Veitch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5252321,3561406\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/471/124/\">\n    471 F.3d at 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Moreover, even if Crisman's alleged harms were imminent and ongoing, she has failed to demonstrate that these harms are \"fairly traceable\" to her alleged placement on a watch list.

Second Opp. at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Crisman's main argument in support of this assertion is that because she was escorted out of FRB headquarters due to \"something in her FBI file,\" her name must have been placed on a watch list.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. However, aside from quoting from a standard notice relating to the VGTOF and TSDB watch lists that FRB Security \"would likely have read,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12, Crisman provides no evidence establishing that the \"something in her FBI file\" was a notice or other evidence indicating that her name was placed on a watch list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Crisman further argues that there are three additional events demonstrating her placement on a watch list: (1) the FRB's Assistant Director of Human Resources' indication that Crisman had been \"Removed, Based on Suitability or Security Determination,\" (2) the fact that she was \"singled out for extra screening\" at the airport, and (3) DOJ's observation that the \"FBI's procedures for tracking and removing names from the TSDB were far from optimal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   12-14.
