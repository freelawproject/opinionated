WOODCOCK, JR., UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A pipeline operator challenges a local ordinance prohibiting loading crude oil onto tankers and the construction of new structures for that purpose on the grounds that it violates the dormant Commerce Clause and Foreign Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. A state or local statute can violate the dormant Commerce Clause if it (1) has an impermissible extraterritorial reach, (2) discriminates against interstate or foreign commerce, (3) excessively burdens interstate or foreign commerce, or (4) interferes with the federal government's ability to speak with one voice when regulating commerce with foreign nations. After a four-day bench trial, the Court concludes that the local ordinance does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause or the Foreign Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Patricia Doucette was the City's Code Enforcement Director at the outset of this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Pipelines\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In 1941, PPLC and MPLL began constructing and operating a twelve-inch crude oil pipeline stretching from the harbor in South Portland, Maine (the Harbor), through New Hampshire and Vermont and into Quebec, Canada, terminating at oil refineries in Montreal East.\n   <em>\n    Pls.' Ex.\n   </em>\n   164. PPLC added to its pipeline system in 1950 by constructing and operating an eighteen-inch pipeline. PPLC added to its pipeline system again in 1965 by constructing and operating a twenty-four-inch pipeline. PPLC decommissioned and ceased operating the original twelve-inch line in 1982. PPLC now uses the twelve-inch line as a sacrificial anode to protect its eighteen and twenty-four-inch lines from external corrosion. The nominal capacities of the remaining eighteen and twenty-four-inch lines are approximately 192,000 barrels per day and 410,000 barrels per day of crude oil, respectively. With a few exceptions of short distances, all three of PPLC's pipelines follow the same route, along the same rights of way, and pass largely underground between South Portland and the Montreal East oil refineries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Since 1941, PPLC has operated the portion of the pipeline within the United States, while MPLL has operated the portion within Canada. The only exception was a period from 1987 to 1999, when PPLC and MPLL cleared the eighteen-inch line and leased it to Granite State Gas Transmission, Inc., which operated the line for natural gas transmission. The companies refer to this combined pipeline system as the Portland-Montreal Pipe Line (PMPL).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In South Portland, PPLC maintains \"Pier 2,\" an oceanfront pier near Portland Breakwater Light on the Harbor where tanker vessels historically have docked to deliver crude oil. The crude oil is offloaded from marine tank vessels at Pier 2 and transported to storage tanks in the City; four storage tanks are on two parcels close to Pier 2 (the Waterfront Tanks) and nineteen are on Hill Street (the Main Tank Farm) approximately 2.7 miles inland from Pier 2. The oil travels from Pier 2 and the Waterfront Tanks through three lines running under Broadway and other streets and Mill Cove to the Maine Tank Farm. PPLC's eighteen-inch and twenty-four-inch pipelines move the crude oil northward from the Main Tank Farm to refineries in Montreal using six pumping stations across Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Access to the Harbor has been integral to PPLC's success and longevity. The Harbor is able to accommodate ships with up to fifty-two feet of draft and up to 170,000 deadweight tons of cargo. The Harbor has all-season ice-free conditions, which permits\n   shipment of cargo in and out of the Harbor year round. As recently as 2010-the last year the eighteen-inch line was in active service-PPLC accepted 132 deliveries from tankers. That year, PPLC transported 27,969,719 barrels of crude oil northward to Montreal East through its eighteen-inch pipeline, an average of 76,629 barrels per day, as well as 72,231,154 barrels of crude oil northward to Montreal East through its twenty-four-inch pipeline, an average of 197,894 barrels per day. At the busiest times, the piers docked forty-one ships per month and the pipelines transported 550,000 barrels per day. PPLC has been able to operate continuously since 1941 in part due to its ability to respond and adapt to changing market conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The 2008-2009 Oil Sands Proposed Project\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In 2007-2008, PPLC determined that demand for transportation of crude oil from the Harbor to the Montreal East refineries was likely to decline because the boom in crude oil production in Alberta's \"oil sands\" fields meant that Montreal East refiners would need less foreign oil. Crude oil derived from \"oil sands\" is sometimes referred to as \"tar sands\" or \"tar sands oil.\" In 2007-2008, PPLC moved to reverse the flow of its eighteen-inch pipeline, but not its twenty-four-inch pipeline, to enable the company to transport crude oil from Montreal to the Harbor and to load crude oil onto tanker vessels for shipment to both United States and international destinations.\n   <em>\n    Defs.' Ex.\n   </em>\n   64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   PPLC invested substantial money and effort in advancing its flow reversal project, spending approximately $5 million on consultants to determine the necessary changes to its infrastructure, to model the economics, and to identify necessary permits. Modifications to PPLC's existing pipeline infrastructure would be needed to reverse the direction of the flow of its pipelines, including reversing and adding valves to accommodate southbound crude oil transportation, installing pumping facilities, and installing a vapor control system at the Harbor. PPLC later estimated the total cost of a reversal project to be on the order of $100 million.\n   <em>\n    Defs.' Ex.\n   </em>\n   25 at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Marketing the Proposed Reversal Project\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In 2007-2008, PPLC began implementing its flow reversal project by marketing its ability to deliver oil from Canada to the South Portland Harbor. PPLC conducted a traditional \"open season\" process, whereby PPLC presented the details of its pipeline capacity to interested shippers-oil companies who wished to move their Canadian oil to the Harbor-to secure conditional offers for committed volumes of crude oil. During the open season process, PPLC asked shippers to sign non-disclosure agreements to protect the confidentiality of PPLC's plans, and many did. Numerous shippers expressed interest in PPLC's project during the open season process. PPLC intended to obtain contractual commitments from interested shippers to move specific volumes of oil. PPLC's intention, consistent with industry practice, was to use the contractual commitments to obtain financing to complete the infrastructure changes associated with reversing the flow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In late 2008, the financial crisis that caused the Great Recession crippled financial markets and caused worldwide economic activity to decline.

In 2009, without having obtained all of the necessary permits, PPLC suspended further permitting on the project. During the 2008-2009 process, no permitting authority denied PPLC any of the permits it sought. PPLC did not seek all the permits that would have been required, and did not receive approval for a pump station it proposed in Dunham, Quebec. Of the thirteen permits PPLC initially sought, relevant authorities granted ten and PPLC voluntarily ceased its pursuit of the other three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The 2012-2013 Proposed Flow Reversal Project\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   When economic conditions improved in 2012 and 2013, as PPLC determined that its prior forecasts had proved accurate concerning the increase in Canadian oil production, PPLC once again considered reversing the flow of oil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Design Differences\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In 2011 and 2012, PPLC analyzed and considered several different design and engineering characteristics of a potential project to reverse the flow of either the eighteen-inch or the twenty-four-inch pipeline and to load crude oil onto marine tank vessels in the City's Harbor. PPLC considered modifying its earlier proposal to a single stream light line of crude oil, instead of a design capable of carrying both heavy and light crude oil. It considered ways to obviate the Dunham, Quebec pump station for which PPLC never obtained approval from Canadian regulatory authorities. PPLC considered using a vapor recovery unit (VRU) to capture hydrocarbon vapors during the loading process, which would use different technology and have less intrusive dimensions than the two 70-foot-tall John Zink VDUs proposed in 2009. PPLC also considered omitting the Pier 2 upgrades that would have accommodated smaller vessels such as barges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Marketing the 2012-2013 Proposed Project\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In 2011-2012, PPLC again began soliciting interest and held discussions with numerous potential crude oil shippers, including Irving, Valero, Shell, Keyera, Repsol, Suncor, Global, Imperial Oil, to attempt to obtain contractual volume commitments on a reversed eighteen-inch or twenty-four-inch pipeline. PPLC's marketing efforts came on the heels of a potential announcement\n   by Enbridge to reverse its Line 9 to carry oil from west to east from Sarnia to Montreal. During this time, PPLC was under less pressure to reverse the flow of its pipeline system because it still was doing enough northbound business so that flow reversal had not become urgent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In 2013, PPLC again solicited interest from potential crude oil shippers for committed volumes of crude oil to be carried southward on the eighteen-inch or twenty-four-inch pipeline. In 2013, PPLC received positive indications of interest from potential shippers, many of whom signed non-disclosure agreements. In April of 2013, PPLC sought to secure shareholder endorsement for PPLC to seek expressions of interest from potential shippers concurrent with the TransCanada PipeLines Limited's Energy East Open Season then underway. PPLC's Board of Directors was not interested in pursuing a formal Open Season at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   For a variety of reasons, including insufficient market interest, PPLC did not move forward with the reversal project. Sometime after April 2013 and before June 17, 2013, PPLC postponed seeking commercial support for any project to load crude oil in the City. It considered writing off part or all of the $6.5 million it had already spent planning and permitting the 2008 project. The only portion of PPLC's investment it decided to write off concerned approximately $150,000 related to PPLC's work on the Dunham, Quebec pump station that did not result in approval. PPLC monitored the progress of the Enbridge Line 9 reversal project, which did not begin operating until December 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Current Market Conditions and the Future of the Pipeline\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   If PPLC cannot reverse the flow of either the eighteen or the twenty-four-inch line, or both, it likely cannot survive as a business. The recent increase in the production of Alberta oil sands has reduced the need for Canadian oil refiners to import crude oil. PPLC's eighteen-inch line has been completely idle since 2011 as a result of insufficient demand for northbound shipping. Although PPLC's twenty-four-inch line remains active, a trickle flows through it. With the exception of one shipment PPLC arranged to perform an inspection required by regulation, there have been no northbound shipments since August 4, 2017. As of July 2016, PPLC had only ten of its twenty-three crude oil storage tanks in service, and it has taken more out of service since then. There is no prospect of PPLC receiving significant shipments of oil in the future, thanks to the glut of production in western Canada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   PPLC's plan to reverse the flow of its pipeline faces some economic obstacles. Financing will depend on commitments from shippers, which in turn depend on certain key market conditions. There must be sufficient volumes of oil capable of arriving at the Montreal end of PPLC's pipelines for transport to South Portland, and market prices must support southbound shipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Crude Supply in Montreal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Canada is currently in the midst of expanding and repurposing its pipeline infrastructure to transport crude oil from western Canada to other markets. Repurposing existing pipeline is increasingly more logical and valuable as an alternative to new pipeline construction, given the substantial time and costs associated with new pipeline construction. In December of 2015, Enbridge completed a project to reverse the flow of crude oil in its Line 9 from Sarnia to Montreal. See\n   <em>\n    Defs.' Ex.\n   </em>\n   185. The reversed Line 9 has a nameplate capacity to carry a maximum 300,000 b/d of crude oil from west to east. By Canadian law, five percent, or 25,000 b/d of that capacity must remain uncommitted to serve the spot market. That spot market capacity could not be committed for southbound shipment on PPLC's pipeline. Enbridge Line 9 is the only pipeline currently constructed that could feed PPLC's pipeline reversal project. Line 9 currently carries a mix of U.S. sourced and Canadian crude oil.\n   <em>\n    Trial Tr.\n   </em>\n   183:7-193:21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Historically, PPLC delivered crude oil to refineries in Montreal. These Montreal refineries include the 137,000 b/d capacity Suncor Refinery in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and the 265,000 b/d capacity Valero Jean Gaulin Refinery in Levis, Quebec, Canada. The Suncor Refinery and Valero Jean Gaulin Refinery have executed binding Transportation Shipping Agreements with \"take or pay commitments\" for roughly 220,000 b/d.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The actual flows\n   through Line 9B confirm these estimates: on average over the last twenty-eight months, roughly 219,000 b/d flowed through Line 9 to Montreal.\n   <em>\n    Pls.' Ex.\n   </em>\n   4. Under the \"take or pay\" commitments, if the Suncor Refinery or Valero Jean Gaulin Refinery does not take delivery of its committed share from Line 9B, it still must pay the pipeline tariff regardless of actual use. After subtracting 220,000 b/d that are currently committed to other contracts and the 25,000 b/d that must remain uncommitted by Canadian law, this leaves 55,000 b/d presently available from Line 9's nameplate capacity for PPLC to enter into take or pay commitments with shippers for a reversal project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   On the one hand, Line 9's nameplate capacity may overestimate the real availability of crude oil capable of arriving in Montreal via pipeline. Due to maintenance and other down time, most oil industry infrastructure does not operate at maximum capacity the whole year. A typical maximum sustainable volume rate is ninety percent of nameplate capacity.\n   <em>\n    Trial Tr.\n   </em>\n   396:25-397:15;\n   <em>\n    Defs.' Ex.\n   </em>\n   223B. While PPLC contemplated larger volumes of oil for its previous reversal projects, it intends to serve even this limited flow because it has no alternative but to shut down its business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   On the other hand, there is roughly 60,000 b/d of additional available capacity to transport crude oil from Western Canada by rail to Montreal for southbound shipment on PPLC's pipelines. While the present cost of that rail transportation is too high to compete with marine transportation of crude from alternate sources such as the North Sea or West Africa, it may be economical in the future. Pipelines are also capable of expanding their nameplate capacities by transporting less viscous oil, modifying their pumping equipment, or using additives to boost flow rates. Similarly, PPLC hoped TransCanada's Energy East pipeline could feed a reversal project, and while it could be revived in the future, that project is currently cancelled. The City's expert testified that new pipeline projects are expected to come online in Western Canada in the next few years that will likely divert all new production in Western Canada before it could reach Line 9 and a reversed PPLC pipeline. But as Energy's East's cancellation indicates, the expected timelines or even the ultimate success of those projects is not assured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   PPLC is willing to place a bet with its infrastructure to have the ability to ship southward whatever volumes of crude oil become available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Transport Costs and Price Differentials\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The price differential between the Syncrude shipped through the pipeline and a substitute crude, such as Brent, must also be wide enough to cover the transportation costs, or purchasers will choose an alternate supply. The transport costs from Western Canada through the PMPL system to refineries in North America and Europe is roughly $12 per barrel.\n   <em>\n    Defs.' Ex.\n   </em>\n   223F. PPLC's previous reversal efforts in 2008 and 2012 closely correlate to periods of particularly favorable price conditions.\n   <em>\n    See Defs.' Ex.\n   </em>\n   197. The 2012 average price spread between Brent and Syncrude was sufficient to cover the transport costs, but the average price spread declined in the years after 2012.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The 2018 year-to-date average spread is roughly $7 per barrel, but the price over the last few months has been over $12 per barrel, which would be sufficient to support a reversal project if those price conditions hold.\n   <em>\n    Trial Tr.\n   </em>\n   at 421.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The Ordinance stands as an obstacle to PPLC's efforts to obtain permits and credibly market its services to transport crude oil from north to south. Without the impediment\n   of the Ordinance, PPLC would take immediate steps to implement its desired flow reversal. While it may not be a sure bet that global prices will sustainably support the transportation costs of southbound pipeline shipping soon, PPLC intends to place that bet and reverse its pipeline infrastructure. Oil prices are volatile, and there is a substantial likelihood that prices will break in PPLC's favor so that it will succeed in reversing the flow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    L. Unknown Details Regarding a New Reversal Project\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   A future project to reverse the flow of the eighteen-inch or the twenty-four-inch pipeline would likely be different from the 2008-2009 proposal. A future project to load crude oil in the City would not necessarily use PPLC's eighteen-inch pipeline, as PPLC proposed in 2008-2009; it could use the twenty-four-inch pipeline or both pipelines. PPLC continues to rely on the specific plans it developed in 2008-2009 as the starting point for how it would implement any future flow reversal project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   If PPLC is legally allowed to pursue a flow reversal project, it will update its previous plans in light of new technology and customer needs. A future project to load crude oil in the City may not use the \"John Zink\" brand VDUs that were planned and permitted by Maine DEP in 2009. A future project would reevaluate the best technology for emissions control from crude oil loading, which has advanced since 2009. The 2009 proposal contemplated simultaneous northbound and southbound operations, and thus required higher flow rates to move ships in and out of Pier 2 relatively quickly. PPLC now expects a reversal project would only involve southbound flow, allowing it to reduce the planned loading rates by as much as half. By reducing loading rates, less vapor would be expelled per unit of time and smaller VDUs may be sufficient. PPLC would also consider using VRUs, rather than VDUs. If PPLC were to construct a project to load crude oil in the City, it would be willing to move any type of crude, light or heavy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Since 2013, other than pursuing this lawsuit, PPLC has not taken any formal steps to activate its plan to reverse one or both pipelines, such as analyzing the market demand for oil or the regulatory or economic feasibility. If PPLC were to construct a project to load crude oil in the City, it would seek new permits from the necessary state and local authorities in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Canada. PPLC expects that it will not require a pump station in Dunham, Quebec as originally planned in 2009. If PPLC is permitted to pursue a flow reversal project, it will plan the infrastructure changes after determining the type of crude oil its customers would like to move as well as the speed and capacity the company seeks to achieve on its lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    M. Air Emissions and Health Effects\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   PPLC's existing Part 70 Air Emissions License regulates emissions from PPLC's twenty-three oil storage tanks and related boilers and emergency generators and classifies it as a major stationary source of emissions.\n   <em>\n    Defs.' Ex.\n   </em>\n   30. Under its existing Part 70 Air Emissions License, Maine DEP authorizes PPLC to emit 1.8 tons per year (\"tpy\") of Sulfur Dioxide (SO\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   ), 5.1 tpy of Nitrogen Oxides (NO\n   <sub>\n    x\n   </sub>\n   ), and 220 tpy of VOCs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   PPLC's oil storage tanks utilize a floating roof design, but some vapors can still escape, termed \"fugitive emissions.\" VOCs in crude oil contain benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and other contaminants classified by the Environmental Protection Agency as \"Hazardous Air Pollutants\" (HAPs). A reversal project would create increased VOCs and HAPs fugitive\n   emissions from renewed usage of the Main Tank Farm and Waterfront Tanks over the level of emissions in recent years,\n   <em>\n    Trial Tr.\n   </em>\n   770:9-17, but emissions would not necessarily be higher than the historic levels when the tanks were more heavily utilized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   PPLC's unloading operations do not require VDUs. Unloading crude oil into pipelines does not require releasing air that has become laden with hydrocarbon vapors. Loading crude oil onto ships requires releasing air laden with hydrocarbons because the liquid crude oil displaces the air from inside the ship's holds.

Also, the vendors with whom PPLC contracts for support services would lose a source of revenue. In addition, the value of PPLC's pipeline assets and property would decrease significantly from the $120 million amount assigned to those assets and property by government taxation authorities along the pipeline route. South Portland alone assigns a value of $44.7 million to the pipeline assets and property currently within the City and, again, this valuation will be reduced significantly if PPLC can no longer transport crude oil. In the 2015 tax year, PPLC paid property taxes amounting to $2 million to twenty-seven different municipalities located along the pipeline route between South Portland and the Canadian border, with South Portland receiving nearly $750,000. In 2010, the last year PPLC's eighteen-inch line was in active service, the company paid approximately $7.1 million to the federal government, $1.4 million to Maine, $209,000 to New Hampshire, and $273,000 to Vermont. PPLC has paid over $70 million to the Maine oil conveyance fund supporting government clean-up and response capabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The American Waterways Operators\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   AWO is a trade organization that represents members across the United States, which operate thousands of vessels licensed by the United States Coast Guard to engage in coastwise, i.e., domestic, trade. Every year, AWO members and others in the industry carry more than 800 million tons of cargo every year across U.S. waterways, including 280 million tons of crude oil, and employ more than 50,000 people.\n   <em>\n    Trial Tr.\n   </em>\n   82:3-84:13. AWO represents two-thirds of the industry. One of AWO's chief purposes is, and historically has been, to advocate for uniform federal control over maritime activity, as such uniformity allows AWO's members to avoid the confusion, inefficiency, decreased safety and increased costs associated with multiple and differing layers of regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Portland Tugboat LLC (Portland Tugboat) is an AWO member that currently operates four tugboats in the Harbor. Portland Tugboat's operations in the Harbor consist chiefly of assisting larger vessels arriving from another port and guiding them into their final docket spaces in the Harbor, i.e., \"ship assist\" services. Historically, Portland Tugboat has received a significant portion of its revenue from providing ship assist services to tanker vessels docking at PPLC's Pier 2 to have their cargos of crude oil unloaded by PPLC into PPLC's oil pipeline infrastructure. Up until 2008, Portland Tugboat assisted approximately seventeen ships per month with docking at Pier 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   As PPLC has received fewer and fewer shipments of oil over the past several years, Portland Tugboat has had fewer and fewer opportunities to provide arriving tankers with ship assist services, with a corresponding loss of revenue and profitability for Portland Tugboat. This financial result is also reflected on the financial statements of its sole manager and member, McAllister Towing and Transportation Co., Inc. (McAllister). Unless PPLC is able\n   to reverse the flow of its pipeline, and thereby attract empty ships seeking to be loaded with crude oil, Portland Tugboat may permanently lose all of the business it previously received from assisting ships seeking to dock at PPLC's Pier 2. If PPLC's operations do not materially change, Portland Tugboat will be forced to downsize its operations in the Harbor by reducing the number of tugboats it has operating in the Harbor from four to three. Due to lack of business in the Harbor, predominantly as a result of PPLC's declining business, Portland Tugboat has already reduced its force of full-time maritime employees from sixteen to eight. If PPLC's operations do not materially change, Portland Tugboat may be forced to further reduce the number of full-time maritime employees servicing customers in the Harbor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   In 2008, when PPLC's business operated at higher levels than it currently is, McAllister commissioned the design and construction of a very specialized tugboat, the\n   <em>\n    Andrew McAllister\n   </em>\n   , for Portland Tugboat to better serve tankers docking at PPLC's Pier 2. The\n   <em>\n    Andrew McAllister\n   </em>\n   arrived in 2008 at a cost of approximately $10 million. The\n   <em>\n    Andrew McAllister\n   </em>\n   was designed to meet the requirements of servicing ships transporting crude oil for PPLC and to respond to oil fires on ships or on the water. The\n   <em>\n    Andrew McAllister\n   </em>\n   is an escort tugboat equipped with 6,000 horsepower engines and certified capable of generating eighty-three tons of bollard pull, which is the specification needed to service tankers transporting crude oil for PPLC. It is the most powerful tugboat on the Eastern Seaboard north of Boston.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Andrew McAllister\n   </em>\n   was also designed to have a specialized 11,000 gallon-per-minute fire-fighting system, which is equivalent to three municipal fire trucks, and is capable of creating foam to put out oil fires on water. There are very few boats on the Eastern Seaboard with similar firefighting capabilities, and the\n   <em>\n    Andrew McAllister\n   </em>\n   is the only one operating north of Boston. As a result of its firefighting capabilities, Portland Tugboat is called upon by the cities of Portland and South Portland to use the\n   <em>\n    Andrew McAllister\n   </em>\n   to provide backup firefighting assistance when needed in the Harbor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Given the decrease in PPLC's business, the\n   <em>\n    Andrew McAllister's\n   </em>\n   highest and best use is not being realized. It is not being used to its full capacity in the Harbor and the revenue it has been generating from delivering crude oil to PPLC is insufficient to offset the costs of operating it there. The best way for the\n   <em>\n    Andrew McAllister\n   </em>\n   to be employed is if it is used in the Harbor to service tankers delivering crude oil to PPLC or being loaded with crude oil by PPLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Andrew McAllister\n   </em>\n   may be removed from the Harbor and redeployed elsewhere. Several years ago, the\n   <em>\n    Andrew McAllister\n   </em>\n   prevented a major marine casualty in the Harbor while it was escorting a tanker to a non-PPLC location in the Harbor that required the tanker to pass under the Casco Bay Bridge. While the\n   <em>\n    Andrew McAllister\n   </em>\n   was escorting the tanker, the Casco Bay Bridge failed to open and the tanker was unable, on its own power, to change course and prevent a collision with the Casco Bay Bridge. The\n   <em>\n    Andrew McAllister\n   </em>\n   was able to maneuver the tanker to avoid a collision with the Casco Bay Bridge and to avoid it running aground. If the\n   <em>\n    Andrew McAllister\n   </em>\n   had not been present, a major marine casualty may have occurred from the tanker colliding with the bridge or running aground. Had the tanker collided with the bridge or run aground, it could have resulted in severe damage to the bridge or to the tanker, an oil spill, an\n   onboard fire, or damage to assets on shore from the tanker running aground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   In addition to Portland Tugboat, McAllister owns and operates tugboat companies in twelve locations along the eastern seaboard, from Portland, Maine to San Juan, Puerto Rico, including in New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. A significant portion of the revenue generated by AWO members, including McAllister, arises out of towing tank barges loaded with crude oil. This service consists of tugboats pulling or pushing a tank barge that has been filled with crude oil from an oil terminal to another location, such as an oil refinery. Pier 2, where PPLC receives marine vessels, is not presently designed to accommodate tank barges. It only can receive Aframax, Suezmax, and Panamax self-propelled tank vessels. For Pier 2 to be able to berth tank barges, PPLC would be required to modify Pier 2. In 2011, PPLC gave strategic consideration to developing a project while omitting the upgrades to Pier 2 that would enable to it handle small tankers and barges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   If PPLC successfully reversed the flow of its pipeline so it can load crude oil onto vessels in the Harbor and also chose to modify Pier 2 to accommodate tank barges, McAllister would have the opportunity to tow tank barges from South Portland to other locations, such as oil refineries located in Philadelphia, Houston, and the New York/New Jersey area. AWO members like McAllister have profitably provided this service elsewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

For purposes of this prong of the dormant Commerce Clause, the Court sees little difference between the Ordinance and other zoning prohibitions. Conduct is not controlled by the Ordinance if it occurs outside the state of Maine, outside the boundaries of the City, or outside South Portland's Shipyard, Commercial, and Industrial districts. While it is likely true that PPLC's ability to obtain financing for a reversal project is contingent on its ability to load oil at the Harbor, and that means the effect of the Ordinance is to influence the functions of its infrastructure outside the City, that does not mean the Ordinance regulates extraterritorially. Every local prohibition on particular goods or services has the effect of preventing distant merchants from employing their capital and labor to sell those goods or services within the boundaries of the restrictive locality, and local merchants with distant contacts from doing the same. In the modern age of highly interconnected commerce, there would be virtually no room for local historic police powers if this sort of extraterritorial effect were enough to invalidate an ordinance under the dormant Commerce Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Viewed in another way, PPLC would not be subject to inconsistent obligations if other localities passed similar statutes. If other municipalities enacted similar ordinances, there would simply be a smaller list of potential sites for loading crude oil. That situation would be indistinguishable from the current state of affairs, where some coastal localities devote their waterfronts to uses they deem inconsistent with petroleum handling, forcing companies to pursue those uses in other localities where the local government permits them.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PORTLAND, ME., CODE OF ORDINANCES \u00a7\u00a7 14-231, 14-233(h), 14-246, 14-249(i) (2018), available at https://www.portlandmaine.gov/Document Center/View/1080/Chapter-14-Land-Use---Revised-7182018,\n   (prohibiting petroleum refining as well as petroleum storage yards and tank farms); CAPE ELIZABETH, ME., CODE OF ORDINANCES \u00a7 19-6-11-D, (2017) available at https://www.capeelizabeth.com/government/rules_regs/ordinances/zoning/zoning.pdf, (prohibiting petroleum storage and sales). \"The most apparent effect of similar [ordinances] being passed in other [localities] would be a loss in profits for [petroleum companies]. It does not appear ... that [ordinances] similar to the [Clear Skies Ordinance], if enacted, would result in [petroleum companies] having inconsistent obligations to [localities] ....\"\n   <em>\n    PhRMA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11094820\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/249/66/#p79\">\n    249 F.3d at 82-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ordinance's indirect economic effects on out-of-state transactions is a natural implication of cross-border projects and local government control, not an indication of unconstitutional extraterritorial regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   PPLC's arguments about extraterritorial purpose, as opposed to effect, does not alter this conclusion. There is evidence that some of the voting public and, more importantly, some of the City Counselors actively considered that the impact from the Ordinance would reach beyond the borders of South Portland. For example, during consideration of the WPO, one member of the public said the citizen's initiative would \"not only be helping to protect South Portland and Maine, but all the communities that this pipeline runs through or near in the environment of northern New England.\"\n   <em>\n    Pls.' Ex.\n   </em>\n   104 at 1:38:50-1:39:22. Another commenter expressed concern about continued reliance on fossil fuels causing global climate change.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11094820\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/249/66/#p79\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   1:58:00-2:00:31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   But the vast majority of the evidence regarding WPO support focused on the impacts within South Portland. PPLC has not shown that these isolated statements of a few members of the public were so important as to motivate the majority of the City Council when it later considered the Ordinance. The strongest evidence of extraterritorial purpose came from Councilor Smith, who admitted that \"I really care about the indigenous people of Alberta\" and South Portland's neighboring towns and said, \"I know that what I see on paper is something that will protect the health and safety of our residents and potentially the health and safety of other global residents.\"\n   <em>\n    Pls.' Ex.\n   </em>\n   159 3:18:02-3:32:04. But even with that strongest indication of extraterritorial motive, Councilor Smith also commented on her perception of the beneficial impact of the WPO on South Portland itself. As with the public pressure on the City Council, the Court is not convinced that isolated comments about a greater global purpose of the WPO from City Counselors and others establish that extraterritorial impact was the primary purpose of the Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Even if there were stronger indications of extraterritorial purpose, it would be of little assistance to PPLC. Unlike the discrimination prong of the dormant Commerce Clause, where improper purpose matters, \"[t]he 'critical inquiry' here is 'whether the practical effect of the regulation is to control conduct beyond the boundaries of the State.' \"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Foreign Trade Council v.

The Court concludes that, while there was an ancillary background motive on the part of some Councilors and citizens, the primary purpose of the Ordinance was not to create impacts beyond the boundaries of South Portland or to prevent oil sands extraction in other jurisdictions, and even if that were the primary purpose, the focus of this inquiry on the effects of the Ordinance obviates further discussion.\n   <em>\n    But see infra\n   </em>\n   Part V-B (legislative purpose is important for the discrimination prong).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   \"Because the regulation only applies to in-[city] activities, there is no extraterritorial reach and the [Ordinance] is not per se invalid under the Commerce Clause.\"\n   <em>\n    PhRMA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11094820\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/249/66/#p79\">\n    249 F.3d at 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The second entity most directly affected by the Ordinance is another local Maine corporation, Portland Tugboat. The Ordinance cannot be said to favor in-state commercial interests at the expense of out-of-state competitors when the entities most directly harmed by the practical effects of the Ordinance are in-state, local businesses.

Unlike the state statutes in\n   <em>\n    Kraft\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Natsios\n   </em>\n   , South Portland's Ordinance does not create any distinction or difference between competitors from different countries or states, which means it creates no relative difference in treatment that implicates the dormant Commerce Clause. The Ordinance does not target commerce with Canada, and the prohibition applies equally to crude oil flowing through Line 9 into PPLC's Montreal terminus from North Dakota as it does to crude oil from Alberta.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   The Court is skeptical of PPLC's argument that the Ordinance discriminates against Canadian commerce because PPLC believes it has the practical effect of completely blocking flows of crude oil from Canada. While PPLC is a Maine corporation, it is true that the pipelines are connected with Canadian infrastructure and some of the crude oil that would be shipped southward would originate in Western Canada. But there are at least two major flaws in this argument. First, the Ordinance has no impact on several major sources of Canadian oil entering South Portland. A major source of PPLC's northbound crude shipments was the Hibernia oil field off the southeast coast of Newfoundland, in Eastern Canada, which the Ordinance does nothing to inhibit.\n   <em>\n    Trial Tr.\n   </em>\n   181:14-20. While market forces have reduced those flows in recent years, there is no indication in the record that the City has ever objected to that Canadian commerce. Similarly, refined oil products from Canada still make their way to South Portland today, which the Ordinance also does not block.\n   <em>\n    See Pls.' Ex.\n   </em>\n   106 at 2:16:30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Second, PPLC's argument stretches the dormant Commerce Clause too far. Maine is the only state that shares a border with only one other state, and Maine also shares a border with Canada. It may often be true, especially in small, rural, and relatively geographically isolated states like Maine, that certain industries or markets are comprised of a small number of firms or even a single firm. Just because commerce in a market originates in another state or country does not mean that otherwise evenhanded regulations or prohibitions on that market automatically have the \"practical effect\" of discriminating against interstate or foreign commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   The logical implication of PPLC's argument is that many perfectly ordinary health and welfare regulations would violate the dormant Commerce Clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a modern globalized economy, if this were enough to trigger strict scrutiny for local restrictions that are otherwise agnostic as to the state or country of origin, there would be scant room remaining for state and local police powers. On the contrary, courts have carefully resisted the impulse to conflate neutral regulations that harm interstate firms with the sort of economic protectionism that the dormant Commerce\n   Clause forbids.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Exxon Corp. v.

The comments that indicate an economic protectionist purpose are few and far between.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   PPLC emphasizes the bulk of citizen and official comments focusing on the desire to prevent PPLC from transporting crude oil derived from tar sands through the Harbor. According to PPLC's theory of the case, the primary purpose of the Ordinance was to discriminate against foreign commerce because it was intended to block PPLC's reversal project, which seeks to transport crude oil from Canada to South Portland. But the Court does not view the City's claims about air quality, water quality, aesthetics, and economic redevelopment as mutually exclusive goals. What the parties present as competing goals are easily reconcilable: the City Council enacted an ordinance that would block a tar sands project like the one PPLC proposed because it had concerns about the air quality, water quality, aesthetics, and redevelopment risks of crude oil loading in general, and the transporting and coastal loading of crude oil derived from tar sands in particular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Even though the Court agrees with PPLC that the City sought to alleviate its concerns and those of the public by enacting an ordinance that would prohibit PPLC from undertaking its reversal project, that does not imply that the Ordinance's primary purpose was discriminatory. The City feared the local risks of handling crude oil derived from tar sands in South Portland and at the Harbor, but it does not follow that the City was primarily concerned with the fact that the tar sands crude oil originated outside South Portland and Maine. The Court is left with the impression that the City Council and the public supporters would have been equally motivated to enact the Ordinance if the tar sands crude oil originated in Vermont, New Hampshire, Bethel, Westbrook, or even western portions of South Portland. The evidence is more consistent with a primary concern about the local impacts of crude oil loading in general and the transport and loading of tar sands products more specifically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   In other words, PPLC has not explained why, even assuming the true purpose of the Ordinance is what PPLC says it is-a disguised attempt to ban the handling of tar sands derived crude oil, not other types of crude oil-that undisguised motive would constitute discrimination offending the dormant Commerce Clause.

The Supreme Court acknowledged New Jersey's legitimate financial and environmental goals and said that it \"may pursue those ends by slowing the flow of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   waste into the State's remaining landfills, even though interstate commerce may incidentally be affected.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183310\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/617/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183310\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/617/\">\n    at 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183310\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/617/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). The\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia\n   </em>\n   Court distinguished a long line of cases upholding quarantine laws which block the flow of commerce at the state's border because \"[t]hose laws ... did not discriminate against interstate commerce as such, but simply prevented traffic in noxious articles, whatever their origin.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183310\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/617/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183310\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/617/\">\n    at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183310\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/617/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Applying\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia\n   </em>\n   , even if the City's true purpose were to enact a disguised but practically effective tar sands ban, there is evidence that the City considered tar sands to be a dangerous article with greater health and environmental risks than other types of crude oils and intended to alleviate the risks from transporting and loading tar sands crude oil \"whatever [its] origin.\" That purpose is not equivalent to the economic favoritism that the dormant Commerce Clause prohibits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   PPLC would have the Court draw the inference that the purpose of the Ordinance was discriminatory because it was designed to create an \"asymmetry\" between the direction of flow, or between the ability of shippers to import crude oil to South Portland for northbound flow, and the ability of shippers to export crude oil after southbound flow. But under historic northbound flow operations, domestic and foreign sourced crude oil was imported to South Portland and immediately exported. Under PPLC's proposed southbound flow operations, domestic and foreign sourced crude oil would be imported to South Portland and immediately exported. Technically, the Ordinance does not distinguish between importation and exportation. It only distinguishes between certain methods of transportation within the borders of South Portland. Unlike the cases where Courts have found dormant Commerce Clause violations, the alternative modes of operations here are meaningfully different from one another.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183310\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/617/\">\n    437 U.S. at 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183310\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/617/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (The dormant Commerce Clause prohibits disparate treatment of foreign and local products \"unless there is some reason, apart from their origin, to treat them differently\"). Crude oil unloading at the Eastern Waterfront does not expel air that is saturated with hydrocarbon vapors, so it does not contribute to local air pollution at the Harbor and there is no need to construct vapor control devices. But crude oil loading at the Harbor does create those local harms and does require those structures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   PPLC's arguments regarding discriminatory purpose are also undermined by the fact that a major source of northbound crude oil has been from Eastern Canada, which the Ordinance does not obstruct. Similarly, refined oil products from Canada are still transported to South Portland today, which the Ordinance also does nothing to block. These facts bolster the Court's finding that PPLC has not shown that the Ordinance favors or was primarily intended to favor local commerce or to discriminate against interstate or Canadian commerce. Canada would be a major source of crude oil under southbound flow conditions, but Canada has always been a\n   source of crude oil flows under historic northbound flow conditions as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   Finally, the Ordinance functions in much the same way as if the City had simply removed pipeline facilities or crude oil handling facilities from the list of approved activities while grandfathering in the existing facilities and uses. That approach would permit PPLC to continue its current business when market conditions support northbound flow, but would prevent it from installing the new facilities and structures it would need in order to alter or expand its business activities. The DOC explicitly recommended this change, and some council members themselves made the same comparison.\n   <em>\n    See e.g. Pls.'

There is little question that such a straightforward zoning change, while narrowly grandfathering an existing business model, would be permissible under the dormant Commerce Clause, because there is no indication that it was intended to benefit local businesses over their out-of-state competitors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rullan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9008274\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/405/50/#p55\">\n    405 F.3d at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Prohibitions and grandfathering clauses can indicate prohibited purpose when they burden out-of-state competitors and allow in-state competitors to persist) (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pac.

Despite this, the Court agrees with PPLC that the Ordinance creates meaningful burdens on interstate and foreign commerce. Without the Ordinance, there is a substantial likelihood that PPLC would complete its reversal project and begin shipping some quantity of crude oil southbound through its pipelines to markets in the Eastern U.S. and Europe. Financial losses to shareholders and workers in the relevant industries will be significant-for example, AWO receives roughly $100,000 per docking-and the reduced flows will impact others in the supply chain. While the Ordinance will likely have little impact on global oil prices, the dormant Commerce Clause is not limited to burdens of that scale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   It is unrealistic for the City to argue that the Ordinance does not actually block PPLC's pipeline reversal project because PPLC could theoretically and legally move crude oil out of South Portland via a new rail interconnection on PanAm's existing right of way. While that alternative would solve some of the environmental concerns about tar sands oil near the South Portland waterfront, it would not address the concerns about air pollution from increased utilization of the Main Tank Farm or emissions from the VDUs, since loading crude oil onto rail cars expels the same volumes of air laden with hydrocarbon vapors. Although the Court does not pretend to grasp all of the details of the logistics of crude oil transfers, one would expect that if anything, there would be a greater risk of leaks when transferring the same volume of crude oil to hundreds or thousands of rail cars, as compared with a single connection to a marine tanker. Even though consistency is not always a political virtue, there is no evidence that either the City Council or the South Portland residents who favored the Ordinance would support the transfer of large volumes of oil onto railcars in the Rigby Yard. Even if\n   PPLC could accomplish the City's proposed rail project, which the Court finds implausible, the City's own expert testified about the cost disadvantage in most circumstances from transporting crude oil via rail instead of marine tankers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City's railcar argument is a sidetrack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   The Court agrees with the City, however, that the Ordinance creates ample and weighty local benefits. The record demonstrates that the City Council and an engaged and sizable portion of South Portland's residents had sincere concerns about (1) increased air emissions-related public health risk resulting from the proposed VDUs, (2) increased air emissions-related public health risk resulting from renewed utilization of the Main Tank Farm adjacent to sensitive locations, such as schools, (3) increased odors resulting from renewed utilization of the Main Tank Farm at adjacent sensitive locations like schools, (4) aesthetic and noise impacts at recreational locations like Bug Light Park from the VDUs and renewed tanker traffic, (5) reduced likelihood of redevelopment opportunities for vacant and underutilized properties from renewed heavy industrial activity, and (6) increased risk to the local land and coastal environment and elevated public health risks from pipeline accidents or spills of crude oil derived from tar sands.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   PPLC argues that the City attempted to disguise its true motives by incorporating lengthy legislative findings and adopting an air quality-related moniker. Those accusations are not without foundation. There is evidence that the City overemphasized or played up its air quality motives and sought to downplay the spill-related concerns. The Court does not agree, however, that the purported local air quality, aesthetics, and redevelopment benefits were pretextual, illegitimate, or illusory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   The public comments and official legislative history demonstrate that air quality, aesthetics, and waterfront redevelopment goals pervaded the public and official considerations during the WPO, the Moratorium, the DOC proceedings, and the Ordinance vote. They were not merely tacked-on justifications after savvy attorneys instructed the City Council to \"bulletproof\" the Ordinance, as PPLC insists. For example, there is a WPO advocacy flyer that\n   PPLC cites for its claim that the City sought to disfavor \"out-of-state big oil companies\" predates the Moratorium and DOC meetings.\n   <em>\n    Pls.' Ex.\n   </em>\n   11. Yet that WPO campaign flyer also focuses heavily on air quality and aesthetics. The flyer features a large photo of PPLC's DEP air emissions permit for the project and states that PPLC will be allowed to \"release\n   <em>\n    tons\n   </em>\n   of additional toxic air pollution each year.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. It also features large aerial photographs of the main tank farm with a bold caption claiming, \"\n   <strong>\n    With a tar sands project\n   </strong>\n   , these tanks could release\n   <strong>\n    triple the amount of toxic air pollution (220 tons/year!)\n   </strong>\n   right next to where our children learn and play. Compared to regular oil, tar sands contains more toxic chemicals, including\n   <strong>\n    benzene which causes cancer and triggers asthma\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The flyer contains a photo rendering depicting the two proposed VDUs with a bold caption describing the size of the structures-\"\n   <strong>\n    two proposed 70-foot-tall smokestacks next to Bug Light Park\n   </strong>\n   \"-and encouraging voters to help \"stop this project before our air is polluted and Casco Bay is put at risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   The quotes in the flyer are consistent with the bulk of public comments and the remarks of the City Council when it considered the WPO, which indicates that air quality and aesthetic impacts from PPLC's reversal proposal were legitimate concerns before the WPO votes. Those concerns are also consistent with much of the record of public pressure and official comments during the Moratorium and DOC process. While air quality was increasingly emphasized over time, it not pretextual. It was an evident and sincere goal from the beginning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   The City's public health expert, Dr. Helen Suh, testified about the health risks of VOC and HAP emissions from the Main Tank Farm and SO\n   <sub>\n    x\n   </sub>\n   and NO\n   <sub>\n    x\n   </sub>\n   emissions from the proposed VDUs. The specifics of her quantitative estimations of the marginal risks from the VDUs were somewhat undermined by PPLC's witnesses' effective explanations regarding the highly conservative assumptions and overestimations of the modeling employed by another of the City's experts, Dr. Stephen Zemba, upon which Dr. Suh relied. The actual pollutant concentrations would almost certainly be substantially lower than Dr. Zemba's worst-case model, especially in light of new emissions control technology and lower flow rates for a future project compared to the 2008-2009 proposal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the remainder of Dr. Suh's testimony regarding the public health benefits of reducing emissions from loading operations and renewed tank farm use, even when a locality is in compliance with federal and state air quality standards, was unrebutted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   PPLC argues that these benefits are inflated because the Ordinance does not address other sources of local air pollution, including woodstoves and mobile sources, which represent far larger public health\n   risks.\n   <em>\n    See Pls.' Ex.\n   </em>\n   45. This argument is misplaced, however, because the Supreme Court \"has made clear that a legislature need not strike at all evils at the same time or in the same way, and that a legislature may implement its program step by step, adopting regulations that only partially ameliorate a perceived evil and deferring complete elimination of the evil to future regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    Minnesota v.

Poor tailoring can suggest that the asserted purposes are not the true purposes, but the rest of the record establishes that the goal was legitimate and sincere, albeit somewhat overstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   The City had real interests in reducing the visual, auditory, and olfactory externalities of heavy industrial activities within its borders and encouraging recreational and lower-impact development on the waterfront. The City's development interests are not undercut because some of a developer's previous proposals were outlandish. There is an inherently speculative nature to encouraging redevelopment projects, but that does not defeat the City's interest in pursuing them. The evidence showed that the City has demonstrated a pattern of opposition to heavy industrial projects in recent years, indicating that the touted local safety, aesthetic, and redevelopment concerns of the public and City officials were bona fide.\n   <em>\n    See e.g., Trial Tr.\n   </em>\n   641:24-655:6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   PPLC essentially raises the problem of NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) legislation. But the dormant Commerce Clause, and the\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   balancing inquiry in particular, do not and were never intended to solve all governance problems that come with a federal system of distributed local authority.

More importantly, PPLC did not rebut Dr. Suh's testimony that there is no safe level of exposure to many of the air pollutants that would be emitted from renewed use of PPLC's tanks and the proposed VDUs from crude\n   oil loading operations. Neither did PPLC rebut the City's evidence about aesthetic and recreational benefits to deindustrializing the waterfront.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   Regarding the City's spill-related safety concerns, PPLC's frustration is understandable given that the City downplayed those concerns and because there is some reason to doubt the severity of any special risks associated with tar sands oil as compared to other types of crude oil.\n   <em>\n    See e.g. Pls.' Ex.\n   </em>\n   96 (National Academy of Science Report \"Effects of Diluted Bitumen on Crude Oil Transmission Pipelines\" finding no significant increased risk of pipeline corrosion or ruptures from tar sands crude oil). But there is also competing evidence that tar sands transportation and spills create special risks.\n   <em>\n    See e.g. Defs.'

The scarcity of cases addressing these doctrines leaves the matter opaque, but if there is any significant space between the two doctrines, it is a narrow divergence and this case does not fit within it. The Court concludes that national uniformity is not required and the Ordinance does not interfere with the federal government's ability to \"speak with one voice\" in regulating foreign commerce. The Court reaches this conclusion for many of the same reasons the Court concluded the Ordinance was not preempted by federal foreign affairs powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   The Ordinance does not explicitly target any foreign countries. The Anti-Burma law struck down in\n   <em>\n    Natsios\n   </em>\n   made a facial distinction about a particular foreign country, whereas the Ordinance prohibits loading crude oil and new structures for loading crude oil, regardless of either the source or ultimate destination. As such, unlike the Anti-Burma law, the Ordinance has not and is unlikely to provoke international objections and retaliation. On the contrary, a Canadian locality, Dunham, Quebec, imposed local restrictions that would have interfered with PPLC's ability to complete its 2008-2009 proposal, suggesting that\n   other states and Canada expect infrastructure projects like pipelines to satisfy local restrictions and avoid local prohibitions if they wish to operate successfully. The policy of the federal government appears to favor local control over whether pipelines can exist or operate within each locality's borders. The Presidential Permits contemplate local restrictions, and Congress has declined to prevent states and municipalities from exercising siting authority over pipelines and transfer facilities, unlike with nuclear power plants, liquefied natural gas terminals, and electric transmission lines. There does not appear to be any direct conflict between the Ordinance and specific federal laws or consistent policies, so there is no potential for embarrassment to the United States Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   PPLC asserts that there is risk of \"retaliation\" from Canada or other nations if other jurisdictions enacted similar ordinances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Japan Line\n   </em>\n   , 441 U.S. at 451,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780549\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/434/#p449\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing risk of \"retaliation\" from \"asymmetry in the international tax structure\"). The risk the\n   <em>\n    Japan Line\n   </em>\n   Court feared was the inconsistent taxation that would result if a state was permitted to depart from the international norm that property taxes on assets like tankers engaging in commerce on the high seas are taxed in their home jurisdictions, not wherever they travel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780549\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/434/#p449\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780549\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/434/#p449\">\n    at 441-43, 450-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780549\" index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/434/#p449\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike\n   <em>\n    Japan Line\n   </em>\n   , here, PPLC has not made the case that there is a realistic risk of inconsistent or overlapping burdens on the same infrastructure. Even though PPLC has consistently stressed the cumulative impacts of other jurisdictions enacting similar ordinances prohibiting this particular industrial activity, not only is PPLC's fear speculative, this type of regulation is not the type of \"asymmetry\" or lack of uniformity that concerned the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Japan Line.\n   </em>\n   Even if enacted in many other jurisdictions, there will be no inconsistent burdens requiring pipeline operators to choose between complying with one state or local command or another. There is no risk of \"multiple taxation\" arising from different ways of apportioning burdens on the same assets or conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780549\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/434/#p449\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780549\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/434/#p449\">\n    at 449-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780549\" index=\"274\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/434/#p449\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The nightmare scenario PPLC presents is not perplexing disuniformity, it is simply unfavorable uniformity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   Furthermore, PPLC's argument proves too much. Consider the federal rule that PPLC implies is necessary in order to avoid \"impair[ing] federal uniformity in an area where federal uniformity is essential.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780549\" index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/434/#p449\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780549\" index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/434/#p449\">\n    at 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780549\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/434/#p449\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The uniform federal rule apparently must prohibit localities from banning certain petroleum handling activities like crude oil loading within their borders. To put it another way, according to PPLC's argument, the dormant Commerce Clause requires all coastal jurisdictions to allow crude oil loading at their shores. Otherwise, oil markets would shut down if many or all localities chose to prohibit such activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   But the same could be said of nearly any local prohibition on any good, service, or activity pursuant. If every jurisdiction prohibited handling fireworks, interstate and international markets in fireworks would shut down. If PPLC were correct, many of South Portland's longstanding prohibitions on other industrial activities would also be invalid, as would those of other localities, like Portland and Cape Elizabeth. There is no indication in the caselaw that the \"one voice\" test requires\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   coastal jurisdictions to permit all activities that might contribute to a significant international market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   The Ordinance merely has \"foreign resonances\" because it impacts a piece of cross-border infrastructure and a large industry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Container Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6192779\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/159/#p193\">\n    463 U.S. at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6192779\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/159/#p193\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (upholding state tax and distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Japan Line\n   </em>\n   ). Any local\n   regulation or prohibition on a large and important industry will inevitably touch on federal commerce in a broad sense, given the realities of a modern globalized economy. But that does not mean it impermissibly interferes with the government's ability to \"speak with one voice\" when regulating foreign commerce or impairs uniformity in an area where federal uniformity is essential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Final Thoughts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   Supporters and opponents of the Ordinance may view the Court's decision as placing a judicial imprimatur on the wisdom of the Ordinance and a corresponding disapproval of PPLC and its business. It is not. The Court's job is a narrow one. It is not charged with determining whether the city of South Portland should have adopted the Ordinance; only whether it legally could do so. Whether the enactment of a local law that effectively puts a lawful local business out of business is good public policy falls within the aegis of the duly-elected representatives of the citizenry of South Portland.

Bug Light Park necessarily attracts people, including elderly and young people, who are more susceptible to respiratory problems. Here, the City cited the public use of Bug Light Park as a reason to uphold the Ordinance. PPLC could be forgiven for concluding that its good deed in allowing public use of its land at Bug Light Park is being punished.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-290\">\n    Sarah Emerson, the City's expert, initially testified that there were three committed shippers on Line 9 into Montreal, meaning that virtually all of Line 9's 275,000 b/d of available capacity is committed.

PPLC stresses that the City exaggerated its concerns about non-spill-related environmental and health risks because its true fears involved pipeline spills and the safety of pipeline facilities and marine transfer facilities. PPLC insists that the City cannot assert these safety related concerns under the dormant Commerce Clause inquiry because that is an improper purpose under preempting statutes like the Pipeline Safety Act, 49 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7 60101\n    <em>\n     et seq.\n    </em>\n    PPLC may be correct about the City's desire to craft an ordinance that could survive legal challenge and may also be correct about the City's litigation strategy.

This is true even though the Ordinance was motivated in part out of concerns about the safety of handling tar sands crude oil at the Harbor (in terms of environmental and public health risk from spills). Statutes that preempt state safety standards for certain activities and facilities do not generally remove local control over whether those activities and facilities are permitted in each locality. Congress knows how to preempt local bans and siting authority, since it has done so for nuclear power, liquefied natural gas terminals, and electric transmission lines. It has not done so for pipeline facilities, and instead chose a more narrowly preemptive scope.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-297\">\n    Since preemption bars certain types of statutes, not motives or legislative purposes, there is no logical contradiction in concluding that the Ordinance is not a preempted safety standard and also concluding that one purpose of the Ordinance was to alleviate perceived safety risks from tar sands crude oil spills by blocking the loading of that crude oil at the Harbor. PPLC argues that, stripped of its disguises, the Ordinance was truly an attempt to ban tar sands crude oil, but PPLC has not convinced the Court that, even if the Ordinance were truly such a ban, it would either constitute a preempted pipeline facility safety standard or a discriminatory ordinance enacted for an economically protectionist purpose.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-298\">\n    One aspect of Sarah Emerson's testimony that rings true is the periodic narrowness of the margins in the oil business. It is ironic that the city of South Portland has spent so much time pressing its argument that delivery of oil down a pipeline from Canada to oil tankers in its Harbor would be economically unfeasible, but at the same time, arguing that PPLC could economically unload the same oil onto railcars in Rigby Yard. The Court does not take seriously the City's argument on this alternative.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-299\">\n    The Court disagrees with PPLC's contention about the illegitimacy of the City's concerns about the unique risks from transporting tar sands derived crude oil as compared with other types of crude oil. As the Court explained in footnote 4, federal statutes preempt types of legislation or legislative means and effects. Federal statutes normally do not preempt legislative purposes. The Pipeline Safety Act does not permit the City to set its own safety standards or regulate pipeline or transfer facility operations, but that does not mean that the City is prohibited from banning loading or new facilities for loading simply because the ban was motivated in part by environmental and safety concerns that overlap with the legislative purposes of a federal statute. If overlapping legislative purpose with a preempting federal statute were ordinarily enough to destroy the legitimacy of state interests in the\n    <em>\n     Pike\n    </em>\n    balancing, courts would likely have to strike down a huge swath of state legislation, such as the Maine Oil Discharge Prevention and Pollution Control law, 38 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 541\n    <em>\n     et seq.\n    </em>\n    , that have long been upheld under preemption and constitutional attacks.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Portland Pipe Line Corp. v.
