Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorneys' Fees\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 11, 2018, judgment was entered by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (Filing 694), affirming the judgment that was entered by this court on July 6, 2016 (Filing 561).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court of Appeals' mandate issued and was received by this court on July 24, 2018 (Filing 697). On July 31, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their motion for attorney fees (Filing 700) with an index of evidence (Filing 701), but no supporting brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The period of time covered by the motion runs from August 3, 2016 (the date Defendants filed a Rule 59 motion for\n   judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial), through July 29, 2018. The court previously granted a motion for attorney fees and expenses for work performed by Plaintiffs' counsel through July 21, 2016 (the date the motion for attorney fees was filed).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum and Order (Filing 613) and Judgments (Filings 615 through 620) entered on September 6, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 1, 2018, this court entered a Memorandum and Order directing Plaintiffs to submit \"a brief addressing whether the motion is timely, whether the motion is in compliance with the local rules of this court, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals Local Rules, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and whether the law and the facts warrant the relief sought on the merits.\" (Filing 702) A schedule was established for submission of briefs and evidence by both sides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their brief on August 13, 2018 (Filing 708). Defendants filed an opposing brief on August 24, 2018 (Filing 712). Plaintiffs replied on August 29, 2018 with a brief (Filing 715) and additional evidence (Filing 716). The matter is now ripe for determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    A. Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As an initial matter, this court must determine whether it has jurisdiction to award attorney fees and expenses associated with an appeal. As suggested by the court in its previous Memorandum and Order, this question was answered in the affirmative by the Eighth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Little Rock School District. v. State of Arkansas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1000572\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/127/693/\">\n    127 F.3d 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 1997). In that case, as here, the prevailing parties on appeal did not file a motion for attorney fees with the Court of Appeals, as provided in Rule 47C of the Local Rules of the Eighth Circuit, but instead applied to the district court after the defendant/appellee's petition for rehearing was denied. The district court awarded attorney fees to the plaintiffs pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant appealed from the award and argued, among other things, that Rule 47C deprived the district court of jurisdiction to award attorney fees for work performed in connection with the appeal. The Eighth Circuit rejected this argument, stating:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Rule 47C provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (a) Motion for Fees. A motion for attorney fees ... shall be filed with the clerk within 14 days after the entry of judgment.... The court may grant on its own motion an allowance of reasonable attorney fees to a prevailing party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (b) Determination of Fees. On the court's own motion or at the request of the prevailing party, a motion for attorney fees may be remanded to the district court or administrative agency\n   for appropriate hearing and determination....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The usual practice for awarding fees and costs under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is for this Court to fix the compensation for services rendered before it, and for the District Court to do so for services rendered before it.\n   <em>\n    Avalon Cinema Corp. v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1469800\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/689/137/#p138\">\n    689 F.2d 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 138 (8th Cir.1982) (en banc). The policy behind Rule 47C is that fee awards should be determined by the court most familiar with the legal services in question. In this case, as in any other before this Court, the plaintiffs should have filed a motion to this Court for fees incurred on appeal. If they had done so, we could have remanded the matter to the District Court for its determination; but we probably would have kept the motion here and decided it ourselves.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   However, Rule 47C cannot and does not affect the jurisdiction of the district courts. The jurisdiction of the federal district courts is conferred by Congress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1390. Rule 47C is a rule of procedure for the Court of Appeals and does not alter this grant of jurisdiction. Therefore, despite our local rule, the district courts retain jurisdiction to decide attorneys' fees issues that we have not ourselves undertaken to decide. The District Court has awarded attorneys' fees for services rendered before the United States Supreme Court, reasoning that the Supreme Court had lost jurisdiction, and, in any event, would have been unlikely to undertake the intensive fact-finding necessary in such matters.\n   <em>\n    Vaughn v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5626491\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/526/1165/#p1169\">\n    526 F.Supp. 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1169 (E.D.Ark.1981). Such discretionary and practical considerations continue to be relevant to a district court's decision whether to grant a motion for attorneys' fees for services before an appellate court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Rule 47C's own language indicates that it is not a rigid jurisdictional rule. First, this Court has the power to grant attorneys' fees on its own motion. 8th Cir. R. 47C(a). Second, whether the fee award is on its own motion or that of the party seeking compensation, this Court retains the discretion to remand the question to the District Court, instead of determining the award itself. 8th Cir. R. 47C(b). The Rule thus preserves multiple procedural options for the determination of attorneys' fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The choice of procedure should not obscure the end goal: calculation of a fair award. It would be mere procedural contortion to reverse the District Court's award only to award fees to the school districts on our own motion, which we would be inclined to do rather than allow services necessary to enforce the settlement agreement to go uncompensated. Therefore, we hold that the District Court had jurisdiction to make the award, and we review its amount for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winter v.

The court must next decide whether Plaintiffs' motion is timely, an issue that was not raised in the\n   <em>\n    Little Rock Sch.

R. App. P. 36(a), there can be no doubt that the deadline for Plaintiffs to file a motion for attorney fees in the Court of Appeals was June 25, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants do not argue that Rule 47C applies directly to the district courts in this circuit. It is, after all, \"a rule of procedure for the Court of Appeals.\"\n   <em>\n    Little Rock Sch.

While this might be a relevant consideration in determining whether to grant Plaintiffs' motion, see\n   <em>\n    Little Rock Sch.

They contend the applicable rule is Rule 54(d)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This rule, which is also relied upon by Defendants, provides in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (A)\n   <em>\n    Claim to Be by Motion\n   </em>\n   .

Mosey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5674978\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/602/777/#p782\">\n    602 F.Supp.2d 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 782 (N.D. Tex. 2009), the district court concluded, after \"looking at the Federal Rules as a whole,\" that \" Rule 54 should not apply to a judgment from the Court of Appeals.\" It explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The trigger for the 14-day period under Rule 54 is the entry of judgment. A \"judgment\" is defined by Rule 54 as \"any order from which an appeal lies.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(a). Based on that definition alone, Rule 54 could apply to a judgment from the Court of Appeals. After all, a judgment from the Court of Appeals can be appealed to the United States Supreme Court. But looking at the Federal Rules as a whole demonstrates that Rule 54 should not apply to a judgment from the Court of Appeals. Starting at the beginning, Rule 1 provides that \"[t]hese rules govern the procedure in all civil actions and proceedings in the United States district courts.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 1. This rule creates a presumption that the Federal Rules only deal with and refer to district court proceedings. Additionally, Rule 54 is part of Chapter VII of the Federal Rules. This chapter is titled \"Judgment\" and provides rules for issues such as motions for summary judgment, a new trial, and to alter or amend a judgment. These are all issues that only arise in district court proceedings. For example, Rule 59 provides that \"[a] motion to alter or amend a judgment must be filed no later than 10 days after the entry of judgment.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). This rule \"makes clear that the district court possesses the power ... to alter or amend a judgment after its entry.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 59, Advisory Committee Notes, 1948 Amendments. If the word \"judgment\" in Rule 59 includes a judgment from the Court of Appeals, then the same should be true for Rule 54. But it is obvious that a district court does not possess the power to alter or amend a judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The reasons for having a 14-day period also demonstrate that Rule 54 should not apply to a judgment from the Court of Appeals. The most important reason is that the \"14-day period is designed to operate in conjunction with the 30-day appeal period.\" 10 James Wm. Moore's\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 54.151 (Matthew Bender 3d ed.). \"14 days ensures that the fee opponent has notice of the fee motion prior to the expiration of the time to appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5674978\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/602/777/#p782\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed.R.Civ.P. 54, Advisory Committee Notes, 1993 Amendments. But this rationale only applies to a judgment from a district court. A party that wants to appeal a judgment from the Court of Appeals has much longer than 30 days to file a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A) (30 days to file notice of appeal) with Sup.Ct. R. 13 (90 days to file petition for a writ of certiorari). Another reason for the 14-day period is that \"[p]rompt filing affords an opportunity for the court to resolve fee disputes shortly after trial, while the services performed are freshly in mind.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 54, Advisory Committee Notes, 1993 Amendments. Again, this rationale only applies to a judgment from a district court. There are no trials in the Court of Appeals, and a district court judge will not have \"the services performed [on appeal] freshly in mind.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Although there is not much relevant case law on this issue, at least one court has also said that Rule 54 does not apply to a judgment from the Court of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turic v.

The court finds the description of services to be sufficient and the hours claimed to be reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Third, Defendants object to 6.5 hours of time Matthew Kosmicki spent in client conferences. In view of the fact that Mr. Kosmicki's client is mentally ill and low functioning, the court does not find this amount of time to be unreasonable. Fourth, and finally, Defendants object to billings for clerical work that was performed by paralegals in Herbert J. Friedman's office. The court agrees that there should be no recovery of the $1,413.75 fee claimed for such work. \"In calculating attorneys' fees, 'purely clerical or secretarial tasks should not be billed at a paralegal rate, regardless of who performs them.' \"\n   <em>\n    Murray v.

Defendants filed their notice of appeal (Filing 621) on October 5, 2016.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    On July 6, 2016, the same date that judgment was entered on the jury verdict, the court entered an order (Filing 562) establishing a schedule for Plaintiffs to apply for attorney fees and nontaxable costs, for Defendants to respond, and for Plaintiffs to reply. Plaintiffs' motion for attorney fees (Filing 565) was filed on July 21, 2016, and the matter was taken under submission on August 26, 2016 (Filing 608). The court awarded Plaintiffs attorney fees and expenses totaling $1,721,519.85. This amount included fees and expenses associated with three appeals. Defendants argued that Plaintiffs were required to have filed motions in the Court of Appeals in order to recover these fees and expenses. The court rejected this argument, for the reason that Plaintiffs did not gain \"prevailing party\" status until July 6, 2016, when the jury verdict was returned and judgment was entered in Plaintiffs' favor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    \"In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of section[ ] ... 1983, ... the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs, ....\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (West).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Had Defendants not petitioned for rehearing, the mandate would have issued within 21 days after entry of the Court of Appeals' judgment if normal procedures were followed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.
