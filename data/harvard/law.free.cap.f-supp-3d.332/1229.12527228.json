TUNHEIM, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A substantial number of Latinos-both U.S. citizens and foreign-born residents-are less likely to contact the police or report crimes, even when they are victims, because they fear that police will inquire about their immigration status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the U.S. immigrant population is extremely vulnerable to crime,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   police mistrust is common within immigrant communities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Minnesota, law-enforcement\n   agencies fear that the immigrant community's distrust of police results in increased crime against immigrants and decreased reporting of such crimes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The law-enforcement conduct alleged in this case is precisely the type of conduct that further sows the Minnesota immigrant community's distrust of law-enforcement agencies. Plaintiff Myriam Parada resides in Ramsey, Minnesota. In July 2017, Parada was the victim of an automotive accident. Coon Rapids Police Officer Nicolas Oman arrested Parada for driving without a license. While detained at the Anoka County jail, Defendants contacted Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") and transferred Parada into ICE custody. Parada is now in removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Parada alleges that she was unlawfully arrested and detained by Defendants because of her race, nationality, and immigration status. She brings this \u00a7 1983 action against Anoka County, Anoka County Sheriff James Stewart, the City of Coon Rapids,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oman, and two unknown defendants for violations of her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Parada also brings state-law claims for violations of the Minnesota Constitution and false imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Coon Rapids and Oman (collectively, \"Coon Rapids Defendants\") move to dismiss Parada's claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The Court will deny the Coon Rapids Defendants' motion with respect to Parada's Fourth Amendment claims, equal-protection claim, Minnesota Constitution claims, and false-imprisonment claim. However, the Court will grant the Coon Rapids Defendants' motion with respect to Parada's due-process claims, because it will conclude that they are duplicative of her Fourth Amendment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Parada alleges the following facts. (Compl., March 22, 2018, Docket No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Parada-a Mexican citizen-resides in Ramsey, Minnesota.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13, 34-35.) On July 25, 2017, Parada was driving her siblings and cousins home from her younger sister's birthday party. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Around 6:40 p.m., a Caucasian driver rear-ended Parada. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) The other driver called the police, and Oman arrived at the scene around 6:46 p.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.) Parada\n   called her parents, who came to the scene. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Oman asked Parada for her driver's license, which she did not have. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.) Parada gave Oman her proof of insurance and her Matr\u00edcula Card-an official identification card issued by the Mexican Consulate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.) The Matr\u00edcula Card lists Parada's full name, date of birth, and U.S. address. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) It also has a recent photo of Parada and security features to ensure its authenticity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Parada confirmed that all the information on her card was true and accurate, as did her step-father. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.) Her step-father told Oman that he was the registered owner of the car and gave Oman his name, which Oman ran through his database. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Oman went to his vehicle and spoke with Anoka County staff on his personal phone for several minutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) When Oman returned, he told Parada that his supervisor told him that he needed to \"bring her in to get her prints.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.) In the police report, Oman wrote that he \"transported Parada to jail since I was also unable to positively identify her.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Oman brought Parada to the Anoka County Jail around 7:20 p.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) Officers handcuffed Parada, patted her down, took her mugshot, and placed her in a cell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-52.) According to the jail records, Parada was free to leave on that same day, July 25. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54, 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   However, Defendants did not release Parada that day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) At approximately 11:00 p.m. on July 25, the Anoka County Sheriff's Office brought Parada to one of the unknown defendants, who questioned her for several minutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) At approximately 11:30 p.m., Parada was again brought to the unknown defendant to speak with ICE officers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) Defendants did not advise Parada that she could refuse to speak with the ICE officers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.) The ICE officers questioned Parada about her immigration status. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62-63.) Parada asked the unknown defendant whether she needed an attorney, and he told her to ask ICE. When Parada asked ICE the same question, an ICE officer replied that \"it goes faster without a lawyer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-66.) Parada answered the ICE officers' questions about how she entered the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.) Parada was then taken back to her cell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.) An hour later, they took her fingerprints. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The next day, July 26, ICE sent Anoka County an I-200 Warrant for Arrest of an Alien (\"ICE Warrant\") and an I-247 ICE Detainer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.) The ICE Warrant was unsigned and the ICE Detainer was stamped with \"Draft Not Complete\" on every page. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70, 87.) Neither ICE nor Defendants served Parada with copies of these documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At approximately 2:00 a.m. on July 26, Defendants brought Parada out of her cell, handed her a citation for driving without a license, and handed her over to two ICE agents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74-75.) The ICE agents took her to Sherburne County Jail. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75-76.) An hour after transferring custody of Parada to ICE, Anoka County Defendants notified her family. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.) Parada is currently in removal proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79-80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Parada alleges that Coon Rapids and the Anoka County Sheriff's Office have policies and customs which require officers to detain foreign-born persons while awaiting transfer to immigration authorities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 112, 123, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 158, 163, 170.) She also alleges that Coon Rapids and the Anoka County Sheriff's Office have failed to train their employees on the Fourth Amendment and the rights of immigrants (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Initial Arrest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court must decide whether Parada states a \u00a7 1983 claim for the violation of her Fourth Amendment rights arising from her initial arrest. Parada argues three theories for why her initial arrest was unlawful: (1) Oman was not present while Parada was driving without a license, (2) the arrest violated Minnesota Rule of Criminal Procedure 6.01, and (3) Oman extended the stop beyond what was reasonably required to issue a citation for driving without a license. The Court considers each argument in turn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   First, Parada argues that misdemeanor arrests require a warrant unless the crime is committed in the presence of the arresting officer. At common law, \"[a] warrant was required [for misdemeanor arrests] except when a breach of peace occurred in the presence of the arresting officer.\" Wayne R. LaFave, 3 Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment \u00a7 5.1(b) (5th ed. 2017).

Although the Eighth Circuit has not decided the issue, it has held that, \"[b]ecause the law regarding warrantless misdemeanor arrests for offenses committed outside the presence of\n   the arresting officer is not clearly established under the Fourth Amendment,\" arresting officers are entitled to qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    Gilmore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12133523\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/827/#p832\">\n    837 F.3d at 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the law was not clear at the time of the arrest, the Court concludes that Oman is entitled to qualified immunity for any argument based on his lack of presence during Parada's commission of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Second, Parada argues that Oman \"lacked the legal authority to take [her] into custody\" because the arrest violated Minnesota Rule of Criminal Procedure 6.01. (Compl. \u00b6 126.) Rule 6.01 requires officers, in misdemeanor cases, to issue a citation and release the defendant unless it reasonably appears that \"(1) the person must be detained to prevent bodily injury to that person or another; (2) further criminal conduct will occur; or (3) a substantial likelihood exists that the person will not respond to a citation.\" Minn. R. Crim. P. 6.01(a). Taking Parada's allegations as true, Oman violated Rule 6.01. But while States may regulate arrests however they wish, \"state restrictions do not alter the Fourth Amendment's protections.\"\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674054\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/164/#p171\">\n    553 U.S. at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674054\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/164/#p171\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court's only concern is whether Oman had probable cause to arrest Parada; whether Oman violated Rule 6.01 does not affect the Fourth Amendment analysis. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Parada fails to state a claim for a Fourth Amendment violation based exclusively on a violation of Rule 6.01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Third and finally, Parada argues that the stop and arrest extended beyond the time reasonably required to identify Parada and issue her a citation for driving without a license. \"[T]he tolerable duration of police inquiries in the traffic-stop context is determined by the seizure's 'mission'-to address the traffic violation that warranted the stop.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

Parada provided Oman with her Matr\u00edcula Card and her proof of insurance for identification. Nevertheless, Oman told Parada that he needed to take her to the jail in order to identify her. However, Parada alleges that Defendants never doubted Parada's identity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53-56.) This allegation is supported by the fact that Oman said he needed to \"get her prints,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40), but no one took Parada's fingerprints upon booking. Indeed, her prints were not taken until almost five hours after she arrived at the jail and until after she had spoken to ICE officers. Even assuming Oman had probable cause to arrest Parada for driving without a driver's license, Parada states a claim that the stop and arrest extended beyond the time required to identify Parada and issue a citation for driving without a license. The Court concludes that Parada states a claim for a Fourth Amendment violation arising from the initial arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court must decide whether it was clearly established at the time of the arrest that unreasonably prolonging a traffic stop and subsequently arresting someone under these circumstances violates the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Caballes\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   clearly establish that a seizure cannot extend beyond the time necessary to issue a traffic ticket.\n   <em>\n    Caballes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/#p407\">\n    543 U.S. at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/#p407\">\n    125 S.Ct. 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1615\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And while Parada cannot use Rule 6.01 to establish a Fourth Amendment violation, the Rule is evidence that Oman should know that a full custodial arrest is not necessary-and indeed not even allowed in Minnesota-to issue a citation for driving without a license. The Court concludes that Oman has not shown that he is entitled to qualified immunity with respect to Parada's Fourth Amendment claim stemming from the initial arrest. The Court notes that this is the only Fourth\n   Amendment theory that Parada can assert against Oman in his individual capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court must also decide whether Parada can maintain a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against Coon Rapids based on (1) Oman's prolonging of the traffic stop and (2) the fact that Oman was not present when Parada was driving without a license.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Parada alleges that Coon Rapids has a policy or custom of arresting Hispanic drivers for misdemeanor traffic offenses and that its policy of refusing to accept the Matr\u00edcular Card is pretext for arresting aliens to detain them for immigration authorities. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 145, 147.) Parada alleges that Oman arrested her pursuant to this policy, even though Oman did not witness her driving without a license. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145.) Indeed, Oman told Parada that his \"supervisor told him to bring her in to get her prints\" to identify her, which suggests that both Oman and his supervisor were acting pursuant to a policy to (1) disregard the Matr\u00edcular Card and (2) arrest Hispanic individuals to detain them for immigration authorities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) This inference is supported by allegations that the Defendants waited to take her prints until after they had spoken with ICE agents. The alleged policy caused Oman to overstep the boundaries of Minnesota law and, possibly, the protections of the Fourth Amendment. The Court concludes that Parada states a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against Coon Rapids based on (1) the prolonging of the traffic stop and (2) Oman's absence during the commission of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will deny the Coon Rapids Defendants' Motion to Dismiss with respect to the Fourth Amendment claims arising from Parada's initial arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Minn. Sept. 8, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Court incorporates its previous Fourth Amendment analysis here. With respect to the initial arrest, Parada alleges that (1) she was arrested by Oman and (2) Oman was not present while Parada was driving without a license and unreasonably extended the arrest beyond what was necessary. She alleges that her arrest was willful or malicious, (Compl. \u00b6 169), and she supports that claim with allegations that the Coon Rapids Defendants deliberately engaged in racial profiling, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 170). Parada states a false-imprisonment claim stemming from her initial arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   With respect to her continued detention, Parada alleges that (1) she was unlawfully detained by the Defendants after she was cleared for release and (2) Defendants lacked probable cause to detain her on account of her immigration status. Parada alleges that her continued detention was willful or malicious, (Compl. \u00b6 169), and she supports that claim with allegations that Coon Rapids has an unofficial policy or custom of arresting Hispanic motorists simply to place them in immigration custody, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Court will deny the Coon Rapids Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Parada's false-imprisonment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Based on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   1.

(Compl. at 1, Mar. 22, 2018, Docket No. 1.) The Complaint later identifies \"City of Coon Rapids\" as the intended defendant. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 16.) The Court will grant Parada leave to both amend the substantive content of the Complaint and correct the case caption. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The Complaint does not actually allege that Parada is a Mexican citizen. However, Parada's alleges that she was discriminated against based on her perceived nationality. Moreover, she alleges that she presented her Mexican birth certificate to obtain her Matr\u00edcular Card. Pursuant to Constitution of Mexico, individuals \"born in the territory of [Mexico], regardless of the nationality of their parents,\" are Mexican citizens.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, CP, art. 30, Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n 05-02-1917 (Mex.). The Court has no reason to suspect that Parada has renounced her Mexican citizenship and, therefore, will assume for purposes of this motion that Parada is a Mexican citizen. Parada will have an opportunity to clarify her citizenship status when amending the Complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The Coon Rapids Defendants argue that Parada's Fourth Amendment claim is barred by the\n    <em>\n     Heck\n    </em>\n    doctrine because she pleaded guilty to the cited offense. In\n    <em>\n     Heck v. Humphrey\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff cannot maintain a \u00a7 1983 claim for violations of the Fourth Amendment where \"a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/#p487\">\n     512 U.S. 477\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 487,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/#p487\">\n     114 S.Ct. 2364\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/#p487\">\n     129 L.Ed.2d 383\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1994). Parada does not challenge the validity of her conviction for driving without a license. Parada's claims stem from the unreasonable length of her initial arrest and her continued detention without probable cause. If proven, neither theory would invalidate Parada's conviction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Even though the law is not clearly established, Coon Rapids is not entitled to any form of immunity on this issue.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Webb\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516833\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/889/483/#p486\">\n     889 F.3d at 485\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The Court will be required to decide whether the Fourth Amendment permits a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor not witnessed by the arresting officer. But the Court declines to conduct that analysis at this stage because Parada's Fourth Amendment claim will nevertheless go forward on an alternative theory. The Court concludes that discovery and subsequent argument are necessary for the Court to make a reasoned decision on the state of the law and whether the Court is required to reach this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    As a threshold issue, it is not entirely clear to the Court whether Parada is alleging that the Coon Rapids Defendants participated in Parada's continued detention. However, certain allegations suggest that Parada intends to make such claims. Parada alleges that the Coon Rapids Defendants treated her as an immigration detainee, Oman spoke with Anoka County officials on his personal phone before arresting Parada, and Coon Rapids officers regularly arrest Hispanic individuals for immigration purposes. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 39, 53, 145.) These allegations support a conclusion that the Coon Rapids Defendants cooperated with the Anoka County Defendants in detaining Parada for immigration purposes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The Court expects Parada to amend the Complaint if it becomes clear during discovery that the Coon Rapids Defendants did not participate in Parada's continued detention.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
