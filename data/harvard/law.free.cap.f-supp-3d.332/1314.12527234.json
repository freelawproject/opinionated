Regarding the SV for hot-rolled coil, the Department determined that it was more appropriate to value the J55-H using \"the average of SSV's [market economy (\"ME\") ] purchase prices of J55-H in the year prior to the [period of investigation (\"POI\") ], and adjusted to the POI using an inflator.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. In so doing, Commerce rejected data from the harmonized tariff schedule (\"HTSUS\") 7208.37.00 because it was, as a \"basket category,\" overly broad in that it could capture \"all non-alloy steel with width greater than 600 millimeters, rather than just J55-H.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Next, Commerce supplemented the record with a more legible version of a document, the Agro Dutch data worksheet, and continues to use this document to calculate a SV for inland insurance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24. While the Department did omit the values for marine insurance, Commerce continues to interpret and apply the Agro Dutch values over SSV's objections.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-27. Last, Commerce continues to value domestic B &amp; H costs using data from a report titled\n   <em>\n    Doing Business India: 2014\n   </em>\n   (\"Doing Business Report\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This dispute arises under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201581\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and, thus, the court will sustain Commerce's determinations unless they are \"unsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(1)(B)(i). Doing so requires that the court assess the Department's reasoning under the arbitrary and capricious standard and review its factual findings for substantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Changzhou Wujin Fine Chem.

The court addresses the bad faith argument and then each of the subsequent challenges to individual findings below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Bad Faith\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   SSV relies primarily on two cases to suggest that the court ought to\n   infer bad faith based on an allegation of malicious prosecution by Commerce and its arbitrary, results-based findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Comments on Commerce's Redeterminations 3 n.3, ECF No. 183 (Mar. 12, 2018) (\"Pl.'s Comments\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Kilopass Tech., Inc. v.

But, as the Federal Circuit has made clear, \"[s]ubjective bad faith is difficult to prove directly, essentially requiring the discovery of a smoking gun,\"\n   <em>\n    Kilopass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694476\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/1302/#p1311\">\n    738 F.3d at 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , circumstances not met-nor hardly even identified-here. Instead, SSV attempts to indirectly demonstrate Commerce's predisposition by pointing to a laundry list of \"rationalizations that make no sense,\" Pl.'s Comments at 6, which SSV asserts make \"an inference [of bad faith] abundantly warranted,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Yet, put simply, a party's mere disagreement with Commerce's findings -however adamant and genuinely held it may be-in no way establishes bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   What's more, when such an accusation of bad faith is lodged against the government, the burden of proof is even higher. In order to demonstrate that Commerce has acted in bad faith, SSV must present clear and convincing evidence to overcome the ordinary presumption that the government has acted in good faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SKF USA Inc. v.

Purchases of J55-H Coil\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In its remand order, the court expressed a concern that Commerce had failed to adequately explain its valuation of J55-H hot-rolled coil. Specifically, the court could not discern why \"Commerce decided to optimize accuracy by using [SVs] specific to the three variations of J55 HRC\" and \"discarded the more specific [SV]-SSV's actual ME purchases-because the sales occurred about six months before the POI.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12434322\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/269/1335/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12434322\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/269/1335/\">\n    at 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At that time, the court lacked the tools to \"yet say that Commerce's decision was reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12434322\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/269/1335/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the court directed Commerce \"to either provide a more exhaustive explanation of its preference or, alternatively, to change its preference.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12434322\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/269/1335/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In its Remand Redetermination, Commerce recalculated the surrogate value for J55-H, selecting data from ME purchase data over the non-specific HTSUS 7208.37.00 information. Remand Redetermination at 4-7, 20-21. Commerce did concede that \"in weighing contemporaneity versus specificity, [it] did not [previously] attach sufficient weight to the specificity of the SVs in [its] analysis in the First Remand Redetermination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Ultimately, Commerce concluded that \"the ME purchase data that is more specific and would require an inflation adjustment of only six months is the superior data source when compared with a less specific (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , basket category) and three months more contemporaneous data source.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. Therefore, the Department discarded the HTSUS 7208.37.00 information because that \"is a 'basket category' that may contain all non-alloy steel with width greater than 600 millimeters, rather than\n   just J55-H and, thus, is not specific to the input.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   SSV challenges Commerce's findings in this area, advocating that Commerce ought to have pursued an alternative in valuing J55-H: SSV's actual ME purchases of the subject merchandise. Arguing that since the \"simultaneous purchases of J55 and J55H coil [in September 2012] demonstrated that the prices were the same,\" SSV asserts that \"appl[ying] [ ] this historical price ratio requires the conclusion that the prices for J55 and J55H coils would also be the same during the investigation period.\" Pl.'s Comments at 9. In response, the Government argues that SSV's proposed alternative of using a single transaction would be less specific. Rather, the Government contends that there is \"no record evidence of market economy purchases of J55-H hot-rolled coil during the [POI]\" and Commerce resultantly \"considered several imperfect options for selecting a [SV].\" Def.'s Resp. to Comments Regarding the Remand Redetermination 10, ECF No. 188 (Apr. 11, 2018) (\"Def.'s Comments\"). At the end of the day, the Government maintains that Commerce decided \"that SSV's purchases of J55-H hot-rolled coil shortly before the [POI] were the best information available to determine the [SV] of J55-H hot-rolled coil because they were the most specific record evidence, predated the [POI] by less than one year, and could be made contemporaneous with an inflator.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Commerce was faced with choosing between two imperfect alternatives: it could either select the HTSUS 7208.37.00 \"basket category,\" which may be less specific in that it may contain more than just J55-H, or it could examine ME purchase prices specific to the subject merchandise, which pre-date POI (albeit by less than one year). It chose the latter, applying an inflation adjustment in an effort to remedy the infirmities of that data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As this court has stated-and the court here referred to in\n   <em>\n    SeAH II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12434322\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/269/1335/\">\n    269 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1344 -when \"Commerce is faced with the choice of selecting from among imperfect alternatives, it has the discretion to select the best available information for a surrogate value so long as its decision is reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    CS Wind Vietnam Co. v.

But, when doing so, the court requires that Commerce supply a \"well-reasoned decision, sufficiently explaining\" the agency action from which the court can derive \"the analytical path [Commerce] undertook to arrive at its conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inner Mongolia Jianlong Biochemical Co. v. United States\n   </em>\n   , 41 CIT ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273134\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/279/1332/#p1337\">\n    279 F.Supp.3d 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1337 (2017). Having now provided a detailed explanation of its practices and reasoning in this space, Commerce has adequately explained its ultimate decision to prioritize specificity over contemporaneity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Whereas before Commerce had provided \"scant explanation,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SeAH II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12434322\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/269/1335/\">\n    269 F.Supp.3d at 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Department has now given a more detailed explanation of its practice. In comparing the strengths and weaknesses of the data (including ways in which the flaws could be mitigated), Commerce has assessed the quality of the data more fully. Commerce's preference of specificity in this instance is reasonable because specificity is one of the primary considerations in determining the \"best available information.\" If a set of data is not sufficiently specific, it is of substantially lesser import whether that data satisfies the other criteria, such as contemporaneity, because a lack of specificity-from including products dissimilar\n   to the subject merchandise-substantially increases the risk of distortive effects in the data. As a result, the Department's preference is neither arbitrary nor capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   SSV offers a third surrogate for consideration: SSV's market economy purchases of \"regular\" J55 hot-rolled coil. In support, SSV cites a single September 2012 transaction in which it purchased J55 and J55-H hot-rolled coil at the same price. This proffered alternative does not adequately address the specificity problem because its accuracy is based on a single transaction, the applicability of which cannot be ascertained from the information on the record. The fact that J55 and J55-H hot-rolled coil were bought at the same price in a single transaction outside of the POR is not probative of whether the two products could always be bought at the same price. Commerce may not elevate its desire to have contemporaneous data over the necessity for accuracy, as contemporaneity is but one factor to be considered in deciding on a surrogate value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dorbest Ltd. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20CIT%201671\">\n    30 CIT 1671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1691,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3398481,5806767\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/462/1262/\">\n    462 F.Supp.2d 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1281 (2006). What's more, SSV's proposed surrogate value is even less specific than the two other options considered by Commerce as neither Commerce nor the court has the ability to disaggregate in any meaningful way J55 and J55-H hot-rolled coil purchased at the same price in the same transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Accordingly, Commerce acted reasonably and its findings are sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

Relying on this corrected document, the Department rejected most of SSV's arguments as to the document's defects,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-26, but did agree with SSV that Commerce had \"inadvertently inflated the Agro Dutch data from 2005 to 2013 dollars using the Indian consumer price index, rather than the U.S. dollar consumer price index\" and corrected that error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   SSV asserts that defects with the Agro Dutch document still undermine the Department's findings, even with the corrected document now on the record.

Due Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   SSV's due process argument centers around the idea that when Commerce opened the record to supplement the information as to the SV for inland insurance the Department should have afforded SSV an opportunity to rebut the new information placed on the record. Not doing so, SSV argues, amounts to a denial of due process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, SSV was on\n   notice that the Agro Dutch data would be used to calculate inland insurance and declined its opportunity to rebut that information. As a result, SSV has not suffered a violation of its due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Due process \"is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstance;\" rather, it \"is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\"\n   <em>\n    Mathews v.

Even if SSV has satisfied the threshold inquiry of demonstrating it has been deprived of a protected right, it must still demonstrate a lack of specific notice and opportunity to be heard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11548418,11211211\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/182/860/\">\n    182 F.3d 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 871 (Fed. Cir. 1999). SSV has failed to do so as Commerce did indeed provide specific notice regarding the Agro Dutch data and SSV declined the opportunity to comment when U.S. Steel placed the document on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In this proceeding, SSV argues not that it was denied an opportunity to comment on the Agro Dutch data but rather that \"it had no reason to believe that Commerce would\" assign a constructive value for inland insurance. Pl.'s Comments at 9. Indeed, SSV rested on its contention that Commerce should not assign a value for inland insurance and did not argue in the alternative that the record information was insufficient for such a calculation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   While the legibility of the original document is questionable, the notice it provided SSV is not. The document itself clearly provided SSV with actual notice that Commerce may consider calculating a SV for inland insurance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Steel's Submission of SV Data, ECF No. 60, Tab 16, Tab J (Jan. 17, 2014). Not only did U.S. Steel label the document as \"CALCULATION OF SURROGATE VALUE FOR DOMESTIC INLAND INSURANCE,\" it suggested that Commerce \"value[ ] domestic inland insurance using information submitted by Agro Dutch.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   What's more, the document to which the Agro Dutch data was affixed, a memo from Commerce related to SVs in a different proceeding, discussed the method used by Commerce for valuing domestic inland insurance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Tab J Attach. 2 at 6. SSV cannot now construe such overt notice as being deficient. Given the circumstances, the court finds that the notice given to SSV was adequate. As such, SSV was on notice that the Agro Dutch data could be used by Commerce to calculate inland insurance and, thus, can only articulate a due process violation if the Department denied it an opportunity to be heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   However, once on notice that the Argo Dutch data would be used for valuing inland insurance, SSV declined to comment, thus rendering its due process claim without merit. Indeed, SSV acknowledges that it did not rebut the information-or request a cleaner version of the document be placed on the record-because it believed that its argument about Indian common law sufficiently disputed the inland insurance premise altogether. By so doing, SSV left the document unrebutted as the sole source of valuing inland insurance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   SSV could have alerted Commerce to the illegibility of the document at the time it was placed on the record and-ideally-even\n   stated SSV's desire that it be afforded an opportunity to rebut the document when a more legible version was provided. Ultimately, SSV did neither and cannot now claim that it did anything but decline its opportunity to be heard on the subject.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As SSV received ample notice that Commerce may indeed value inland insurance using the Argo Dutch data and SSV failed to comment on that data when it was placed on the record, its claim for a denial of due process is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    2. Alleged Ambiguities Within the Agro Dutch Document\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   SSV presents two primary challenges to Commerce's actions as they pertain to the Agro Dutch worksheet: 1) that the two unit prices listed, 2.00 and 22.75, do not state their applicable denominations and the Department should have corrected this error by placing a more complete excerpt of the document on the record; and 2) that Commerce's \"decision not to re-open the record more widely to clarify any ambiguities cannot be sustained.\" Pl.'s Comments at 11-12. This all amounts to one specific claim of error and a more encompassing claim that Commerce acted unreasonably.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Where a plaintiff seeks to challenge Commerce's determinations as not supported by substantial evidence, it must present specific allegations demonstrating the insufficiency of Commerce's reasoning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202639\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (stating that Commerce's decisions are presumed to be correct and that the \"burden of proving otherwise shall rest upon the party challenging such decision.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Looking first to the alleged error as to the unit prices listed and their corresponding denominations, Commerce reasoned that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The figure on this worksheet to which SSV cites as the gross unit price (which SSV believes to be $12.75/kilogram) is GRSUPR2U. It is clear on the worksheet that GRSUPR2U is $22.75. Based on the figures given on the worksheet for \"cases,\" \"kilos,\" and GRSUPR1U, we interpret GRSUPR2U to be the price per case, and GRSUPR1U to be the price per kilogram. Therefore, because the gross unit price (GRSUPR1U) is $2/kilogram, and not $22.75/kilogram, we continue to determine that the record evidence does not support SSV's allegation that the inland insurance SV we used was \"incredibly inflated.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Remand Redetermination at 23-24. An examination of the document in question confirms that Commerce's reading was a reasonable one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Analysis Mem. for the Final Redetermination on Remand, ECF No. 190, P.R. 11 Attach. 4 (Feb. 9, 2018). As the GRSUPR1U and GRSUPR2U values align to create roughly equivalent total prices-when interpreted using Commerce's applied methodology-the court disagrees with SSV's suggestion that this was an unreasonable interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As to Commerce's decision to re-open the record for limited purposes, this court has previously stated on multiple occasions that it will defer to Commerce's discretion, but will nonetheless \"review on a case-by-case basis whether the interests of accuracy and fairness outweigh the burden placed on the Department and the interest in finality.\"\n   <em>\n    Mid Continent Steel &amp; Wire, Inc. v.

Here, Commerce based its decision to re-open the record for limited purposes in part on the fact that \"SSV chose not to submit [factual] information to value inland insurance by [the stated] deadline[s], despite [U.S. Steel] having submitted the\n   Agro Dutch inland insurance information\" prior to the later of the two deadlines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Remand Redetermination at 26. SSV's argument that Commerce abused its discretion is largely disarmed by its declining to either comment on or supplement the record at the time the Agro Dutch data was first raised. To now assert that Commerce acted unfairly ignores SSV's own strategic decisions. Accordingly, the court defers to Commerce's decision with regard to opening the record and finds no element of unfairness that would contravene that discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   All in all, SSV has failed to satisfy its burden of proof. In this instance, rather than merely asserting that there were ambiguities the Department failed to reconcile, SSV has the burden of demonstrating the Commerce's decision was improper. By failing to engage with Commerce's reasoning and raising only one specific alleged ambiguity, SSV has failed to meet its burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    3.

Here, the Department stated that this was not a normal circumstance, warranting departure from the regulation because \"the Agro Dutch information, which is the only data on the record, does not allow [Commerce] to separate the inland insurance costs from the marine insurance costs because they are represented as one value.\" Remand Redetermination at 25. As a result, Commerce determined that its methodology-\"removing the marine insurance SV\" from the combined insurance value-was \"the only alternative to ensure that the marine insurance costs are not double counted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.408\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.408\">\n    at 25-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In this case, the only evidence on the record as to inland insurance included marine insurance and the Department's decision to deduct the marine insurance was reasonable.

That, in the Department's view, cut against SSV's argument because it showed that record evidence, submitted by SSV, demonstrated that there were indeed some Indian B &amp; H costs charged by their weight.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20Fed.%20Reg.%2074%2C764\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20Fed.%20Reg.%2074%2C764\">\n    at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Government contends that the Doing Business Report did lay out a fee structure for B &amp; H costs in India and, therefore, \"Commerce logically referred to a fee structure on the record-SSV's contract with its Vietnamese supplier.\" Def.'s Comments at 24.

In essence, SSV argues that \"GVN's questionnaire response indicated that GVN paid a total of roughly $5.42 per ton for all [B &amp; H] services\" such that Commerce \"cannot plausibly justify [its] assertion that GVN's questionnaire response supports Commerce's calculation of [B &amp; H] costs of $75 to $85 per ton.\" Pl.'s Comments at 23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   For its part, the Government contends that the GVN questionnaire \"simply provided Commerce with additional factual support to justify Commerce's reasonable inference that [B &amp; H] fees for Indian OCTG producers vary by weight.\" Def.'s Comments at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \"Commerce can, and does, mix and match the data that it chooses in its surrogate value selection, for instance through the use of gap-filling data.\"\n   <em>\n    Dorbest\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20CIT%201671\">\n    30 CIT at 1684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3398481,5806767\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/462/1262/\">\n    462 F.Supp.2d at 1275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
