Like Plaintiff, Defendant FJUVO Collections collects, refines, and sells cooking oil. At this visit, Plaintiff and Defendant FJUVO entered into a contract whereby Defendant FJUVO would be allowed to inspect Plaintiff's refining facility \"solely for the purpose of evaluating a potential business relationship\" in exchange for providing Plaintiff with truckloads of oil. Defendant FJUVO delivered Plaintiff the oil. However, Plaintiff alleges Defendant FJUVO and two spinoff companies, Defendants TG Recycle Oil and Green Oil Recycle, used its proprietary technology for their own ends. Plaintiff alleges that this violated Virginia tort law, contract law, and trade secret law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the majority of these claims must be dismissed, the trade secret claims are adequately pled.

Defendants Andy Chen, Daniel Zheng, and Adam Zheng have each served as agents of FJUVO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant Andy Chen is also the principal of Defendant TG Recycle Oil. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11). Like Plaintiff and Defendant FJUVO, Defendant TG Recycle Oil is \"engaged in collecting, refining and selling used\n   cooking oil.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It \"is a spin-off company of FJUVO.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant Daniel Zheng also serves as the principal of Defendant Green Oil Recycle, Inc. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12). Defendant Green Oil Recycle is \"engaged in collecting, refining and selling used cooking oil.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Prior business dealings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before this dispute, FJUVO \"collected and supplied [Darton] with used cooking oil for [Darton]'s refining operation.\" (Dkt. 50 at \u00b6 13). Darton \"refines the cooking oil through a process called 'heat and settle' involving superheated water, which separates waste material from the oil.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9). This process was \"significantly less labor-intensive and less costly\" than the refining method FJUVO had previously used. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Negotiations and the agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   FJUVO began negotiating with Darton for use of its technology in 2015. (Dkt. 50 at \u00b6 16). Andy Chen, Daniel Zheng, and Adam Zheng negotiated on behalf of FJUVO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17). Daryl Hubbard negotiated on behalf of Darton. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). The parties agreed to allow FJUVO to inspect Darton's refining facility \"solely for the purpose of evaluating a potential business relationship\" in exchange for \"six truckloads of oil per month for eighteen months.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 24-25). Each truckload contained at least 45,000 pounds. (Dkt. 7-1). Darton would pay \"one cent below the IL Jacobsen market price\" for the oil, and could re-sell it for two cents over the market price. (Dkt. 50 at \u00b6 25). On October 21, 2015, the parties entered into the \"buy and sell\" agreement, memorializing these terms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29; dkt. 7-1). That same day, the parties also executed non-compete and confidentiality agreements. (Dkt. 50 at \u00b6 32; dkt. 7-1; dkt. 7-2). These agreements made clear that FJUVO was to \"use the Confidential Information only for the purpose of evaluating potential business and investment relationships with [Darton].\" (Dkt. 7-2). The agreements were signed for FJUVO by Andy Chen and for Darton by Daryl Hubbard. (Dkt. 50 at \u00b6 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    D. FJUVO begins using Darton technology and selling refined oil\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Darton then \"allowed Chen and Daniel and Adam Zheng to examine the proprietary equipment at the Darton refinery. Daniel Zheng also took photographs of the equipment.\" (Dkt. 50 at \u00b6 44). Afterwards, \"FJUVO quickly set up its own refinery in Hammond, Indiana, and later converted its old centrifuge refinery in Murfreesboro, Tennessee to a 'heat and settle' facility using the Darton technology, and began selling refined oil therefrom.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47). Defendants Andy Chen and TG Recycle Oil used the Darton technology in Defendant TG Recycle Oil's refinery in Highland, Indiana. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48). Likewise, Defendants Daniel Zheng and Green Oil Recycle used the Darton technology at their refinery in Highland, Indiana. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49). Defendants began selling this refined oil to other buyers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 52, 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff's seven counts include claims for breach of contract, conversion, tortious interference with business expectancy, Virginia statutory business conspiracy, common law conspiracy, and violations of the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court takes them one at a time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In evaluating the enforceability of non-compete agreements, Virginia courts ask whether the agreement is (1) \"narrowly drawn\" to protect a legitimate business interest, (2) \"not unduly burdensome\" on the contracting party's \"ability to earn a living,\" and (3) \"not against public policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Preferred Sys.

Additionally, courts are to consider the \"function, geographical scope, and duration\" of the agreement.\n   <em>\n    Simmons v.

Finally, \"when the non-compete clause is ambiguous and susceptible to two or more differing interpretations, at least one of which is functionally overbroad, the clause is unenforceable.\"\n   <em>\n    Nortec Commc'ns, Inc. v. Lee-Llacer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3532124\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/548/226/#p230\">\n    548 F.Supp.2d 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 230 (E.D. Va. 2008) (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The non-compete agreement's primary problem is that it is overbroad, and the Court concludes it is unenforceable as an unreasonable restraint of trade. The agreement states that FJUVO \"shall not, in any manner, represent, provide services or engage in any aspects of business that would be deemed similar in nature to the business of Darton....\" (Dkt. 7-3). It continues by preventing FJUVO from \"directly or indirectly engag[ing] in any business that would be considered similar in nature to with [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] Darton Environmental, Inc., its subsidiaries, and any current or former clients and/or customers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Under the agreement, FJUVO also may not \"solicit any client, customer, officer, staff or employee for the benefit of [itself] or a third party that is or may be engaged in a similar business.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This language is both ambiguous and overbroad. Its terms prevent FJUVO from engaging in \"business that would be deemed similar in nature to the business of Darton.\" But Plaintiffs allege FJUVO \"has historically been primarily engaged in collecting, refining and selling used cooking oil.\" (Dkt. 50 at \u00b6 10). And so FJUVO's practice is almost identical and certainly \"similar in nature to the business of Darton.\" These terms would force FJUVO to stop the work it had historically been engaged, a result that was both unanticipated by the parties and unreasonable. Plaintiff, in its opposition to the motion to dismiss, admits that reading this language by itself \"would lead to an absurd result.\" (Dkt. 63 at 16). But its attempt to limit the terms to a \"rational reading\" that only protects \"its specific method of 'heat and settle' refining\" relies on limitations found nowhere in the agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Parties cannot write facially overbroad non-compete agreements and then seek to tailor them after the fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The agreement's terms would likewise prevent FJUVO's ongoing solicitation of its own clients because it may not \"solicit any client ... engaged in a similar business.\" (Dkt. 7-3). This language is problematic because it goes far beyond Darton's proprietary technology and instead limits conduct that is \"similar\" to its general business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klaff v. Pratt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2403132\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/117/739/\">\n    117 Va. 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20S.E.%2074\">\n    86 S.E. 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 78 (1915) (\"The agreement restraining trade must be incidental to and in support of the contract or sale by which the one in whose favor it runs acquired some interest in the business he seeks to protect.\") Again, any limitation on this broad language is only created by Plaintiff\n   <em>\n    ex post\n   </em>\n   ; it is nowhere to be found in the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, the agreement is missing traditional geographic and temporal limitations. Similar contracts containing no geographic scope have long been found unenforceable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alston Studios, Inc. v. Lloyd V. Gress &amp; Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"474854\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/492/279/#p285\">\n    492 F.2d 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 283 (4th Cir. 1974) (\"[B]ecause of its limitless geographic application ..., we hold the provision unenforceable and void.\"). The non-compete purports to be in effect for ten years. (Dkt. 7-3). Plaintiff points to no contracts of this length that have been upheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff responds by noting that the Supreme Court of Virginia has said \"[t]he possession of trade secrets and confidential information is an important consideration in testing the reasonableness of a restriction on competition.\"\n   <em>\n    Meissel v. Finley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2058564\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/198/577/#p583\">\n    198 Va. 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 583,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20S.E.2d%20186\">\n    95 S.E.2d 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1956). While this is undoubtedly true, the non-compete here goes significantly beyond the underlying trade secrets at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   It would instead prevent FJUVO from engaging in its day-to-day business, a result that Plaintiff acknowledges is absurd. The agreement is overbroad, even if it aims at protecting legitimate interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff's recourse to\n   <em>\n    Consol. Indus. Roofing v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3923083\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-cir/17/341/\">\n    17 Va. Cir. 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Roanoke Cir. Ct. 1989), is likewise unavailing. This thirty-year-old circuit court case simply stands for the unobjectionable proposition that non-compete agreements must be read holistically. While the Court does look at the whole agreement, the limiting terms Plaintiff seeks to introduce now are found nowhere on the face of the document. And unlike the agreement upheld in that case, which restricted competition within 150 miles of Roanoke for two years, there are no limiting principles in this agreement that save Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For these reasons, the non-compete agreement is unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court now turns to the confidentiality agreement. (Dkt. 7-2). The parties both agree that \"[t]he Supreme Court of Virginia applies the same test to confidentiality agreements as it does to noncompetition agreements.\" (Dkt. 63 at 18 (quoting\n   <em>\n    BB &amp; T Ins.

The complaint then alleges that \"shortly after the agreements were signed and FJUVO representatives inspected the Darton refinery,\n   <em>\n    FJUVO and its agents\n   </em>\n   Chen and the Zhengs conspired together to breach the agreements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46 (emphasis added) ).

The Act defines \"trade secret\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   information, including but not limited to, a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   1.

Code \u00a7 59.1-336. Unlike the other claims addressed above, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that each Defendant violated the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The first and overarching question for all Defendants is whether the technology constitutes a trade secret. Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that it is. First, Plaintiff plausibly alleges that the Darton technology \"derives independent economic value ... from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.\" Va. Code \u00a7 59.1-336. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges \"[t]he Darton technology is a significantly less labor-intensive and less costly means of refining than the centrifuge method\" Defendants had been using. (Dkt. 50 at \u00b6 15). The (admittedly unconsummated) negotiations for Plaintiff to build Defendant FJUVO a refining system further attest to this value. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21, 22). Second, Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that the Darton technology \"[i]s the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\" Va. Code \u00a7 59.1-336. While largely unenforceable, Plaintiff negotiated agreements that limited Defendants access to the technology. (Dkt. 7-2; dkt. 7-3). Likewise, Plaintiff alleges that the individual Defendants \"were all fully aware of the sensitive nature of the Darton technology, and of Darton's desire to maintain its proprietary nature.\" (Dkt. 50 at \u00b6 15). In short, Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that the Darton technology was a trade secret.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendants' arguments that the technology is not a trade secret fail. Defendants point to diagrams of the technology, links\n   to websites describing the technology, and a photograph in the Lynchburg News &amp; Advance newspaper of Darton's refinery. (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   dkt. 62 at 12) (\"Counsel for the Zheng Defendants found these exact same tanks available on the internet in the first search undertaken.\"). But these arguments all go well beyond the pleadings, and it would be inappropriate for the Court to consider them at this stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d) (\"If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56. All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The second question is whether Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that each Defendant misappropriated the technology. Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that Defendants used Plaintiff's trade secret \"without express or implied consent\" and \"knew or had reason to know\" that their knowledge of the trade secret was \"[a]cquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use.\" Va. Code \u00a7 59.1-336. In particular, Plaintiff has alleged that Defendants FJUVO, Andy Chen, Daniel Zheng, and Adam Zheng were part of the negotiations to view the technology (dkt. 50 at \u00b6\u00b6 17-18), understood that it was proprietary (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45), and understood that they were only being given access for a limited purpose. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 24, 45). Plaintiff then alleged that these Defendants used this technology for their own purposes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 46-50). Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that Defendants TG Recycle Oil and Green Oil Recycle acted through their principals, Defendants Chen and Daniel Cheng, to use the technology. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 48-50). At this stage, those two Defendants can be imputed the knowledge of their principals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendants Green Oil Recycle, Adam Zheng, and Daniel Zheng raise one more defense under\n   <em>\n    Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. v.

Plaintiff never responds to this argument, but under Virginia law, \"where two papers are executed at the same time or contemporaneously between the same parties, in reference to the same subject matter, they must be regarded as parts of one transaction, and receive the same construction as if their several provisions were in one and the same instrument.\"\n    <em>\n     Countryside Orthopaedics, P.C. v.

Accordingly, because documents were signed on the same day and reference interrelated obligations, the Court for present purposes is convinced that it is appropriate to consider the agreements jointly as one contract.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The Court notes that the majority of these cases arise in the employment context and so may have some differences from the non-compete agreement here. However, Plaintiff relies on these same cases throughout its brief, conceding that \"Defendants are correct that under Virginia law, restraints on trade are disfavored and must be strictly construed,\" (dkt. 63 at 13), and does not suggest any problems with the application of these cases here. While the Court notes the potential difference, and has independently looked for cases applying non-compete and confidentiality agreements in more analogous contexts,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Preferred Sys.

For the reasons stated in Section I.B above, the Confidentiality Agreement is reasonable and should be enforced.\" (Dkt. 63 at 18). But the confidentiality agreement has entirely different terms than the non-compete agreement, and so Plaintiff's previous analysis does not translate easily, if at all, to this context. Furthermore, after acknowledging the lack of limitation on duration, Plaintiff neglects to respond to Defendants' arguments about why this is problematic, citing no law in support of its\n    <em>\n     ipse dixit.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Plaintiff concedes that it has not alleged sufficient facts against the other Defendants.
