COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Following the 2017 presidential inauguration, a wave of anonymous accounts claiming to have ties to federal government agencies cropped up on Twitter. The account \"handles\" were styled as \"@alt\" followed by the particular agency's name, such as @altFEC or @ALT_USCIS. Run by those professing to be current or former agency employees, these Twitter accounts publicly criticized the associated agencies and the current Administration. This naturally raised legal questions. After receiving a summons from U.S. Customs and Border Protection for information related to the @ALT_USCIS account, Twitter filed suit on First Amendment grounds, voluntarily dismissing only after the government withdrew the summons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twitter, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:17-cv-01916-JCS (C.D. Cal. 2017). And, not surprisingly, journalists wanted to know what other agencies were planning to do about the accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   One group of journalists, the Center for Public Integrity, filed two requests under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") with the Federal Election Commission (\"FEC\") seeking records regarding the \"@altFEC\" Twitter account and communications from the \"EOP.gov\" domain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FEC produced some responsive documents and redacted or withheld others. The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment regarding these redactions and withholdings. For the reasons below, the Court will grant the FEC's motion for summary judgment and deny\n   the Center for Public Integrity's cross-motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case involves two FOIA requests. By email on February 1, 2017, plaintiff first requested from the FEC:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Any emails, memoranda or other correspondence or communication that discuss, mention, reference or otherwise pertain to the Twitter account \"altFEC.\" This includes direct mention of the account \"@altFEC\", as well as other obvious references to the @altFEC account, which should include, but not be limited to: \"alt FEC Twitter,\" \"alt FEC account\" and \"fake @FEC account.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Decl. of Katie A. Higginbothom Supp. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. (\"Higginbothom Decl.\") Ex. A. The FEC's searches generated twenty-one pages of communications. Higginbothom Decl. \u00b6 5. The agency released seven pages of these responsive records and withheld fourteen pursuant to FOIA Exemption 5.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. The agency affirmed the withholding in an administrative appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By email on February 6, 2018, plaintiff submitted a second records request to the FEC, this time for \"[a] copy of all emails from the domain 'EOP.gov' to senior managers and commissioners encompassed within the required agency system for retaining emails of senior officials.\" Higginbothom Decl. Ex. G. The FEC found fourteen pages of responsive documents, all of which originated from the Office of Management and Budget (\"OMB\"). Higginbothom Decl. \u00b6 11. The agency referred those documents to OMB for disposition and OMB suggested redactions pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 5 and 6.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14. The FEC adopted those suggestions and released all fourteen pages with redactions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties have both moved for summary judgment, and those motions are ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The agency bears the burden of proving that any redactions or withheld records fall within the scope of an exemption to FOIA.\n   <em>\n    AquAlliance v.

Summary judgment may be granted in the FOIA context \"on the basis of agency affidavits if they contain reasonable specificity of detail rather than merely conclusory statements, and if they are not called into question by contradictory evidence in the record or by evidence of agency bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Consumer Fed'n of Am. v.

The Center argues that the agency's declaration justifying application of the deliberative process privilege is \"conclusory\" and that, even if the privilege were to apply, the agency would still have to produce redacted versions of the documents revealing non-exempt factual information. Pl.'s MSJ at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    1. Deliberative process privilege\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The FEC has met its burden of demonstrating the applicability of Exemption 5 and the deliberative process privilege. The agency's declaration explains that the withheld emails \"consisted of communications among attorneys at different levels in the FEC's Office of General Counsel working to identify and analyze potential legal issues that the 'altFEC' Twitter account might raise.' \" Higginbothom Decl. \u00b6 6. In other words, agency lawyers were engaged in a back-and-forth discussion on a specific legal question. \"There can be no doubt that such legal advice, given in the form of intra-agency memoranda prior to any agency decision on the issues involved, fits exactly within the deliberative process rationale for Exemption 5.\"\n   <em>\n    Brinton v.

Segregable information\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Perhaps because the documents contain exactly the kind of information the deliberative process privilege was designed to protect, the Center for Public Integrity focuses more of its attention on the agency's conclusion that the emails contain no reasonably segregable nonexempt information. But the Center's arguments here, too, are unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Factual information is generally not covered by the deliberative privilege exemption. However, such information \"may also be withheld as deliberative material when it is so thoroughly integrated with deliberative material that its disclosure would expose or cause harm to the agency's deliberations.\"\n   <em>\n    Elec.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frontier Found. v.

According to the agency's declaration, that is the case here, see Higginbothom Decl. \u00b6 6, and the Center for Public Integrity has produced no evidence of agency bad faith to suggest otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Consumer Fed'n of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3456664,3253266\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/455/283/\">\n    455 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   287 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sussman v.

Requiring the agency to release additional factual information beyond that in the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index would risk revealing the underlying deliberations themselves. Thus, the Center for Public Integrity's challenge to the FEC's response on this basis fails as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    EOP.gov request\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Center for Public Integrity also objects to the FEC's reliance on FOIA Exemption 5 to redact responsive documents related to its EOP.gov request. Because the Center does not challenge the redactions made pursuant to Exemption 6, that leaves just two pages of responsive documents at issue. The Court addresses those pages in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    1.

A at 3. According to the agency, the agenda was redacted because \"disclosure would reveal preliminary plans regarding subjects to be addressed in a future meeting.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565051,6047422\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/1106/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The email does not provide more detail of those \"subjects\" and instead describes the agenda as covering \"several areas.\" Def.'s Reply Ex. B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A meeting agenda prepared before the meeting is necessarily predecisional and inherently deliberative in that staff are suggesting the topics to be discussed at the meeting. Other courts in this district have likewise concluded that an agency properly redacted the contents of a typed meeting agenda pursuant to the deliberative process privilege of FOIA Exemption 5.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Right to Work Legal Defense &amp; Educ.
