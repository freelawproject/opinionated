Defendants have moved to dismiss this action for failure to state a claim under Fed R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Walsh and Davies also move to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2).

Am. Compl \u00b6 2. Albanese served as Rio Tinto's Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") from May 2007 until January 2013 and on the Board of Directors (\"Board\") from 2006 until January 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Walsh served as CEO from January 2013 until his retirement in July 2016, and as a Board member from June 2009 through July 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Davies served as the Company's chief executive of the Energy &amp; Minerals Group from July 2016 through November 2016, when he was terminated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.

In late 2008, the GoG revoked Rio Tinto's rights to blocks 1 and 2, ultimately awarding them to one of Rio Tinto's competitors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. The GoG maintained that it rescinded Rio Tinto's mining rights because the Company breached the Guinean Mining Code by failing to vigorously develop the mine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Company, however, believed that this was a pretext and that its rivals had bribed GoG officials to secure their share of Simandou.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lest Rio Tinto lose its remaining rights to blocks 3 and 4, the Company poured significant resources into their development, and high-level executives of the Company made frequent visits to the mine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. In 2010, upon his election to power in Guinea, then-President Alpha Conde declared that all mining contracts would be reexamined.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30, 67. As a result, Rio Tinto's competitor was stripped of its rights to blocks 1 and 2.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Payment to Combret\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Fearful that their rights to blocks 3 and 4 would likewise be stripped, Rio Tinto entered into an arrangement with one of President Conde's close friends, Francois Polge de Combret.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. Combret had studied with President Conde in Paris.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. In 2010, Combret established an independent advisory firm called FC Finance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff alleges that, since President\n   Conde's victory, Combret \"has played a key, nefarious role in the renegotiations of Simandou mining rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the course of this relationship, Individual Defendants agreed to pay Combret $10.5 million (\"Combret payment\") for his help protecting the mining rights for blocks 3 and 4, in which they were ultimately successful.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70, 76. Plaintiff alleges this payment constituted a bribe in violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\"FCPA\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7, 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 10, 2011, Walsh, Albanese, and Davies sent multiple emails discussing the Combret payment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-74. In these messages, Davies described the \"very unique and unreplicable services and closeness to the President\" that Combret provided, along with his \"extreme confidence that [Combret would] continue to assist [Rio Tinto] to improve [their] relationship with the GoG and the President.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72. Walsh agreed that there was \"[n]o question that [Combret] delivered sizeable value, but also no question that there is still sizeable risk going forward.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. Albanese cautioned Walsh to \"think about [the] optics to the GoG.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 22, 2011, Rio Tinto disclosed the signing of a \"Settlement Agreement\" with the GoG, whereby their mining rights to blocks 3 and 4 were secured by a payment to the Guinean Public Treasury of $700 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   These actions came on the heels of revelations in April 2010 that Rio Tinto executives had, in 2009, bribed Chinese officials in connection with iron-ore operations in China.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. At that time, Walsh stated that \"[r]eceiving bribes is a clear violation of Chinese law and Rio Tinto's code of conduct,\n   <em>\n    The Way We Work\n   </em>\n   ... [we] will spare no effort in doing everything we can to prevent any similar activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. Walsh further stated that Rio Tinto had \"already implemented a number of improvements to our procedures\" and ordered \"a further far-reaching independent review of our processes and controls.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Allegedly Misleading Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During the class period, Defendants made numerous public statements to Rio Tinto's investors via SEC filings, earnings calls, the Company's code of conduct, media releases, and its website.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-10, 93-186. These statements fall into five main categories: (1) Rio Tinto's commitment to law abidance and anti-corruption,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82-84; 94-100; 110-115; 122-23; 126-31; 134-37; 142-45; 156-162; 169-70; 173-76; 185-86; (2) the Company's work with the GoG,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 108-09; 116-121; 124-25; 138-41; 152-55; 171-72; (3) the Company's contingent liabilities,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101-03; 146-47; 163-64; 177-78; 183-84; (4) the adequacy of the Company's of internal controls,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 104-05; 148-49; 165-66; 179-80; and (5) SOX certifications,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 106, 132, 150, 167, 181. Plaintiff contends that these statements were materially misleading because, in short, Defendants failed to disclose that they paid Combret a $10.5 million bribe which violated their code of conduct, subjected the Company to regulatory and legal action, and made clear the ineffectiveness of their internal controls.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Revelation of Payment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The alleged bribery scheme came to light in 2015, when Rio Tinto's counsel found the May 2011 emails about the Combret payment during discovery in an unrelated case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Counsel then reported the emails to Rio Tinto's head of Legal &amp; Regulatory Affairs, Debra Valentine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80. At some point thereafter, another law firm was retained to conduct an internal investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Rio Tinto first disclosed the payment in a media release on November 9, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 187. The Company stated that it launched an internal investigation into the\n   matter led by external counsel and had notified relevant authorities in the United Kingdom and the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On November 16, 2016, Rio Tinto issued a statement disclosing that it had reviewed the investigation's findings to date and concluded that executives \"failed to maintain the standards expected of them under [Rio Tinto's] code of conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 190. News articles published on November 14, 2016, \u00b6 189, November 16, 2016, \u00b6 191, and November 18, 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 192-94, discussed the alleged bribe and attendant controversy. Rio Tinto disclosed the outfall from the Combret payment as a contingent liability in its 2016 Form 20-F.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 200.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Following the disclosure, \"heads rolled.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. Valentine, Davies, and Hugo Bague, group Executive of Organizational Resources, were terminated in connection with the payment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Additionally, Rio Tinto deferred bonuses and incentive plan awards designated to be paid to Davies and Walsh, valued at $20 million, and even reclaimed money already paid to Davies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 197-99. Plaintiff alleges that this treatment indicates the seriousness of the alleged misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As a result of public statements about the bribe, Rio Tinto's ADR price dropped from $39.65 on November 14, 2016 to $36.55 on November 18, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 195. This caused Plaintiff and other putative class members \"significant\" losses and damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 196.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff filed the complaint commencing this action on December 12, 2016. ECF No. 1.

Pl Opp at 33. First, the definition of \"instrumentality\" in the FCPA is unclear and not defined by statute. However, the text of the FCPA compels a reading of \"instrumentality\" as something other than a person, since the definition of a foreign official includes an \"officer or employee\n   <em>\n    of\n   </em>\n   a ...\n   <em>\n    instrumentality\n   </em>\n   [of a foreign government].\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78dd-1(f)(1)(A) (emphasis added). While not reaching this precise issue, courts assessing the meaning of \"instrumentality\" appear to have interpreted it as an entity, not a person.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Plaintiff does not allege that Combret worked for the GoG in any official capacity. By Plaintiff's own admissions Combret acted \"as an\n   <em>\n    informal\n   </em>\n   advisor\" to President Conde and worked at an \"\n   <em>\n    independent\n   </em>\n   advisory firm.\" Am.

Whether Defendants had Knowledge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiff also fails to allege facts supporting the \"knowing\" element of an FCPA violation. Plaintiff relies on email exchanges between Individual Defendants to allege that Defendants knew that they were making an unlawful payment.

Plaintiff contends that this liability was foreseeable because the DOJ's prosecutorial factors strongly suggest that Rio Tinto would face penalties as a result of the payment. Defendants counter that (1) since the payment was not unlawful, there was no duty to disclose, and (2) any such duty would only arise upon the initiation of an investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Court agrees that Plaintiff does not plead Individual Defendants' awareness that the payment was unlawful and thus that it would expose the company to economic risk.

The complaint does not specify when in 2015 the emails were discovered, when that year Valentine learned about the emails, and whether anyone else at Rio Tinto was alerted at that time. The complaint next provides that \"[t]hereafter, Kirkland &amp; Ellis was retained to conduct an internal investigation[.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   ]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81.

The complaint next alleges that, in its November 9, 2016 media release announcing the payment, Rio Tinto claimed it became aware of the payment on August 29, 2016 and \"launched an investigation into the matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 187. Thus, Plaintiff alleges that Rio Tinto knew about the payment in 2015 but did not disclose it until November 2016, while Rio Tinto contends that it only learned about, and thus investigated, self-reported, and subsequently disclosed, the payment in 2016.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 187, 200.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Accordingly, the earliest that the investigation could have begun is 2015.

The Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiff has not specifically pled that the investigation began in 2015. The most plausible conclusion from the complaint appears to be that the investigation began sometime after August 29, 2016.

Violation of Anti-Bribery Laws\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Plaintiff contends that Individual Defendants' approval of the Combret payment evinces their conscious misbehavior or recklessness. Merely paying Combret is insufficient, however. Plaintiff must allege that Defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the payment was unlawful. Plaintiff does not plead facts suggesting that Defendants knew, or should have known, that Combret was a foreign official. Indeed, Plaintiff does not plead facts suggesting that Combret even\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   a foreign official. The complaint simply does not state a claim that Defendants had any indication that the payment was unlawful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Sanofi Sec.

But the emails do not suggest knowledge of any wrongdoing. The emails discuss services provided by Combret such as \"vouch[ing] for [Rio Tinto's] integrity\" which was impactful due to his \"closeness to the President.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 72. Combret also \"helped [Davies] on a number of communication issues with the President and the Minister of Mines.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7655033\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/944/1202/#p1214\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The emails also state that Combret \"behaved with the utmost integrity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7655033\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/944/1202/#p1214\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The emails appear to discuss legitimate consulting practices. This does not give rise to a cogent inference that Individual Defendants knew, or should have known, that their conduct was unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Since Plaintiff does not state a claim that Individual Defendants acted with scienter by paying Combret, the Court cannot impute their scienter to Rio Tinto on this ground. Moreover, Plaintiff does not plead that anyone else at Rio Tinto knew about the payment at that time. Accordingly, the complaint does not support an inference of corporate scienter here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Knowledge and Concealment of the Payment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Plaintiff next argues that Defendants acted with scienter because they knew about and subsequently concealed the payment from the public. Plaintiff states that Individual Defendants knew about the payment since 2011, and Rio Tinto became aware of it at least in 2015, yet Defendants delayed disclosing the payment until 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   This does not suffice to show scienter. Since Plaintiff does not allege that Individual Defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the payment was unlawful, he cannot state a claim that Defendants acted recklessly by failing to disclose it. Moreover, there is no general duty to disclose internal emails about payments to a consultant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kalnit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9482966\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/264/131/#p142\">\n    264 F.3d at 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (scienter not satisfied when \"duty to disclose ... was not so clear\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Further, Plaintiff does not adduce any facts alleging that Defendants purposefully\n   delayed the investigation or covered up the emails. From the complaint, it is unclear how long Rio Tinto knew about the payment before disclosing it. Even if the timing \"calls [Defendants'] motivations into question,\" that is insufficient to meet Plaintiff's \"correspondingly greater\" burden to allege scienter via recklessness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kalnit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9482966\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/264/131/#p142\">\n    264 F.3d at 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff offers no specific allegations of Defendants' scienter with respect to disclosure of the emails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Termination and Discipline of Executive Committee Members\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that the abrupt terminations of Davies, Valentine, and Bague support an inference of scienter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl \u00b6\u00b6 36, 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Resignations, while insufficient alone, can give rise to an inference of scienter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re OSG Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219549\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/12/622/\">\n    12 F.Supp.3d 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 633 n.84 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (collecting cases). Nevertheless, such an inference is not always appropriate as \"there are any number of reasons that an executive might resign, most of which are not related to fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    In re BISYS Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1304285\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/397/430/#p446\">\n    397 F.Supp.2d 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 446 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Here, the terminations do not give rise to a cogent inference of scienter. First, scienter as to the Individual Defendants would be inappropriate. Plaintiff does not allege that Albanese or Walsh were involved in terminating the aforementioned individuals. Furthermore, Davies was terminated. The fact that Rio Tinto fired him says nothing of his state of mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Second, the complaint does not allege corporate scienter on this ground either. To be sure, the terminations were linked to the alleged fraud. However, Rio Tinto stated that it fired these executives because they \"failed to maintain the standards expected of them under [Rio Tinto's] global code of conduct.\" Am. Compl \u00b6 190. This does not necessarily support the inference that Rio Tinto knew that the executives violated the law, which of course is narrower than a company's ethics code. In any event, that Rio Tinto took disciplinary action in 2016 does not lead to a cogent inference that the Company was aware of, or consciously disregarded, any fraud at the time it was committed. The more plausible inference is that Rio Tinto became aware of misconduct around 2016 and subsequently initiated appropriate disciplinary action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Even if the terminations could give rise to an inference of scienter, the Court is reminded that terminations alone are insufficient to satisfy this element.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re OSG Sec.

Admission of Wrongdoing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the fact that key executives admitted to wrongdoing and self-reported supports an inference of scienter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl \u00b6\u00b6 187-194. Essentially, Plaintiff contends that Defendants would not have self-reported and dealt with the anticipated fallout if they were not aware of unlawful actions. Moreover, Plaintiff suggests that Rio Tinto self-reported to seek leniency from the SEC, fearing harsh consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   As Defendants note, the Company announced that \"something\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   have gone wrong,\" not that any wrongdoing necessarily occurred.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 201 (emphasis added). Further, Rio Tinto admitted violations of ethical obligations, not legal ones.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 190 (\"[T]he board concluded that the executives failed to maintain the standards\n   expected of them under our global code of conduct,\n   <em>\n    The way we work.\n   </em>\n   \"). Finally, self-reporting-even to seek leniency-does not compel an inference \"that [Rio Tinto] was trying to hide anything from its investors.\"\n   <em>\n    Slayton v. Am. Exp.

SOX Certifications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Plaintiff next asserts that Defendants' SOX certifications show scienter. As discussed, Albanese signed the 2011 Form 20-F and Walsh signed the 2012-2015 Form 20-Fs. Davies did not sign any SOX certifications, and thus this factor could not support scienter as to him. Rio Tinto's scienter could be inferred from that of the certifying officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Courts have determined that \"signing the SOX certifications might be indicative of scienter.\"\n   <em>\n    Menaldi\n   </em>\n   , 277 F.Supp.3d at 517. However, Plaintiff \"cannot raise an inference of fraudulent intent based on the signing of a certification without alleging any facts to show a concomitant awareness of or recklessness to the materially misleading nature of the statements.\"\n   <em>\n    Plumbers &amp; Pipefitters Nat.

Accordingly, the SOX certifications do not support an inference of scienter as to any Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    vi. Core Operations Doctrine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff relies on the core operations doctrine to support scienter. The core operations doctrine \"permits an inference that a company and its senior executives have knowledge of information concerning the 'core operations' of a business.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Hi-Crush Partners L.P.

In any event, for the same reasons elucidated as to Walsh the Court would hold that jurisdiction over Albanese is proper.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    For the reasons adduced below, if the Court determined that personal jurisdiction over Davies was appropriate it would still dismiss the claims against him pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    The parties dispute whether Plaintiff must plead the existence of the underlying violation with the specificity required under Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA. Because Plaintiff has failed to meet either standard, the Court need not reach this issue.
