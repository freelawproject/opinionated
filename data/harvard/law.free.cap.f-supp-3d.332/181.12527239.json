BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 1, 2016, the Department of Education promulgated the Borrower Defense Regulations, a package of regulatory changes to federal student loan programs that was to become effective on July 1, 2017. William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (\"Borrower Defense Regulations\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2075%2C926\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. 75,926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Nov. 1, 2016). Shortly before the effective date, the California Association of Private Postsecondary Schools (\"CAPPS\") brought suit challenging the regulations, and, on June 2, 2017, CAPPS sought a preliminary injunction blocking the implementation of two aspects of the new rules. Dkt. 1, Dkt. 6,\n   <em>\n    CAPPS v. DeVos\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. 17-999 (D.D.C.). But that motion was never fully briefed or decided because the Department, on its own accord, issued a stay under \u00a7 705 of the APA, postponing not only the effective date of the two changes that CAPPS had asked the Court preliminarily to enjoin, but most of the other portions of the new regulations as well. Section 705 Stay,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2027%2C621\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. at 27,621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Separately, the Department issued an interim final rule on October 24, 2017, that delayed the effective date of the Borrower Defense Regulations to July 1, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (\"Interim Final Rule\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2049%2C114\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 49,114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oct. 24, 2017). That same day, the Department also issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (\"NPRM\") to further delay the effective date to July 1, 2019. William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (\"October 24, 2017 NPRM\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2049%2C155\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 49,155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oct. 24, 2017). Then, on February 14, 2018, the Department issued a final rule delaying the effective date of the Borrower Defense Regulations until July 1, 2019. Final Delay Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%206%2C458\">\n    83 Fed.

As the Court explained, the Department had stayed the Borrower Defense Regulations pending the resolution of the\n   <em>\n    CAPPS\n   </em>\n   litigation on three grounds: the\n   <em>\n    CAPPS\n   </em>\n   litigation raised \"serious questions\" about the validity of the Borrower Defense Regulations; the delay would not cause the government any significant harm; and the Department was, in any event, reconsidering the regulations, and the delay would minimize confusion while that process proceeded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 106-07, at *22 (citing Section 705 Stay, 82 Fed.

At the September 14, 2018 hearing, the Department stated that, \"to the extent [the Court] feels that vacatur is appropriate ... [the Department] is not prepared ... to oppose that.\" Dkt. 90 at 55. Moreover, as the Court has previously noted, the Department declined to address this issue in opposing Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 58-1 at 79-80 n.28. Accordingly, the Court will vacate the Final Delay Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Section 705 Stay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs and the Department disagree, however, as to the appropriate remedy with respect to the Section 705 Stay. Plaintiffs ask the Court to vacate the stay and to allow the Borrower Defense Regulations to take effect immediately. Dkt. 55-1 at 79; Dkt. 56 at 72. In the alternative, they ask the Court to allow the Borrower Defense Regulations to take immediate effect, but, if necessary, to issue a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") in\n   <em>\n    CAPPS\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. 17-999, staying the provision prohibiting predispute arbitration agreements and class action waivers-the only provision that CAPPS had previously sought to enjoin. Dkt. 90 at 48. The Department counters that the appropriate remedy is remand without vacatur, or, in the alternative, to \"stay any implementation pending the [preliminary injunction] briefing\" in\n   <em>\n    CAPPS\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. 17-999.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41. The Department also represented that, in the event the Court orders the Borrower Defense Regulations to take immediate effect, the Department requires at least 60 days to implement the regulations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court declines to adopt Plaintiffs' second suggestion. The Court cannot sua sponte issue a TRO in\n   <em>\n    CAPPS\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. 17-999, when CAPPS itself has not requested one. The Court, accordingly, turns to the\n   <em>\n    Allied-Signal\n   </em>\n   factors to analyze whether remand without vacatur is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The first consideration-whether the Department could substantiate the Section 705 Stay on remand-presents a close call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Department could, \"in theory,\" cure the deficiencies identified in the Court's earlier opinion, but it \"may face practical obstacles when attempting to remedy them.\"\n   <em>\n    NAACP v.

To begin, given the incongruency between the scope of the Section 705 Stay (which covers 22 provisions) and the scope of relief sought in the motion for a preliminary injunction that CAPPS filed and then withdrew,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bauer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526776\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/325/74/\">\n    325 F.Supp.3d at 107-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204353656\">\n    2018 WL 4353656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *23, the Department may not be able to justify the full breadth of the Section 705 Stay. The Department would also need to explain why it believes CAPPS has raised serious questions about the lawfulness of the Borrower Defense Regulations; why it no longer ascribes to the view that the prohibition of predistpute arbitration agreements and class action waivers is lawful, as it had previously stated,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Borrower Defense Regulations,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2075%2C926\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. at 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,021 -24; and how that conclusion relates to other provisions of the Borrower Defense Regulations. Nevertheless, because there is a \"nontrivial likelihood\" that the Department could justify the Section 705 Stay on remand,\n   <em>\n    NAACP v. Trump\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p243\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    WorldCom, Inc. v.

In light of the\n   <em>\n    CAPPS\n   </em>\n   litigation, which is now unstayed, and the\n   <em>\n    CAPPS\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's entitlement to be heard on the merits of its preliminary injunction, the Court concludes that vacating the Section 705 Stay, and allowing the Borrower Defense Regulations to take immediate effect, could result in an \"interim change\" that \"may itself be changed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 245 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Allied-Signal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3813033,10510774\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/988/146/\">\n    988 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   150-51 ). If the Court were, for example, to vacate the Section 705 Stay, and then conclude that CAPPS is entitled to preliminary relief, the Borrower Defense Regulations might take effect this week, only to be enjoined, at least in part, two or three weeks later. Without any advance notice and opportunity to prepare, such an abrupt change would cause regulatory vertigo. As such, the threat of disruption also weighs in favor of remand without immediate vacatur, at least for a few weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Because this case is about the consequences of delay, however, the Court is mindful that, in crafting the appropriate remedy, time is of the essence. The further delay that would result from remanding the Section 705 Stay to the Department for further explanation without vacatur risks depriving Plaintiffs of meaningful relief. Accordingly, the Court will chart an intermediate course: the Court will vacate the Section 705 Stay, but stay the vacatur for 30 days from the date of its opinion declaring the Section 705 Stay unlawful. This will allow the Department to attempt to remedy the deficiencies in the Section 705 Stay while the\n   <em>\n    CAPPS\n   </em>\n   litigation proceeds in an expeditious manner; it will also curtail the harm to student borrowers that a remand without vacatur would otherwise engender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   It is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Final Delay Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%206%2C458\">\n    83 Fed.
