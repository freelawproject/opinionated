In 1994, the U.S. Department of Health and\n   Human Services, Office of Inspector General (\"OIG\"), issued a Special Fraud Alert that addressed laboratory practices that violated the Anti-Kickback Statute, including, but not limited to, \"routine waiver of Medicare Part B co-payments and deductibles.\" Publication of OIG Special Fraud Alerts,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20Fed.%20Reg.%2065%2C372\">\n    59 Fed.

And the OIG has made clear that \"disguising remuneration for Federal referrals through offers or payments of inflated amounts for non-Federal business or simply by offering or paying remuneration for non-Federal referrals to 'pull through' the Federal business\" \"may violate the [A]nti-[K]ickback [S]tatute.\" Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs. Office of Inspector Gen., Advisory Opinion No. 00-8: Spectrum Housing, d/b/a Housing Referrals of Maine at 5 (2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Consequently, in 2005, the OIG issued an Advisory Opinion stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Where a laboratory pays a referring physician to perform blood draws, particularly where the amount paid is more than the laboratory receives in Medicare reimbursement, an inference arises that the compensation is paid as an inducement to the physician to refer patients to the laboratory ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs. Office of Inspector Gen., Advisory Opinion No. 05-08 at 4 (2005) (\"2005 OIG Advisory Opinion\").

The district court in\n   <em>\n    Hunter Laboratories\n   </em>\n   did not state that discounts cannot constitute an unlawful referral as a matter of law; rather, it held that the plaintiffs \"fail[ed] to provide sufficient particularity to satisfy the pleading standard of Rule 9(b).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the relator here does not allege that Boston Heart only provided discounts on co-payment and deductible payments, but rather alleges that Boston Heart waived these fees entirely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Am.

Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Hunter Laboratories\n   </em>\n   does not provide a basis for dismissal due to failure to allege inducement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Third, Boston Heart argues that the 1994 OIG Special Fraud Alert, upon which the relator relies to support his allegation that waiving co-payments and deductibles constitute kickbacks, does not reference privately insured patients, and therefore is not applicable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 25 (\"[T]he 1994 Alert concerns Medicare beneficiaries and does not apply to waivers of amounts owed by privately insured patients.\"). The relator argues in response that \"Boston Heart's reading of the 1994 OIG Fraud Alert is overly narrow and ignores the rationale underlying the OIG's position,\" namely, that the payments at issue in that document \"were improper not because it was a managed care patient or government funded payer, but instead because promising a physician [his or her] patients will not be charged a co-pay is a thing of value.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 19-20 (emphasis removed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Court agrees with the relator. Although Boston Heart is correct that the 1994 OIG Special Fraud Alert references waiver of charges to managed care patients as an \"example[ ] of lab services arrangements that may violate the [A]nti-[K]ickback [S]tatute,\" it notes that this example fits the category of \"cases where the provision of free services results in a benefit to the provider,\" and thus, \"the [A]nti-[K]ickback [S]tatute is implicated.\" 1994 OIG Special Fraud Alert,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20Fed.%20Reg.%2065%2C372\">\n    59 Fed.

In this case, the relator alleges that Boston Heart waives physicians' privately insured patients' co-payments and deductibles, \"so long as the physicians send all of their lipid-related business-especially the highly profitable Medicare business-to [Boston Heart].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Am.

In the Court's view, this allegation, if true, would also implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute because it would constitute the provision of free services,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the waiver of co-payments and deductibles, that result in a benefit to the provider,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , by saving the physicians' time not spent on explaining co-payment and deductible charges to patients and providing them an opportunity to market free laboratory testing. And, the relator alleges that the objective of Boston\n   Heart's waiver of co-payments and deductibles scheme is to gain additional Medicare business, which in turn results in federal funds being acquired by Boston Heart as a result of its fraudulent kickback scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20Fed.%20Reg.%2065%2C372\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20Fed.%20Reg.%2065%2C372\">\n    \u00b6 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, Boston Heart's argument that the relator fails to plausibly allege inducement because the 1994 OIG Special Fraud Alert does not specifically reference privately insured patients fails. Therefore, the Court finds that the relator sufficiently alleges that Boston Heart's waiver of patients' co-payments and deductibles constitutes a kickback, and therefore, sufficiently alleges the falsity element of a false presentment claim under the False Claims Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Boston Heart's Knowledge that Its Payment of Packaging Fees Was Unlawful\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Regarding the relator's allegation that Boston Heart had knowledge that its inflated packaging fees paid to physicians would induce the physicians to increase their referral of Medicare business to Boston Heart, the relator relies on Boston Heart's actions following the OIG's 2014 Special Fraud Alert that laboratories' payment of packaging fees, among other services, to referring physicians \"could constitute illegal remuneration under the [A]nti-[K]ickback [S]tatute.\" 2014 OIG Special Fraud Alert at 1. According to the relator, after the Special Fraud Alert was issued, \"rather than stop the practice of incentivizing physician referrals through cash payments, Boston Heart simply changed its scheme to further conceal it by using third parties to make the payments to physician staff and families, rather than Boston Heart paying physicians directly.\" 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 63. Furthermore, the relator alleges that a Boston Heart representative told a physician: \"[the Department of Justice] said we can't pay you [the physician] directly, so we pay [a third party], they take some of the money and they pay you.\n   <em>\n    It's all about perception\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66 (emphasis and brackets in original). Finally, the\n   relator alleges that Boston Heart's CEO and two members of its Board of Directors \"were involved in the decision to institute the payment of packaging fees to physicians.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Boston Heart argues that \"it is not sufficient to allege that a low-level employee or agent's knowledge can be imputed to the company as a whole,\" Def.'s Mem. at 7 (citing\n   <em>\n    SAIC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553665,6053149\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/626/1257/\">\n    626 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1275 ), and that the relator \"failed to describe the source of [his knowledge of its employees' alleged statements],\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553665,6053149\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/626/1257/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 10 n.7. Boston Heart further argues that the relator must allege that Boston Heart \"had knowledge that it was submitting false claims and that it\n   <em>\n    took specific actions to do so\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (emphasis added). However, the relator\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   allege that Boston Heart took specific actions to submit false claims, alleging that Boston Heart began funneling excess packaging fees through specific third parties in order to avoid discovery because it knew that what it was doing was illegal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d. Am. Compl. \u00b6 63;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66 (alleging that Boston Heart funneled this money through Biotex, LLmobileLab, and VeniExpress). Putting aside the statements allegedly made by the Boston Heart representative, taking the relator's allegations as true, as it must, the Court finds that the relator sufficiently alleges Boston Heart's knowledge of this purported scheme by alleging that Boston Heart's CEO and two members of its Board of Directors \"were involved in the decision to institute the payment of packaging fees to physicians,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103, that Boston Heart \"promote[d] this practice by sponsoring seminars that discuss[ed] how profitable splitting up tests between laboratories can be for physicians,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61, and that Boston Heart changed its practice of directly paying referring physicians for their packaging fees following the 2014 OIG Special Fraud Alert to instead paying those payments through third parties to avoid government detection,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 63-66. Like the alleged waiver scheme, the Court concludes that the relator sufficiently alleges Boston Heart's knowledge, given that the relator contends that Boston Heart altered its practice to hide its scheme in response to government action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lutz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270196\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/225/487/#p501\">\n    225 F.Supp.3d at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that the relator sufficiently alleged the defendants' knowledge by alleging that they \"knew of the illegality of the [processing and handling] fees and tried to disguise them\"). The Court therefore finds that the relator has sufficiently pleaded Boston Heart's alleged knowledge of this scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Boston Heart's Knowledge of Physicians' Self-Referrals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The relator does not discuss Boston Heart's knowledge regarding self-referrals by physicians who were Boston Heart shareholders, and he never specifically alleges that Boston Heart knew that it received referrals from such physicians apart from the letters that the relator sent Boston Heart following his resignation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 83-85, 99, 105. Therefore, the Court does not find that the relator sufficiently alleges Boston Heart's knowledge of this purported scheme as required under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A). Accordingly, the relator cannot proceed on this theory of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Boston Heart's Knowledge that Its Payment of Speaking and Consulting Fees Was Unlawful\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Boston Heart argues that the relator's complaint is \"devoid of any indicia of [Boston Heart's] intent to operate a kickback scheme\" through the payment of speaking and consulting fees to a physician and nurse practitioner. Def.'s Mem. at 29 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   , 651 Fed.Appx. at 116 ). However, as discussed before, the relator alleges that Boston Heart paid \"outrageous\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   speaking and consulting fees to the physician and nurse practitioner with the specific purpose of expanding its packaging fee kickback scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d.

Compl. \u00b6 7 (\"The consulting fees were paid primarily for [the physician and nurse practitioner] to solicit physician clients for Boston Heart by speaking at seminars where they explained to physicians how much money they could make by receiving packaging fees and splitting specimens between multiple labs ....\") (emphasis omitted) ). Taking the relator's allegations as true, and because the Court has already found that the relator sufficiently alleges Boston Heart's knowledge of the packaging fee scheme, the Court finds that the relator sufficiently alleges Boston Heart's knowledge of this alleged scheme by pleading that the fees it paid to the physician and nurse practitioner were above market value with the specific purpose of perpetuating its scheme to defraud the government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Boston Heart's Knowledge that It Was Performing Medically Unnecessary Testing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The relator alleges that Boston Heart included medically unnecessary tests in its panels. 2d. Am. Compl. \u00b6 95. In\n   <em>\n    Groat II\n   </em>\n   , this Court held \"that even though the Medicare statute requires the laboratory to certify the medical necessity of any test for which it makes a claim for payment, the laboratory is not required to make an independent determination of medical necessity, but rather may rely on the ordering physician's determination,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523924\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/296/155/#p163\">\n    296 F.Supp.3d at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the relator in that case sufficiently \"allege[d] that Boston Heart engaged in a scheme to encourage non-cardiology physicians to order medically unnecessary tests through a false marketing campaign and pre-printed test requisition forms,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523924\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/296/155/#p163\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523924\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/296/155/#p163\">\n    at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the relator alleges that Boston Heart employees encouraged physicians to use its test panels, which included more tests than the industry standard, and that the additional tests were not medically necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-13. However, the relator never specifically alleges that Boston Heart\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   that these additional tests were medically unnecessary tests, nor can the Court reasonably infer Boston Heart's knowledge on the basis of any alleged scheme, like the one in\n   <em>\n    Groat\n   </em>\n   , where the relator specifically alleged that \" 'General Practitioners and other non-cardiology physicians [we]re Boston Heart's primary target' for its allegedly false marketing statements regarding the medical necessity of its tests.\"\n   <em>\n    Groat I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274593\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/13/#p27\">\n    255 F.Supp.3d at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, the relator in this case merely alleges, with respect to this theory, that \"[Boston Heart] knew that Federal law prohibited code stacking and the manipulation of Medicare reimbursement.\" 2d. Am. Compl. \u00b6 96.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Court finds that the relator has not sufficiently alleged that Boston Heart knew that the additional tests on its test panels were medically unnecessary, and therefore, the relator cannot proceed on this theory of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court is satisfied that the relator properly alleges\n   Boston Heart's knowledge for his false presentment theories of liability regarding (1) the waiver of co-payments and deductibles, (2) the payment of packaging fees, and (3) the payment of speaking and consulting fees. The Court dismisses the self-referral and medically unnecessary testing theories of liability because the relator has not adequately alleged Boston Heart's knowledge with respect to these theories as required under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Boston Heart argues that the relator's Second Amended Complaint does not satisfy this heightened pleading requirement because for all three theories of liability that have otherwise survived the motion to dismiss, he does not allege \"who at Boston Heart made the [kickback] agreements with physicians (or sent the agreements that physicians 'received'); when [ ] such [kickback] agreements occur[red]; where and how [ ] such [kickback] agreements come to be; and ... the terms of the agreement[s].\" Def.'s Mem. at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Court finds that the relator\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   sufficiently allege the \"who\" requirement of Rule 9(b),\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , which Boston Heart employees were part of the scheme, having identified the following individuals as knowing participants of all three purported schemes: (1) Boston Heart's President and CEO, Susan Hertzberg; (2) the Chairman of Boston Heart's Board of Directors, Peter Parker (3) Boston Heart's Chief Business Officer, Alice Limkaking; (4) Boston's Heart's General Counsel, Frank Yunes; and (5) Boston Heart's Director, Jeff Crison. 2d.

Boston Heart argues that the relator \"does not identify the amount of [packaging] fees Boston Heart paid with respect to any claim submitted to the government.\" Def.'s Mem. at 16. The relator argues in response that he did provide the amount of the packaging fees,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Relator's Opp'n at 16, because he alleged that Boston Heart paid LlmobileLab, Biotex, and VeniExpress $15, 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 64, and sometimes up to $25, per blood draw,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62. The Court therefore agrees with the relator that he provided the amount of the packaging fees that Boston Heart allegedly paid to physicians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Boston Heart next argues that the relator \"does not identify the fair market value for the [packaging] services associated with such fees.\" Def.'s Mem. at 16. The relator alleges that the standard\n   <em>\n    draw fee\n   </em>\n   allowed by Medicare is $3, 2d. Am. Compl. \u00b6 55, and cites to an OIG Advisory Opinion stating that a $6 draw fee is illegal,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54 (citing 2005 OIG Advisory Opinion). Although the relator does not cite or provide what constitutes a standard packaging fee,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-55, this is presumably because CMS has not established one,\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   2014 OIG Special Fraud Alert, but the Special Fraud Alert, in its discussion of packaging fees, states that \"arrangements providing free or below-market goods or services to actual or potential referral sources are suspect and may violate the [A]nti-[K]ickback [S]tatute, depending on the circumstances,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (providing various factors to consider \"[w]hen determining the fair market value of a physician's services\"). And, OIG noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   Whether an actual violation of the [Anti-Kickback S]tatute occurs depends on the intent of the parties-the [A]nti-[K]ickback [S]tatute prohibits the knowing and willful payment of such amounts if even one purpose of the payment is to induce or reward referrals of Federal health care program business.\n   <em>\n    This is true regardless of whether the payment is fair market value for services rendered.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (emphasis added). Here, the relator has alleged that Boston Heart's intent in covering physicians' packaging fees was to \"induce[ ] physicians to order tests from [Boston Heart],\" 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 62. Because the OIG has made clear that the Anti-Kickback Statute may be violated\n   even if the payment in question is of an amount equivalent to fair market value, so long as the parties intend to induce referrals of federal health care business, the Court does not find that the relator's failure to provide a fair market value for packaging fees is grounds for dismissal under Rule 9(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Boston Heart next argues that the relator \"does not identify any specific payment to any specific physician.\" Def.'s Mem. at 16. The relator responds that he \"identified dozens of physicians who received packaging fees and zero balance billing and who made referrals to Boston Heart.\" Relator's Opp'n at 16;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 98 (providing a list of several specific physicians who purportedly received packaging fees or waivers of co-payments and deductibles). Because the relator provides the names and locations of over fifty physicians who allegedly referred Medicare business to Boston Heart after allegedly receiving inflated packaging fees, 2d Am.

The Court is unpersuaded by this argument. Although a concrete example can be helpful in analyzing the pleading of claims under Rule 9(b), other members of this Court have found that \"plaintiffs are not required to 'affix actual claims for payment to the complaint.' \"\n   <em>\n    Head\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4259062\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/798/186/#p203\">\n    798 F.Supp.2d at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pogue I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9330270\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/238/258/#p264\">\n    238 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   269 );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kellogg Brown &amp; Root Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4155738\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/800/143/#p154\">\n    800 F.Supp.2d at 153-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Whether the Relator Satisfies the \"What\" Requirement of Rule 9(b) Regarding Boston Heart's Payment of Speaking and Consulting Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Boston Heart argues that the relator's characterization of Boston Heart's speaking and consulting fees paid to a nurse practitioner and a physician as \"outrageous,\" 2d. Am. Compl. \u00b6 7, is \"conclusory,\" Def.'s Mem. at 29. The Court agrees. The relator alleges that the speaking and consulting fees paid by Boston Heart were $200,000, and that the payment of this amount was \"outrageous.\" 2d. Am. Compl. \u00b6 7. Although the Court must treat this allegation as true under Rule 12(b)(6), and finds that the relator plausibly alleges that a kickback occurred,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 68-69, Rule 9(b) requires \"a party [to] state with particularity the circumstances constituting\n   fraud or mistake,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Without providing any further detail regarding why payment of the $200,000 qualifies as an \"outrageous\" speaking and consulting fee for a physician or nurse practitioner, the Court cannot find that the relator alleges a fraud with sufficient particularity. Although the relator does allege in the introduction of his Second Amended Complaint that Boston Heart paid such speaking and consulting fees to the physician and nurse practitioner to \"explain[ ] to [other] physicians how much money they could make by receiving packaging fees,\" 2d. Am. Compl. \u00b6 7, and also alleges that packaging fees are part of Boston Heart's kickback scheme,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4, he never specifically alleges that the physician and nurse practitioner were promoting\n   <em>\n    inflated\n   </em>\n   packaging fees, nor does he provide any further detail regarding the scheme or even mention the scheme again,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   With nothing more than an attenuated connection between Boston Heart's payment of speaking and consulting fees and the alleged inflation of packaging fees, the Court concludes that the relator fails to allege a speaking and consulting fee fraud with sufficient particularity under Rule 9(b). Accordingly, the Court holds that the \"what\" requirement of Rule 9(b) has not been satisfied, and therefore dismisses the theory of liability based on the payment of speaking and consulting fees to the physician and nurse practitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   In conclusion, as to the relator's false presentment cause of action, the Court finds that two theories of liability survive Boston Heart's motion to dismiss: (1) the waiver of patient co-payments and deductibles theory, and (2) the payment of inflated packaging fees to physicians theory. The Court dismisses the three following theories of liability: (1) the physician self-referral theory, (2) the medically unnecessary testing theory, and (3) the payment of excessive speaking and consulting fees theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants in part and denies in part Boston Heart's motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. Specifically, the Court grants the motion and dismisses the following theories of liability under both the false presentment and false statements causes of action (Counts I and II): (1) the payment of speaking and consulting fees theory, (2) the physician self-referral theory, and (3) the medically unnecessary testing theory. The theories of liability regarding (1) the waiver of patient co-payments and deductibles and (2) the payment of inflated packaging fees to physicians survive under both Counts I and II. Finally, the Court grants Boston Heart's motion to dismiss the reverse false claims cause of action (Count III).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this 12th day of September, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    In addition to the filings already identified, the Court considered the following submissions in rendering its decision: (1) the Memorandum in Support of Boston Heart Diagnostics Corporation's Motion to Dismiss Relator's Second Amended Complaint (\"Def.'s Mem.\"); (2) the Relator's Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Relator's Second Amended Complaint (\"Relator's Opp'n\"); and (3) Boston Heart Diagnostics Corporation's Reply in Support of its Motion to Dismiss Relator's Second Amended Complaint (\"Def.'s Reply\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    The Court takes judicial notice of the Processing Manual because \"judicial notice may be taken of public records and government documents available from reliable sources.\"\n    <em>\n     Johnson v.

Although it is true that the relator does not allege receipt of his letters, given the Court's conclusion that the content of the letters, even if received, does not satisfy the knowledge requirement on the part of Boston Heart, the Court need not decide the issue of whether alleging that letters were sent, without alleging their receipt, sufficiently alleges Boston Heart's knowledge.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    The Court recognizes that the relator also alleges, in discussing the packaging fees scheme, that \"Boston Heart actively encourage[d] physicians to order additional tests-whether medically necessary or not-in order to increase the number of 'packaging' fees physicians receive[d].\" 2d Am.
