Conclusion...785\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   This is an action by Plaintiffs Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \"CFPB\") and the People of the State of New York, by Eric T. Schneiderman, Attorney General for the State of New York (\"NYAG\" or the \"Attorney General\") (collectively, the \"Government\"), against Defendants RD Legal Funding, LLC; RD Legal Finance, LLC; RD Legal Funding Partners, LP (collectively, the \"RD Entities\"); and Roni Dersovitz, the founder and owner of the RD Entities (together with the RD Entities, the \"Defendants\"). The Government asserts that the Defendants violated certain provisions of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (\"CFPA\" or the \"Act\"). NYAG independently asserts that the RD Entities are liable under New York law for the same actions and events that form the basis of the CFPA claims. Defendants move to dismiss the Complaint (ECF No. 1) on three principal grounds. First, Defendants argue that the CFPB is unconstitutionally structured and therefore lacks the authority to bring claims under the CFPA. Second, Defendants contend that the Court lacks federal jurisdiction because the RD Entities are not \"covered persons\" under the CFPA and therefore do not come within the Act's jurisdictional purview. Third and finally, the RD Entities move to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to state a claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As set out below, because the CFPB's structure is unconstitutional, it lacks the authority to bring claims under the CFPA and is hereby terminated as a party to this action. The NYAG, however, has independent\n   authority to bring claims under the CFPA. The Court concludes that NYAG has alleged plausibly claims under the CFPA and under New York law. Accordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss the Complaint is denied. (ECF No. 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The following facts are drawn from the Complaint, (Complaint (\"Compl.\"), ECF No. 1), the Assignment and Sale Agreements (hereinafter the \"Purchase Agreements\") attached as exhibits to the Affidavit of Roni Dersovitz, (Affidavit of Roni Dersovitz (\"Dersovitz Aff.\"), Exs. A-1 to A-20, B-1 to B-5, ECF No. 41-1), and the National Football League (\"NFL\") Concussion Litigation Settlement Agreement (\"NCLSA\"), (Dersovitz Aff. Ex. 6), which Defendants attached to their motion to dismiss. The allegations in the Complaint are accepted as true for purposes of the instant motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The CFPB and NYAG bring this action against the RD Entities and their founder and owner, Roni Dersovitz. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-19.) The RD Entities are companies that offer cash advances to consumers waiting on payouts from settlement agreements or judgments entered in their favor. The Government alleges that Defendants misled these consumers into entering cash advance agreements that the Defendants represented as valid and enforceable sales but, in reality, functioned as usurious loans that were void under state law. (Compl. \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   At issue in this case are two specific groups of consumers (collectively, the \"Consumers\") with which the RD Entities transacted: (1) class members in the National Football League (\"NFL\") Concussion Litigation class action (\"NFL Class Members\" or \"Class Members\") and (2) individuals (\"Eligible Claimants\") who qualify for compensation under the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001 (\"VCF\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2040101\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    The NFL Class Members\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   On January 31, 2012, a federal multidistrict litigation was created in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for lawsuits on behalf of former NFL players who suffer from mild traumatic brain injury due to playing professional football.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement (hereinafter \"Settlement Agreement\") Preamble,\n   <em>\n    In re NFL Players'\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Concussion Injury Litig.\n   </em>\n   , MDL No. 2323 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 13, 2015) (ECF No. 6481-1). Defendants in that case, the NFL and NFL Properties LLC, ultimately agreed that settlement of the claims in that complex putative class action was appropriate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2040101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Recitals (K). Accordingly, on February 13, 2015, a federal district court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania approved the NFL Concussion Litigation Settlement Agreement (\"NCLSA\") between the Class Members, by and through class counsel, and defendants NFL and NFL Properties LLC.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2040101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Preamble.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The NFL Class Members at issue in this case are former NFL players who have been diagnosed with neurogenerative diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (\"CTE\"), Alzheimer's, or Parkinson's disease and who have received notification of their entitlement to a settlement award under the NCLSA for these injuries. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    September 11, 2001 James Zadroga Victims Compensation Fund Eligible Claimants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In January 2011, President Obama signed the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 (\"Zadroga Act\"), which served to renew the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001 (the \"VCF\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2040101\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Congress created the VCF to provide compensation to individuals and personal representatives of deceased individuals who suffered physical injury or were killed as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks or were harmed during the removal of debris immediately following those attacks. Proposed Rule, Federal Register, Vol. 76 No. 119 (Jun. 21, 2011). The Zadroga Act authorizes a Special Master appointed by the Attorney General to carry out the administration of the VCF by enacting substantive and procedural rules, including making determinations as to what award amount an eligible individual (\"Eligible Claimant\") is entitled to under the VCF.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20104.51\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   According to the Complaint, the Eligible Claimants with whom the RD Entities transact have received an award letter from the VCF's Special Master indicating the amount of compensation to which they are entitled under the VCF. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20405\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), 405(c), 406(a). Eligible Claimants who are entitled to compensation include individuals who suffer from respiratory illnesses and cancers related to their exposure to dust and debris at the World Trade Center site as well as from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety disorder, and memory loss following the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks. (Compl. \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    The Purchase Agreements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   According to the Complaint, after a Consumer has received final approval and a notice of the award amount to which he or she is entitled, the RD Entities offer to take a security interest in the Consumer's settlement award or a portion thereof (the \"Property\" or \"Property Amount\"). (Compl. \u00b6 20.) In the contracts that Defendants enter into with Consumers, the RD Entities purport to \"acquire the full risks and benefits of ownership of the Property and acquire the full right, title and interest in the Property.\" (Def. Br. Ex. 1.) In exchange, the RD Entities offer Consumers an immediate \"lump sum\" cash payment that represents a portion of the total award to which the Consumer is entitled. (Compl. \u00b6 24.) In return, the Consumer agrees to repay a larger amount,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Property Amount, to the RD Entities after receiving its settlement payment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Purchase Agreements contain a no recourse provision that relieves the Consumer\n   of his or her obligation to repay the RD Entities in the event that the RD Entities are unable to recover the settlement award from the Consumer's third-party obligor,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the NFL Settlement Fund or the VCF. (Def. Br. Ex. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The RD Entities enter into two types of contracts with Consumers. Under the first, the RD Entities advance a lump sum of cash to the Consumer. The repayment amount that the Consumer owes to RD remains the same, regardless of when the Consumer receives the award from the VCF or the NFL Settlement Fund. (Compl. \u00b6 31.) Under the second type of contract, the amount the Consumer repays turns on when the claims administrator disburses the Consumer's award. The longer it takes for the Consumer to receive his or her settlement payment, the more the Consumer owes to the RD Entities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   After entering into the Purchase Agreement, Consumers are obligated immediately to forward any monies received from the NFL Claims Administrator or the VCF to the RD Entities until the Consumer has paid off the agreed-upon amount. (Compl. \u00b6 26.) After the amount due under the agreement has been paid to the RD Entities, the Consumer is entitled to keep any balance in excess of that amount that he or she receives from the NFL Settlement Fund or VCF Claims Administrator.

In January 2017, RD Legal Funding, LLC filed a complaint against the CFPB in the Southern District of New York seeking relief in the form of,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a declaration that the purchase of legal receivables from customers are true sales and that, therefore, RD Legal Funding, LLC's business is not within the CFPB's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    RD Legal Funding, LLC v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-cv-00010 (LAP) (S.D.N.Y.) (ECF No. 1); (Def. Br. 7.) According to Defendants, RD Legal Funding, LLC filed that action in response to civil investigative demands (\"CID\") that the CFPB served on RD Legal Funding, LLC as well as a formal request from the CFPB to depose an RD Legal Funding, LLC representative in connection with the CFPB's investigation of the RD Entities. (Def. Br. 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Two days after filing suit in federal court against the CFPB, RD Legal Funding Partners, LP and RD Legal Funding, LLC filed a similar suit in New York state court against NYAG seeking a declaration that the VCF Purchase Agreements are true sales.\n   <em>\n    RD Legal Funding, LLC, et al. v. Schneiderman, et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-cv-00681 (LAP) (S.D.N.Y.) (ECF No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Following RD Legal Funding, LLC and RD Legal Funding Partners, LP's actions against the CFPB and NYAG in this Court and New York state court, the CFPB and NYAG filed this enforcement action against the RD Entities on February 7, 2017. (ECF No. 1.) On May 15, 2017, the RD Entities moved to dismiss the Complaint on several grounds, including lack of federal jurisdiction due to the CFPB's unconstitutional structure, the CFPB's lack of jurisdiction over the RD Entities as \"covered persons\" under the CFPA, and for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (ECF No. 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In July 2017, class counsel for the NFL Class Members requested that this Court allow it to file an amicus brief in opposition to the RD Entities' motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, that determination of the validity of the assignment provisions in the NFL Purchase Agreements be referred to\n   United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. (ECF No. 45.) Class counsel stated that it believed referral of this question to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania would be appropriate because that court has continuing jurisdiction over the administration and interpretation of the NCLSA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement \u00a7 27.1 (\"The Court retains continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over this action including jurisdiction over ... all Settlement Class Members....\"). Class counsel explained that referral of this question would ensure uniformity of adjudication through \"a single up-or-down ruling that [would] apply not only to Defendants in this action but also to other potential lenders to class members who might assert the same defense.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because interpretation of the NCLSA's terms falls squarely within \"the administration and interpretation of the [NCLSA]\" and referral would promote judicial economy, this Court concluded that referral of the anti-assignment clause question to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania was appropriate. (ECF No. 59.) On September 15, 2017, this Court referred the assignment question to the Honorable Anita B. Brody in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, who was presiding over the NFL Concussion Litigation. (ECF No. 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   On December 8, 2017, Judge Brody issued an Explanation and Order which concluded that the anti-assignment clause in the NFL Concussion Litigation Settlement Agreement \"unambiguously prohibits\" NFL class members \"from assigning or attempting to assign any monetary claims [under the NFL Settlement Agreement],\" thereby rendering \"any such purported assignment ... void, invalid and of no force and effect\" under New York law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Explanation and Order (hereinafter, \"Explanation and Order\"),\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NFL Players' Concussion Injury Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:12-md-2323-AB (E.D.

Under this framework, Judge Brody concluded that the term \"relating to\" in the NCLSA's anti-assignment clause, which prohibits Class Members from assigning claims \"relating to the subject matter of the Class Action Complaint,\" encompassed assignment of Class Members' claims to settlement awards under the NCLSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Explanation and Order at 3, 4 n.6.

Accordingly, the Court agrees with the Explanation and Order's conclusion. The NCLSA's terms state clearly that the anti-assignment provision validly applies to the\n   assignment of Class Members' claims to settlement awards under the NCLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Assignability of \"Settlement Proceeds\" Versus \"Monetary Claims\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Defendants also assert that Judge Brody's Explanation and Order refers to the assignment of \"monetary claims,\" while the Purchase Agreements at issue purport to assign Class Members' right to \"settlement proceeds.\" (ECF No. 62.) Defendants argue that the Explanation and Order's use of the term \"monetary claims\" rather than \"settlement proceeds\" shows that Judge Brody conflated legally distinct concepts under New York law. Specifically, Defendants note that although New York law prohibits the assignment of claims, it does not similarly prohibit the assignment of settlement proceeds. For this reason, Defendants argue that the Explanation and Order's findings, which use the term \"monetary claims,\" are inapplicable to the assignment of \"settlement proceeds\" at issue in the NFL-related Purchase Agreements. (ECF No. 62); Explanation and Order at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Defendants' argument is a combination of mere word mincing and misconstruction of the law. As to misconstruction of the law, the assignments in the NFL-related Purchase Agreements purport to effectuate a transfer of Class Members' full ownership rights and interest in the Property Amount to RD Legal Finance, LLC. (Dersovitz Aff. Exs. B-1 to B-7.) Through these Purchase Agreements, RD Legal Finance, LLC purports to \"step into the shoes of the assignor\" and obtain the full right to demand direct payment of the Property Amount from NFL Monetary Award Fund through a limited irrevocable power of attorney. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dersovitz Aff. Ex. B-5 at 12.) Defendants fail to note that the right to demand direct payment from the NFL Monetary Award Fund in itself is a \"claim\" that \"clearly encompasses a cause of action for nonpayment.\"\n   <em>\n    Renfrew Ctr. v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Central N.Y., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 94-cv-1527 (RSP/GJD),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%20204309\">\n    1997 WL 204309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (N.D.N.Y. Apr. 10, 1997). Although the NCLSA does not define the word \"claim,\" the assignment attempts to transfer all of the Class Members' rights and interests in the Property Amount to RD Legal Funding, LLC. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dersovitz Aff. Ex. B-5.) The RD Entities provide no basis for believing that this bundle of ownership rights includes anything less than the full benefits of ownership, and that includes the right to sue the NFL Monetary Award Fund in the event of nonpayment. Accordingly, Judge Brody's Explanation and Order addresses squarely the scenario at issue in the NFL Purchase Agreements by analyzing the assignment of \"monetary claims\" under it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Defendants' assertion that the NFL Purchase Agreements are assignments of the \"right to settlement proceeds\" under the NCLSA is unavailing.

Peter V. Pantaleo et al.,\n   <em>\n    Rethinking the Role of Recourse in the Sale of Financial Assets\n   </em>\n   , 52 Bus. Law. 159, 160 (1996). To that end, bankruptcy courts weigh the presence or absence of certain factors in determining whether a transaction is a sale or a loan under New York law. (Def. Br. 19, 27.) Among the factors that these courts consider in this analysis is the existence of recourse. If a buyer retains recourse against the seller, this indicates that the buyer has assumed less than all of the ownership rights in a purported sale, thereby indicating that the transaction is more likely a loan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Dryden Advisory Group, LLC v. Beneficial Mut. Sav. Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5918185\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/534/612/#p620\">\n    534 B.R. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 620-23 (Bankr.

For example, an assignee's right to demand direct payment from the seller's account debtor tends to indicate that a true sale has taken place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Dryden Advisory Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5918185\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/534/612/#p620\">\n    534 B.R. at 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Conversely, a seller's right of repurchase from the buyer tends to weigh in favor of classifying the transaction as a loan because it indicates that the seller has not fully alienated his ownership rights in the property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Joseph Kanner Hat Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1322782\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/482/937/#p940\">\n    482 F.2d 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 940 (2d Cir. 1973) (finding pledge of security rather than true sale where underlying asset serving as security was returned upon repayment of the advanced funds). In addition, courts may also look to the intent of the parties in effectuating a sale or a loan as indicated by the language of the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Platinum Rapid Funding Grp. Ltd. v.

Sup. Ct. June 8, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Bearing all of these factors in mind, Defendants urge that the paramount factor in determining whether a transaction is a sale or a loan under New York law is whether the \"risk of non-payment is transferred from the seller to the buyer, not the degree of risk borne by the buyer.\" (Def. Rep. 11-12.) Because the RD Entities purport to assume all of the risks of nonpayment in the Purchase Agreements, they argue that the Agreements are non-recourse and therefore are true sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Contrary to the RD Entities' assertions, the instant case is not a line-drawing exercise. The assignments in the Purchase Agreements are void and thus do not transfer a single right of ownership from\n   Consumers to the RD Entities in their monetary claims. This constitutes the beginning and end of the story. Because the assignments are invalid, the RD Entities retain recourse against the Consumer in the event of nonpayment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   In spite of the lack of case law classifying structured settlement transactions as loans or sales where a court deems the assignment void as a matter of law against the third-party obligor, a single Missouri state court case contains significant factual parallels to the case at hand.

To that end, although the assignment is \"null and void\" as against the third-party obligors, the Court refuses to look the other way when evaluating the true nature of the transactions. Therefore, to the extent these extensions of credit did not comply with state regulatory requirements governing loans at the time they were offered, the RD Entities will not be allowed simply to return to their pre-agreement positions without any penalties.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bouffard v.

In addition, Dersovitz is the founder and owner of each RD Entity named as a Defendant in this action. (Compl. \u00b6 18.) Given Dersovitz's role as founder and owner of the RD Entities and his authority to \"dictate the terms of [C]onsumer contracts,\" his conduct is at least \"reckless\" with respect to the NFL Settlement Agreement's anti-assignment clause and the Anti-Assignment Act's potential applicability to the VCF Purchase Agreements.

Dersovitz's failure to inform Class Members that this existed exhibits \"highly unreasonable\" conduct that \"represents an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care.\" Furthermore, the allegations suggest that Dersovitz was aware of the possibility that the assignments were impermissible but decided to go ahead with the transaction in spite of this. The Purchase Agreements address specifically the possibility that the assignments in the Purchase Agreements will be classified as loans by a court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Similarly with the VCF Purchase Agreements, Dersovitz encountered several warning signs indicating a high risk that the RD Entities were misrepresenting the nature of these agreements to Consumers, specifically, that the VCF Claims Administrator refused to make payment directly to the RD Entities, in spite of its demands that it do so pursuant to the assignments, and the general disclaimer in the VCF Purchase Agreements that a court may find the sale to be a loan. In sum, the Complaint adequately alleges that Dersovitz acted recklessly in knowing that the assignments may well be invalid but holding them out as enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   Finally, Dersovitz provided \"substantial assistance\" to the RD Entities in carrying out these CFPA violations. Dersovitz \"associated himself\" with the RD Entities as their founder and owner and \"participated in [the enterprise] as something he wished to bring about\" by continuing to craft the RD Entities' policies and procedures and exercising authority over those Entities. Furthermore, Dersovitz \"sought by his action to make [the RD Entities] succeed\" by making offers to enter into Purchase Agreements to Consumers, (Compl. \u00b6 54), being responsible for \"solicit[ing] funds from investors\" for cash advance payments to Consumers, (Compl. \u00b6 51), and \"[making] phone calls to at least one New York consumer to collect from that consumer,\" (Compl. \u00b6 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Accordingly, the Complaint alleges adequately a claim of \"substantial assistance\" liability against Roni Dersovitz in his individual capacity.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205536\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Count III\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Count III of the Complaint avers that Defendants violated the CFPA's prohibition on deceptive acts or practices by making representations that Defendants could \"cut through red tape\" and expedite payment of Consumers' settlement awards. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44-48.) Defendants argue that this statement is not misleading because, read in the context of the entire advertisement or transaction, a reasonable Consumer would understand this to mean that the RD Entities would disburse funds more quickly than the settlement fund or claims administrator would, not that the RD Entities would actually expedite disbursements\n   <em>\n    from the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    fund or the administrator\n   </em>\n   .

(Compl. \u00b6 46.) Futhermore, Dersovitz's approval of a website intended to draw in business for the RD Entities alleges adequately that he provided \"substantial assistance\" to the RD Entities' venture by maximizing their prospects for new business through their websites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   Accordingly, the Complaint alleges adequately facts demonstrating that Dersovitz substantially assisted the RD Entities in engaging in deceptive acts or practices in violation of the CFPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Count IV\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   Count IV, which alleges that the RD Entities acted deceptively in violation of the CFPA by making misleading statements as to when RD would pay Consumers, pleads adequately facts demonstrating that the RD Entities engaged in deceptive conduct under the CFPA.

Accordingly, the RD Entities' failure to provide money to Consumers on certain dates as agreed is misleading insofar as the RD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   Entities made statements that turned out to be false, and those statements are also material in that they \"would influence the Consumer's decision\" as to whether to enter into the Purchase Agreement or not.\n   <em>\n    Med.

(Def. Br. 36); (Pl. Opp. 27.) Therefore, the Government need not \"identify[ ] which of the 27 contracts the RD Entities allegedly\n   <em>\n    breached\n   </em>\n   by failing to make timely payment.\" (Def. Br. 36.) As previously noted, Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standard does not apply to deceptive conduct claims under the CFPA, and therefore the Government need not aver the \"who,\" \"what,\" \"where,\" and \"when\" that 9(b) requires at this stage. The Complaint avers adequately that Defendants made misleading statements, outside the four corners of the Purchase Agreements, as to the timing of payments that misled consumers. Accordingly, the Government has alleged plausibly that the RD Entities engaged in deceptive acts or conduct under Count IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    \"Substantial Assistance\" Claim Against Roni Dersovitz Under Count IV\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   The Court concludes that the Complaint alleges adequately a claim against Roni Dersovitz for \"substantially assisting\" the RD Entities in carrying out deceptive acts or practices by making misstatements about when Consumers would receive payments from the RD Entities.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205531\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 5536(a)(1)(B) ; (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51, 90-91.) Having established that the Complaint alleges adequately a claim for the underlying violation, the Court also concludes that the Complaint alleges adequately that Dersovitz at least \"recklessly\" provided substantial assistance to the RD Entities in misrepresenting to Consumers when their funds would be disbursed. (Compl. \u00b6 86.) The Complaint alleges that Dersovitz \"has authority and responsibility to ... determine when funds for [C]onsumers would arrive.\" (Compl. \u00b6 51.) As noted above, the timing of payments was crucial to Consumers, who entered into these transactions for the sole purpose of receiving expedited access to liquidity in the form of a lump sum cash payment. Incorrect statements as to the timing of disbursement of Consumers' payments, if made, would constitute an \"extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care\" given that Dersovitz had some element of authority over when funds would arrive and given the importance of the timing to payments to these particular Consumers. (Compl. \u00b6 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   Finally, for the reasons stated earlier, including Dersovitz's responsibility for the RD Entities' policies and practices and his role as founder and CEO of the RD Entities, the Complaint alleges adequately that Dersovitz sought ostensibly through these misstatements \"to make [the RD Entities] succeed\" by drawing in Consumers who were primarily concerned with the timing of their settlement payments.\n   <em>\n    DiMaria\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272473\" index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/207/343/#p359\">\n    207 F.Supp.3d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 359 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (quoting\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

Informing Consumers that they have an obligation to repay under a transaction in which the assignment is void or unenforceable clearly meets the materially misleading threshold under the CFPA. Collecting on loans that are void is materially misleading because it gives Consumers the impression that \"borrowers were obligated to repay\" the RD Entities when in reality the loan agreements were void and the borrowers were not legally obligated to pay.\n   <em>\n    CFPB v.

At a minimum, the Complaint and the Purchase Agreements themselves contain facts adequate to allege that Dersovitz acted \"recklessly\" in providing this assistance. The entire premise of the RD Entities' business model is labeling transactions that look and function like loans as \"sales\" to circumvent the regulatory restrictions that would otherwise govern these transactions if they were loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   According to the Complaint, Dersovitz \"has authority and responsibility to dictate all the terms of consumer contracts\" and \"makes decisions on the terms of the offers or extensions of credit.\" (Compl. \u00b6 27.) These allegations, coupled with the fact that the Purchase Agreements reserve the right to file a UCC Financing Statement in the event a court deems the transaction a loan and Dersovitz's position as CEO and founder of the RD Entities, allege facts sufficient to find that Dersovitz exhibited \"highly unreasonable\" conduct in failing to determine whether the assignments were valid before offering Purchase Agreements to Consumers. The allegations, viewed collectively, indicate that Dersovitz knew that the transactions might not be valid assignments but proceeded with them in any event in an \"extreme departure from the standard of ordinary care.\" Finally, the Complaint alleges that Dersovitz \"substantially assisted\" the RD Entities in carrying out this deceptive conduct in light of his role as founder and CEO of the RD Entities and his substantial involvement in the business, such as collecting on loans, drafting policies, and having the final word on the terms of the Purchase Agreements. Accordingly, the Complaint pleads facts sufficient to state a claim of individual liability against Dersovitz for substantially assisting a \"covered person\" under the CFPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Count II: Abusive Acts or Practices Under the CFPA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   The Government alleges that the RD Entities engaged in abusive conduct by undermining Consumers' understanding of\n   the Purchase Agreements through their misrepresentations that the contracts are for valid and enforceable assignments. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 72-73.) Under the CFPA, conduct is \"abusive\" where it \"materially interferes with the ability of a consumer to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service,\" \"takes unreasonable advantage of ... a lack of understanding on the part of the consumer of the material risks, costs, or conditions of the product or service,\" \"takes unreasonable advantage of ... the inability of the consumer to protect the interests of the consumer in selecting or using a consumer financial product or service,\" or \"takes unreasonable advantage of ... the reasonable reliance by the consumer on a covered person to act in the interests of the consumer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"321\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205531\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   Here, the Government has pleaded sufficient facts to state a claim for abusive acts or practices under the CFPA. Representations that a transaction is a sale when it does not, in fact, transfer validly any rights of ownership from the consumer to the RD Entities are materially misleading because such representations are false. To that end, the Government is correct that these false representations prevent Consumers from evaluating accurately whether this transaction is in their best interest. Defendants' contention that they disclose adequately the risks involved in the Purchase Agreements by labeling them \"complex financial transaction[s]\" does not neutralize other materially misleading information.

At a minimum, a business premised on purchasing rights to structured settlement payments should know whether the future receivables are, in fact, assignable.

Br. 38 n.14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court pays minimal credence to an argument raised in a two-sentence footnote of a forty-page motion to dismiss regarding the NYAG's jurisdiction over certain Consumers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gramercy Advisors, LLC v.

To the extent that Defendants challenge NYAG's assertion of jurisdiction over the transactions under New York General Business Law \u00a7 349-the statute at issue in the two cases that they cite in support of this argument-NYAG has alleged adequately that the transactions have a sufficient nexus to New York under New York General Business Law \u00a7 349, because the Complaint makes reference to \"New York consumers,\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54) and loans made \"in New York,\" (Compl. \u00b6 57). In addition, several of the contracts themselves indicate that the Consumer has a New York address, (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dersovitz Aff. Ex. A-2 at 20) (listing consumer as having New York residence), and that certain of the Consumers used a New York agent to seek legal advice regarding the Purchase Agreement before entering into it, (Dersovitz Aff. Ex. A-1 at 18-19) (showing New York attorney sending letters on behalf of Consumer client to RD Legal Funding Partners, LP). For purposes of New York General Business Law \u00a7 349, the relevant inquiry is whether there are New York transactions that are deceptive or that occur as a result of out-of-state deceptive conduct.\n   <em>\n    New York v.

As discussed earlier, such advertising is \"consumer-oriented\" in that the Complaint alleges that these representations were made to all those who visited Defendants' website or transacted with Defendants through a Purchase Agreement. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 125-26.) Such statements are also material because they are likely to mislead a reasonable consumer into believing that the transactions are true sales or that Defendants had the ability to expedite payment from the settlement fund administrators when neither statement is true. Defendants also argue that these alleged statements pertain to the \"source\" of the payments, which is distinct from the timing of payments and would not be material to consumers. (Def. Br. 34.) The Court disagrees. Consumers are individuals who want their settlement awards quickly because they need access to liquidity. It does not take a grand leap of imagination to envision that Consumers may have strained relations with the claims administrators in seeking access to their settlement awards. Therefore, if Consumers were misled into believing that RD would act as a type of third-party facilitator between the Consumer and the claims administrator, this information would be material to the Consumer. Therefore, the Court concludes that Defendants' argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   Accordingly, the NYAG alleges adequately facts demonstrating a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"391\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20GBL%20%C2%A7%20350\">\n    N.Y.

In the Ratification, the CFPB attempts to ratify its decision to file this enforcement decision prior to the appointment of the CFPB's Acting Director, Mick Mulvaney, on November 24, 2017. (Notice\n   of Ratification (hereinafter, Ratification) 1.)

As Defendants point out, the relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that render the CFPB's structure unconstitutional remain intact. (Ratification 4.) Furthermore, Mr. Mulvaney cannot serve past June 22, 2018 (210 days after the vacancy arose), unless the President nominates a new Director, and then only until the new Director is appointed. Thus, there will likely be a new Director appointed in the coming months who will be subject to the for-cause removal provision. Therefore, the Ratification does not cure the constitutional deficiencies with the CFPB's structure as the CFPB argues. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Notice of Ratification (ECF No. 78) to the extent the CFPB argues that the Ratification renders Defendants' constitutional arguments moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that the CFPB \"lacks authority to bring this enforcement action because its composition violates the Constitution's separation of powers,\" and thus the CFPB's claims are dismissed.\n   <em>\n    Fed.
