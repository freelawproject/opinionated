Plaintiffs allege the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Conditions in Stewart Detention Center\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Stewart County, Georgia has an intergovernmental services agreement with United States Immigration and Custom Enforcement to house immigration detainees like Plaintiffs. Compl. \u00b6 13, ECF No. 1. Stewart County contracts with CoreCivic, a for-profit corporation, to operate the Stewart Detention Center (\"Stewart\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Stewart has nearly 2,000 beds and is one of the largest immigration detention centers in the nation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the conditions at Stewart are deplorable. The bathrooms are in poor condition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. Some showers have no hot water, while other showers have no cold water.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The open dormitories house 66 people in bunk beds with no privacy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. Each dormitory has one bathroom with several sinks and toilets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The showers in the shared bathroom do not have temperature control.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Conflict and violence occur frequently in the open dormitories.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Detainees refer to the open dormitories as the \"Chicken Coop\" because of the unsanitary conditions and overcrowding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   CoreCivic does not adequately furnish detainees with basic hygiene products like toilet paper, soap, lotion, or toothpaste.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. Instead, CoreCivic instructs detainees to buy these basic necessities from the commissary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CoreCivic also provides no means for detainees to contact people outside Stewart other than expensive phone cards available for purchase at the commissary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-47. The commissary is the only place detainees can purchase hygiene products, clothes, or phone cards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. Detainees must use funds from their inmate fund accounts to make purchases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. Detainees therefore rely on access to the commissary to purchase basic necessities and phone cards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Stewart's \"Voluntary Work Program\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   CoreCivic operates a \"voluntary work program\" at Stewart.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. CoreCivic assigns program participants to various jobs in the facility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. Responsibilities include scrubbing bathrooms, cleaning the medical center, preparing meals, washing detainees' laundry, and cleaning floors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. CoreCivic generally pays detainees in the program between $1 and $4 per day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. CoreCivic deposits detainees' wages into their inmate fund accounts so the detainees may purchase items at the commissary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Detainees in the voluntary work program are spared from some of Stewart's more unfavorable conditions. Program participants are not housed in the Chicken Coop. Instead, they are provided more favorable living quarters with private two-person cells, a shared common area, a bathroom shared with only one other cellmate, and a shower with temperature control.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. But when participants refuse to work, CoreCivic threatens to transfer them back to the Chicken Coop,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54, revoke their access to the commissary,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57, transfer them to solitary confinement,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59, or initiate criminal proceedings against them,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that CoreCivic maintains deplorable conditions as part of a \"deprivation scheme\" that provides CoreCivic with a cheap supply of labor to operate the facility, thereby enabling CoreCivic to increase its profits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 59-60. According to Plaintiffs, this scheme operates as follows: (1) CoreCivic deprives detainees of basic necessities, including toothpaste, soap, toilet paper, privacy, safety, and contact with loved ones; (2) detainees must participate in the voluntary\n   work program to move to humane accommodations and to earn money to purchase necessities at the commissary; and (3) once detainees are in the program, CoreCivic threatens to harm or actually harms those who refuse to work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. Therefore, according to Plaintiffs, participation in the \"voluntary\" work program is \"not 'voluntary' in any meaningful sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Named Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Barrientos, Velazques-Galicia, and Ahmed either are working or previously worked as kitchen workers in the program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62, 78, 86. Specifically, Barrientos alleges CoreCivic threatened to transfer him to the Chicken Coop,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69-70, revoke his access to the commissary,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71, and put him in solitary confinement,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72, when he refused to work or when CoreCivic believed he was organizing a work stoppage. Velazquez-Galicia alleges that he witnessed CoreCivic threaten to transfer detainees who decline to work from the preferable two-person cells to the Chicken Coop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82. Ahmed alleges that CoreCivic threatened to put him in solitary confinement if he stopped working.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89. He also alleges that CoreCivic actually put him in solitary confinement for ten days for threatening a work stoppage after he had not been paid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90. All three allege that they participate (or participated) in the work program because of CoreCivic's threats of harm and because of CoreCivic's deprivation scheme.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75, 83, 91. They bring this action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated. Plaintiffs' proposed classes are limited to detainees who actually participate or participated in the voluntary work program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs assert two categories of claims against CoreCivic: (1) civil liability for violations of the TVPA and (2) claims for unjust enrichment under Georgia law. CoreCivic moved to dismiss all of Plaintiffs' claims. For the following reasons, CoreCivic's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I. TVPA Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As to Plaintiffs' TVPA claims, the question presented is whether Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts in their Complaint, which if ultimately proven to be true, could subject CoreCivic to civil liability under the TVPA. The TVPA provides a private cause of action against anyone:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (a) Who[ ] knowingly provides or obtains the labor or services of a person by any one of, or by any combination of, the following means-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (1) by means of force, threats of force, physical restraint, or threats of physical restraint to that person or another person;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (2) by means of serious harm or threats of serious harm to that person or another person;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (3) by means of the abuse or threatened abuse of law or legal process; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (4) by means of any scheme ... intended to cause the person to believe that, if that person did not perform such labor or services, that person or another person would suffer serious harm or physical restraint[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201589\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The TVPA defines \"serious harm\" as \"any harm, whether physical or nonphysical, including psychological, financial, or reputational harm, that is sufficiently serious, under all the surrounding circumstances, to compel a reasonable person of the same background and in the same circumstances to perform or to continue performing labor or services\n   in order to avoid incurring that harm.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201589\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1589(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   CoreCivic contends that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under the TVPA because Congress did not intend the statute to apply to lawfully held detainees. In the alternative, CoreCivic argues that Plaintiffs failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim under the \"abuse of legal process\" prong.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201589\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1589(a)(3). Finally, CoreCivic contends that Plaintiffs' TVPA claims for conduct prior to December 23, 2008 are barred. These arguments are addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    A. Plaintiffs Stated Claims under the Plain Language of the TVPA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   CoreCivic argues that the TVPA is intended to apply narrowly to forced labor in the human trafficking context and that applying it to detainee work programs is \"absurd\" and contrary to the intentions of Congress. CoreCivic's argument has superficial appeal and some support from the TVPA's legislative history. But it ignores the plain language of the statute. It also misunderstands \"the absurdity doctrine,\" which is a narrow exception to the fundamental principle that statutory interpretation must be anchored to the plain language of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   CoreCivic points to evidence of congressional intent in support of its position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207101\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (setting forth the congressional purposes and findings regarding the TVPA);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7101(a) (\"The purposes of this chapter are to combat trafficking in persons, a contemporary manifestation of slavery whose victims are predominantly women and children, to ensure just and effective punishment of traffickers, and to protect their victims.\"). But when interpreting a statute, the Court must presume that Congress says what it means and means what it says.\n   <em>\n    Conn. Nat'l Bank v. Germain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6225793\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/249/#p253\">\n    503 U.S. 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 253-54,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6513849,6225793\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/112/1146/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6225793\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/249/#p253\">\n    117 L.Ed.2d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). If Congress intended the TVPA to apply narrowly to human traffickers or human trafficking-related labor only, it could have easily limited \u00a7 1589 or \u00a7 1595 to those circumstances by saying so in those sections of the Act. Congress placed no such restriction in the statute but chose instead to broadly prohibit \"whoever\" from \"obtain[ing] labor\" by any of the proscribed means.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201589\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Court thus declines to read an implied exclusion for lawfully confined victims into the statute. Of course, the lawful force necessary to detain the detainees cannot be the source for the TVPA claims. But Plaintiffs allege that although they may be lawfully detained, they cannot be forced to labor in violation of the TVPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   To the extent CoreCivic relies on the \"absurdity doctrine\" as an exception to the fundamental principle that courts must apply statutes as written, the Court finds that this exception does not apply here. The \"absurdity doctrine\" can be traced back to the English common law. As Blackstone explained in his Commentaries, \"[W]here words bear ... a very absurd signification, if literally understood, we must a little deviate from the received sense of them.\" William Blackstone,\n   <em>\n    Commentaries on the Laws of England\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2, at 60 (4th ed. 1770). As understood in the English common law: \"[I]n construing ... all written instruments, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to, unless that would lead to some absurdity, or some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument, in which case the grammatical and ordinary\n   sense of the words may be modified so as to avoid that absurdity and inconsistency, but no farther.\"\n   <em>\n    Grey v. Pearson\n   </em>\n   , (1857) 10 Eng. Rep. 1216, 1234; 6 H.L. Cas. 61, 106 (Lord Wensleydale).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The absurdity doctrine, however, does not authorize \"judicial revision of public and private texts to make them (in the judge's view) more reasonable.\" Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Garner,\n   <em>\n    Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts\n   </em>\n   237 (2012). To avoid such judicial mischief, the doctrine has two limiting conditions: (1) \"[t]he absurdity must consist of a disposition that no reasonable person could intend;\" and (2) \"[t]he absurdity must be reparable by changing or supplying a particular word or phrase whose inclusion or omission was obviously a technical or ministerial error.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201589\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201589\">\n    at 237-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The drafter's failure to fully appreciate the effect of a plainly written statute does not bring it within the absurdity doctrine.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201589\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201589\">\n    at 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   CoreCivic points to no particular word or phrase in the TVPA that it claims must be corrected. Instead, it argues that the statute does not apply to persons who are held lawfully as detainees by the government. It relies upon no language in the statute for this broad assertion. It simply points to legislative history outlining the motivation for the enactment of the statute. Thus, it asks the Court rewrite the statute by effectively adding a provision stating, \"this statute shall not apply to anyone who uses labor of detainees who are lawfully detained pursuant to a contract with a governmental agency.\" The absurdity doctrine does not authorize the Court to re-draft a statute. CoreCivic may find it absurd that Congress drafted the TVPA in such a way that it theoretically reaches the conduct alleged here. And one can speculate that Congress did not foresee the application of its plain language to these circumstances. But this Court cannot rewrite statutes to avoid what it may perceive to be an unintended consequence or even an absurd public policy result. Congress is alone responsible for any such absurdities and lack of legislative foresight. Moreover, the Constitution gives it the exclusive power to fix them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court's ruling today that Plaintiffs have stated a claim for relief under the TVPA certainly does not mean they will ultimately prevail. They must of course still prove their allegations. And in doing so, they will be required to point to evidence that supports the reasonable conclusion that CoreCivic threatened them with a serious risk of harm if they did not persist as laborers. That burden will be a heavy one.

The Court today finds that the TVPA does apply under the circumstances alleged in Plaintiffs' Complaint. This determination thus allows this litigation to proceed which will not only involve extensive fact discovery but also class certification proceedings. If the Court's conclusion is wrong and the primary (maybe only) basis for federal jurisdiction is removed, these subsequent proceedings will have been for naught. Therefore, an immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. Of course, if today's order is affirmed, these proceedings will have arguably been unnecessarily delayed. But given the nature of the issue to be decided on appeal and the implications of today's ruling, the undersigned is of the opinion that an immediate appeal is appropriate pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Thus, the Court leaves for another day whether Plaintiffs must prove that the conditions in the Chicken Coop do not meet the constitutional conditions of confinement standard in order to show a serious threat of harm for TVPA purposes.
