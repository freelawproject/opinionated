The Court also concludes, however, that the balance of the defendants' overtime and minimum wage liability is disputed and remains an issue for trial. The Court further concludes that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover liquidated damages in an amount equal to three times their total unpaid overtime wages, and that the precise amount will be determined later after the total amount of overtime liability is determined.
