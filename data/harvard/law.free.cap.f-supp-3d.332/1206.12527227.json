Schiltz, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs are shareholders in the Federal National Mortgage Association (commonly known as \"Fannie Mae\" or \"Fannie\") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (commonly known as \"Freddie Mac\" or \"Freddie\"). Fannie and Freddie (collectively, \"the Companies\") are federally chartered, for-profit, publicly traded corporations that are in the business of purchasing and guaranteeing mortgages and bundling them into securities. Both companies are regulated by defendant Federal Housing Finance Agency (\"FHFA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2008, in the midst of the Great Recession, FHFA placed Fannie and Freddie into conservatorship-and then, acting in its capacity as conservator on behalf of the Companies, FHFA entered into preferred stock purchase agreements (\"PSPAs\") with the United States Department of the Treasury (\"Treasury\"). Under the PSPAs, Treasury made billions of dollars available to Fannie and Freddie in exchange for shares of the Companies' stock. Over the years, the parties amended the PSPAs from time to time. In August 2012, FHFA and Treasury amended the PSPAs for the third time in order to restructure the calculation of dividends to be paid to Treasury. Under this Third Amendment (which is still in effect), Fannie and Freddie pay a quarterly dividend to Treasury that is roughly equal to the amount by which their net worth exceeds zero.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Third Amendment is deeply unpopular among some of the Companies' shareholders, and they have launched at least two waves of lawsuits in an attempt to undo it. The first wave of litigation attacked the Third Amendment directly. When that wave largely failed, shareholders launched a second wave of litigation\n   (including this lawsuit). In the second wave of litigation, shareholders are attacking the Third Amendment indirectly by challenging the legality of FHFA itself-hoping that, by killing the tree, they can kill one of its fruits. Plaintiffs in this particular lawsuit challenge the structure of FHFA (specifically, the fact that it is headed by a single director who can be removed only for cause). Plaintiffs also challenge the way that FHFA is funded and limitations on judicial review of FHFA's actions as conservator. Plaintiffs further challenge the length of the term that was served by an acting director of FHFA. And finally, plaintiffs challenge Congress's grant of conservatorship powers to FHFA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This matter is before the Court on defendants' motions to dismiss and plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. For the reasons that follow, defendants' motions are granted, and plaintiffs' motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    A.

The Conservatorship and the PSPAs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As noted, FHFA placed Fannie and Freddie into conservatorship on September 6, 2008. Am. Compl. \u00b6 28. The next day, Fannie and Freddie (acting through their conservator, FHFA) entered into the PSPAs with Treasury. Am. Compl. \u00b6 31. Under the original PSPAs, Treasury committed to provide up to $100 billion to each Company to ensure that it maintained a positive net worth. Am. Compl. \u00b6 32. For any quarter in which a Company's liabilities exceeded its assets, the PSPAs authorized the Company to draw on Treasury's commitment up to the amount of the shortfall. Am. Compl. \u00b6 32. In return, Treasury received a million shares of senior preferred stock in the Companies and warrants entitling it to purchase up to 79.9 percent of the Companies' common stock at a nominal price. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. By operation of law, Treasury's right to purchase common stock in the Companies expired on December 31, 2009. Am. Compl. \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Treasury's preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $1 billion, which increases by one dollar for every dollar the Companies draw on Treasury's funding commitment. Am. Compl. \u00b6 35. In the event of liquidation, Treasury will be entitled to recover the full amount of its preference before any other stockholder receives payment. Am. Compl. \u00b6 35. Treasury is also entitled to receive dividends, which, under the original PSPAs, the Companies could elect to pay by increasing the amount of the liquidation preference. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The PSPAs have been amended several times. In May 2009, the parties doubled Treasury's funding commitment from $100 billion to $200 billion. Am. Compl. \u00b6 41. In December 2009, the parties increased the funding commitment even more, establishing a formula that permits Treasury's funding commitment to exceed $200 billion. Am. Compl. \u00b6 41. Finally, in August 2012, the parties entered into the Third Amendment, which is the focus of this litigation. Am. Compl. \u00b6 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Third Amendment replaced the fixed-rate annual dividend to which Treasury was entitled-and which could be paid by increasing Treasury's liquidation preference rather than with cash-with a quarterly cash dividend equal to the amount by which the Companies' net worth exceeds zero, less a capital buffer that decreases over time (and reaches zero in 2018). Am. Compl. \u00b6 55. Plaintiffs refer to this dividend requirement as the \"Net Worth Sweep.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The conservatorship in general and the Third Amendment in particular are bitterly opposed by plaintiffs and other shareholders participating in the second wave of legal attacks designed to undo the Third Amendment. According to plaintiffs, the conservatorship and the Third Amendment were parts of a nefarious plot to seize control of Fannie and Freddie and operate them for the exclusive benefit of the federal government. Am. Compl. \u00b6 28. Plaintiffs claim that Fannie and Freddie did not need the hundreds of billions of dollars of financing that Treasury provided to the Companies during the Great Recession. To the contrary, plaintiffs claim, the Companies were always in a strong financial position and could have weathered the Great Recession by raising additional capital through the financial markets. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-29. Plaintiffs' assertion that Fannie and Freddie could have remained solvent without the help of the federal government is dubious,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perry Capital LLC v.

The injury that plaintiffs allege is the Third Amendment, which purportedly harms their interests as shareholders in the Companies by being too favorable to Treasury. To remedy this injury, plaintiffs ask the Court to vacate the Third Amendment and strike down the director's tenure protection-and, if necessary, any other provisions that unconstitutionally insulate FHFA from oversight- so that a less independent FHFA (that is, an FHFA under more presidential control) may reconsider its decision to enter into the Third Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The problem with plaintiffs' claims is glaring: There is no causal connection between their injury-a Third Amendment that (in plaintiffs' view) is too favorable to the Executive Branch-and the lack of Executive Branch influence over FHFA. Nor is there any reason to believe that increasing Executive Branch influence over FHFA will somehow result in a \"revised\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Third Amendment that is less favorable to the Executive Branch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Third Amendment is part of a contract between FHFA and Treasury. Treasury is an executive department that is fully under the President's control. Thus, in a very real sense, the President has already approved the Third Amendment. Plaintiffs have no coherent theory for how their injury-a Third Amendment that, in plaintiffs' view, is unduly favorable to the President-could have resulted from the President having too\n   <em>\n    little\n   </em>\n   control over FHFA. Nor do plaintiffs have a coherent theory as to why giving the President\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   control of FHFA will lead to him renegotiating the Third Amendment so that it is less favorable to himself.

The core of the panel's reasoning can be summarized as follows: The purpose of separation of powers is to protect individual liberty; good decisions protect individual liberty more than bad decisions; multimember commissions are more likely to make good decisions than single agency heads; therefore, multimember commissions are constitutionally permissible, but single agency heads are not. The panel opinion also relies heavily on the notion that the individual members of a multimember body are accountable to each other-which, according to the panel, more-or-less substitutes for their lack of accountability to the President.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   One problem with this reasoning is that it is based on a series of debatable assumptions about the advantages and disadvantages of various organizational structures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PHH II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275132\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/75/\">\n    881 F.3d at 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"PHH's disputed factual premises about the effects of agency design choices underscore that, while such considerations may be useful fodder for policymaking by Congress, they are not grounds for courts to reshape the constitutional removal power.\"). For example, whether the quality of decisionmaking increases with the number of decisionmakers is a highly debatable issue with respect to which judges enjoy no special expertise. But even if all of the assumptions underlying the panel opinion are valid, this \"unmoored liberty analysis\n   is no part of the inquiry the Supreme Court's cases require[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275132\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/75/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275132\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/75/\">\n    at 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court is also not persuaded that multimember commissions are constitutionally permissible because the members' accountability to each other somehow substitutes for accountability to the President. Putting aside the question of whether commission members are truly accountable to each other, courts are not called upon to reason from first principles to determine which institutional structures will best protect individual liberty. The Framers have already made that choice: the constitutional principle of separation of powers and, within that framework, accountability to the President through the removal power.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crawford v.

The Supreme Court has never cited the fact that an agency had multiple leaders as a reason for finding the agency's structure constitutional. Nor is there is any reason to believe that a single director is less accountable to the President than a multimember body. The President has the exact same power of removal over the single director that he would have over individual members of a multimember commission. Indeed, it may well be easier for the President to hold a single director accountable. When a single person is in charge, there is no doubt about who is responsible for any official action that would justify removal for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   True, the FHFA director is appointed for a term of five years, which means that a President who serves only one term could theoretically be deprived of the opportunity to appoint a director.

To the extent that plaintiffs contend that congressional oversight is necessary to correct what they view as an unconstitutional limit on the President's removal power, their argument is misplaced. Again, the question is whether the President retains sufficient oversight; congressional oversight cannot substitute for executive oversight and indeed can itself impermissibly intrude on the Executive Branch.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowsher v.

Both of these concerns are implicated here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Again, the premise of plaintiffs' challenge is that a judge should determine whether an acting director has served for an unreasonably long time. Plaintiffs compare their challenge to challenges to the validity of an officer's appointment, which courts are capable of adjudicating. But challenges to the validity of an officer's appointment are ripe at the moment of appointment-before the officer has taken any official action. Plaintiffs' claim is quite different. The logic of their constitutional claim is that DeMarco's initial appointment was valid, and that the actions that he took early in his term were valid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But at some point, say plaintiffs, DeMarco's tenure became unreasonably long, and the actions that he took after that point were invalid. To support their argument, plaintiffs cite opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel stating that an acting officer should serve only \"as long as is reasonable under the circumstances,\"\n   <em>\n    Designation of Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2024151770\">\n    2003 WL 24151770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 n.2 (O.L.C. June 12, 2003), and proposing a multifactor test to determine reasonableness, including \"the President's ability to devote attention to the matter\" and whether the President has \"a desire to appraise the work of an Acting Director,\"\n   <em>\n    Status of the Acting Director, Office of Management and Budget\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20Op.%20O.L.C.%20287\">\n    1 Op. O.L.C. 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 290 (1977).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The OLC opinions on which plaintiffs rely illustrate why the \"reasonable under the circumstances\" test is not a judicially discoverable or manageable standard. Applying that standard would require a judge to assess the functioning of the entire Executive Branch and the changing state of the nation (actually, the world) throughout the length of the acting officer's tenure to determine at what point, if ever, the length of the officer's service became unreasonable. These assessments are far outside the competency of the judiciary and would require delving into areas-such as \"the President's ability to devote attention to the matter\" and his \"desire to appraise the work of an Acting Director\"-that are not normally the subject of judicial inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Moreover, these assessments would involve \"initial policy determination[s] of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Critically, these assessments can only be done retrospectively, which would throw the functioning of the government into intolerable uncertainty. Because the conditions under which an acting officer serves are continually changing, it would be impossible to know, in advance, how long those conditions would justify an acting officer's continued service. Nor would it even be possible-as conditions fluctuate from day to day, week to week, month to month-to contemporaneously identify the moment at which the acting officer's tenure became too long. The passage of yet more time would be necessary to put those changes in perspective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As a result, none of those who had business before or were being affected by the agency-not private individuals, not businesses, not other governmental agencies, not members of Congress, not even the President himself-would have any way of knowing whether the acting officer who was heading the agency had lost his or her authority to act on the agency's behalf. Instead, they would have to order their affairs with the knowledge that, at some point years later, a judge acting with the benefit of hindsight might pronounce the length of the tenure unreasonable and pick an essentially arbitrary point beyond which the officer's actions will be deemed invalid. This is no way to run a government.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vieth v.

As described above, the first FHFA director resigned in August 2009, thereby triggering the designation of DeMarco as acting director. At that point, Fannie and Freddie had been under conservatorship for nearly a year and Treasury's funding commitment had recently doubled from $100 billion to $200 billion. Just over a year after DeMarco's appointment, President Obama sent a nomination to the Senate, but the Senate failed to act and the nomination was returned to the President on December 22, 2010. Am. Compl. \u00b6 44. In May 2013, President Obama made another nomination, which stalled in the Senate for more than seven months until the Senate finally voted to confirm on December 10, 2013. Am. Compl. \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, by the time that the Third Amendment was adopted in August 2012, DeMarco's tenure had become unreasonable. But consider the circumstances facing FHFA in August 2012: The agency was charged with administering \"the largest conservatorships in U.S. history,\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 19, over two companies that dominated the housing market-the recent collapse of which had triggered the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression. Those companies were also the beneficiaries of hundreds of billions of dollars in governmental financing. Whether at that point no acting director was needed is the type of judgment call that the judiciary is not equipped to make. Nor is the judiciary equipped to litigate the question whether the President had the ability to devote attention to the matter between December 2010 and May 2013. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine what such litigation would look like or how the normal tools of discovery would operate. (\"Mr. President, I see that you spent two hours meeting with the ambassador from Aruba on March 23. Wasn't it more important for\n   you to devote attention to the affairs of the FHFA?\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiffs point to other timing-based constitutional challenges, contending that such challenges are capable of adjudication. But the cases to which they point are distinguishable. For example, in\n   <em>\n    NLRB v. Noel Canning\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that a break of less than ten days is presumptively too short to fall within the meaning of \"recess\" in the Recess Appointments Clause. --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581735\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2550/#p2566\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2566-67,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581735\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2550/#p2566\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).

But neither of those cases involved a retrospective consideration of a particular officer's tenure in light of the conditions under which he served; instead, they prospectively considered the length of time generally permitted by statute for the office. Moreover, neither of the cases actually placed much significance on the length of the officer's tenure.\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   found that the independent counsel was an inferior officer despite the fact that an independent counsel serves for an indefinite time.\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n    487 U.S. at 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And in\n   <em>\n    Edmond\n   </em>\n   itself, the Court essentially treated any temporal factor as irrelevant, finding that the officers in question were inferior despite the fact that they were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \"limited in tenure\" as that phrase was used in\n   <em>\n    Morrison.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n    at 661, 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652680\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/651/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither of these cases indicate that a court should engage in a freewheeling, after-the-fact assessment of the reasonableness of a particular officer's tenure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   It is true that, in\n   <em>\n    Eaton\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court explained that the vice consul could constitutionally exercise the duties of the consul in part because the vice counsel was \"charged with the performance ... for a limited time, and under special and temporary conditions ....\"\n   <em>\n    Eaton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3597786\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/169/331/#p343\">\n    169 U.S. at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3597786\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/169/331/#p343\">\n    18 S.Ct. 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But this was simply a general description of the circumstances under which a vice consul is authorized to perform the duties of a consul, not a comment on the length of the particular vice consul's tenure in that case or the conditions under which he served. Indeed, Eaton (the vice consul who performed the consul's duties for nearly a year) was himself succeeded by another vice consul.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3597786\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/169/331/#p343\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3597786\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/169/331/#p343\">\n    at 332-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3597786\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/169/331/#p343\">\n    18 S.Ct. 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court seemed untroubled by that fact; it did not even mention the total length of time during which there was no Senate-confirmed\n   consul, much less discuss the length of Eaton's tenure in its analysis or explain why the length of his tenure was constitutionally permissible. In short, the Supreme Court was not asked to decide-and did not decide-how long an inferior officer may perform the duties of a principal officer.\n   <em>\n    Eaton\n   </em>\n   is not at odds with the Court's conclusion that plaintiffs' \"reasonableness\" standard is non-justiciable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiffs seek to get around the justiciability problem by proposing a ceiling of two years on any acting officer's tenure. They point out that this is the maximum possible term for an officer appointed under the Recess Appointments Clause and argue that it would be anomalous for the President to be able to evade this limit through the appointment of acting officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The problem for plaintiffs is that recess appointees are not analogous to acting officers. When making a recess appointment, the President has unlimited authority; he can appoint anyone of his choosing with no oversight whatsoever. This power extends even beyond the Executive Branch to include Article III judgeships.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Evans v. Stephens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9155864\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/1220/#p1222\">\n    387 F.3d 1220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1222-24 (11th Cir. 2004). The\n   <em>\n    sole\n   </em>\n   limit on this extraordinary authority over two of the three branches of government is temporal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The same cannot be said of acting officers. Congress has the power to control the President's choice of acting officers-which, by their very nature, are limited to the Executive Branch.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203345\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Vacancies Reform Act provision limiting who may be appointed as acting director of an executive agency). In this case, for example, the President's choice was severely circumscribed: He was required to choose an acting director from among FHFA's three deputy directors.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204512\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). This is simply not comparable to the ability of a President to make a recess appointment with no restrictions or oversight whatsoever.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Importantly, if Congress perceives that the President is abusing his limited power to appoint acting officers, Congress has the ability to address the problem through legislation. But Congress cannot limit the President's constitutionally granted power under the Recess Appointments Clause. The unlimited constitutional power to make recess appointments is therefore unlike the limited statutory power to designate acting officers. And given the vastly different types, functions, and tenures of executive officers, the Court could not possibly say that a two-year limit on acting officers' tenure is mandated in each and every case-which is what the Court would have to say in order to avoid the justiciability problem discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Because plaintiffs' proposed \"reasonableness\" standard is not capable of judicial application-and because plaintiffs' two-year cap finds no support in the Constitution-the Court rejects plaintiffs' claim that the length of DeMarco's tenure was constitutionally invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   2. Other Appointments Clause Challenges\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In addition to their challenge to the length of DeMarco's term, plaintiffs make two other arguments regarding the validity of his tenure. First, they argue that, although it is permissible for the duties of a principal officer to temporarily devolve upon a subordinate by operation of law, the President may not be given the power to select the officer who will perform those duties (unless his choice is confirmed by the Senate). As a result, plaintiffs contend, the procedure under \u00a7 4512(f) is unconstitutional, as it gives the President the ability to choose an acting director from one of three deputy directors. Plaintiffs base their argument on the fact that the Constitution identifies\n   only one circumstance in which the President may appoint a principal officer without Senate confirmation: during a Senate recess.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument suffers from a logical flaw, however. As explained in\n   <em>\n    Eaton\n   </em>\n   , a subordinate who takes on the duties of a principal officer does not thereby become a principal officer who requires Senate confirmation.\n   <em>\n    Eaton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3597786\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/169/331/#p343\">\n    169 U.S. at 343-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3597786\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/169/331/#p343\">\n    18 S.Ct. 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given that the Appointments Clause permits Congress to vest the appointment of inferior officers in the President alone, there is nothing unconstitutional about allowing the President to choose an acting director.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Second, plaintiffs contend that, setting aside any constitutional problems with DeMarco's appointment and tenure, his appointment did not comply with \u00a7 4512(f). Their argument is as follows: DeMarco's predecessor, James Lockhart, served as FHFA director pursuant to \u00a7 4512(b)(5). That provision designated the then-current director of OFHEO (FHFA's predecessor) to \"act\" as the first FHFA director. As a result, plaintiffs argue, Lockhart merely served as an\n   <em>\n    acting director\n   </em>\n   , and his resignation therefore did not trigger \u00a7 4512(f) -which applies only \"[i]n the event of the death, resignation, sickness, or absence of\n   <em>\n    the Director\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiffs did not assert this claim in their amended complaint, and therefore it is not properly before the Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fischer v.

Although the language of \u00a7 4512(b)(5) can be read to suggest a distinction between Lockhart's role and the role of a director appointed under \u00a7 4512(b)(1), the Court believes that the better reading is that Lockhart was a director whose resignation triggered the power to appoint an acting director under \u00a7 4512(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Section 4512(b)(5) is the fifth paragraph of subsection (b), which is generally concerned with the appointment of the director. The first four paragraphs of subsection (b) describe the process for appointing a director and govern the length of his tenure. The fifth paragraph, under which Lockhart became the director, begins with the phrase \"[n]otwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2)\"-thus indicating that the person designated under (b)(5)\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   be subject to those provisions if not for the excepting language. The structure and language of subsection (b) thus connect the \"director\" appointed under (b)(5) to the \"director\" appointed under (b)(1). For that reason, the better reading of the statute is that (b)(5) is not describing some unique official, but rather a director like those described in (b)(1) (albeit appointed under a special method and with a special tenure not applicable to later directors).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   This interpretation is further bolstered by the fact that (b)(5) vests the director's duties in the former director of OFHEO. Because the office of OFHEO director required Senate confirmation, Lockhart could constitutionally serve as the director (and not merely the acting director) of FHFA without additional Senate confirmation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FHFA v.UBS Americas Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3554929\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/712/136/#p144\">\n    712 F.3d 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 144 (2d Cir. 2013) (holding that Lockhart's duties as FHFA director were \"germane\" to his duties as OFHEO director and therefore he did not need to be renominated and reconfirmed). And indeed, paragraph (b)(5) states that the appointed individual acts \"for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   purposes as\" and \"with the\n   <em>\n    full\n   </em>\n   powers of\" the director. (Emphasis added.) This case is therefore unlike\n   <em>\n    Doolin Security Savings Bank, F.S.B. v. Office of Thrift Supervision\n   </em>\n   , in which the D.C. Circuit held that the resignation of an acting director who was not appointed in conformity with the Appointments Clause did not trigger a \"vacancy\" within the meaning of the Vacancies Act.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11833371,3712723\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/139/203/\">\n    139 F.3d 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 207-08 (D.C. Cir. 1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, the Court finds it unlikely that Congress intended to leave the office of FHFA director vacant in the event of Lockhart's resignation. The manifest purpose of \u00a7 4512(b)(5) was to enable FHFA to hit the ground running in response to a serious economic crisis.
