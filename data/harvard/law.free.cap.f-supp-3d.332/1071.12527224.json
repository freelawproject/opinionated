INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In May 2017, Iowa enacted legislation permitting the sale and use of consumer fireworks for two designated periods each year. Shortly thereafter, several Iowa cities enacted various ordinances regulating firework sales. A Nebraska corporation in the business of selling fireworks, Bellino Fireworks, Inc., brings this lawsuit against four cities requesting declaratory judgments that their ordinances are preempted by Iowa law, alleging the ordinances violate\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and contending the cities interfered with Bellino's contracts and prospective business relationships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The City of Ankeny, the City of Boone, the City of Johnston, and the City of Pleasant Hill\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ask the Court to grant summary judgment in their favor. Ankeny &amp; Pleasant Hill's Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 54; Boone &amp; Johnston's Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 57. They assert Bellino's claims fail because their ordinances are not preempted and Bellino does not demonstrate any material disputes as to the necessary elements of its \u00a7 1983 and tortious interference claims. Bellino requests partial summary judgment in its favor, contending the Cities' regulations are preempted by state law and the Court should find in its favor on the declaratory judgment counts. ECF No. 56. The Cities also request the Court either continue the trial or bifurcate the trial on the declaratory judgment action from the trial on damages. ECF Nos. 85 &amp; 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As further explained below, the Court grants the Cities' motions for summary judgment, and denies Bellino's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and the Cities' Motion to Continue or Bifurcate. The Cities' Ordinances are not preempted and summary judgment in the Cities' favor as to the declaratory judgment counts is thus appropriate. Bellino lacks standing to challenge the miscellaneous portions of the Cities' codes because it has not alleged it was injured by these provisions and fails to present an actual controversy. There are no genuine issues of material fact as to whether the Cities committed any substantive due process violations. Additionally, summary judgment in the Cities' favor on the tortious inference with contract and tortious interference with prospective business relationship claims is appropriate because the Cities' interference was not improper and, alternatively, the Cities are entitled to immunity under the discretionary function exception. Because the Court rules in the Cities' favor as to all claims, it does not consider the arguments regarding punitive damages and finds the Cities' motions to continue or bifurcate the trial are moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. SUMMARY OF RELEVANT FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court set forth the relevant facts in its Order granting in part and denying in part Bellino's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. ECF No. 23 at 2-5. Since that time, the Cities' Ordinances have been amended, the Senate File has been codified, and Bellino has amended its complaint. Accordingly, the Court recites the relevant facts at this juncture. In large part, the parties agree there are no material facts in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 9, 2017, the Governor of Iowa signed into law Senate File 489 (SF 489), amending the Iowa Code to allow for the possession, sale, transfer, purchase, and use of consumer fireworks in the State of Iowa. 2017 Iowa Legis.

The Cities request summary judgment in their favor as to all claims. ECF Nos. 54, 57. The Court first addresses the parties' arguments as to the declaratory judgment claims. The Court concludes there are no material facts in dispute as to the declaratory judgment claims and judgment in the Cities' favor is appropriate. The Cities' Ordinances currently in effect are not preempted by state law. Additionally, Bellino lacks standing to challenge the other provisions of the Cities' codes because it does not allege an actual controversy for the Court to resolve. Second, the Court addresses Bellino's \u00a7 1983 claims against the Cities. The Court concludes the \u00a7 1983 claims fail because Bellino does not allege a substantive due process violation sufficient to support such claims. Lastly, the Court concludes there are no material facts in dispute supporting Bellino's tortious interference claims because the Cities' actions were not improper and, alternatively, the Cities are immune. Because the Court resolves these claims in the Cities' favor, Bellino's punitive damages claims are moot. The Cities' motions to continue or bifurcate the trial are also moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

And much like the other zoning regulations Bellino challenges, Johnston's temporary structures permit requirement is not expressly preempted because it does not set \"standards or requirements regarding the sale or marketing of consumer merchandise,\" HF 295, and instead concerns the use of a temporary structure, not the sale of merchandise within Johnston's city-limits.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 23 at 24-31 (discussing Ankeny and Pleasant Hill's zoning ordinances).

As the Court concludes for the challenges Bellino brings to Ankeny's City Code, Bellino presents no evidence it has been injured by these provisions of Johnston's City Code.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   IV.A.1.b.

Pleasant Hill (Count XIII)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Similarly to Ankeny and Boone's ordinances, Pleasant Hill's Ordinance limits fireworks sales to industrial zoning districts. ECF No. 54-2 at APHA 46. As stated in the analysis above, such a zoning ordinance is not preempted by state law.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   IV.A.1.a. Pleasant Hill's zoning ordinance does not concern \"the sale or marketing of consumer merchandise that are different from, or in addition to, any requirement established by state law.\" HF 295. Pleasant Hill's ordinance is not irreconcilable with state law, nor is the ordinance preempted under the doctrine of field preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Bellino has not demonstrated it has suffered any injury as a result of the other provisions of Pleasant Hill's City Code it challenges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 45 \u00b6 72 (challenging provisions including \"a required certificate issued by the Zoning Administrator,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"height and yard regulations,\" \"storage regulations,\" \"open space and landscaping requirements,\" \"loading requirements,\" \"and sign regulations\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 56-3 at App. 216-48 (setting forth sections of Pleasant Hill's Code of Ordinances). There is no actual controversy for the Court to resolve.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   IV.A.1.b. Accordingly, the Court grants summary judgment in favor of Pleasant Hill as to the declaratory judgment count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court grants summary judgment in favor of the Cities as to each declaratory judgment count. There are no genuine issues of material fact Bellino can point to showing the Cities' zoning ordinances are preempted. State law also does not preempt Boone's temporary structures requirements,\n   Johnston's Certificate of Zoning Compliance, or Johnston's temporary use permit requirement. Bellino present no actual controversy for the Court to resolve as to the Cities' other regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Court next considers Bellino's other claims against the Cities alleging: section \u00a7 1983 due process violations, tortious interference with contract, and tortious interference with prospective business relationships.

Bellino lacks standing to assert challenges against other miscellaneous provisions of the Cities' codes because Bellino does not present an actual controversy for the Court's resolution and does not allege it sustained any injury as a result of these provisions. Summary judgment is also appropriate in favor of the Cities as to Bellino's \u00a7 1983 due process claims because there are no material facts in dispute that the ordinances violate Bellino's substantive due process rights. The same is true regarding Bellino's tortious interference with contract and prospective business relationships claims. Judgment as a matter of law is appropriate as to Bellino's tortious interference with contract and prospective business relationships claims because there are no allegations the Cities' interference was improper and, alternatively, the Cities actions are afforded discretionary function immunity. Lastly, the Court need not consider whether punitive damages are warranted or appropriate because the Court rules in the Cities' favor as to all counts. Because the Court resolves the claims on summary judgment, the Cities' request to continue or bifurcate trial is moot. The preliminary injunction is also moot and the bond shall be returned to Bellino.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment, ECF Nos. 54 and 57, are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, ECF No. 56, is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . Defendants' Motions to Continue or Bifurcate Trial, ECF Nos. 85 and 87, are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Each party is responsible for its own costs. The $5000 bond previously paid by Plaintiff Bellino shall be returned to Plaintiff as the preliminary injunction is moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 23, 24.
