D. 21 \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    1. El Salvador\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On March 1, 2001, then Attorney General John Ashcroft (\"Ashcroft\") gave El Salvador TPS designation. D. 21 \u00b6 83. That designation was based upon a determination that, due to three earthquakes earlier in the year that had resulted in the deaths of at least 1,100 people and the displacement of approximately 1.3 million people, El Salvador would be \"unable, temporarily, to handle adequately the return of its nationals.\" D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 83-84. On July 11, 2002, Ashcroft extended the designation, finding that the earthquakes had caused substantial damage to the country's infrastructure and that subsequent droughts had left farming families \"destitute\" and 200,000 people \"threatened by food insecurity.\" D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 85-86. On July 16, 2003, then DHS Secretary Tom Ridge (\"Ridge\") extended the designation, stating that the \"economy of El Salvador [was] not yet stable enough to absorb returnees from the United States.\" D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 87-88. Ridge again extended the designation on January 7, 2005, based on a determination that the economy of El Salvador had not yet recovered. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 89-90. On June 15, 2006, then DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff (\"Chertoff\") extended the designation for El Salvador, finding that new natural disasters, including a volcanic eruption and a hurricane that resulted in mudslides and flooding, had slowed rebuilding efforts. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 91-92. Chertoff again extended the designation on August 21, 2007, and October 1, 2008, citing his determination that El Salvador\n   had \"still not completed reconstruction of the infrastructure damaged by several severe 2001 earthquakes\" and was therefore still limited in its ability to absorb potential returnees. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 93-96. On July 9, 2010, then DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano (\"Napolitano\") extended the designation, stating that El Salvador continued to \"suffer a public security crisis that threaten[ed] to undermine sustained development and confidence in democratic governance\" and finding \"increasing levels of violent crime.\" D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 97-98. On January 11, 2012 and May 30, 2013, Napolitano again extended the designation, based on findings of infrastructural deficiencies and subsequent natural disasters. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 99-102. On January 7, 2015, then DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson (\"Johnson\") extended El Salvador's designation, based on the recent eruption of a volcano and a recent tropical storm. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 103-104. On July 8, 2016, Johnson again extended El Salvador's designation. D. 21 \u00b6 105. The effective period for the extension was September 10, 2016 to March 9, 2018. D. 21 \u00b6 105. Johnson cited, in his extension decision, a substantial rise of violence and \"an environment of impunity\" for corruption, violent crimes, and gang activity. D. 21 \u00b6 106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    2. Haiti\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On January 21, 2010, Napolitano gave Haiti TPS designation, finding that a recent earthquake there had \"destroyed most of the capital city\" and affected \"one-third of Haiti's population.\" D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 107-108. Napolitano re-designated Haiti with TPS on May 19, 2011, based on the earthquake's lasting damage to Haiti's infrastructure, the high numbers of displaced persons following the earthquake, the outbreak of a cholera epidemic and a rise in gender-based violence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   D. 21 \u00b6 109-110. Napolitano extended the designation on October 1, 2012, based on similar findings. D. 21 \u00b6 111-12. On March 3, 2014, Johnson extended the designation, citing the slow pace of the economic recovery and new natural disasters, including Hurricane Sandy, which had caused additional displacement, damage and death. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 113-14. On August 25, 2015, Johnson again extended the designation. D. 21 \u00b6 115. The effective period for the extension was January 23, 2016 to July 22, 2017. D. 21 \u00b6 115. The extension was based on continued infrastructural damage, high rates of food insecurity, the lack of emergency services and the lack of a \"functioning legislative branch or duly elected local authorities.\" D. 21 \u00b6 116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    3. Honduras\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On January 5, 1999, then Attorney General Janet Reno designated Honduras for TPS based on findings that Hurricane Mitch had rendered Honduras temporarily unable to handle the return of Honduran nationals. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 117-18. On May 11, 2000, Reno extended the designation for Honduras, determining that Honduras had made \"little progress\" in recovering from Hurricane Mitch and that the reconstruction had \"not sufficiently countered the devastation\" caused by the hurricane. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 119-120. On May 8, 2001, Ashcroft extended Honduras' designation based on findings that only a fraction of the necessary housing units had yet been constructed and that many Hondurans remained in\n   shelters, notwithstanding some progress in the recovery efforts. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 122-23. On May 3, 2002, Ashcroft again extended Honduras' designation, noting that \"[a]lthough there are strong indications of progress in recovery efforts, recent droughts as well as flooding from Hurricane Michelle in 2001 have added to the humanitarian, economic, and social problems initially brought on by Hurricane Mitch in 1998.\" D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 123-24. On May 5, 2003, Ridge extended the designation, determining that prolonged drought and flooding after Hurricane Michelle had compromised food security and disrupted reconstruction efforts. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 125-26. On November 3, 2004, Ridge again extended the designation, finding that Honduras was still recovering from damage to its water and power supplies. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 127-28. On March 31, 2006, Chertoff extended Honduras' designation, citing both continuing vulnerability after Hurricane Mitch and serious storms in 2005. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 129-130. On May 29, 2007, Chertoff again extended the designation, determining that there was continued social and economic stress caused by Hurricane Mitch, with ongoing challenges in the areas of health, infrastructure, and employment. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 131-32. On October 1, 2008, Chertoff extended the designation for a third time, based on findings that much of the newly built housing lacked electricity and water, that more than 600,000 Hondurans lived in flood-prone areas and that much of the drinking water remained contaminated. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 133-34. On May 5, 2010, Napolitano extended Honduras' TPS designation, noting that \"Honduras continue[d] to rely heavily on international assistance\" and that recovery from Hurricane Mitch and subsequent disasters remained incomplete. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 135-36. On November 4, 2011, Napolitano again extended the designation, based on a recent series of natural disasters in Honduras and the determination that Honduras' security situation was \"critical,\" negatively affecting its ability to re-assimilate returning Hondurans. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 137-38. On April 3, 2013, Napolitano extended Honduras' designation a third time, citing a drought in 2012 and a tropical storm in 2011 that had contributed to ongoing problems with water, infrastructure, and sanitation. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 139-140. On October 16, 2014, Johnson extended the designation, finding that Honduras suffered from both food insecurity caused by a drought in 2014 and ongoing problems stemming from Hurricane Mitch and subsequent natural disasters. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 141-142. On May 16, 2016, Johnson again extended Honduras' designation. D. 21 \u00b6 143. The effective period for the extension was July 5, 2016 to January 5, 2018. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 143. Johnson based the extension on findings that Honduras still had a housing deficit of 1.1 million homes; that Honduras was one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere; that Honduras suffered damage caused by Tropical Storm Hanna in 2014; and that Honduras experienced an increase in mosquito-borne disease in 2014 and 2015. D. 21 \u00b6 144.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Allegations Regarding Defendants' Bias\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that President Trump, the head of the Executive Branch in which the DHS Secretary serves, has personally made \"numerous statements reflecting bias and prejudice against immigrants of color, particularly Latino and Haitian immigrants.\" D. 21 \u00b6 148. In support of this allegation, Plaintiffs cite several, alleged statements by President Trump. On or about June 16, 2015, while then-candidate Trump announced his presidential campaign, he stated that \"[w]hen Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. ... They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those\n   problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people ... It's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all over South and Latin America.\" D. 21 \u00b6 149. A few months later, on or about August 6, 2015, then-candidate Trump declared during a debate that the Mexican government was \"send[ing] the bad ones over, because they don't want to pay for them, they don't want to take care of them.\" D. 21 \u00b6 150. On or about August 21, 2015, then-candidate Trump was asked about an incident in which two men beat and urinated on a sleeping Latino man and one, after his arrest, stated that \"Donald Trump was right; all these illegals need to be deported.\" D. 21 \u00b6 151. He allegedly responded by stating that \"[i]t would be a shame ... I will say that the people who are following me are very passionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again. They are passionate.\" D. 21 \u00b6 151. During a presidential debate in October 2016, then-candidate Trump responded to a question on immigration policy by stating that \"[w]e have some bad hombres here and we're going to get them out.\" D. 21 \u00b6 152. In December 2016, after having been elected President, in referring to an article about a crime wave on Long Island, President-elect Trump said, as alleged, \"[t]hey come from Central America. They're tougher than any people you've ever met. They're killing and raping everybody out there. They're illegal. And they are finished.\" D. 21 \u00b6 153.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs also rely on certain actions and statements made by President Trump since he assumed office. On August 25, 2017, the President pardoned former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was to be sentenced for criminal contempt for failing to comply with a federal court order to stop racially profiling Latinos. D. 21 \u00b6 154. During a meeting in the Oval Office in June 2017, President Trump reportedly reacted to a report that 15,000 Haitians had received visas to enter the United States in 2017 by stating that Haitian immigrants \"all have AIDS.\" D. 21 \u00b6 155. In January 2018, during a discussion at the White House of a legislative proposal to reallocate visas from other groups of foreign nationals to TPS recipients, President Trump allegedly said about TPS recipients \"[w]hy are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?\" D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 157-160. President Trump also allegedly asked \"[w]hy do we need more Haitians?\" and demanded that the Senators with whom he was meeting \"[t]ake them out\" of the plan. D. 21 \u00b6 161. President Trump then reportedly stated that policies should encourage immigration from countries like Norway, a predominantly white country, D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 161, while, as Plaintiffs note, El Salvador and Honduras are predominately Latino countries and Haiti is a predominately black country. D. 21 \u00b6 165. President Trump later denied having made such comments, D. 21 \u00b6 163, but others present at the meeting dispute this denial, D. 21 \u00b6 162.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege actions taken by DHS as evidence of bias on the part of Defendants. First, they allege that in April 2017, DHS officials sought evidence regarding criminal records and welfare use by Haitians living in the United States, which they allegedly sought to use to support a decision to rescind TPS status. D. 21 \u00b6 167. Second, on February 14, 2018, DHS issued a press release regarding a legislative proposal on immigration with the headline \"[t]he McCain-Coons Proposal Would Increase Illegal Immigration, Surge Chain Migration, Continue Catch and Release, and Give a Pathway to Citizenship to Convicted Alien Felons.\" D. 21 \u00b6 171. The release also characterized the legislative proposal as a \"[m]ass [l]egalization [b]ill.\" D. 21 \u00b6 171. Third, on February 15, 2018,\n   DHS characterized a proposal to provide conditional permanent resident status for TPS recipients as part of \"a [m]ass [a]mnesty [b]ill for [i]llegal [a]liens of [a]ll [a]ges.\" D. 21 \u00b6 172.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Termination of TPS Designations for El Salvador, Haiti and Honduras\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    1. El Salvador\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On January 18, 2018, Nielsen terminated El Salvador's TPS designation, effective September 9, 2019. D. 21 \u00b6 173. In doing so, Nielsen stated that \"the conditions supporting El Salvador's 2001 designation for TPS on the basis of environmental disaster due to the damage caused by the 2001 earthquakes are no longer met.\" D. 21 \u00b6 174. Plaintiffs allege that Nielsen made clear a \"new rule\" that the Secretary \"would not consider intervening country conditions\" but rather would only consider whether the conditions supporting the initial TPS designation continue to be met. D. 21 \u00b6 174. Plaintiffs also allege that El Salvador is still unable to accept returning nationals safely because the country \"lacks viable infrastructure, is low on housing, [ ] suffers from pervasive and widespread violence,\" has a high underemployment and poverty rate, and has suffered several intervening natural disasters. D. 21 \u00b6 175-78. Economic growth in El Salvador has been stagnant, with high levels of unemployment, and the economy depends heavily on remittances sent from Salvadoran nationals living here. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 179-181. An estimated 220,000 people were forced to flee violence from El Salvador in 2016 alone, due to the widespread human rights abuses and violence, including high levels of gender-based violence. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 182-186.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Nielsen's stated rationale was pretext for invidious discrimination, as evidenced by the adoption of a new rule focusing on the conditions that created the initial designation rather than the general state of the country and the current inability of El Salvador to accept returnees safely. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 187-192. Plaintiffs also allege that Nielsen's reliance on the recent increase in the GDP raises an inference of pretext, because the factors responsible for the increase in GDP included an increase in remittances, which overwhelmingly come from the United States. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 181, 193. Plaintiffs further point to internal DHS reports documenting that El Salvador is one of the \"leading countries of nationality for persons granted either affirmative or defensive asylum.\" D. 21 \u00b6 195. Finally, Plaintiffs contend that the statements by President Trump described above further support the inference of discriminatory animus. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 239-242.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    2. Haiti\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On May 24, 2017, then DHS Secretary John Kelly extended Haiti's TPS designation for six months, effective from July 23, 2017 to January 22, 2018. D. 21 \u00b6 196. This extension was based upon Kelly's finding of a high number of internally displaced persons in Haiti, high levels of gender-based violence and the continuing cholera epidemic. D. 21 \u00b6 197. Kelly, however, only extended the designation for a six-month period, stating that it was \"in the best interest of [Haitian] TPS beneficiaries to prepare for their return to Haiti.\" D. 21 \u00b6 198. On June 6, 2017, while testifying before the Senate, Kelly stated that TPS designations are \"for a specific event. [In] Haiti, it was the earthquake. Yes, Haiti had horrible conditions before the earthquake, and those conditions aren't much better after the earthquake. But the earthquake was why TPS was [ ] granted and [ ] that's how I have to look at it.\" D. 21 \u00b6 244. On January 16, 2018, after Nielsen became the DHS Secretary, she similarly stated that \"the law does not allow me to look at\n   the country conditions of a country writ large. It requires me to look very specifically as to whether the country conditions originating from the original designation continue to exist.\" D. 21 \u00b6 245.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On November 20, 2017, Duke announced the termination of Haiti's TPS designation, effective July 22, 2019. D. 21 \u00b6 199. In doing so, Duke cited a decrease in the number of internally displaced persons. D. 21 \u00b6 200. Plaintiffs allege that Duke \"did not consider all country conditions that might justify TPS designation for Haiti, but rather focused only on the original basis for designation and whether those conditions continued to be met.\" D. 21 \u00b6 200. Plaintiffs allege that Haiti is unable to support a safe return of Haitians currently holding TPS status. D. 21 \u00b6 201. Plaintiffs base this allegation on their claims that Haiti remains one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere; that Haiti's GDP growth has slowed in recent years; that over 37,000 people in Haiti are located in internal displacement camps, with tens of thousands more displaced but not recorded; the settling of many Haitians in inadequate housing; a continued food shortage and severe malnutrition ; the recent damage caused by Hurricane Matthew in October 2016; and Haiti's political instability. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 201-205, 210-211. On or about November 3, 2017, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\"), a branch of DHS, authored a report stating that \"[m]any of the conditions prompting the original January 2010 TPS designation persist, and the country remains vulnerable to external shocks and internal fragility. Haiti ... continues to be affected by a convergence of humanitarian needs, including food insecurity, internal displacement, an influx of returnees from the Dominican Republic, the persistence of cholera, and the lingering impact of various natural disasters.\" D. 21 \u00b6 220 &amp; n.184.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Duke's stated reasoning for terminating Haiti's TPS designation is pretext for invidious discrimination. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 213-214. In support of this allegation, they contend that Duke improperly failed to consider recent conditions in Haiti, including conditions as documented by the USCIS report and similar reports from the Department of State. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 217-218. Plaintiffs also allege that, in addition to President Trump's statements supporting an inference of discriminatory animus, D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 239-42, Duke's reliance on the withdrawal of United Nations forces from Haiti also contributes to an inference of discrimination because such withdrawal cannot be attributed to progress in Haiti but rather a function of controversy related to that mission. D. 21 \u00b6 219.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    3. Honduras\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On December 15, 2017, Duke extended Honduras' TPS designation, with an effective period from January 5, 2018 to July 5, 2018. D. 21 \u00b6 221. This extension, however, was automatic because of Duke's failure to make a determination by the statutory deadline of November 6, 2017. D. 21 \u00b6 222; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(b)(3)(C). Plaintiffs allege that on or about November 6, 2017, Kelly, now White House Chief of Staff, and Tom Bossert, the White House Homeland Security Advisor, pressured Duke to terminate Haiti's TPS designation, notwithstanding that Duke had made no findings regarding whether the statutory requirements for terminating the designation had been satisfied. D. 21 \u00b6 223.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On May 4, 2018, Nielsen terminated Honduras' TPS designation, effective January 5, 2020. D. 21 \u00b6 224. Plaintiffs allege that the report in the Federal Register focused \"only on the original basis for designation and whether those conditions continued to be met.\" D. 21 \u00b6 224. Plaintiffs further allege that Honduras is not\n   able to handle safely the return of Honduran TPS holders, due to several recent natural disasters, recent outbreaks of disease, periodic drought, high levels of entrenched poverty and rampant violent crime, including gang violence and gender-based violence. D. 221 \u00b6\u00b6 225-231. Finally, Plaintiffs allege that the termination of Honduras' TPS designation was based on invidious discrimination, based upon President Trump's aforementioned statements, D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 149-65, and upon Nielsen's departure from what they contend is DHS's ordinary decision-making process. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 236-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs' Claims and Request for Relief\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs assert the following claims against Defendants: violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as incorporated through the Fifth Amendment, based upon unlawful discrimination by race, ethnicity, and/or national origin (Count I); violation of the due process clause, based upon \"irrational government action\" (Count II); violation of the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\") for arbitrarily and capriciously narrowing the scope of review for TPS designations (Count III); violation of the APA for failure to provide notice and comment (Count IV); a count for mandamus relief (Count V); and a count for a declaratory judgment that Defendants' actions are illegal and have caused injury to Plaintiffs and those similarly situated (Count VI). D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 257-286. Plaintiffs further seek an injunction enjoining Defendants from implementing or enforcing the termination of the TPS designation as to the three subject countries. D. 21 at 79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On February 22, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their complaint against Defendants. D. 1. On May 9, 2018, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. D. 21. On May 23, 2018, Defendants moved to dismiss. D. 24. On June 22, 2018, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts filed an amicus brief, joined by a number of other states and the District of Columbia. D. 37. On July 12, 2018, the Court heard argument on the motion and took the matter under advisement. D. 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As an initial matter, Defendants contend that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear any of Plaintiffs' claims. D. 25 at 23-24. The statute states that \"[t]here is no judicial review of any determination of the [Secretary] with respect to the designation, or termination or extension of a designation, of a foreign state under this subsection.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(b)(5)(A). Defendants argue that this provision completely bars all judicial review, including any constitutional and statutory claims related to TPS designation decisions. D. 25 at 23-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiffs respond that, notwithstanding this provision, the Court retains jurisdiction over both constitutional and statutory claims because Congress has not stated with the requisite clarity that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. D. 35 at 15-16. As to the constitutional claims, Plaintiffs cite\n   <em>\n    Webster v.

The court in\n   <em>\n    McNary\n   </em>\n   rejected the comparison to\n   <em>\n    Heckler\n   </em>\n   for two reasons. First, it stated that \"[u]nlike [ ] in\n   <em>\n    Heckler\n   </em>\n   , the individual respondents in this action do not seek a substantive declaration that they are entitled to SAW status[, n]or would the fact that they prevail on their purportedly procedural objections have the effect of establishing their entitlement to SAW status.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 495,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, it stated that \"[u]nlike in\n   <em>\n    Heckler\n   </em>\n   , if not allowed to pursue their claims in the District Court, respondents would not as a practical matter be able to obtain meaningful judicial review of their application denials or of their objections to INS procedures,\" notwithstanding the ability to seek judicial review in removal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/\">\n    at 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In support of its conclusion that removal proceedings would not offer meaningful judicial review, the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    McNary\n   </em>\n   that judicial review in removal proceedings is not available \"unless the alien is [ ] apprehended and deportation proceedings are initiated,\" so \"most aliens denied SAW status can ensure themselves review in courts of appeals only if they voluntarily surrender themselves for deportation. Quite obviously, that price is tantamount to a complete denial of judicial review for most undocumented aliens.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/\">\n    at 496-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court further noted that asserting the constitutional claims at issue would require bringing in \"a substantial amount of evidence, most of which would have been irrelevant in the processing of a particular individual application,\" so \"a court of appeals reviewing an individual SAW determination [would] therefore most likely not have an adequate record as to the pattern of [the agency's] allegedly unconstitutional practices\" and \"also lack the factfinding and record-developing capabilities of a federal district court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/\">\n    at 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the court recognized that, even aside from the risk of deportation, the work authorization that SAW status carried was a separate constitutional interest that required constitutionally fair procedures.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/\">\n    at 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   This case is like\n   <em>\n    McNary\n   </em>\n   in several important respects. Plaintiffs, like the plaintiffs there, bring both constitutional and statutory claims that they frame as challenges to Defendants' process of adjudication rather than the content of any particular adjudication.

The jurisdiction-stripping provision here, like the jurisdiction-stripping provision at issue in\n   <em>\n    McNary\n   </em>\n   , is framed in the singular.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(b)(5)(A) (barring judicial review of \"any determination of the [Secretary] with respect to the designation, or termination or extension of a designation\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201160\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1) (barring judicial review of \"a determination respecting an application for adjustment of status under this section\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Moreover, in both cases, there are comparable examples of jurisdiction-stripping provisions in which Congress used broader language than it did in the provision at issue. In\n   <em>\n    McNary\n   </em>\n   , the Court pointed out that Congress used more expansive language, barring review of \"all questions of law and fact,\" in a provision limiting judicial review of claims for veterans' benefits.\n   <em>\n    McNary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/\">\n    498 U.S. at 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20211\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (1991) ). Plaintiffs here point to the more expansive language Congress used to channel judicial review into removal proceedings. D. 35 at 16. That provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(9), precludes \"[j]udicial review of all questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions\" outside of the specific process provided for in that statute. The language at issue in Section 1254a(b)(5)(A) in this case, barring review of \"any determination of the [Secretary] with respect to the designation, or termination or extension of a designation, of a foreign state\" is less explicitly broad than Section 1252(b)(9), because it lacks the specific language of \"all questions of fact and law, including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions.\" \"When Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another, this Court presumes that Congress intended a difference in meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Dig. Realty Tr., Inc. v. Somers\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616856\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/767/#p777\">\n    138 S.Ct. 767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 777,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616856\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/767/#p777\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) (internal citation omitted). As a result, if the presumptions in favor of review outlined in\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   apply, there are sound textual reasons to conclude that Congress has not spoken with the requisite clarity to bar all judicial review of challenges to the process by which TPS designation determinations are made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendants contend that the presumptions in favor of review should not apply because, unlike in\n   <em>\n    McNary\n   </em>\n   , there remains an avenue for individual plaintiffs to bring their claims, namely, removal proceedings. D. 25 at 24. In support of this argument, they cite\n   <em>\n    Elgin v. Dep't of the Treasury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406976\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/1/#p9\">\n    567 U.S. at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406976\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/1/#p9\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , contending that the clear statement rule in\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   would not apply if Congress merely channeled judicial review into a particular forum. D. 24 at 24. This argument is unavailing because here, as in\n   <em>\n    McNary\n   </em>\n   , there would be no meaningful opportunity for review of Plaintiffs' constitutional and statutory claims in removal proceedings. Like the constitutional and statutory claims at issue in\n   <em>\n    McNary\n   </em>\n   , the assertion of the claims here would require developing a record that would not be possible or relevant in any one individual plaintiff's removal proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aguilar v.

Moreover, the employment authorization that comes with TPS would stop being valid on the effective date of the termination,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20244.12\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 244.12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), but removal proceedings could occur some time after the effective date of the termination of a country's TPS designation, leaving Plaintiffs either unable to vindicate their asserted right to work authorization for a substantial period of time or forced to submit to removal proceedings voluntarily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendants do not explain convincingly how individuals could successfully vindicate their claims in removal proceedings. D. 25 at 24; D. 40 at 10. Defendants contend instead that Elgin supports their claim that\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   's clear statement rule\n   does not apply where Congress channels review into alternative forum, even a more limited one. D. 40 at 10. But in\n   <em>\n    Elgin\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that the alternative forum (there, review by the Federal Circuit of decisions by the Merit Systems Protection Board) had the \"authority to consider and decide petitioners' constitutional claims,\" and \"[t]o the extent such challenges require factual development, the [statute] equips\" the administrative body with the \"tools to create the necessary record.\"\n   <em>\n    Elgin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406976\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/1/#p9\">\n    567 U.S. at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406976\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/1/#p9\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concluded that the \"petitioners' constitutional claims can receive meaningful review within the\" alternative forum.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12406976\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/1/#p9\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The same cannot be said here as to any statutory or constitutional claims regarding TPS designation in any one individual's removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, Defendants contend that, even though Plaintiffs' claims are framed as a challenge to the criteria applied by the Secretary in making decisions regarding extensions of TPS designations, Plaintiffs' claims amount to a challenge to the TPS designation decisions themselves. D. 40 at 18. It is true that Plaintiffs seek the relief of setting aside the decisions made by the Secretary pursuant to what they allege was the application of unlawful criteria. D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 274, 279. Plaintiffs, however, do not seek a substantive declaration from the Court that they are entitled to any particular new TPS determination by the Secretary-the relief that they seek is a declaration that the current termination decisions are \"void and without legal force or effect,\" and an injunction restraining Defendants from \"implementing or enforcing\" those terminations or \"taking any further action\" to terminate designations \"in violation of the U.S. Constitution or other applicable laws.\" D. 21 at 78-79. If this Court were to grant Plaintiffs the relief they seek, the prior TPS determinations would be set aside and the Secretary would need to make new determinations, applying the allegedly lawful criteria, which could result in the same or different TPS determination as to each of the three countries. This stands in contrast to the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Heckler\n   </em>\n   , who sought \"a 'substantive' declaration from [the Secretary] that [certain expenses] are reimbursable under the Medicare Act,\" notwithstanding the objections the plaintiffs offered to some of the procedures followed.\n   <em>\n    Heckler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204204\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/602/\">\n    466 U.S. at 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204204\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/602/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, seeking the remedy of setting aside the Secretary's earlier TPS decisions does not convert Plaintiffs' claim about unlawful process into a substantive challenge to each of the determinations at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendants contended at the motion hearing that, even if Plaintiffs' claim for relief is cast as a redetermination rather than a particular substantive decision, the policy change challenged by Plaintiffs is a mere change in the weighing of factors involved in a TPS designation determination, and such a challenge is in fact substantive, in contrast to the claims in\n   <em>\n    McNary\n   </em>\n   concerning the availability of interpreters. D. 45. As described below, however, Plaintiffs allege that the current administration adopted a new policy that TPS designation determinations are to be made solely on the basis of whether the conditions that created the initial designation persist rather than a broader view of whether the country is safely able to accept returning nationals. The allegation is not that Defendants changed the relative weight given to the persistence of conditions justifying the initial designation versus intervening events or that Defendants changed the balancing of the various factors involved in making a determination of whether the country may safely accept returning nationals changed. The allegation is rather that Defendants are giving no weight to any facts except those regarding\n   whether the conditions that created the initial designation persist. Thus, like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    McNary\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs here allege that the decision is being made on the basis of an improperly narrow record. The difference is that in\n   <em>\n    McNary\n   </em>\n   , the additions to the record-such as the evidence that the plaintiffs would have offered had they had the opportunity to present witnesses-were not available to the decisionmaker, whereas here, Plaintiffs allege that the additions to the record-that is, factfinding regarding intervening conditions-are allegedly being ignored by the Secretary despite being potentially available. That distinction, however, does not change the collateral nature of Plaintiffs' challenge. For all of the aforementioned reasons, the Court thus concludes that Plaintiffs' challenge is sufficiently collateral that the Court has jurisdiction over both the constitutional and statutory claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

Defendants argue that there was no new policy at all, because, contrary to the allegations in the complaint, the decisions to terminate the TPS designations of El Salvador, Haiti and Honduras were accompanied by an examination of not just whether the conditions that led to the initial designation had been ameliorated but also a broader look at the country's capacity to accept returnees safely. D. 40 at 19-20.

Plaintiffs rely upon public statements by Kelly and Nielsen that they adopted the policy that extension is only warranted if the conditions causing the initial designation persist. D. 21 \u00b6 244 (alleging that Kelly stated that \"the earthquake [in Haiti] is why TPS ... was granted ... and that's how I have to look at it\"); D. 21 \u00b6 245 (alleging that Nielsen stated that \"[t]he law does not allow me to look at the country conditions of a country writ large. It requires me to look very specifically as to whether the country conditions originating from the original designation continue to exist\"). Given the reliance of earlier administrations on current country conditions writ large in making TPS designation decisions, D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 92-144, these statements support the reasonable inference that Defendants have adopted a new policy with respect TPS designation decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendants contend that prior administrations \"terminated TPS for countries despite ongoing crises\" and also \"linked TPS extensions to the failure to recover adequately from the crises underlying the initial designation,\" and that, therefore, there is no \"new policy\" to challenge. D. 40 at 20. Defendants point to earlier decisions published in the Federal Register in support of this contention. D. 40 at 20. The publications in the Federal Register are susceptible to judicial notice and referenced in the complaint, so are properly considered by the Court in consideration of Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schatz v.

In this case, by contrast, there is no justification, explicit or otherwise, for Defendants' switch to focusing on whether the conditions that caused the initial designation had abated rather than a fuller evaluation of whether the country would be able to safely accept returnees.

Third, Defendants contend that to the extent there is a new policy, that new policy is not \"in tension with [the] statute that vests TPS decision making in the judgment of the Secretary.\" D. 25 at 35. The Court need not, however, resolve the issue of whether the new policy is in tension with the applicable statute.

D. 21 \u00b6\u00b6 244-245. Thus, under the logic of\n   <em>\n    Lily Transportation\n   </em>\n   , even if the alleged new policy is interpretive, Defendants would be required to provide some rationale acknowledging the change in position to provide the \"observance of procedure required by law,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(D), even though Defendants would not be required to go through a full notice-and-comment process. As addressed above, Defendants have given no explanation at all-much less one acknowledging the change in position-for the new policy. Thus, Defendants' motion to dismiss Count IV is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Count V: Mandamus Relief\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Plaintiffs allege in their complaint that they are entitled to mandamus relief because Defendants have failed in their mandatory and nondiscretionary duties set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(b)(3). D. 21 \u00b6 281. Defendants contend that Plaintiffs' claims do not meet the narrow criteria for mandamus relief. D. 25 at 36-37. Mandamus relief is \"intended to provide a remedy for a plaintiff only if he has exhausted all other avenues of relief and only if the defendant owes him a clear nondiscretionary duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Heckler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204204\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/602/\">\n    466 U.S. at 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204204\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/602/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the Plaintiffs assert substantive claims for relief under the Constitution and the APA and seek injunctive relief for those claims. D. 21 at 74-79. Plaintiffs have thus not yet exhausted all other avenues of relief. Plaintiffs appear to recognize this when they state that because they \"have direct causes of action by way of the Constitution and the APA,\" the\n   Court \"need not reach the cause of action for mandamus\" at this juncture, but that the Plaintiffs \"reserve the right to address the appropriate mechanisms for relief at the merits stage.\" D. 35 at 35 n.7. Plaintiffs have not stated a claim for mandamus relief in the complaint. The Court thus ALLOWS Defendants' motion to dismiss Count V, for mandamus relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Count VI: Declaratory Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that \"Defendants have violated the U.S. Constitution and other laws.\" D. 21 \u00b6 284. Defendants seek to dismiss this claim, on the grounds that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under the Constitution or other laws. D. 25 at 37. As explained above, however, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have stated claims that Defendants have violated the Constitution and the APA. Thus, the Court DENIES Defendants' motion to dismiss Count VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Dismiss President Trump as a Defendant\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Finally, Defendants seek to dismiss President Trump as a defendant.
