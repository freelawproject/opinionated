McMann allege that Selene Finance LP (\"Selene\"), a loan servicer, and Korde &amp; Associates, PC (\"Korde\"), counsel of record for Selene and a debt collector pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, violated federal and state statutes in the servicing of a loan and the attempted collection of plaintiffs' debt with respect to a property located on Crescent Street in Weston, Massachusetts (\"the Property\").

In January, 2008, plaintiffs defaulted on the mortgage and continue to be in default. When asked at an earlier hearing whether he had made any payments on the mortgage since 2008, Mr. McMann, representing himself\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   , answered that he does not recall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On or around May 11, 2017, plaintiffs sent Korde a Qualified Written Request (\"QWR\") pursuant to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202605\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That QWR requested written responses and production of documents with respect to a myriad of questions relating to the mortgage. Selene purportedly responded to that QWR by letter dated July 31, 2017, although plaintiff denies that he ever received the letter. Plaintiffs also contend that Korde sent correspondence to Eileen McMann's sister in an effort to collect the alleged debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that 1) Selene violated M.G.L. c. 244, \u00a7 35B (Count 4) and its implementing regulation at 209 C.M.R. \u00a7 56.07 (Count 5) by failing to publish a notice of foreclosure sale without first having taken reasonable steps to avoid foreclosure, 2) defendants breached their contract with plaintiffs (Count 6), 3) defendants violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    etseq.\n   </em>\n   , (Count 7), 4) defendants violated the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\"RESPA\") by failing to respond to a Qualified Written Request (\"QWR\"),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202605\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , (Count 8), 5) defendants violated the Truth-in-Lending Act (\"TILA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    etseq.\n   </em>\n   , (Count 9) and 6) those various violations constitute unfair or deceptive trade practices in violation of M.G.L. c. 93A (Count 10).

Mass. 2017). The Court held that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits of either their RESPA or FDCPA claim and that plaintiffs had not established that monetary damages would be insufficient to remedy the injuries they alleged. The Court ordered that any funds received from the foreclosure sale \"are to be held in escrow\n   by defendants until this litigation is concluded.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277727\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/281/218/#p220\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277727\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/281/218/#p220\">\n    at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendants state that the total debt secured by the mortgage at issue was in excess of one million dollars and that at the foreclosure sale Wilmington Savings Fund Society (\"Wilmington\") submitted a credit bid of $920,000, which was the highest bid received at such sale. Therefore, defendants argue that there are no funds to be paid into escrow. The plaintiffs request that the Wilmington credit bid of $920,000 be held by this Court so that it can accrue interest during the pendency of the litigation. Defendants have represented that Wilmington will refrain from recording its foreclosure deed until this action is concluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The facts that plaintiffs allege supporting their FDCPA claim also state a claim under Chapter 93A. The Court has dismissed all other claims alleged in plaintiffs' complaint.

LR, D. Mass 67.3 (d). This Court previously ordered that funds received from the foreclosure sale are to be held in escrow by defendants until the litigation has concluded. Defendants declare that the Wilmington credit bid at the foreclosure sale ($920,000) does not exceed the total debt secured by the mortgage (in excess of one million dollars) and thus there are no funds to be paid into escrow. Furthermore, defendants have stated that Wilmington will refrain from recording its foreclosure deed until this action is concluded. Because there are no escrow funds to be preserved, plaintiffs' motion to appoint an escrow agent will be denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    <strong>\n     C.\n     <em>\n      Leave to Amend\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The First Circuit Court of Appeals has explained that the fact a plaintiff files a complaint\n    <em>\n     pro\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     se\n    </em>\n    \"militates in favor of a liberal reading.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Boivin\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Black\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11230906\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/225/36/#p43\">\n     225 F.3d 36\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 43 (1st Cir. 2000).

At the same time, the Court will not become a drafter of pleadings, especially in a realm of consumer law where attorneys' fees are made available by statute to ensure the protection of plaintiffs such as the McManns.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(a)(3) (providing for reasonable attorneys' fees as determined by the court); M.G.L. c. 93A \u00a7 11 (providing for attorneys' fees and costs).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The Court will dismiss plaintiffs' claims under M.G.L. c. 244, \u00a7 35B (Count 4), 209 C.M.R. \u00a7 56.07 (Count 5) and TILA (Count 9) with prejudice, meaning that the McManns will be precluded from raising those claims again in this Court. The breach of contract and RESPA claims, on the other hand, do not fail as a matter of law but rather because the complaint does not include sufficient factual allegations to state claims for relief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    A district court \"should freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.\" Fed.
