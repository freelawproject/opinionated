Plaintiffs alleged that JMAV, as general contractor of a construction project, was negligent resulting in serious injury to Mr. Parker, a construction worker on the project site. Defendant JMAV subsequently filed a Third-Party Complaint against Third-Party Defendant Strittmatter Metro, LLC (\"Strittmatter\"), and Strittmatter, in turn, filed a Fourth-Party Complaint against Fourth-Party Defendant Environmental Consultants and Contractors, Inc. (\"ECC\"). Subsequent procedural developments included Plaintiffs' amendment of their Complaint to add ECC as a Defendant. ECC also asserted counterclaims against Strittmatter and\n   cross-claims against JMAV. JMAV in turn asserted cross-claims against ECC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Presently before the Court are Strittmatter's [121] Motion for Summary Judgment, ECC's [122] Motion for Summary Judgment, and JMAV's [123] Motion for Summary Judgment on Count I and II of Its Amended Third Party Complaint.

Without the benefit of further definition in the Owner/ECC Agreement, the finder of fact could construe \"Contractor\" as JMAV and possibly also as Strittmatter, for Strittmatter assumed JMAV's obligations to the Owner with respect to excavation. The Agreement also contemplates that other parties on the project site may want to rely on ECC's \"reports ... and any other information generated by [ECC] for the Project,\" which reliance the Agreement prohibits \"without the prior written consent of Owner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270330\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/224/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art. 3(e).

The finder of fact could determine that the Owner/JMAV Agreement is one such instance of the Owner's prior written consent to rely on information that ECC generated for the project. The Owner/JMAV Agreement expressly incorporates ECC's 2014 Report-upon which ECC expressly allowed one of the member entities of Owner to rely-and permits JMAV to rely on any environmental reports and other information that the Owner furnishes. Owner/JMAV Agreement at 37 (Ex. A), 80;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   2014 Report at 10 (permitting reliance by Insight Apollo LLC). ECC admits that it provided its daily reports to JMAV when the Owner so requested; whether that request was in writing is not clear from the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECC's Mot. at 4 (Statement of Undisputed Material Facts \u00b6 9); Dep. of John Diehl at 70:7-19, ECC's Ex. C, ECF No. 122-3. The JMAV/Strittmatter Agreement also references the 2014 Report. JMAV/Strittmatter Agreement at 30 (Ex. C). The 2014 Report calls for \"[c]ontinuous observation, field screening, and air monitoring by an environmental professional to identify petroleum-contaminated soil during excavation.\" 2014 Report at 20. The finder of fact could determine that JMAV and Strittmatter expected ECC, as the environmental professional on site, to engage in the continuous air monitoring that it had contemplated. That expectation would be all the more reasonable because the Owner/JMAV and, in turn, JMAV/Strittmatter agreements expressly carve out relevant environmental obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Owner/JMAV Agreement at 57 (Ex. B) (e.g., \"soil contamination monitoring\"); JMAV Strittmatter Agreement at 28 (Ex. B) (e.g., \"[s]oil and [m]aterial [t]esting (by Owner)\"). It is up to the finder of fact to determine whether those carve outs include monitoring air near soil for VOCs, but the contractual language could support that inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   There is sufficient evidence in the record to create, at the least, a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether JMAV and Strittmatter were intended beneficiaries of the Owner/ECC Agreement. The finder of\n   fact could determine both that \"recognition of a right to performance in the beneficiary [i.e., JMAV and Strittmatter] is appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties [i.e., Owner and ECC],\" and that \"circumstances indicate that the promisee [i.e., Owner] intend[ed] to give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance.\"\n   <em>\n    Fort Lincoln Civic Ass'n, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8387828\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/944/1055/#p1064\">\n    944 A.2d at 1064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 302(1) ).

The appropriate consideration in this case is accordingly whether there is a contract between JMAV and ECC. It is undisputed that there is no such contract.

ECC's Mot. at 28. ECC amplifies the argument in its Reply by asserting that only a \"direct\" promise from ECC to JMAV counts. ECC Reply at 12. But ECC has evidently manufactured that notion, as it cites no case law in support (or in opposition). In the Court's view, both parties miss key language, among the thicket of documents, that could be construed as a promise to JMAV, whether or not that promise is \"direct.\" The \"Review and Approval\" page of the EHASP provides that \"[t]he undersigned,\" which includes at least ECC, \"agree to abide by the safety and health requirements and procedures outlined in this document.\" EHASP at 3. Those requirements and procedures would seem to include ECC's commitment to monitor air using a PID \"as [excavation] work progresses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   EHASP at 19. The finder of fact could reasonably understand this as a promise on the part of ECC, notwithstanding any obligations JMAV also had to monitor site safety. And while those to whom ECC's purported promise is directed may include the Owner and D.C. officials, for whom the EHASP was \"prepared\" and to whom it was \"submitted,\" respectively, the finder of fact could also determine that promisees include other signatories to the EHASP that likewise are agreeing to abide by the document.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EHASP at 1 (cover page referring to Owner and D.C. officials). The record lacks any firm indication that JMAV signed a copy of the EHASP, but the document suggests that it has been reviewed by Strittmatter and therefore likely by JMAV as well.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (indicating that \"[t]his document has been reviewed by the undersigned representatives of companies performing earthwork, excavation, ... and related development activities\" on site).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court need not reach the questions of whether any promise by ECC reasonably induced reliance, and whether JMAV so relied, to its detriment.

Rather, the Court shall need to evaluate whether Strittmatter has a special relationship with ECC and JMAV that could bring their\n   claims within the exception recognized in this jurisdiction for instances in which an employer has independent duties grounded in a special relationship with third parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Howard Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7927216\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/608/116/#p123\">\n    608 A.2d at 123-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In its prior discussion of the WCA, this Court did not directly and expressly address the effect of the WCA on ECC's claims for contribution and for negligence and negligent misrepresentation, or on JMAV's claims for breach of contract and contractual indemnity. It is important at this stage, however, to distinguish between third parties' efforts to recover from an employer under a common law indemnity theory and those efforts to do so under other theories. The case law in this jurisdiction that permits recovery against an employer-otherwise protected under the WCA-when the parties have a \"special relationship,\" appears to have been developed primarily for situations in which a party seeks indemnity from the employer at common law.\n   <em>\n    See generally, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Howard Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7927216\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/608/116/#p123\">\n    608 A.2d 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Myco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7348355\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/565/293/#p299\">\n    565 A.2d 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Strittmatter does not allege that the exclusivity provision so operates, but the Court addresses it here in the interest of completeness. In\n   <em>\n    Myco\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Court of Appeals recognized that a contractual indemnity claim falls outside the scope of claims prohibited under the WCA because, in the event of a contractual indemnity provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   the duty involved is one voluntarily accepted by the employer and existing separate and apart from either of the parties' relationships with the injured employee.

Below the Court shall consider the merits of the contractual indemnity claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Court is left to determine the effects of the WCA's exclusivity provision on ECC's negligence and negligent\n   misrepresentation claims and JMAV's breach of contract claim. Strittmatter does not cite any authority-aside from the plain text of the WCA's exclusivity provision-in support of its argument that ECC's negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims are barred by that provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Strittmatter's Mot. at 22; Strittmatter's Reply at 10-11. Strittmatter does not argue that JMAV's breach of contract claim is barred by the exclusivity provision. Accordingly, the Court shall proceed to consider the merits of the negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract claims. In any event, the Court is of the view that the WCA exclusivity provision does not bar these claims against Strittmatter, for the same reasons that actions for contractual indemnity are not so barred. JMAV's breach of contract claim, like its contractual indemnity claim, should survive the WCA exclusivity bar because Strittmatter shouldered certain duties voluntarily upon entering into contract with JMAV, and those duties exist \"apart from either of the parties' relationships with the injured employee.\"\n   <em>\n    Myco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7348355\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/565/293/#p299\">\n    565 A.2d at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And indeed the record contains evidence that could support such a finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As ECC observes, the JMAV/Strittmatter Agreement deems Strittmatter's \"coordination and cooperation\" with third parties on site to be an \"essential term\" under that agreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Subcontractor shall\n   <em>\n    coordinate and cooperate in all respects\n   </em>\n   , during every phase of Subcontractor's performance of the Work, with Owner, Contractor, Architect, other Subcontractors, and any public authority or\n   <em>\n    third party who may be employed or engaged in activity on or near the site in relation to the Project\n   </em>\n   .

Strittmatter concedes that it \"was responsible ... for coordinating [its] work [e.g., of \"digging holes\"] with others onsite.\" Strittmatter's Reply at 10. But Strittmatter seems to dispute the full implications of the JMAV/Strittmatter Agreement language when Strittmatter asserts that \"[t]he Subcontract does not require Strittmatter to perform any work related to environmental controls at the site\n   <em>\n    nor does it require any specific communications with or obligations to ECC\n   </em>\n   .\" Strittmatter's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, ECF No. 121-2, \u00b6 16 (emphasis added). Whatever specific communications the JMAV/Strittmatter Agreement may have required, or not required, Strittmatter does not dispute that it had \"daily on-site conversations\" with JMAV and ECC representatives as to \"where the work would occur each day, so ECC could coordinate its work at the Apollo jobsite.\" Strittmatter's Resp. to Statements of Undisputed Material Facts Submitted by JMAV and ECC, ECF No. 124-2, \u00b6 53 (Resp. to ECC's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts);\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-55 (indicating that these conversations would \"direct[ ]\" ECC as to excavation location).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the foregoing evidence, the finder of fact could conclude that Strittmatter had a duty to inform ECC as to the location of that excavation, and that this duty entailed informing ECC as part of these daily conversations. Strittmatter does not proceed further than its argument that it had no duty. The Court need not either. The Court finds that Strittmatter has not met its burden to establish that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on ECC's negligence claim based on undisputed material facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Strittmatter's efforts to defend against ECC's negligent misrepresentation claim also fail. In arguing that it has no duty to ECC, Strittmatter evidently attempts to prove that the second prong of the negligent misrepresentation test cannot be satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Regan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160942\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/21/#p37\">\n    134 F.Supp.3d at 37-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the [false] statement or omission was in violation of\n   <em>\n    a duty to exercise reasonable care\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) ). The Court already has found that Strittmatter did not discharge its burden to show that undisputed material facts clear Strittmatter of any duty to ECC. Because the finder of fact could determine that Strittmatter did have certain duties, the breach of which could result in tort liability to ECC, the Court does not proceed further in its analysis of ECC's negligent misrepresentation claim. Strittmatter is unable at this time to prevail in its attempt to obtain summary judgment as to that negligent misrepresentation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    3.

JMAV, in turn, responds to Strittmatter's motion by discussing only indemnity issues.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   JMAV's Opp'n to Strittmatter's Mot.

Under the Court's foregoing analysis, the finder of fact could determine that Strittmatter did have relevant obligations to JMAV under the JMAV/Strittmatter Agreement. A breach of Strittmatter's safety obligations under the Site-Specific Plan could support JMAV's breach of contract claim. Because Strittmatter has not proven that it lacks duties to JMAV under their contract, the Court shall not proceed at this time to consider whether Strittmatter breached those duties.

It remains unnecessary to consider implied-in-law indemnity any further, however, as Strittmatter challenges JMAV's and ECC's implied indemnity claims on purely implied-in-fact grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Strittmatter's Mot. at 9-10. It is only if Strittmatter owed \"a specific duty of defined nature\" to JMAV and to ECC, independent of the incident giving rise to this case, and had a \"special legal relationship\" with each of them, that JMAV and ECC, respectively, would be able to prevail against Strittmatter on an implied-in-fact theory of indemnity.\n   <em>\n    Quadrangle Dev.

The Court accordingly considers whether Strittmatter has carried its burden to prove that it had no such duty, and no such relationship, with either JMAV or ECC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Strittmatter argues that it lacked an independent duty to JMAV and ECC that could give rise to implied-in-fact indemnity. Strittmatter's Mot. at 9-10. But based on the JMAV/Strittmatter Agreement and the parties' daily conversations at the project site, the Court has already determined above that the finder of fact could discern that Strittmatter had a duty to inform ECC as to where excavation would be occurring each day. The finder of fact likewise could determine that the same contractual language and on-site conversations support a duty to inform JMAV. The \"coordination and cooperation\" clause in the JMAV/Strittmatter Agreement expressly applied to Strittmatter's interaction with JMAV, defined as the \"Contractor,\" just as it also expressly applied to third parties on site such as ECC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JMAV/Strittmatter Agreement at 19 (Ex. B). Moreover, the daily coordination meetings-suggesting at least one means by which contractual coordination was to take place-included JMAV.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Strittmatter's Resp. to Statements of Undisputed Material Facts Submitted by JMAV and ECC, ECF No. 124-2, \u00b6 53 (Resp. to ECC's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts). While JMAV would not be using information from Strittmatter in order to determine where to take air measurements, the finder of fact could determine that JMAV could use this information as part of its \"overall responsibility\" to ensure site safety. EHASP at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Because the finder of fact could discern that Strittmatter owed duties to JMAV and ECC, independent of the incident involving Mr. Parker, the Court need not reach the issue of Strittmatter's special relationship with JMAV and ECC. The Court finds that genuine disputes of material fact regarding Strittmatter's duties preclude Strittmatter from obtaining summary judgment as to JMAV's and ECC's common law indemnity claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <em>\n    5. Contractual Indemnity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Strittmatter also seeks summary judgment as to JMAV's contractual indemnity claim, which the Court determined above is not barred by the WCA's exclusivity provision. JMAV's claim is based on the following language in the JMAV/Strittmatter Agreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   To the fullest extent permitted by the law of the District of Columbia, the Subcontractor [Strittmatter] shall indemnify and hold harmless the Owner, the Architect and the Contractor [JMAV] and all of their agents and employees from and against all claims, damages, losses and expenses, including but not limited to attorney's fees, caused by, arising out of, in connection with, or resulting from the performance of the Subcontractor's Work under this Subcontract, where any such claim, damage, loss or expense is attributable to bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death, or to injury to or destruction of tangible property including the loss of use resulting therefrom, and is caused by or arises in whole or in part, from any negligent or non-negligent act or omission of the Subcontractor or any of its agents, employees, sub-subcontractors or others ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   JMAV/Strittmatter Agreement at 10 (Art. 11.11.1). In the Court's decision denying JMAV's first motion for partial summary judgment, which the Court expressly incorporates herein, the Court determined whether the contract was ambiguous as a matter of law such that discovery would be necessary to fill the gap.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parker I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122098\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/189/38/\">\n    189 F.Supp.3d at 42-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Strittmatter's interpretation is incorrect. The issue is instead whether discovery has cleared up the ambiguity in the contractual language. Strittmatter has not cited any evidence in the record to resolve that ambiguity. Accordingly, the Court finds that Strittmatter has not carried its burden to prove that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on JMAV's contractual indemnity claim based on undisputed material facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    C. JMAV's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   As the Court has discussed, JMAV previously sought partial summary judgment as to the contractual indemnity claim in Count I of its Third-Party Complaint against Strittmatter, which the Court denied.\n   <em>\n    Parker I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122098\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/189/38/\">\n    189 F.Supp.3d at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

JMAV does not move as to its claim for common law indemnity.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122098\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/189/38/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   At the threshold, the Court reiterates its finding above that neither JMAV's contractual indemnity claim nor its breach of contract claim is barred by the WCA's exclusivity provision. But, for the reasons that follow, JMAV is unable to carry its burden as to either its contractual indemnity claim or its breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <em>\n    1. Contractual Indemnity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The Court found above that Strittmatter did not discharge its burden to show that ambiguity in the JMAV/Strittmatter Agreement's indemnity provision could be resolved in its favor based on facts presently in the record. The Court now finds that JMAV similarly has failed to cite any evidence that was not before the Court in\n   <em>\n    Parker I\n   </em>\n   to show that JMAV and Strittmatter intended the indemnity provision to cover JMAV's own negligence, if any. JMAV attempts instead to basically re-open the entirety of the Court's\n   <em>\n    Parker I\n   </em>\n   decision, urging again that the law supports its reading of the contractual language, as well as arguing that Strittmatter's and Mr. Parker's alleged negligence require Strittmatter to indemnify JMAV.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   JMAV's Mot. (focusing on Strittmatter's and Mr. Parker's actions); JMAV's Reply (focusing on contractual interpretation and Strittmatter's actions). JMAV did not seek reconsideration of the\n   Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Parker I\n   </em>\n   , and the Court sees no reason now to revisit its prior finding that the contractual language was ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   JMAV's various arguments do not answer the question that remains, namely whether any evidence from outside of the contract can clarify whether the parties intended that JMAV could recover regardless of its negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The D.C. Court of Appeals decision in\n   <em>\n    Schlosser\n   </em>\n   precludes a finding that JMAV can recover for its own negligence unless this Court is \"firmly convinced\" that JMAV and Strittmatter so intended in their indemnity provision.\n   <em>\n    W.M.

The Court finds that JMAV has not proven that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to its contractual indemnity claim against Strittmatter based on undisputed material facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <em>\n    2. Breach of Contract\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   JMAV also seeks to recover for the alleged breach of Strittmatter's obligations under the JMAV/Strittmatter Agreement. JMAV's Mot. at 18-19. Strittmatter's opposition is limited to arguing that JMAV's breach of contract claim is effectively a recycled contractual indemnity claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Strittmatter's Opp'n to JMAV's and ECC's Mots. at 13. The Court has elsewhere rejected Strittmatter's attempt to lump ECC's negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims into its common law indemnity claim, in part for lack of authority supporting that notion. Here again, Strittmatter offers no authority for its assertion-in essence-that JMAV cannot separately pursue both contractual indemnity and breach of contract claims against Strittmatter springing from the injury to Mr. Parker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In evaluating Strittmatter's motion for summary judgment as to JMAV's breach of contract claim, the Court found that Strittmatter failed to establish that it lacked contractual obligations to JMAV, and accordingly the Court declined to reach the issue of whether Strittmatter breached any such duties. Now that JMAV has the burden, the Court agrees that the record could support a finding that Strittmatter had certain safety obligations under the JMAV/Strittmatter Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JMAV's Mot. at 18-19 (arguing that those obligations included training employees). For example, \"Subcontractor Foremen\" were required to \"train their employees to perform their work in a safe manner and to recognize and correct potential and actual hazards and unsafe acts.\" JMAV/Strittmatter Agreement at 52 (Ex. D). Accordingly, the Court proceeds to consider whether Strittmatter breached those obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   JMAV argues that Strittmatter \"failed to provide [Mr. Parker with] any information about the existence, safe handling, or excavation of contaminated soil on\n   the Apollo Project.\" JMAV's Mot. at 18-19 (citing Statement of Material Facts Not in Genuine Dispute, ECF No. 123-2 (\"JMAV's Statement\"), \u00b6\u00b6 31, 43). Strittmatter denies JMAV's assertions of undisputed material fact, arguing that \"Mr. Abel specifically testified that he spoke to Mr. Parker about the job he was to do on the Apollo work site and that Mr. Parker should have received further orientation and training from [JMAV].\" Strittmatter's Resp. to Statements of Undisputed Material Facts Submitted by JMAV and ECC, ECF No. 124-2, \u00b6 31 (Resp. to Moriarity's [sic] Statement of Undisputed Material Facts) (citing Dep. of Richard Abel at 12:16-21, 13:11-18, JMAV's Ex. 17, ECF No. 123-21);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43 (referring to response to \u00b6 31).

Absent record evidence to support Strittmatter's position, the Court would be led to conclude that JMAV had carried its burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Upon examination of JMAV's evidence for its so-called undisputed facts, however, the Court is not persuaded that summary judgment is warranted. JMAV refers to the deposition testimony of Mr. Parker and of Strittmatter's corporate designee. JMAV's Statement \u00b6 31 (citing Dep. of J. Parker at 160:14-16, JMAV's Ex. 11, ECF No. 123-15; Dep. of C.R. Strittmatter at 49:3-52:9, JMAV's Ex. 10B, ECF No. 123-13). In particular, JMAV cites the following exchange in a deposition of Mr. Parker:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   Q .... When you got to the Apollo job site, what did Strittmatter tell you about the job site?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   A Nothing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Dep. of J. Parker at 160:14-16, JMAV's Ex. 11, ECF No. 123-15. The cited deposition testimony of Strittmatter's designee is longer and covers several topics, but it likewise involves questioning as to \"what specifically ... Mr. Parker [was told] when he first got to this jobsite.\" Dep. of C.R. Strittmatter at 49:3-52:9, JMAV's Ex. 10B, ECF No. 123-13. That designee indicates that Mr. Parker was told about \"the potential of underground tanks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52:2-5.

ECC argues that this language shows that JMAV should not be permitted to rely on documents and information generated by ECC\n    <em>\n     with regard to safety\n    </em>\n    , since that does not relate to the time and cost factors in this second clause.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECC's Reply at 13. However, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to non-movant JMAV, the first clause can be read to permit reliance independently of whether it has any effect on time or cost.
