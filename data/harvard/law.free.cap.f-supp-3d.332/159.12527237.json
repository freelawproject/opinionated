Before the Court is the Office of Compliance's Motion to Dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant the motion and will dismiss the complaint without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Terry Wigfall began working for the Office of Compliance (OOC), a federal legislative agency, in 2007. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 18. Around 2010,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wigfall began working with John Uelmen, then a senior attorney.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Uelmen is a white man, and according to Wigfall, he \"had trouble interacting with non-white employees\" and \"frequently ignored\" them \"[f]rom the outset.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. In the fall of 2013, when OOC was considering Uelmen for the general counsel position, Wigfall \"raised concerns\" to OOC's executive director that \"Uelmen was racist and sexist.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. OOC did not select Uelmen for the general counsel role in 2013, but he later became general counsel in 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. From 2010 to the present, Wigfall alleges that Uelmen \"has regularly engaged in rude and inappropriate behavior\" including interrupting her at meetings and minimizing her achievements, while sparing Wigfall's white colleagues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. Wigfall claims that \"Uelmen's poor treatment of [her] intensified after she recommended to the Board that he not be chosen as General Counsel in 2013,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39, though her complaint does not allege any specific instances before 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Wigfall was promoted to occupational safety and health (OSH) program manager in 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. In that role, she completed three reports between August and October 2015 finding health and safety issues in cases filed by the Architect of the Capitol's Inspector General's Office employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. In October 2015, the general counsel (Uelmen's predecessor, a white woman named Amy Dunning) told Wigfall that she intended to remove the findings, and Wigfall \"strongly objected.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. On October 28, 2015, Dunning gave Wigfall a negative performance evaluation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. Wigfall alleges that \"[b]ecause of [her] negative performance evaluation, she was denied a bonus in 2015,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44, though she admits in her opposition to OOC's motion to dismiss that she learned of the bonus decision in September, Pl.'s Opp'n, Dkt. 37 at 9. Wigfall met with OOC's executive director on October 30 and November 5, and at both meetings she \"expressed concerns of racial discrimination in the office.\" Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 7, after investigating a complaint from another OOC employee, Wigfall informed management about mold in one of OOC's file rooms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-51. OOC's executive director \"became visibly upset and stated that there should be no findings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Sometime in December, Uelmen stopped processing Wigfall's report on this issue and \"changed the process of OSH safety reports\" so that \"attorneys completed a final review without input from the OSH team,\" often resulting in attorneys removing OSH findings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. And on December 9, after Wigfall had submitted calendars with inspection dates for the OSH team, Uelmen \"returned the calendar proposal with additional job duties\" that included \"increas[ing] the schedule from 3 days of inspections per week to 4 days per week, and added inspections pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. Wigfall believes this added work was retaliation for her mold-in-the-file-room findings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In \"spring 2016,\" an OOC attorney-Hillary Benson-started wearing mosquito repellant because she was pregnant and did not want to contract the Zika virus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. Wigfall \"immediately began having significant negative, physically disabling reactions to the repellant, including difficulty breathing,\" and her reactions \"materially impacted her ability to perform her job duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. She missed \"numerous days of work\" and had to work from an empty conference room when she did come in.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. Wigfall alleges she \"asked for a reasonable accommodation\"-she does not specify what-but that Uelmen dismissed her reactions as seasonal allergies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59-60. Wigfall alleges that she took two days of sick leave in April 2016 \"to recover from bronchitis that she developed as a result of [Benson's] excessive use of insect repellant inside OOC offices.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66. On April 18, Uelmen \"acted aggressively\" in a staff meeting, and Wigfall believes this behavior was retaliation for her accommodation request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67. On April 20, Uelmen sent Wigfall an expectations memo that was critical of Wigfall's job performance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Wigfall filed her first counseling request with OOC on April 25, 2016, and she alleges in her complaint that she \"discussed the issues contained above\" in her first counseling request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69. She completed counseling and requested mediation on June 14; the mediation period ended on August 25.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At a May 2 staff meeting, Uelmen \"did not permit [Wigfall] to speak\" and \"ignored her.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. At meetings on May 4 and May 18, Benson sat close to Wigfall, and Wigfall believes she did so intentionally despite knowing of Wigfall's bug spray sensitivity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72, 74. Uelmen ignored a May 11 email from Wigfall complaining about the repellant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. On May 18, after Wigfall met with Architect of the Capitol staff to discuss cleaning the office to remove the bug spray smell, OOC's executive director \"scolded\" her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75-76. And while a cleaning did take place in late May 2016 that allowed Wigfall to work in her office, Wigfall \"does not believe that the spring cleaning was related to her request for a reasonable accommodation\" and alleges that OOC \"wholly failed\" to accommodate her or engage in an interactive process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Wigfall alleges continuing \"[r]acial and [g]ender [d]isparities\" over the summer of 2016. In May and June, after Wigfall complained to Uelmen that one of her direct reports-a white woman-was habitually late and unresponsive to Wigfall's correction, Uelmen instructed Wigfall to write her up but then met with the employee and took her side.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-82. Wigfall further alleges that Uelmen \"strongly encouraged\n   [Wigfall] to discipline non-white employees against [her] judgment,\" but \"refused to allow\" her to discipline two white employees (including the tardy employee).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84. Finally, at a July 18 meeting, Uelmen \"ignored\" Wigfall and instead directed questions to her subordinate, a white man.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 22, 2016, Wigfall filed a second request for counseling \"as to the continued discrimination and retaliation that occurred after her first request in April 2016.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86. She requested mediation on September 22, and mediation ended on October 24.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87. On September 6, a few weeks after Wigfall's second counseling request, Uelmen \"further increased [her] workload by requiring her to complete four employee evaluations\" by September 9.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88. Uelmen also attended performance review for Wigfall's subordinates-something he had not done before-and \"consistently praised\" the white female employee Wigfall had attempted to write up for tardiness.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 90-91. Uelmen also promised a white male employee he would help him get a raise, but did not make similar promises to minority employees and generally \"praised white employees more than non-white employees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Wigfall sued OOC on November 23, 2016. Dkt. 1. Her complaint-as amended,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 34-lists four counts under the Congressional Accountability Act: failure to accommodate her disabilities; discrimination on the bases of gender, race, and disability; hostile work environment on the bases of gender, race, and disability; and retaliation. Each of her four counts \"repeats and realleges\" her entire complaint without specifying which acts are alleged to support which counts, leaving the Court to parse the events recounted above for colorable claims of failure to accommodate, discrimination, hostile work environment, and retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

It took place after Wigfall's second request for counseling on August 22, and Wigfall does not allege that she ever engaged in a third round of counseling and mediation. \"[T]he completion of counseling and mediation for one set of violations does not give the court jurisdiction over related claims of retaliation that occurred after counseling had commenced; the administrative remedies must be exhausted for each claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Gordon v.
