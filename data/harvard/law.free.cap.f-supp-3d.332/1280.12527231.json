Simon, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff, Joseph J. Munger, Sr. (\"Munger\"), formerly was employed by Defendant, Cascade Steel Rolling Mills, Inc. (\"Cascade\"). After Cascade terminated Munger's employment based on asserted violations of its attendance policy, Munger filed a grievance with his union, challenging Cascade's employment action. Munger's union grieved his challenge under the collective bargaining agreement between Cascade and the union, requiring the parties to engage in binding arbitration. After a hearing, the arbitrator ruled in favor of Cascade, finding that Cascade had just cause to terminate Munger's employment and dismissing Munger's grievance. Munger then filed this lawsuit in federal court. Cascade moves to dismiss solely under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, arguing that Munger lacks standing thus depriving this Court of subject matter jurisdiction. Cascade reserves all other defenses for another time. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies Cascade's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Gunn v.

Munger alleges that he requested medical leave for September 21-23, 2015, October 5-9, 2015, and May 25-26, 2016. Munger also alleges that Cascade wrongfully treated his absences on those dates as non-medical events. Munger adds that Cascade wrongfully suspended Munger on October 26, 2015, and wrongfully terminated his employment on June 2, 2016. In this lawsuit, Munger asserts claims alleging retaliation and discrimination in violation of the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"), the Oregon Family Leave Act, and the Oregon Sick Time Leave Act. Munger also alleges common law wrongful discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, for and on behalf of Local Union 8378 (the \"Union\") and Cascade are parties to a Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"CBA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among other things, the CBA states: \"It is agreed that the Company [Cascade] and the Union shall comply with all the appropriate state and federal statutes dealing with discrimination.\" CBA, \u00a7 3.2. The CBA also contains, in Article 28, a process for the adjustment of grievances. The preamble to that article provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Should any dispute arise between the Company and the Union\n   <em>\n    or the employees represented by the Union\n   </em>\n   during the term of this Agreement, there shall be no interruption of work at any time but\n   <em>\n    the matter shall be settled in accordance with the following provisions.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   CBA, \u00a7 28.1 (emphasis added). Article 28 continues by describing the grievance adjustment process, including, ultimately, arbitration. The CBA also states: \"The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties.\" CBA, \u00a7 28.3(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While employed by Cascade, Munger was represented by the Union. After the termination of his employment, Munger filed a grievance, challenging his discharge under Cascade's \"modified strict attendance policy.\" The Union grieved Munger's challenge through arbitration. The arbitrator held hearings on March 23, 2017, and April 20, 2017. Both Cascade and the Union were represented, and Munger participated as a witness for the Union. The parties agree that the issue presented in arbitration was whether Cascade had \"just cause to terminate Joe Munger, and if not, what is the appropriate remedy.\" Cascade and the Union each submitted a post-hearing brief to the arbitrator. On July 7, 2017,\n   the arbitrator issued a 15-page decision, concluding that Cascade had \"just cause\" to terminate Munger's employment and dismissing Munger's grievance. Eleven months later, Munger filed the pending lawsuit in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Cascade moves to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, asserting two arguments. First, Cascade states that Munger lacks standing because he does not contend that the Union breached its duty of fair representation or that there was anything improper about the arbitration process or decision. Second, Cascade states that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because there was a final and binding arbitration decision on the same facts that underlie Munger's claims in this lawsuit. Cascade adds that it is not currently asserting the defenses of claim preclusion (also known as \"\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   \") or issue preclusion (also known as \"collateral estoppel\") and is not moving for summary judgment to enforce the arbitrator's decision. Cascade also requests its attorney's fees under \"federal common law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The U.S. Constitution confers limited jurisdiction on the federal courts to hear only cases or controversies brought by persons who show standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v.

Thus, Munger has constitutional standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although Article III's injury requirement cannot be displaced by statute, when a statute creates a legal right, the invasion of that legal right may create standing.\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1546\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that Congress \"has the power to define injuries and articulate chains of causation that will give rise to a case or controversy where none existed before\");\n   <em>\n    Edwards v.

This sometimes is called \"statutory standing.\" Because the FMLA protects employees against discrimination or retaliation by their employers based on taking qualified family or medical leave, Munger has statutory standing under the FMLA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In support of its argument that Munger lacks standing, Defendant states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Absent proof that a union has breached its duty of fair representation, a plaintiff does not have standing to bring a subsequent suit in federal court where there was a previous binding arbitration decision made in the context of a collective bargaining agreement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andrus v.

The union members sought declaratory relief and an order vacating the arbitrator's award. The union members did not allege that they were not fairly represented by their union. The district court entered judgment for the defendant employers, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, stating: \"the employees cannot attack the final award, except on the grounds of fraud, deceit or breach of the duty of fair representation or unless the grievance procedure was a sham, substantially inadequate or substantially unavailable.\"\n   <em>\n    Andrus v.

After a merger of two railroads, the Interstate Commerce Commission required the resulting railroad to negotiate with a labor union representing the railroad's employees. When negotiations failed, the railroad and the union agreed to arbitration. The arbitrator issued his first decision in December 1981, resolving some issues, but returning others for further negotiation. A tentative resolution was accepted by many, but not all, of the affected union locals. The tentative resolution was presented to the arbitrator, who approved it in March 1982 as his final, binding award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Several employees then sued, asking the district court to vacate the arbitrator's 1982 award and confirm only the arbitrator's 1981 award. The district court granted summary judgment to the defendant railroad. The Seventh Circuit held that the \"plaintiffs do not have standing in this matter. Plaintiffs have cited no cases to us that allow persons not parties to the original proceeding to appeal the outcome of that proceeding. In analogous cases, courts have held that individual employees have no standing to challenge an arbitration proceeding to which the Union and the employer were the\n   <em>\n    sole\n   </em>\n   parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"18968\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/773/880/\">\n    773 F.2d at 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Munger simply is bringing his own claims against Cascade for federal and state statutory and common law violations. The Court can envision that at some point in this case, Cascade may assert affirmative defenses based on claim preclusion (\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   ) or issue preclusion (collateral estoppel) that the Court will need to consider, but Cascade has expressly declined to seek that consideration at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Cascade also argues that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. Typically, the two bases for subject matter jurisdiction are federal question jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and diversity jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendant, however, argues that the CBA somehow divests this Court of subject matter jurisdiction because \"Plaintiff and Defendant have previously entered into a valid agreement to litigate contract claims in another venue-in arbitration subject to the express terms and conditions of the CBA.\" Defendant's Motion to Dismiss at 6. Based on this argument, Cascade moves to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

This approach, however, is unsound. As noted, if a federal court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, such a defect can never be waived.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cotton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353467\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/625/#p630\">\n    535 U.S. at 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353467\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/625/#p630\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet, it is not uncommon, or at least not unthinkable, that parties to a mandatory arbitration agreement mutually decide to waive arbitration and pursue resolution of their dispute in federal court, assuming that either federal question or diversity jurisdiction otherwise exists. There is also a significant and consistent body of case law holding that if a party, whether a plaintiff or a defendant, continues in a lawsuit long enough and takes advantage of the procedural benefits of civil litigation, that party may be found to have waived its right to stay or dismiss the lawsuit in favor of arbitration, despite the existence of a valid and binding agreement to arbitrate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

If, however, the existence of an agreement to arbitrate divested a federal court of subject matter jurisdiction, these holdings would not be possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Consider also the case of two parties who have a binding agreement to arbitrate. If, despite their agreement to arbitrate, they participated in a lawsuit to its final conclusion at trial, the losing party might appeal and, on appeal, argue that the lower court's adverse judgment should be reversed and vacated based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arbaugh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5937941\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/500/#p506\">\n    546 U.S. at 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5937941\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/500/#p506\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that an objection that a particular court lacks subject matter jurisdiction may be raised by any party, or by the court on its own initiative, at any time). One response to this possibility would be to say that litigating a dispute in court notwithstanding an agreement to arbitrate is an implicit \"termination\" of the agreement. But if there mere existence of an agreement to arbitrate divests a federal court of subject\n   matter jurisdiction, then such an implicit termination of the agreement would appear to violate the rule that a court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Although the Ninth Circuit has not yet expressly ruled on whether a motion to dismiss based on a binding arbitration clause is subject to a motion brought under Rule 12(b)(1), other circuits and district courts have addressed this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Benkelman, NE v.

As the Eighth Circuit concluded based on\n   <em>\n    Atl. Marine\n   </em>\n   , \"to the extent an arbitration provision is like a forum-selection clause, the motion seeking to compel arbitration is not properly construed under Rule 12(b)(3).\"\n   <em>\n    City of Benkelman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275440\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/875/#p881\">\n    867 F.3d at 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Similarly, a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim does not appear to be a particularly viable solution. A plaintiff who brings a federal lawsuit, invoking either federal question or diversity jurisdiction, notwithstanding a binding agreement to arbitrate is unlikely to include, incorporate, or even refer to the arbitration clause. If the document containing an agreement to arbitrate is not otherwise incorporated into the complaint,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   then the defendant who seeks to rely on the arbitration agreement must present that agreement as a matter outside the pleadings. In that event, however, a motion to dismiss would be improper and, if the outside material is not stricken, \"the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   That leaves a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 as the best vehicle to enforce a valid and binding arbitration clause, and this is not a particularly harsh result. When a party files such a motion, the court can determine whether there are any genuine disputes of material fact sufficient to question the binding and enforceable nature of the agreement to arbitrate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of the court's authority under Rules 16, 26, and 56 to control the nature, extent, and timing of discovery and other motion practice in civil litigation, the court can effectively and efficiently resolve by summary judgment a dispute over whether to enforce a purportedly binding agreement to arbitrate. Until either the Ninth Circuit or the Supreme Court addresses this issue further, or until there is an amendment to the rules, this approach seems best, at least to this Court. As stated, however, Cascade has expressly declined to move for summary judgment at this time. Accordingly, Cascade's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant Cascade Steel Rolling Mills, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss (ECF 5) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The CBA submitted by Cascade became effective April 1, 2016, but appears to be a continuation of an earlier collective bargaining agreement between the Union and Cascade.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Moreover, whether a plaintiff has stated a basis for statutory standing is not jurisdictional and is tested under Rule 12(b)(6), rather than Rule 12(b)(1).\n    <em>\n     Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v.
