Bianco, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs Thomas A. Datre Sr. (\"Mr. Datre\"), Clara Datre (\"Mrs. Datre\" and, together with Mr. Datre, the \"Datres\"), and Daytree at Cortland Square, Inc. (\"Daytree\" and, collectively, \"plaintiffs\") bring this action against defendants Michael P. Walsh, Edward Walsh,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Michael Torres, Robert L. Cicale, and Anthony S. Senft, Jr.; councilmembers of the Town of Islip (the \"Town\") Steven J. Flotteron,\n   John C. Cochrane, Jr., and Trish Bergin Weichbrodt (\"councilmember defendants\") in their official capacities; and the Town (collectively, \"defendants\"). Plaintiffs bring their claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 1983 and 1988, alleging violations of their Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Plaintiffs bring claims for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as defamation (libel), stigma-plus, breach of contract, and Section 1983 conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In particular, plaintiffs allege that defendants conspired and carried out a plan to cause local authorities and the public to wrongly believe plaintiffs were responsible for dumping toxic materials in the Roberto Clemente Park (the \"Park\"), a public park in the Town. Plaintiffs allege that, as part of the conspiracy, defendant Michael Walsh used his position as Deputy Town Attorney to proclaim that the Town had completed an investigation and determined that plaintiff Daytree was responsible for the toxic dumping-a statement that defendants allegedly knew to be false. Specifically, plaintiffs assert that there was no investigation by the Town, nor was there a finding that Daytree was responsible. Additionally, plaintiffs claim that defendants shared this false information with the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office (\"DA's Office\") and the media, leading to widespread dissemination via social media. Plaintiffs allege that defendants' defamatory statements were motivated by a desire to deflect blame for the environmental scandal onto plaintiffs for defendants' own political gain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As a result of defendants' allegedly false statement that plaintiffs were responsible for the toxic dumping, plaintiffs claim that they have suffered extreme injuries, including Mr. Datre's removal from a paid position with the Town, the raid and seizure of plaintiffs' contracting business as a result of the DA's Office investigation, the filing of multiple civil lawsuits against plaintiffs by third parties, and plaintiffs' vilification in the community, which has prevented them from resuming business operations, among other harms. Plaintiffs allege loss of their personal and professional reputations in addition to business and monetary harms. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages for the alleged violations of their civil rights, as well as a declaratory judgment that they are not a responsible party for any alleged dumping in the Park.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Presently before the Court is defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants defendants' motion to dismiss the claim for declaratory relief, grants the motion to dismiss the claims against the individual councilmember defendants, and denies the motion to dismiss in all other respects. In particular, plaintiffs have alleged a plausible claim for defamation (libel) and, although defendants argue that the statements are subject to the litigation privilege because they were made in a notice letter to insurance carriers, the issue of privilege cannot be decided on a motion to dismiss in this case (especially in light of the allegations of bad faith and malice). Plaintiffs have also sufficiently alleged a plausible stigma-plus claim under Section 1983 in alleging that these false and defamatory statements were made,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , to terminate Daytree's tree-removal contract with the Town without any\n   process. The Section 1983 conspiracy and municipal liability claims also contain sufficient allegations to survive a motion to dismiss. Similarly, plaintiffs have stated a plausible breach of contract claim under New York state law in connection with the Town's alleged failure to pay plaintiffs under the tree-removal contract. However, the declaratory judgment and injunctive relief claims fail as a matter of law in this particular case, and the claims against the individual councilmember defendants must be dismissed as duplicative of the municipal liability claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A. Factual Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   1. The Allegations of Toxic Dumping\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court takes the following facts from plaintiffs' complaint and the exhibits attached thereto.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Starting in or around August 2013, the Town's Parks Department supervised the creation of soccer fields inside the Park, which involved contractors delivering fill materials to the Park. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 102-03.) Defendant Senft, who served as the Town Board's liaison to the Parks Department (the \"Parks Liaison\") at the time, was among those individuals at the Parks Department supervising this project (the \"Park project\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103.) According to the complaint, in September 2013, one or more persons complained that materials were being transported into the Park without permits, and/or that \"objectionable\" materials had been dumped there. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110.) In particular, it is alleged that \"tons\" of \"toxic materials\" were illegally dumped at the Park.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) As discussed further\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs allege that defendants wrongly blamed them for the dumping, and deny \"hav[ing] ever 'dumped' so much as one grain of dirt ... or anything else, whatsoever, in the park,\" or having \"transported anything to the park ... period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   2. The Political Backdrop\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to the complaint, defendants accused plaintiffs of the alleged toxic\n   dumping as part of a politically motivated conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 232-72.) Plaintiffs explain that defendants, who were all members of the Conservative Party or held a position in the Town government, \"scapegoated\" them for two reasons: (1) to deflect blame for the incident away from fellow Conservative Party members, and (2) to \"destroy plaintiffs' reputation and thereby eviscerate the plaintiffs' well-established ability to raise campaign funds for political candidates who were not [members of the Conservative Party].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 240, 255, 258.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Datre has served as the chairman of a local and national Political Action Committee (\"PAC\"), through which he has raised \"hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign moneys\" for both Republican and Democratic candidates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) According to the complaint, \"much to the chagrin\" of defendants, Mr. Datre has not raised funds for the Conservative Party or its candidates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) At the time of the events at issue, defendants allegedly felt that Mr. Datre's fundraising activities had hurt the Suffolk County Conservative Party by limiting its leader's ability to influence the outcomes of elections. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Many of plaintiffs' allegations involve that leader, Eddie Walsh, who served as the Suffolk County Conservative Party's Chairman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 233.) Although Eddie Walsh was dismissed as a defendant from this case, the complaint alleges that the other defendants were his \"political operatives\" and participated in the alleged conspiracy in furtherance of his political objectives. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-8, 10, 15-22.) The remaining defendants in this case all held positions in the Conservative Party; some also held positions in the Town municipal government. These defendants include: Michael Walsh, member of the Conservative Chairman's Club (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 236), member of the Town of Islip Conservative Executive Committee (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and Deputy Town Attorney (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70); Michael Torres, Town of Islip Conservative Party Chairman, serving directly under Eddie Walsh (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 234); Robert Cicale, Town Attorney (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25); and Anthony Senft, Jr., Committeeman of the Town of Islip Conservative Party, serving directly under Eddie Walsh, and Parks Liaison (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74, 235). Plaintiffs also sued councilmembers Steven Flotteron, John Cochrane, Jr., and Trish Weichbrodt, but in their official capacities only. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78-82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Eddie Walsh had secured paid positions in the Town government for his political operatives, several of whom were responsible for overseeing the Park at the time of the alleged dumping. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Two of Eddie Walsh's alleged operatives who are not defendants in this case served as the Parks Commissioner (the \"Commissioner\") and Secretary to the Parks Commissioner (the \"Secretary\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) According to the complaint, sometime prior to January 21, 2014, the Commissioner, Secretary, and defendant Senft (Parks Liaison) learned of the allegations that there had been unlawful dumping of potentially toxic materials \"while the park was under their collective supervision.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) They allegedly consulted with Eddie Walsh and defendant Torres, \"their Islip Conservative Party Superiors ... who had secured ... their positions within the Town.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Plaintiffs claim that, at this point, Eddie Walsh and defendants Torres, Senft, and Michael Walsh became concerned that the three Parks Department officials could be held responsible for the dumping, and thus \"fabricated and proceeded to carry out a plan\" to \"deflect blame\" away from them and onto plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 113.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   3. The Datres' Relationship with the Town and Individual Defendants\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the time of these events, plaintiffs Mr. and Mrs. Datre were the principals of\n   plaintiff Daytree, a corporation \"engaged in the business of building residential homes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 83, 85.) According to the complaint, Daytree \"is not, and has never been, engaged in the business of material transport, or material disposal, except to the extent it removed trees, branches and greenery under a tree-removal contract it secured with the Town of Islip in 2012.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, as of January 2014, defendants \"were affirmatively aware\" that the Datres were the principals of Daytree (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104), and had contracted to perform tree removal services for the Town (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112), and that the Datres' son, Thomas Datre, Jr. (\"Datre Jr.\"), owned a materials transport company that was \"completely separate and independent from the company owned by his parents\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 105-06). Plaintiffs allege defendants were aware that Datre Jr.'s transport company was involved in the Park project, and had transported materials into the Park. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107.) Plaintiffs allege defendants were also aware that, unlike their son's company,\n   <em>\n    they\n   </em>\n   had not transported materials into the Park. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After receiving complaints about dumping in September 2013, the Commissioner and defendant Torres met with Datre Jr. to discuss these complaints. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 110-11.) Plaintiffs assert that the Commissioner and Torres arranged this meeting because defendants knew of Datre Jr. and his company's involvement in the Park project and in transporting materials into the Park.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 109-11.) Plaintiffs allege that, even though defendants were aware that Daytree was separate from Datre Jr.'s company, and had no involvement in bringing materials into the Park (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111), defendants devised a plan to \"falsely project blame\" onto plaintiffs (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, in furtherance of this plan, Torres and another member of the Conservative Party appeared at Daytree's office and falsely accused plaintiffs of illegally dumping construction and/or other materials in the Park. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119.) The Datres informed them that neither they nor their company had dumped \"anything, whatsoever\" in the Park. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112.) Plaintiffs allege that, despite this conversation, Eddie Walsh and defendants Torres, Senft, and Cicale \"then conspired to ... have defendant Michael P. Walsh use his position as Deputy Town Attorney\" to shift blame for the dumping to plaintiffs and falsely state that the Town had \"completed\" an investigation, through which it determined that plaintiffs were responsible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   According to the complaint, defendant Walsh\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   knew that the Town had not completed any such investigation, and had not determined that plaintiffs were responsible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122.) Plaintiffs allege that, in response to a subpoena from the DA's Office, on April 21, 2014, defendant Walsh allegedly sent \"a flurry of emails throughout the Town,\" directing Town employees and representatives to begin collecting records reflecting who was involved in the dumping. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 130-31.) According to the complaint, the DA's Office investigation revealed that, from April 21, 2014 through the present, \"not a single employee of the Town sent\n   <em>\n    anything\n   </em>\n   to Michael Walsh which ... indicated that [Daytree] was in any way, shape or form, involved in the alleged dumping.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 132-33.) Plaintiffs further assert that the Town \"is not in\n   possession of a single document or record of any type\" that suggests plaintiffs' involvement, \"with one exception.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 134.) That exception is a copy of handwritten notes from a Town government group meeting, which defendant Walsh attached to an email to the DA's Office Economic Crime Bureau Chief on April 23, 2014, and which includes the question \"Where does Datre fall into this project?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 135; ECF No. 1-3 at 30, 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   4. The Alleged Defamatory Statements\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that on April 24, 2014, defendant Walsh made the aforementioned defamatory statements about plaintiffs, which he knew to be false, and subsequently published these statements to third parties, including the press and the DA's Office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 123, 126, 130.) As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the alleged false statements were that the Town had completed an investigation through which it had determined that Daytree was a \"responsible party\" for the toxic dumping. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 124.) First, defendant Walsh sent five letters to insurance companies on April 24, 2014, each stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Please be advised that our office received notice of dumping of construction material on town property located at [Roberto Clemente Park].... Enclosed please find photos and field reports completed by town law enforcement person[nel] of the debris at the subject location. This letter shall serve to place your company on notice of the above listed loss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   We have completed our investigation and found that Daytree at Cortland Square is a responsible party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (ECF No. 1-1 at 11-15.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs allege that defendant Cicale, the Town Attorney, \"had apparently consented\" to defendant Walsh's publication of these statements. (Compl. \u00b6 25.) According to the complaint, Cicale later told a News 12 reporter that \"the letters and their content were: 'actually just a precautionary measure being taken to reserve the Town's right to take action later.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He allegedly further stated to this reporter that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   In this case, it's not that we made a final determination. We have insurance policies on file with the town of Islip for work done by this company, that may have also been done in the park, and if that's enough of a connection or a nexus for us, we're going to protect our interests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) Plaintiffs assert that Cicale was referencing the work they did under their tree-removal contract, \"which was limited to the plaintiffs removing trees, tree trunks and branches at the request of the Town.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   According to the complaint, defendants also informed the media and DA's Office that they had completed an investigation and found Daytree to be responsible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) As a result, Newsday published the following articles: \"Islip Town formally blames dumping on Daytree [at] Cortland Square,\" dated May 25, 2014, and \"ISLIP PLACES BLAME: Tells insurers Daytree at Cortland Square at fault,\" dated May 26, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33; ECF No 1-1 at 17-20, 22-24.) According to the first Newsday article, \"Walsh's letters to the insurance companies represent the first formal notification by Islip as to who town officials believe is responsible for the dumping.\" (ECF No 1-1 at 17.) Additionally, the story was published on television and the radio (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 34 (citing ECF No 1-1 at 51-52 (News 12 article, \"Town of Islip blames [Daytree] in dumping scandal\"), 54 (LI News Radio article discussing Daytree, \"Islip blames contractor for toxic dumping\") ) ), and was disseminated via social\n   media (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 35 (citing ECF No 1-1 at 56, 58 (Facebook and Twitter messages sharing and responding to this story) ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   5. The Alleged Harm to Plaintiffs\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   According to the complaint, Facebook users' responses to news stories about the toxic dumping, featuring Daytree, show the public outrage that led plaintiffs to feel defendants \"vilified\" them. For instance, one Facebook user wrote, \"Du[m]ping toxic waste in [a] playground where children play? ... Brentwood is a vulnerable, disadvantaged, segregated community. The racist implicati[o]ns are obvious. Real pigs.\" (ECF No 1-1 at 56.) Another portion of this message seems to incite violence against those responsible for the dumping. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that defendants further stigmatized them by terminating their two-year tree-removal contract with the Town shortly after sending the aforementioned letters to the insurance companies. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36-37; ECF No. 1-2 at 2 (defendant Walsh's letter to Mrs. Datre terminating the contract).) Plaintiffs assert that this termination was \"without cause, and without any form of hearing prior to such termination.\" (Compl. \u00b6 37.) Plaintiffs allege that Eddie Walsh and defendants Senft, Cicale, and Michael Walsh \"caused\" the Town to terminate this contract and \"contemporaneously publish to the press that the Town was 'severing all ties' with the plaintiffs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 139.) The same defendants allegedly also caused the Town to terminate Mr. Datre from a paid position as the Town's Plumbers Examining Board Chairman, without cause or hearing, and again shared this information with the press. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.) In both instances, plaintiffs allege that Eddie Walsh and these three defendants \"exercised their influence and control over the Town and defendants Flotteron, Cochrane Jr. and Bergin-Weichbrodt\" to bring about these contract terminations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 139-40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, defendants allegedly accused plaintiffs of having committed \"heinous criminal activity\n   <em>\n    (i.e., illegal dumping of toxic materials in a children's public park)\n   </em>\n   ,\" as a result of which the DA's Office raided, seized, and \"abruptly shut[ ] down\" plaintiffs' business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-45.) Plaintiffs claim that the DA's Office seized all of their personal property and, to date, has not returned any of it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   According to the complaint, defendants' actions that publicly vilified plaintiffs were \"equally fatal to the plaintiffs' business\" as those of the DA's Office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) Plaintiffs discuss the thousands of images of Mr. Datre \"mailed directly to residents\" in Suffolk County, thereby associating his picture with \"the company that dumped 32,000 tons of toxic waste in our local parks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48; ECF No. 1-2 at 10-11.) Plaintiffs claim that they cannot resume their normal business operations because they \"are now shunned by the community, to the extent that no one with whom they formerly conducted business will speak to them.\" (Compl. \u00b6 47.) As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs claim that they have suffered a \"loss of both their personal and professional reputations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) They claim that they have suffered financial loss due to loss of their business, and became defendants in multiple civil lawsuits as a result of defendants' defamatory statements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50, 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   B. Procedural Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs commenced this action on April 22, 2015.

In other words, the claims hinge on the Town's conduct and knowledge, and the falsity of those statements by the Town could potentially be resolved without a determination as to the parties responsible for any alleged dumping. Therefore, plaintiffs seek declaratory relief regarding past conduct that is not an essential element of the claims brought here, and essentially seek an advisory opinion with respect to the subject matter of other pending lawsuits.

Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiffs bring their defamation claim based on allegations that defendants made multiple statements that the Town had completed an investigation and determined they were \"a responsible party\" for the illegal dumping in the Park. Plaintiffs allege that these statements include the letters to the insurance companies, as well as the subsequent statements to Newsday and the DA's Office. They argue that these statements \"not only accuse the plaintiffs of committing serious criminal activity, but also tended to severely injure the plaintiffs in their trade, business and occupation\" (Compl. \u00b6 175), and were \"defamatory and libelous\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 173). Plaintiffs discuss the reverberating effects of these statements in addition to the harms to their reputations, business, and livelihood, including \"[g]awkers\" visiting plaintiffs' offices \"to sneer at the plaintiffs,\" hate messages on the company's answering machine, and the shunning and harassment plaintiffs' grandchildren endured at school, among others. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 176-82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As a premise for their motion to dismiss this claim, defendants argue that plaintiffs challenge a single defamatory statement: the statement in defendant Walsh's letters to the insurance companies. Defendants request that the Court dismiss this claim on the grounds that (1) the statement at issue failed to meet the pleading requirements, in particular, because the statement was not of \"fact,\" \"defamatory,\" or directed at the Datres, and (2) regardless, the statement qualified as privileged. (Defs. Mem. at 9-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Before turning to the pleading requirements, the Court rejects defendants' premise that plaintiffs' claim challenges a single statement (even if repeated in multiple letters to insurers). At this stage, plaintiffs have adequately alleged that the defamatory statements included multiple statements, including those to the media and the DA's Office, in addition to the initial statements to the insurers. The news articles, other publications, and public social media response that plaintiffs supplied in their exhibits provide support for plaintiffs' plausible claim that defendants' statements went beyond defendant Walsh's initial communications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court has considered defendants' remaining arguments regarding the alleged defamatory statements and, for the reasons discussed below, denies their motion to dismiss this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   i. Statement of Fact\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   First, the Court considers defendants' argument that the statement in the letters to the insurers does not qualify as a \"false and defamatory statement of\n   <em>\n    fact\n   </em>\n   \" because it \"takes a legal position more akin to an opinion.\" (Defs. Mem. at 10.) The Court disagrees. Defendant Walsh's statement that the Town completed an investigation and found plaintiffs to be responsible satisfies each of the requirements in the New York standard for distinguishing fact from opinion: the statement has a \"precise meaning,\" it is capable of being proven true or false, and the context of the insurance letter indicates that this was a factual statement.\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780108\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/10/271/#p276\">\n    10 N.Y.3d at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780108\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/10/271/#p276\">\n    856 N.Y.S.2d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780108\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/10/271/#p276\">\n    885 N.E.2d 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, statements pertaining to whether there was an investigation by the Town or not, and\n   whether there was a finding as to responsibility by the Town or not, are both clearly factual in nature, rather than opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Although defendants point out that the Court must look at the context, an analysis of that context does not change the factual nature of the statements. As an example, context impacted this analysis in\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   , where the court determined that the at-issue statement was one of opinion based in part on the tone, and the fact that the statement appeared in the \"opinion page\" of a newspaper along with a note that the article expressed the author's opinion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780108\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/10/271/#p276\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780108\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/10/271/#p276\">\n    at 276-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780108\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/10/271/#p276\">\n    856 N.Y.S.2d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3780108\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/10/271/#p276\">\n    885 N.E.2d 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, by contrast, the alleged context does not transform the statements from fact to opinion. According to the complaint, defendant Walsh stated without qualification, \"[w]e have completed our investigation and found that Daytree at Cortland Square is a responsible party.\" (ECF No. 1-1 at 11.) No other statement in defendant Walsh's letters suggested that whether there was an investigation and a finding was opinion, rather than fact. Further, defendant Walsh wrote this statement to insurance companies in a \"notice\" that defendants claim was a precursor to potential litigation-a context that the Court views as indicative of a letter containing factual statements. Even considering the statement to the insurers alone (and not to the DA's Office and the media), the Court disagrees with defendants that the notice falls in the \"zone of protected opinion\" because \"[i]t is universally understood that such notifications of claims are going to be independently evaluated and investigated by the insurer.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Defs. Reply at 9.) Defendants' reasoning would permit speakers in many settings to distance themselves from factual statements by retroactively invoking an audience's duty to fact-check. For all of these reasons, the complaint plausibly alleges actionable statements of fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   ii. Defamatory Statement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   With regard to the defamatory nature of defendants' statements, the Court concludes that even what defendants assert is plaintiffs' single alleged statement-namely, that, after an investigation, plaintiffs were found to be responsible for toxic dumping in a public children's park-easily satisfies this pleading requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, the Court concludes that plaintiffs have plausibly alleged statements that \"tend[ed] to expose [plaintiffs] to hatred,\n   contempt or aversion, or to induce an evil or unsavory opinion of [them] in the minds of a substantial number of the community,\" and reflected on the conduct of their business.\n   <em>\n    Golub\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"320248,320313\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/89/1074/\">\n    89 N.Y.2d at 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"320248\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/89/1074/320248/\">\n    659 N.Y.S.2d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"320248\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/89/1074/320248/\">\n    681 N.E.2d 1282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As set forth below, the Court also declines to dismiss the claim at this stage because the Court cannot determine, based on the complaint, that these defamatory statements are protected by the litigation privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   First, plaintiffs allege that the statements in the letters to the insurance carriers were not \"pre-litigation\" in any respect.

However, the fact that notice letters are generally part of insurance protocols and potential litigation does not necessarily mean that such a letter (and the statements at issue here) was part of the pre-litigation process in this particular case. Given the allegations here and the ambiguity regarding the timing and scope of the letter, the Court believes that this issue is more appropriately addressed once discovery is complete.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bel Canto Design, Ltd. v.

Torres served as the Town Conservative Party Chairman, but did not hold a position within the Town government. Given that Torres was not a government actor, he cannot claim qualified immunity for his allegedly defamatory statements or his alleged participation in the conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   With respect to the other three individual defendants, they argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity in light of their objectively reasonable beliefs that their actions did not violate a constitutional right. Their primary defense is that the Town sent the letters to the insurers to protect the Town's interests, \"in the objectively-reasonable exercise of governmental functions and duties.\" (Defs. Mem. at 22-23.) Defendants argue that it was objectively reasonable to identify Daytree as responsible \"based on [the] Town's law enforcement photos and reports as the letters indicate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The Court concludes that the qualified immunity issue cannot be decided at the motion to dismiss stage given the allegations in the complaint. As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs allege that the individual defendants participated in disseminating knowingly false and defamatory statements, in bad faith, for the specific purpose of destroying their business and reputation, including by terminating their tree-removal contract with the Town. Moreover, the complaint alleges that, as part of this malicious plan, defendants falsely stated that an investigation had been conducted, and a finding of responsibility reached, even though they knew that neither of those things had taken place. In other words, according to the complaint, defendants wrote these false and defamatory letters\n   and wrongfully terminated plaintiffs' contract in order to shift blame for the toxic dumping, with the intention of depriving plaintiffs-their political adversaries-of their liberty and property interests. If plaintiffs can prove all of these facts, no reasonable defendant would have understood his or her conduct to be lawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In sum, if the allegations in the complaint are true, there would be no basis for concluding that defendants held an objectively reasonable belief that their actions would not violate plaintiffs' constitutional rights. The Court, therefore, denies the remaining individual defendants' motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity. However, this issue may be raised again at the summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   IV.
