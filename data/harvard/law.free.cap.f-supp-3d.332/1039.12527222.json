C. FELDMAN, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court are two Rule 12 motions: (1) Denka Performance Elastomer LLC's motion to dismiss; and (2) E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company's motion to dismiss. For the reasons that follow, DuPont's motion is GRANTED, and Denka's motion is GRANTED without prejudice to the plaintiffs' opportunity to amend their deficient nuisance allegations in their complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This environmental tort litigation arises from the production of neoprene, which allegedly exposes those living in the vicinity of the manufacturing plant to concentrated levels of chloroprene well above the upper limit of acceptable risk, resulting in a risk of cancer more than 800 times the national average. Thirteen people living in what environmentalists and the media have dubbed \"Cancer Alley\" filed this lawsuit seeking injunctive relief in the form of abatement of chloroprene releases from their industrial neighbor, the Pontchartrain Works facility, the only facility in the United States still manufacturing a synthetic rubber called neoprene, which is made from chloroprene, which the Environmental Protection Agency has classified as a \"likely human carcinogen.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   These facts are drawn from the allegations advanced in the second amended complaint. E.I. Dupont de Nemours &amp; Co. invented neoprene in 1931. Neoprene is a synthetic rubber used in chemical and weather resistant products such as wet suits and orthopedic braces. It is also used as a base resin in adhesives, electrical insulation, and coatings. In 1969, DuPont built a neoprene manufacturing unit at its Pontchartrain Works facility in LaPlace, Louisiana. Chloroprene, a component of neoprene, is manufactured at the site. During the manufacturing process, chloroprene is emitted into the air and discharged into the water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   By 2008, DuPont had consolidated its neoprene production to its Pontchartrain Works facility (PWF), which is now the only facility manufacturing neoprene in the United States. Effective November 1,\n   2015, DuPont sold the PWF to Denka Performance Elastomer LLC (DPE or Denka), but DuPont retained ownership of the land underlying the facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   It is alleged that as early as 1988 DuPont knew \"of the deleterious effects of exposure to chloroprene emissions,\" and that DPE had the same knowledge of such harms when it bought the Pontchartrain Works facility. It is alleged that both DuPont and DPE concealed from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) their knowledge regarding chloroprene's harmful effects. In 2010, the EPA classified chloroprene as a \"likely human carcinogen.\" In its Integrated Risk Information System assessment of chloroprene, the EPA explained that chloroprene was \"likely to be carcinogenic to humans' [sic] through a mutagenic mode of action and that the primary exposure route of concern is the inhalation pathway.\" Additionally, the EPA has noted that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [s]ymptoms reported from acute human exposure to high concentrations of chloroprene include giddiness, headache, irritability, dizziness, insomnia, fatigue, respiratory irritation, cardiac palpitations, chest pains, nausea, gastrointestinal disorders, dermatitis, temporary hair loss, conjunctivitis, and corneal necrosis.... Acute exposure may [also]: damage the liver, kidneys, and lungs; affect the circulatory system and immune system; depress the central nervous system (CNS); irritate the skin and mucous membranes; and cause ... respiratory difficulties in humans.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In December 2015, the EPA again classified chloroprene as a likely human carcinogen when it released a screening-level National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA), which analyzes exposure levels to toxins, estimates the expected number of incidences of cancer per one million people based on exposure to air toxins from industry, and also announces an upper limit of \"acceptable risk\" threshold.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The NATA acceptable risk exposure threshold for chloroprene was established as 0.2 \u00b5g/m\n   <sup>\n    3\n   </sup>\n   ; that is, chloroprene emissions must stay below .2 micrograms per cubic meter\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   in order to comply with the limit of acceptable risk threshold (which is a risk of 100 in one million people).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Despite knowledge of this upper limit of the acceptable risk threshold for exposure to chloroprene concentrations, it is alleged that DPE continues to emit chloroprene at hundreds of times the 0.2 \u00b5g/m\n   <sup>\n    3\n   </sup>\n   threshold. It is alleged that, historically, the Pontchartrain Works facility emitted chloroprene air emissions well in excess of the 0.2 \u00b5g/m\n   <sup>\n    3\n   </sup>\n   threshold. Since May 25, 2016, the EPA has collected 24-hour air samples every three days from six locations around the Pontchartrain Works facility; air samples at all six locations are frequently up to 700 times the 0.2 \u00b5g/m\n   <sup>\n    3\n   </sup>\n   threshold, or more.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   DPE's own sampling numbers at five locations surrounding the facility indicate that average chloroprene emissions range from 20.4 to 33.25 times the 0.2 \u00b5g/m\n   <sup>\n    3\n   </sup>\n   threshold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The EPA's National Enforcement Investigation Center (NEIC) conducted a Clean Air Act (CAA) inspection of the Pontchartrain Works facility in June 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   A copy\n   of the redacted inspection report from the EPA's CAA inspection was publicized on April 3, 2017. The NEIC inspection report revealed various areas of non-compliance by both DuPont and DPE in their operation of the facility, including failure to adhere to monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for the chloroprene vent condenser; failure to replace leaking valves; failure to include appropriate emissions factors in air permit application materials; and failure to institute appropriate emissions controls for the chloroprene Group I storage tank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 6, 2017, DPE entered into an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) with LDEQ with a target to reduce its chloroprene emissions by 85 percent. Even if this reduction is achieved, the plaintiffs allege that DPE's emission levels will nevertheless exceed the 0.2 \u00b5g/m\n   <sup>\n    3\n   </sup>\n   threshold. In any event, it is alleged that DPE has failed to meet all interim requirements for emission controls and emissions concentrations that it agreed to in the AOC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to the EPA, \"[t]he top 6 census tracts with the highest NATA-estimated cancer risks nationally are in Louisiana due to Denka (formerly DuPont) chloroprene emissions.\" The NATA assessment reports that the cancer risk for the census tracts in the vicinity of the Pontchartrain Works facility is 3.365 per million, while the cancer risk from chloroprene exposure in those census tracts ranges from 158.515 to 768.46 per million, all well above the acceptable risk level recommended by the EPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Instead of reducing chloroprene emissions in compliance with the EPA's 0.2 \u00b5g/m\n   <sup>\n    3\n   </sup>\n   threshold, on June 26, 2017, DPE representatives submitted a Request for Correction to the EPA in which they sought to increase the 0.2 \u00b5g/m\n   <sup>\n    3\n   </sup>\n   threshold in order \"to prevent further significant damage to\" their business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is alleged the DPE representatives have lobbied members of the U.S. Congress to undermine the EPA and support reduction or removal of emissions restrictions at the facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Robert Taylor, Jr., individually and on behalf of his minor daughter, N.T., Kershell Bailey, Shondrell P. Campbell, Gloria Dumas, Janell Emery, George Handy, Annette Houston, Rogers Jackson, Michael Perkins, Allen Schnyder, Jr., Larry Sorapuru, Sr., Kellie Tabb, and Robert Taylor, III are all individuals living near PWF in Reserve, Edgard, and LaPlace, Louisiana. On June 29, 2017, these individuals, individually and as representatives of a putative class of similarly situated plaintiffs, sued Denka Performance Elastomer LLC and E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Company in the Louisiana 40th Judicial District Court in St. John the Baptist Parish. The plaintiffs allege that DuPont has emitted chloroprene for many years at levels resulting in concentrations many times the upper limit of acceptable risk, and DPE continues to do so. The plaintiffs advance Louisiana state law causes of action for nuisance, trespass, negligence, and strict liability; they seek injunctive relief in the form of abatement of chloroprene releases such that the concentration of chloroprene does not exceed the 0.2 \u00b5g/m\n   <sup>\n    3\n   </sup>\n   threshold;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   damages for deprivation of enjoyment of occupancy of property; punitive damages; and additional damages including medical monitoring to the extent personal injury claims become mature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The defendants jointly removed the lawsuit, invoking this Court's diversity jurisdiction. The Court denied the plaintiffs' motion to remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs filed an untimely request to extend the deadline to seek class certification, which the defendants opposed. The Court denied the plaintiffs' request to extend the deadline to seek class certification, and later denied the plaintiffs' motion to reconsider its ruling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order and Reasons dtd. 2/22/18 (denying plaintiffs' motion to reconsider, denying the plaintiffs' untimely motion for class certification, and granting DuPont's motion to dismiss class allegations).

The plaintiffs concede that their claims arise from continuing active releases; in this lawsuit they do not seek to recover money damages for personal injuries contributed to by past chloroprene emissions. It is alleged that the source of the chloroprene emissions that the plaintiffs seek to enjoin is the neoprene production facility at the Pontchartrain Works; DuPont sold the facility and neoprene business to Denka on November 1, 2015; Denka has owned and operated the facility since then; it is Denka and its neoprene business that is subject to comprehensive regulations and permit requirements related to the neoprene production operations that the plaintiffs seek to enjoin; Denka is working with the LDEQ to reduce emissions; Denka has entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with state regulators. The plaintiffs\n   offer no basis for this Court to plausibly infer that any injunctive relief that could be granted enjoining DuPont would have the effect of abating chloroprene emissions from a facility it no longer owns nor operates. Because the injunctive relief the plaintiffs seek from DuPont would not abate emissions, it would not redress their injury.

The plaintiffs concede that whether or not the plaintiffs will develop compensable personal injury or property based damages claims in the future is, at this point, hypothetical. Accordingly, insofar as the plaintiffs attempted to state a claim for or hold a place for personal injury or property based damage claims, any such claims must be dismissed without prejudice. Simply put, the plaintiffs' mere wish to reserve their right to assert certain damage-based claims, combined with the absence of any alleged factual predicate supporting personal injury or property damage caused by exposure to chloroprene emitted from the PWF renders any such claims not yet ripe for adjudication. All \"immature tort\" claims are dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Denka moves to dismiss for failure to state a claim the plaintiffs' causes of action for nuisance, trespass, negligence, \"strict liability,\" as well as the plaintiffs' demand for punitive damages. As a threshold matter, the Court observes that two factors hinder this Court's review of the plausibility of these causes of action. First, this case was originally styled as a putative class action, and no amended complaint was filed after the class allegations were dismissed. Therefore, absent from the complaint are any specific factual allegations concerning each plaintiffs' exposure or linking plaintiffs to any (unstated) manifestations of emissions. This impairs the Court's assessment of both a determination as to whether each of these plaintiffs has standing to pursue a claim against Denka, and also unnecessarily complicates a determination as to whether each plaintiff has stated a plausible claim for relief. Second, that the plaintiffs concede that their \"immature tort\" claims based on personal injury or property damage are not yet ripe necessarily informs the Court's determination as to whether they have stated a plausible claim for trespass, negligence, and strict liability (given that causation and damages are elements of these causes of action).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The plaintiffs offer a detailed \"background facts\" section providing an overview of the PWF and the EPA's designation of chloroprene as a likely human carcinogen. Although the \"background facts\" section of the second amended complaint also lists various symptoms that the EPA says is caused by acute chloroprene exposure, not one of the plaintiffs alleges that he or she has experienced any of these symptoms. Nor do any of the plaintiffs allege in any concrete way how chloroprene exposure manifests any physical injury, disease, or nuisance; they simply conclude that the emissions interfere with the enjoyment of their property. It is this lack of factual predicate that dooms the plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Paragraph 50 of the second amended complaint states that the plaintiffs \"have suffered trespass and nuisance due to the regular and repeated exposure to concentrations of chloroprene emissions in excess of levels the Defendants know are unsafe-as demonstrated by the peer-reviewed scientific analysis relied on in EPA's issuance of the 0.2 \u00b5g/m\n   <sup>\n    3\n   </sup>\n   threshold and as a result have sustained damages pursuant to La. C.C. art. 667.\" The remaining defendant, Denka, challenges the sufficiency of the plaintiffs' allegations as to each cause of action asserted on the ground that the plaintiffs fail to allege a factual predicate for any actual harm or damages, or what precisely is the predicate for the alleged nuisance. The Court agrees. However, because leave to amend should be granted when justice requires, the Court will allow the plaintiffs fourteen days to amend their complaint to cure their defective nuisance allegations and to add factual allegations to support the now conclusory allegations (as well as to remove the class allegations, which were previously dismissed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court turns briefly to address the distinct causes of action the plaintiffs purport to allege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   1. Nuisance, La. C.C. arts. 667 - 669\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The plaintiffs first allege that the chloroprene emissions violate the defendants' obligations of vicinage, found in Louisiana Civil Code articles 667 - 669. The Louisiana Supreme Court has observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   These obligations of vicinage are legal servitudes imposed on the owner of property. These provisions embody a balancing of rights and obligations associated\n   with the ownership of immovables. As a general rule, the landowner is free to exercise his rights of ownership in any manner he sees fit. He may even use his property which \"... occasion some inconvenience to his neighbor.\" However, his extensive rights do not allow him to do \"real damage\" to his neighbor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    Rodrigue v.

However, if the work he makes on his estate deprives his neighbor of enjoyment or causes damage to him, he is answerable for damages only upon a showing that he knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that his works would cause damage, that the damage could have been prevented by the exercise of reasonable care, and that he failed to exercise such reasonable care....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Louisiana Civil Code article 668, Inconvenience to neighbor, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Although one be not at liberty to make any work by which his neighbor's buildings may be damaged, yet every one has the liberty of doing on his own ground whatsoever he pleases, although it should occasion some inconvenience to his neighbor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Thus he who is not subject to any servitude originating from a particular agreement in that respect, may raise his house as high as he pleases, although by such elevation he should darken the lights of his neighbor's house, because this act occasions only an inconvenience, but not a real damage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Louisiana Civil Code article 669, Regulation of inconvenience, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   If the works or materials for any manufactory or other operation, cause an inconvenience to those in the same or in the neighboring houses, by diffusing smoke or nauseous smell, and there be no servitude established by which they are regulated, their sufferance must be determined by the rules of the police, or the customs of the place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Brushing broadly, the plaintiffs allege that the chloroprene emissions are a nuisance within the meaning of Louisiana Civil Code articles 667 - 669. They allege that the emissions from Denka's plant have deprived them of enjoyment of their property, and at paragraph 56, state that \"chloroprene emissions ... are sufficient to cause physical discomfort and annoyance to Plaintiffs, who must confine themselves indoors to escape the excess concentrations of chloroprene emissions, and those emissions cause a nuisance.\" Absent from these allegations, however, is any factual content. What precisely is the source of the physical discomfort and annoyance? A noxious smell? Throat irritation? How does this nuisance physically manifest, if at all? The plaintiffs simply omit any facts that might indicate the nature or degree of intrusion, or its relative persistence or duration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The plaintiffs do not suggest what about the emissions makes them remain indoors or how they are aware of the emissions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   They merely recite and intone generic and formulaic conclusions.

Trespass\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that the defendants' operation of the PWF caused excess levels of chloroprene to encroach upon the property where they \"live or are otherwise occupants,\" and that the \"actual physical invasion ... is continuing.\" The excess levels of chloroprene is allegedly \"unauthorized ... and continue[s] to cause damages to the plaintiffs.\" Notably, the plaintiffs disclaim any property damage at this time and seek only prospective relief. Denka urges the Court to dismiss this cause of action because the plaintiffs fail to allege specific facts supporting how transient air emissions have physically invaded the plaintiffs' properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Louisiana Civil Code recognizes the tort of trespass under article 2315.\n   <em>\n    Richard v.

La. 2017) (citation omitted)(Milazzo, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that the operation of the PWF including all units that emit chloroprene exceeding the 0.2 \u00b5g/m\n   <sup>\n    3\n   </sup>\n   threshold \"is the cause-in-fact for Plaintiffs' damages;\" that the defects in operation of the PWF caused the plaintiffs to be exposed to an unreasonable risk of harm; and the defendants knew of the unreasonable risks; and the defendants should be enjoined from any emissions of chloroprene that will result in further exposure to excess chloroprene emissions. This focus on the\n   <em>\n    operation\n   </em>\n   of the PWF undermines any attempt to claim that a \"ruin, vice, or defect\" caused the plaintiffs harm. The plaintiffs counter that their allegations must be read in the context of the EPA materials including an inspection report that revealed \"ruin\" and \"vice\" in the equipment itself, in the form of leaking valves and open-ended lines and the lack of appropriate emission controls on various components of the chloroprene facility. Even if the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged facts indicating a flaw or condition of relative permanence inherent in the PWF equipment, the plaintiffs' strict or custodial liability claim fails the plausibility test for the same reason as their negligence claim: in this lawsuit, they disclaim that they can prove that chloroprene emissions have caused personal injury damages. The plaintiffs' attempt to proceed under a strict liability theory of recovery therefore appears to be another immature tort claim that is not yet ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   5. Punitive Damages\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The plaintiffs seek \"[p]unitive damages to the extent permitted under any applicable law.\" Denka contends that recovery of punitive damages is limited and the plaintiffs fail to identify any provision of Louisiana law authorizing recovery of punitive damages. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Louisiana law permits recovery of punitive damages only in limited circumstances when expressly authorized by law; even when authorized, the statute is strictly construed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ross v. Conoco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11364812\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/828/546/#p555\">\n    828 So.2d 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 555 (La. 2002). The Civil Code permits punitive damages in causes of action arising out of child pornography (article 2315.3), driving while intoxicated (article 2315.4), child molestation (article 2315.7), and domestic abuse article 2315.8).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore v. Wayne Smith Trucking, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-1919,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20471606\">\n    2015 WL 471606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (E.D. La. Feb. 4, 2015) (Vance, J.). Former article 2315.3 (effective in 1984 and repealed as of April 16, 1996) authorized recovery of punitive damages against a party that wantonly or recklessly disregarded public safety in the storage or handling of hazardous toxic substances. Given the article's repeal, the offending conduct must have occurred between the article's passage in 1984 and its repeal in 1996; and the plaintiffs must plead facts that establish their cause of action during the effective period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brownell Land Co., L.L.C. v. Apache Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 05-322,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%203543772\">\n    2005 WL 3543772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (E.D. La. Oct. 13, 2005) (Africk, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Here, the plaintiffs allege that \"chloroprene emissions and discharges have been released into the environment around the Pontchartrain Works facility for 48 years[,]\" but that \"nationwide chloroprene\n   emissions have been concentrated almost exclusively in LaPlace\" since 2007. The plaintiffs fail to plead facts that establish a cause of action for the effective period of former article 2315.3. A common sense reading of the plaintiffs' allegations triggers Denka's recent conduct: the plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief focuses on Denka's present and continuing conduct; and, in particular, its failure to heed the limit of acceptable risk threshold for chloroprene emissions as recently identified by the EPA, below .2 micrograms per cubic meter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, IT IS ORDERED: that DuPont's Rule 12 motion is GRANTED; Denka's Rule 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) motion is also GRANTED, without prejudice to the plaintiffs' opportunity to amend their deficient nuisance allegations if they can in good faith do so. Any amended complaint must be filed within 14 days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Exposure above the designated \"acceptable risk\" represents an unacceptable risk of cancer from exposure from the toxin.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The concentration of an air pollutant is measured in units of density.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    The EPA did not report its sampling results until October 2016.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Meanwhile, representatives of DuPont and DPE told members of the community that there was no danger arising from the facility's chloroprene emissions.

The EPA's response leaves undisturbed its determinations that chloroprene is a likely human carcinogen and 0.2 \u00b5g/m\n    <sup>\n     3\n    </sup>\n    is the upper limit of acceptable risk exposure threshold for chloroprene.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The plaintiffs allege that they do not now seek to recover for personal injury damages due to chloroprene exposure; rather, they allege that they \"seek to preserve\" the right to bring claims to recover compensatory damages when evidence linking chloroprene emissions to physical injury may be developed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The plaintiffs timely moved to remand, arguing both that removal was procedurally defective (because the defendants failed to sufficiently allege their citizenship at the time of removal) and that the Court lacked diversity jurisdiction over the lawsuit. The defendants opposed the plaintiffs' motion to remand and, in response to the plaintiffs' argument that the allegations of citizenship were technically defective, the defendants additionally requested leave to file an amended joint notice of removal to correct any technically defective allegations. The Court denied the plaintiffs' motion to remand and granted the defendants' request for leave to file an amended notice of removal. Meanwhile, the plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion for leave to file a second amended and restated class action complaint; the motion was granted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Meanwhile, the defendants recently removed from state court another lawsuit alleging exposure to chloroprene emissions,\n    <em>\n     Lydia Gerard v.

Ms. Gerard alleges that she has experienced some of the symptoms identified by the EPA as a result of chloroprene exposure, and she seeks to recover not more than $50,000 under theories of nuisance, negligence, strict liability, and civil battery. She has filed a motion to remand, which is pending and shall be resolved by separate order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    The plaintiffs allege that DuPont sold the PWF in 2015, but that it retained ownership of the land underlying the facility.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The Court underscores that the plaintiffs\n    <em>\n     in this lawsuit\n    </em>\n    do not seek redress in the form of damages linked to DuPont's past conduct as responsible for emissions in its capacity of owner and operator of the PWF.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    The standing test is directed to defendant's\n    <em>\n     conduct\n    </em>\n    ; not ownership of land on which the allegedly harmful conduct is occurring.
