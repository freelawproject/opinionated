Prior to RFC's May 2012 bankruptcy, it served as a middleman in the RMBS industry, both acquiring and securitizing residential mortgage loans. First, RFC purchased residential mortgage loans from numerous originating financial lenders,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   including Defendants Home Loan Center, Inc., CTX Mortgage Co., LLC, Standard Pacific Mortgage, Inc., Impac Funding Corp., iServe Residential Lending, LLC, and Freedom Mortgage Corporation (collectively, \"Defendants\"), and bundled them into securitization pools of thousands of loans. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Matthew R. Scheck (\"Scheck Decl.\") [Doc. No. 3258], Ex. 10 (Horst Dep. at 620-23);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836400\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/909/1073/#p1083\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 36 (Ruckdaschel Dep. at 40-41);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836400\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/909/1073/#p1083\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 19 (Corr.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836400\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/909/1073/#p1083\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 19 (Corr.

In the contracts that governed the relationships between RFC and the Trusts, RFC made representations and warranties (\"R &amp; Ws\") concerning the underwriting quality and credit characteristics of the mortgage loans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Trusts issued notes or certificates, supported by the loans' performance, which investors purchased. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) RFC additionally functioned as a \"master servicer\" for many of the securitizations, overseeing the work of the primary servicers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   While both parts of RFC's business model are factually relevant in this consolidated action, the legal focus of this litigation concerns Defendants' potential liability at the first step of selling residential mortgage loans to RFC. To sell their loans, Defendants each separately entered into a \"Client Contract\" with RFC. (Decl. of Deanna Horst (\"Horst Decl.\") [Doc. No. 3244], Exs. 2-9 (Defs.' Client Contracts).) Along with the Client Contract, a longer, more detailed document called \"the Client Guide\" governed the business relationship\n   between RFC and Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    (Id.,\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1 (Client Guide \u00a7 100, Version 1-06-G01, Effective Mar. 13, 2006).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Client Guide \"set[ ] forth the terms and conditions for selling Loans to [ ]RFC.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Specifically, it provided that the originating lender, or \"Client,\" was \"bound by all provisions\" of the Client Guide, \"including but not limited to the [R &amp; Ws] of Client and Remedies of [ ]RFC Sections of this Client Guide [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 101.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The contractual language most relevant to the parties' summary judgment motions-and discussed in further detail throughout this opinion-is found in Sections 113(A) &amp; (B), A200, A202, A208, A209, A210, and A212 of the Client Guide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836400\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/909/1073/#p1083\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 A208) (listing the types of \"Events of Default\"). Under Section A209, \"Non-Exclusive, Cumulative\n   Remedies,\" the Client Guide broadly provides that \"RFC may exercise any remedy outlined in the Client Guide or as allowed by law or in equity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 A209.) Moreover, it states that RFC's exercise of its remedies resulting from an originating lender's default \"will not prevent [ ]RFC from exercising: [o]ne or more other remedies in connection with the same Event of Default\" or \"[a]ny other rights which it may have at law or in equity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Section A210: Repurchase\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Client Guide remedies most relevant here are \"Repurchase,\" in Section A210, and \"Indemnification,\" in Section A212. Under the repurchase provision, if RFC determines that an Event of Default has occurred with respect to a particular loan, the originating lender can be required to repurchase a loan within 30 days of receiving notification from RFC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 A210(A).) The repurchase provision sets forth a specific procedure and formula for determining the repurchase price of a loan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836400\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/909/1073/#p1083\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 A210 (A)-(H).) In addition, it states, \"[ ]RFC is not required to demand repurchase within any particular period of time, and may elect not to require immediate repurchase. However, any delay in making this demand does not constitute a waiver by [ ]RFC of any of its rights or remedies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 A210 (A).) Even if RFC determines that repurchase is not the appropriate remedy, the originating lender is nevertheless obliged to pay RFC \"all losses, costs and expenses incurred by [ ]RFC and/or the Loan's Servicer as a result of an Event of Default,\" including reasonable attorneys' fees and related costs incurred in connection with any enforcement efforts.

Section A212: Indemnification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Client Guide's provision for the remedy of indemnification, Section A212, also provides RFC with wide-ranging indemnification in the event of an originating lender's default. The indemnification provision\n   requires the originating lender to indemnify RFC from\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   all losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees, judgments, and any other coasts, fees, and expenses resulting from any Event of Default.

Bankruptcy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   As this Court previously noted, Plaintiffs and the originating-lender Defendants were active participants in the RMBS market frenzy. During its heyday, they undoubtedly reaped considerable financial benefits from their relationships with each other. But beginning in 2007, and consistent with events throughout the RMBS industry, the loans in the RFC-sponsored and serviced securitizations experienced a high rate of default. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   Ex. 19 (Corr. Hawthorne Rpt. \u00b6 19).) The Trusts consequently sustained significant financial losses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Multiple entities, including the RMBS Trustees, demanded repurchase and/or filed lawsuits against RFC, alleging that their losses were caused by the poor quality of the loans in RFC's securitizations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Each RMBS securitization that RFC sponsored or serviced was administered by a Trustee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Trustee was authorized to seek remedies against RFC to recover losses experienced by the securitization due to contractual breaches by RFC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Any recoveries that the Trustees obtained would be paid to the Trusts, and ultimately benefit the investors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The following Trustees sought relief against Plaintiffs and participated in a settlement with them (\"the RMBS Trustee Settlement\"): Deutsche Bank National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (\"Deutsche Bank\"), Bank of New York Mellon (\"BNYM\"), U.S. Bank N.A. (\"US Bank\"), HSBC Bank USA, N.A. (\"HSBC\"), and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\"Wells Fargo\") (collectively, the \"RMBS Trustees\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Other securitizations that RFC sponsored or serviced, or securitizations into which it sold loans, carried financial guaranty insurance furnished by monoline insurers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The monoline insurers included MBIA Insurance Corporation (\"MBIA\"), Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (\"FGIC\"), Assured Guaranty Municipal Corporation (formerly known as Financial Security Assurance, Inc.) (\"Assured\"), Ambac Assurance Corporation (\"Ambac\"), and Syncora Guarantee Inc. (\"Syncora\") (collectively, the \"Monolines\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Under the insurance policies, the Monolines generally guaranteed that investors would receive timely payments of principal and interest on their notes or certificates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) If a defaulted loan caused a trust to be unable to timely pay its investors, the Monolines were to compensate the trust for the shortfall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Due to the high rate of default in the RFC-sponsored and serviced securitizations in 2007, the Monolines made \"substantial payments\" to their insureds under their policies, and were likely to incur future payments as well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Beginning in approximately 2008, the RMBS Trustees and Monolines filed lawsuits against Plaintiffs alleging claims for breach of representation and warranty, fraud, and servicing-related claims arising from Plaintiffs' sale of the allegedly defective mortgage loans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22; Scheck Decl., Ex. 28 (Bankr. Findings of Fact \u00b6\u00b6 98-108, 124-25).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   On May 13, 2012, Plaintiffs entered into a proposed $8.7 billion settlement (\"Original RMBS Settlement\") with two groups of RMBS Trust investors that had holdings in approximately 392 securitization trusts. (Scheck Decl., Ex. 19 (Corr. Hawthorne Rpt. \u00b6 23);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836400\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/909/1073/#p1083\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 20 (Debtors' 9019 Mot. \u00b6\u00b6 17-20).) Absent settlement, Plaintiffs' then-expert Frank Sillman estimated that lifetime losses for these trusts could have ranged between $45.6 billion to $49.8 billion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 28 (Bankr. Findings of Fact \u00b6 101).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The following day, and as contemplated by the Original RMBS Settlement, Plaintiffs filed for Chapter 11 relief in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (\"Bankruptcy Court\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836400\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/909/1073/#p1083\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 19 (Corr.

Shortly thereafter, the Bankruptcy\n   Court appointed an examiner to investigate the Plaintiffs' pre-petition activities. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836400\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/909/1073/#p1083\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 28 (Bankr. Findings of Fact \u00b6 3).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Multiple entities filed RMBS-related proofs of claim with the Bankruptcy Court in order to obtain damages. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836400\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/909/1073/#p1083\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Exs. 22 to 26 (Proofs of Claim 6767, 6605, 6656, 6451, 5130).) This included six RMBS Trustees with proofs of claim covering 1,000 trusts with a combined original principal balance of over $226 billion. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836400\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/909/1073/#p1083\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 19 (Corr. Hawthorne Rpt. \u00b6 97).) Their most significant claims concerned alleged breaches of the R &amp; Ws that Plaintiffs had made in the Governing Agreements for the securitizations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98.) Among their other claims, RMBS Trustees also asserted common-law fraud or negligent misrepresentation claims against Plaintiffs to the extent that they had actual or imputed knowledge that the mortgage loans failed to comply with Plaintiffs' R &amp; Ws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Additionally, several Monolines filed 32 proofs of claim with the Bankruptcy Court, asserting claims for tens of billions of dollars in actual and potential losses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104.) Like the RMBS Trustees' claims, the Monolines' claims generally alleged breaches of R &amp; Ws. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 105-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Upon filing for bankruptcy, Plaintiffs sought the approval of the Original RMBS Settlement pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9019. (Scheck Decl., Ex. 20 (Debtors' 9019 Mot. \u00b6 57).) However, some stakeholders opposed the Original RMBS Settlement, including the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, a committee appointed to represent all general unsecured creditors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   Ex. 19 (Corr. Hawthorne Rpt. \u00b6 24);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 28 (Bankr. Findings of Fact \u00b6 102);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 29 (Comm. Obj. at 10-11).) Some objectors found the proposed settlement amount unreasonably high, (\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   Ex. 19 (Corr. Hawthorne Rpt. \u00b6 124), while others found it too low. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125.) The parties engaged in substantial discovery and extensively litigated issues concerning the approval of the Original RMBS Settlement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 115-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In light of the objections, the Bankruptcy Court encouraged a new round of comprehensive settlement negotiations. (Scheck Decl., Ex. 28 (Bankr. Findings of Fact \u00b6 102).) Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn, who oversaw the bankruptcy proceedings, appointed another sitting federal bankruptcy judge, Judge James Peck, as mediator, and additionally authorized Lewis Kruger as the Chief Restructuring Officer to negotiate a settlement of the claims against Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   Ex. 30 (Mediator Order);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 31 (Kruger Direct Testimony \u00b6\u00b6 11-12).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   On May 13, 2013, Plaintiffs entered into settlement agreements with the RMBS Trustees and Monolines MBIA, FGIC, Ambac, and Syncora, which were incorporated into the parties' proposed Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Plan (\"the Plan\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   Ex. 19 (Corr. Hawthorne Rpt. \u00b6 139).) Almost all of the creditors that voted on the Plan (95.7%) voted to accept it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   Ex. 28 (Bankr. Findings of Fact \u00b6\u00b6 1, 265).) The Plan reflected that the parties had resolved the RMBS Trustees' claims against RFC for $7.091 billion (the \"RMBS Settlement\"), and the Monolines' claims against RFC as follows: MBIA ($1.45 billion), FGIC ($415 million), Ambac ($22.8 million), and Syncora ($7 million) (collectively, the \"Monoline Settlements,\" and collectively with the RMBS Settlement, the \"Settlements\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   Ex. 19 (Corr. Hawthorne Rpt. \u00b6 26.);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 32, App. 1 (Bankr. Plan, Art. IV(C), (D) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 33 (Order Granting \u00a7 365 Mot. at 12 \u00b6 6).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   In December 2013, Judge Glenn issued his 134-page Findings of Fact regarding the confirmation of the proposed Chapter 11 Plan. (\n   <em>\n    See id.,\n   </em>\n   Ex. 28 (Bankr. Findings of Fact at 1, \u00b6\u00b6 18-50).) Among the Plan's release-related provisions negotiated as part of the Settlements, Judge Glenn noted the parties' respective risks and their time-consuming efforts to reach an informed resolution:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   The settlement reflects a reasonable balance between the litigation's possibility of success and the settlement's future benefits. Each party to the negotiations that led to the settlement had access to a wealth of information gathered over the course of months-long investigations conducted by the Committee and the voluminous materials made available from the Examiner's investigation. To facilitate settlement negotiations, the parties reviewed extensive document discovery, briefed the merits of the claims, and exchanged written and oral presentations regarding their legal positions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 239) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   He further noted that the parties found the Settlements reasonable, stating, \"With the knowledge accumulated in this process, each party independently determined that the settlement of the Estates' claims against the Ally Released Parties reflected a reasonable resolution of the claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, Judge Glenn found that \"each [individual] settlement was reasonable, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 178), that the Plan proponents had exercised reasonable business judgment in entering into the Plan Documents, which he also deemed \"fair and reasonable,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51 &amp; n.11), and that the agreed-upon allocations embodied in the Plan were likewise \"reasonable and appropriate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 201.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   As to the individual settlements comprising the global Settlements, he found that the new RMBS Settlement resolved: \"(1) alleged and potential claims for breaches of R &amp; Ws held by all RMBS Trusts; (2) all alleged and potential claims for damages arising from servicing; and (3) any cure claims ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103).) Absent settlement, Judge Glenn recognized the significant financial risks in litigating the parties' claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   The potential losses for RMBS Trusts asserting breaches of representations and warranties range from $42.4 billion to $43.2 billion, excluding losses that are insured by a Monoline. Of that amount, $32.9 billion are historical losses to Debtor-sponsored trusts, and $1.45 billion represent historical losses in non-Debtor sponsored trusts that correspond to the percentage of loans in those trusts sold by the Debtors. The additional forecasted losses range from $7.76 billion to $8.4 billion for the Debtor-sponsored RMBS Trusts, and $300 to $400 million for the portion of non-Debtor-sponsored RMBS Trusts corresponding to the portion of loans sold by the Debtors. Absent settlement, the likely amount of recoverable damages for the RMBS Trusts' representation and warranty claims, after consideration of legal defenses and litigation costs, ranges from $7.38 billion to $8.6 billion. This range does not account for servicing claims and cure claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106) (internal citations omitted). Judge Glenn further stated that but for the approval of the RMBS Settlement, the R &amp; W claims \"would have to be asserted, litigated and liquidated on an individual basis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118.) And if these claims were litigated individually, Judge Glenn found that they \"would be subject to significant litigation risks and factual and legal defenses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, because litigating these claims would be an expensive and time-consuming undertaking, he concluded\n   that doing so \"would deplete the Debtors' estates, and might result in diminished recoveries to all creditor constituencies, including the RMBS Trusts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In addition to the RMBS Trusts' R &amp; W claims, the mediation also included the RMBS Trusts' Servicing Claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119.) Certain RMBS Trustees retained the financial advisory firm of Duff &amp; Phelps, LLC (\"Duff &amp; Phelps\") to identify and quantify their claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 113-14).) Duff &amp; Phelps sought to quantify Plaintiffs' liability as a servicer with respect to: (1) misapplied and miscalculated payments; (2) wrongful foreclosure and improper loss mitigation practices; and (3) extended foreclosure timing issues caused by improper or inefficient servicing conduct such as falsified affidavits, improper documentation, and improper collection practices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119.) Judge Glenn noted Duff &amp; Phelps' finding that Plaintiffs' potential liability as a servicer under these three bases could be as high as $1.1 billion, but that asserting such claims would involve \"significant risk and uncertainty.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Under the Plan, the servicing-related claims, settled as \"RMBS Cure Claims,\" were allowed in an aggregate amount of $96 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Judge Glenn made similar findings regarding Plaintiffs' financial exposure for the Monolines' claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 126-37, 143-54, 213-15.) He stated that absent a settlement, Plaintiffs were \"almost certain to become embroiled in additional, complex litigation with the Monolines over the validity, amount and possible subordination of their asserted claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 213.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Judge Glenn found that the Settlements resulted from good faith, arms-length negotiations, were in the best interests of the parties and claimholders, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51), were proposed in good faith and in conformity with the Bankruptcy Code, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-26, 27, 51, 121-22), and, as noted, were reasonable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51, 178, 201, 239.) The Bankruptcy Settlements also contemplated further recovery for the investors who acquired RFC's rights against the correspondent lenders. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scheck Decl., Ex. 32 (Bankr. Confirm. Order \u00b6 48) (authorizing the creation of a \"Liquidating Trust,\" into which RFC was to transfer and assign its assets, and preserving the Liquidating Trust's (and Estates') causes of action);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , App. 1 (Bankr.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-26; 82.) RFC contends that Defendants well understood RFC's business model, whereby once the loans were sold to RFC, RFC would pool the loans, eventually selling them into securitization trusts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) RFC also alleges that Defendants knew or should have known of the defects in the loans that they sold RFC, but failed to inform RFC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) RFC contends that Defendants therefore breached their R &amp; Ws, as the loans failed to materially comply with the terms of their agreements and the Client Guide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82-83.) As a result of Defendants' alleged breaches, RFC asserts that it has suffered damages.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.) It contends that it has incurred such liabilities, losses, and damages arising from the alleged material defects in Defendants' loans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.) Specifically, RFC points to over $10 billion in allowed claims approved by the Bankruptcy Court, as well attorneys' fees, litigation-related expenses, and other costs associated with defending numerous lawsuits and proofs of claim against RFC stemming from the Defendants' allegedly defective loans.

Section A212 requires Defendants to indemnify RFC for \"all losses ... resulting from any Event of Default.\" (Client Guide \u00a7 A212.) Defendants argue that the phrase \"resulting from any Event of Default\" limits the scope of this indemnification provision to breaches caused by the Client or third parties. (Defs.' Mem. at 59.) Because \"Event of Default\" is a specifically defined term that does not include the actions of RFC, they contend that any obligations to indemnify arising from an \"Event of Default\" do not extend to RFC's\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   underlying actions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The Court does not read the Client Guide so narrowly. While it does not use the specific word \"negligence,\" it nevertheless makes clear the parties' intent to indemnify RFC for its own negligent acts. Under Section A202(II), Defendants agreed to indemnify RFC from \"any claim, demand, defense or assertion against or involving [ ]RFC based on or grounded upon, or resulting from such misstatement or omission [by Defendants] or a breach of any representation, warranty or obligation\n   <em>\n    made by [ ]RFC\n   </em>\n   in reliance upon such misstatement or omission.\" (Client Guide \u00a7 A202(II) ) (emphasis added). Similarly, Section A212 requires indemnification for liabilities resulting from \"any breach of any representation, warranty or obligation\n   <em>\n    made by [ ]RFC\n   </em>\n   in reliance upon any warranty, obligation or representation made by the Client contained in the Client Contract[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 A212) (emphasis added).

RFC does not contest that it sometimes bought loans outside of the normal program guidelines, observing that the Client Guide permitted it to do so. (Pls.' Opp'n at 36) (citing Client Guide \u00a7 J600.) With respect to Plaintiffs' purported policy of using Assetwise to buy loans that failed to comply with the Client Guide, the first page of RFC's internal policy, which Defendants cite, provides for various circumstances in which \"An Assetwise approval is NOT valid,\" and further states, \"The Client is still responsible to ensure the loan conforms to RFC guidelines.\" (Smallwood Decl., Ex. 58 (Ex. 145-0011 to Maki Dep.)

(Defs.' Mem. at 58) (citing Smallwood Decl., Ex. 39 (Corr. Hawthorne Rpt. \u00b6 237).) But an acknowledgement of potential risk is hardly evidence of fraud, nor is it even an admission of liability.\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. W. Nat'l Mut.

Because RFC settled its claims with the Monolines without admitting liability for alleged fraud or misrepresentation claims, the indemnification provisions between RFC and Defendants remain enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   In sum, there has not been a threshold finding that RFC engaged in fraud or other misconduct with respect to the claims underlying the Settlements, and the Client Guide expressly permitted RFC to seek indemnification for its own negligence. Given the lack of any evidence of intentional wrongdoing, the Court finds no public policy violation in permitting Plaintiffs to seek indemnification for these claims. While the indemnification provisions remain enforceable, Plaintiffs still bear the burden of establishing causation and damages. As to Defendants' misconduct defenses, however, Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on this ground, and Defendants' summary judgment motion on this ground is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Defendants seek partial summary judgment as to Plaintiffs' claims for loans sold to RFC that were subsequently foreclosed upon, or as Defendants call them, \"expired\" loans. (Defs.' Mem. at 65-71.) They point to the provision for the survival of remedies in Section A209(C) of the Client Guide, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   [ ]RFC's remedies for breach of the [R &amp; Ws] and covenants shall survive the sale and delivery of the Loan to [ ]RFC and funding of the related purchase price by [ ]RFC, and will continue in full force and effect\n   <em>\n    for the remaining life of the Loans\n   </em>\n   , notwithstanding any termination of this Client Guide and the related Funding Documents, or any restrictive or qualified endorsement on any mortgage Note or assignment of mortgage or Loan approval or other examination\n   of or failure to examine any related mortgage Loan file by [ ]RFC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   (Client Guide \u00a7 A209(C) ) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Defendants argue that this provision controls the time period in which RFC could file lawsuits arising from a breach of the R &amp; Ws. (Defs.' Mem. at 66.) They claim that it provided a \"discrete survival period\" for RFC to assert a remedy beyond the date of sale, at which point, they argue, RFC's right to seek recovery would have otherwise \"expire[d] as a matter of law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66-70.) Defendants contend that once the \"life of the Loans\" ceased to exist, which Defendants argue was upon foreclosure, RFC's right to assert a claim related to these loans also ceased to exist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67-70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Defendants completely misconstrue the meaning of Section A209(C). In fact, they maintain that the Court should not only deny Defendants' motion for partial summary judgment, but grant summary judgment to Plaintiffs and rule that their right to assert claims for remedies extends to losses and liabilities on foreclosed and liquidated loans. (Pls.' Opp'n at 55) (citing March 21, 2018 Order) (permitting Plaintiffs to move for partial summary judgment on this issue). Plaintiffs do not interpret \"for the remaining life of the loans\" as a limitations period, and assert that the Court \"need not even reach the meaning of the phrase.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60.) In addition, they assert that Defendants' interpretation of Section 209(C) cannot be reconciled with other provisions of the Client Guide that expressly preserve RFC's remedies with respect to foreclosed and liquidated loans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55.) Further, they assert that Defendants' interpretation would produce absurd results, as it would permit Defendants to avoid liability merely by waiting for the liquidation of breaching loans, and would effectively nullify Defendants' contractual duty, in Section A210, to notify RFC of breaches. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   As noted, where the parties' intention is ascertainable from the written contract, construction is for the court.\n   <em>\n    Chergosky\n   </em>\n   , 463 N.W.2d at 525.

July 11, 2011) (stating that the parties' representations and remedies would survive for one year and thereafter terminate). The language here, however, is not a temporal limitation on Plaintiffs' right to bring a cause of action. Rather, it defines the period during which RFC possesses remedies for liabilities and losses incurred resulting from the loans. That period exists for \"the life of the loan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Defendants' interpretation of Section A209(C) is also inconsistent with other provisions of the Client Guide that suggest the availability of remedies for as long as a loan exists. As such, Defendants' interpretation conflicts with the principle that contracts are to be construed as a whole, and with harmonization of all of the provisions in mind.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chergosky\n   </em>\n   , 463 N.W.2d at 525-26. While a loan's existence typically ends upon foreclosure, RFC's remedies are not so strictly limited. For example, with respect to the right to repurchase, Section A210(B) states, \"[ ]RFC may demand that a Client repurchase, and Client must repurchase, a Loan\n   <em>\n    after foreclosure\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Client Guide \u00a7 A201(B) ) (emphasis added). In addition, liquidation proceeds are one element factored into the calculation of a repurchase price, which is equal to the sum of: (1) the actual principal balance of the loan at the time of repurchase; (2) all interest and fees incurred in recovering on the loan; (3) a buy-out fee; (4) RFC's potential additional purchase amounts; (5) minus the amount of any proceeds realized by the owner of the loan\n   <em>\n    upon the final liquidation\n   </em>\n   of the loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 A210(B) ) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Other language extends remedies to the latest of several events, including the date on which the loans are \"paid in full.\" Pursuant to Section 205(C) (\"Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Remedies\"), RFC's remedies survive under the following circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   Client's representations, warranties and covenants with respect to each Loan, and [ ]RFC's remedies for Client's breach of such representations, warranties and covenants with respect to each Loan will continue in full force and effect until the latest of: (i) the date such Loan\n   <em>\n    has been irrevocably paid in full\n   </em>\n   , (ii) the date the last limitations period for bringing claims against [ ]RFC or its successors or assigns concerning the subject matter of Client's representations and warranties with respect to such Loan expire under all applicable law, and (iii) the date any claim, suit or other proceeding against [ ]RFC or its successors or assigns concerning the subject matter of Client's representations, warranties and covenants with respect to such Loan have been conclusively determined or settled and all applicable appeals have been exhausted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 205(C) ) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs contend that because foreclosed loans have not been paid in full, RFC's remedies for losses related to these loans are not precluded. (Pls.' Opp'n at 55) (citing Client Guide \u00a7 205(C).) While Defendants assert that Section 205(C) is not uniformly applicable, and only addresses the consequences of a client's disqualification, suspension, or inactivation, (Defs.' Mem. at 70-71), even so, the provision contemplates RFC's available remedies in different ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   In advocating their \"life of the loans\" construction, Defendants point to a section in the Client Guide which requires Clients to \"keep the mortgage insurance coverage in effect for the entire life of the Loan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.; see\n   </em>\n   Client Guide \u00a7 F302(3).) Defendants contend that this language is synonymous with \"before a loan is extinguished.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court does not take issue with that interpretation. But again, the question is not the meaning of the \"life of the loans,\" but whether the plain language of Section A209(C) prohibits Plaintiffs from filing claims to effectuate their remedies only up to the date of foreclosure. It does not, which is entirely consistent with the other provisions of the Client Guide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Finally, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Defendants' interpretation of Section A209(C) would be nonsensical, as it would require RFC to anticipate breaches, and could potentially allow Defendants to escape liability for the most defective loans. In response, Defendants argue that RFC could simply give notice of a potential breach during \"a loan's life\" and if the originator did not repurchase the loan, RFC could pursue its remedies after foreclosure. (Defs.' Reply at 32 [Doc. No. 3894].) The Court rejects this argument, which is at variance with Defendants' position that Plaintiffs' right to seek relief is precluded upon foreclosure. Furthermore, the Client Guide does not require RFC to anticipate breaches or, as discussed earlier, demand repurchase within any particular time period, if at all. (Client Guide \u00a7 A210.) Instead, the Client Guide requires Defendants to notify RFC of breaches, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )-a provision that would be nullified under Defendants' reading of Section A209(C). Again, courts are to avoid any contract interpretation that would render a provision meaningless.\n   <em>\n    Chergosky\n   </em>\n   , 463 N.W.2d at 526.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   The Court therefore finds that Section A209(C) provides that Plaintiffs' remedies, and their right to damages, extend to liquidated or foreclosed loans, subject to the applicable statutory limitations periods. Section A209(C) does not function as a contractually-agreed upon limitations period, nor does it preclude recovery for RFC's losses and liabilities on foreclosed or liquidated loans. The Court therefore denies Defendants' motion for summary judgment on this issue and grants summary judgment to Plaintiffs that their remedies extend to foreclosed and liquidated loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Recovery for Claims Released in Bankruptcy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Both parties move for summary judgment regarding whether Plaintiffs may recover for claims that RFC released in bankruptcy. Defendants argue that RFC's indemnity claim is barred to the extent that it seeks recovery for more than its actual losses, claiming that RFC and its bankruptcy estate were released from all liabilities through bankruptcy. (Defs.' Mem. at 87; Defs.' Opp'n at 14-16.) They acknowledge that certain Defendants previously raised this argument in a motion to dismiss, which the Court denied. (Defs.' Mem. at 87-88.) But, they contend that (1) this Court was wrong, and (2) new evidence further supports their position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that this Court has already rejected Defendants' argument, finding instead that \" 'the plain language of the Bankruptcy Court's Confirmation Order and the Chapter 11 Plan demonstrates that the claims at issue were not extinguished upon confirmation of the Plan.' \" (Pls.' Opp'n at 50) (quoting June 16, 2015 Am. Order at 18 [Doc. No. 537] ). They contend that there is no \"new evidence\" warranting a departure from the prior ruling, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-52), and that Defendants\n   would receive a windfall if RFC's bankruptcy insulated them from liability. (Pls.' Mem. at 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   As the parties correctly observe, in June 2015, the Court ruled on this very issue, in response to a motion to dismiss filed by Home Loan Center, one of the remaining Defendants, and Decision One Mortgage, which is no longer a party. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 16, 2015 Am. Order at 16-22.) The Court incorporates that ruling herein by reference. In the June 2015 Order, the Court noted that although the estate of a debtor normally ceases to exist once a Chapter 11 plan is confirmed, this is not always true. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19) (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And the Court distinguished\n   <em>\n    Bank of India\n   </em>\n   because, unlike here, there was no contractual indemnification agreement.

The language of confirmation orders and bankruptcy plans will obviously differ from case to case. As this Court has again explained, the applicable language in this case did not extinguish the Allowed Claims themselves or Defendants' obligation to indemnify Plaintiffs for them. Accordingly, the Court reaffirms its June 2015 decision and grants summary judgment to Plaintiffs and denies summary judgment to Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Sampling\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Earlier in this consolidated action, the Court issued a preliminary ruling on the use of loan sampling as a means for Plaintiff to initially make their case for liability and damages. (April 16, 2015 Order [Doc. No. 374].) Plaintiffs had sought an order\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   approving their proposed sampling methodology to determine a breach rate for a group of loans sold by Defendants in 23 cases where the total number of loans exceeded 500 in an individual case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Plaintiffs described the sampling protocol that their expert, Dr. Karl Snow, proposed to utilize in order to extrapolate breach rates to the population from which a given sample was drawn. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (citing Snow Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 37-41 [Doc. No. 157-11] ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Because the Court found that early decisions on sampling issues would streamline the administration of these complex cases, it granted the motion in part and denied it without prejudice in part, holding that: (1) Dr. Snow was a qualified expert witness with respect to the selection and construction of RFC's proposed samples, and the extrapolation of a breach rate from those samples to the populations from which they were drawn; (2) subject to the reservation of Defendants' rights, the sampling\n   protocol set forth in Dr. Snow's declaration was scientifically valid and admissible for the purpose of identifying a random sample of loans from the population of loans at issue in each case; and (3) Defendants agreed that they would not challenge the proposition that a 150-loan sample is sufficiently large to identify a breach rate with a margin of error at the 95% confidence level of no more than +/-8 percentage points for binary questions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) To the extent that Plaintiffs sought further early\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   or admissibility rulings, the Court denied the motion without prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Snow has since completed his sampling protocol and issued an opinion. Defendants seek to preclude that opinion in a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motion that the Court will address in a separate ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Plaintiffs and Defendants have also filed cross summary judgment motions on the question of whether Plaintiffs may use loan sampling as a method of proof. Defendants seek to preclude the use of statistical sampling to establish liability for loans outside of the sample population. (Defs.' Mem. at 85.) They assert that Client Guide Sections A202 and A212 require RFC to establish liability on a loan-by-loan basis, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), consistent with a \"judicial tide\" of RMBS case law against the use of sampling, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 86-87; Defs.' Reply at 39). In addition, Defendants take issue with the methodology of Plaintiffs' expert Dr. Karl Snow, arguing that his opinion is impermissibly speculative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86-87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Plaintiffs disagree. In their affirmative motion, they ask that the Court enter summary judgment holding that RFC may prove its breach of contract and indemnification claims using statistical sampling and need not re-underwrite each at-issue loan. (Pls.' Mem. at 46.) They argue that the Client Guide does not limit how they may prove breaches. (Pls.' Opp'n at 63.) Rather, they argue, it permits them to exercise any remedy outlined in the Client Guide or permitted by law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (citing Client Guide \u00a7 A209(A).) Plaintiffs also cite legal authority approving the use of sampling as a means of establishing liability in RMBS litigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Furthermore, they argue that as a practical matter, sampling is necessary, because re-underwriting each at-issue loan and offering loan-by-loan proof would be unmanageable, if not impossible, for the parties, the jury, and the Court. (Pls.' Mem. at 49-51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   As a general matter, statistical sampling is a commonly used and accepted means of assembling and analyzing data, particularly in complex litigation. The U.S. Supreme Court has noted, \"A representative or statistical sample, like all evidence, is a means to establish or defend against liability,\" and \"is used in various substantive realms of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594872\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1036/#p1046\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1046,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594872\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1036/#p1046\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). The Eighth Circuit has likewise approved the use of sampling methodology as a means of establishing breach and causation in breach of contract litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marvin Lumber &amp; Cedar Co. v. PPG Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9175406\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/901/#p916\">\n    401 F.3d 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 916 (8th Cir. 2005). In litigation involving excess insurance indemnification, this Court has stated that the question of the reasonableness of underlying settlements could also be demonstrated by expert sampling of a statistically significant number of claims files.\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth Group Inc. v. Columbia Cas. Co.,\n   </em>\n   No. 05-cv-1289 (PJS/SRN),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%2011537514\">\n    2010 WL 11537514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *25 (D. Minn. Aug. 10, 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Defendants cite legal authority for the proposition that there is a \"clear trend\" against permitting the use of statistical sampling in RMBS cases. (Defs.' Opp'n at 51-52.) The Court disagrees with the notion that there is any such \"trend.\" Rather, the question of whether sampling\n   is permitted frequently turns on the scope of remedies available under the parties' governing agreement. For instance, several of Defendants' cases involve the more limited question of whether statistical sampling is an acceptable method of proof where the parties' agreements provide for a sole remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Homeward Residential, Inc. v.

(Defs.' Opp'n at 51.) They contend that unlike the facts here, certain of Plaintiffs' cited cases concerned pool-wide claims against aggregators and sponsors of RMBS, in which the plaintiffs asserted misrepresentations of the overall characteristics of entire pools. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants appear to argue this case does not involve such broad claims, therefore, statistical sampling is ill-suited and improper. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20953550\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   But Plaintiffs assert that many of their cited cases approved the use of sampling where the claims were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   pool-wide claims against RMBS aggregators or sponsors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pls.' Reply at 26 [Doc. No. 3909].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   Moreover, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the relevant distinction in the case law is not between pool-wide and loan-by-loan cases, but between cases in which the governing agreement includes a sole remedy provision and those that do not, as discussed above. As noted, in cases involving sole remedy provisions, such as repurchase, courts have found a pervasive breach theory foreclosed, often due to repurchase notice and demand provisions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Homeward Residential\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205256760\">\n    2017 WL 5256760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. But here, the Client Guide's repurchase provision does not require RFC to even make a repurchase demand, (Client Guide \u00a7 A210), nor does it require RFC to give notice of litigation that might trigger an originating lender's indemnification obligations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 A212.) And, perhaps most importantly, the Client Guide does not limit Plaintiffs' remedies to a single type. To the contrary, it contemplates wide-ranging relief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-231\">\n   [ ]RFC may exercise any remedy outlined in this Client Guide or as allowed by law or in equity. [ ]RFC's exercise of one or more remedies in connection with a particular Event of Default will not prevent it from exercising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-232\">\n   \u2022 One or more other remedies in connection with the same Event of Default\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-233\">\n   \u2022 Any other rights which it may have at law or in equity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   <em>\n    (Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 A209.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Defendants highlight certain singular nouns in Sections A202 and A212 as evidence that the Client Guide requires loan-by-loan proof to establish liability. (Defs.' Mem. at 85-86.) For example, they point to references to \"each Loan\" in A202:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-236\">\n   <em>\n    Each\n   </em>\n   of the Loans delivered and sold to [ ]RFC meets the applicable program terms and criteria set forth in this Client Guide. All information relating to\n   <em>\n    each Loan\n   </em>\n   delivered and sold to [ ]RFC is true, complete and accurate .... The Client is in compliance with, and has taken all necessary actions to ensure that\n   <em>\n    each Loan\n   </em>\n   is in compliance with all representations, warranties and requirements contained in this Client Guide.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   (Client Guide \u00a7 A202) (emphases added). Although other Courts have found that the usage of singular nouns requires loan-by-loan proof,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Homeward Residential\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205256760\">\n    2017 WL 5256760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7, this Court is not persuaded. The \"each Loan\" language in the Client Guide does not state that Plaintiffs must prove breaches loan by loan. Rather, the Section A202 language quoted above, for example, requires\n   <em>\n    Defendants\n   </em>\n   to make their representations loan by loan. Defendants identify no Client Guide provisions that expressly require Plaintiffs to prove liability loan by loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   The Court in\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523294\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/484/#p504\">\n    289 F.Supp.3d at 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , rejected this same argument based on the use of singular nouns in the parties' contract. There, as here, the governing contract contained no language requiring the party providing notice to specifically identify or offer proof as to each and every loan subject to repurchase.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523294\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/484/#p504\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, here, Defendants' actual knowledge of breaches is irrelevant because the Client Guide obliged originating lenders to assume liability for any misrepresentations or breaches, regardless of their knowledge or RFC's knowledge. (Client Guide \u00a7 A200.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Moreover, as Plaintiffs note, even if Plaintiffs were required to prove liability\n   on a loan-by-loan basis, two courts have recently suggested that sampling is one means by which to do so. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scheck Decl., Ex. 64 (Mar. 8, 2018\n   <em>\n    Lehman\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 78) (stating that loan-by-loan proof is required, \"either directly or through a sound extrapolation methodology\");\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523294\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/484/#p504\">\n    289 F.Supp.3d at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding statistical sampling consistent with the plaintiff's repurchase obligations under the parties' agreement, as it \"is a well-established and scientifically sound method of inferring (to varying degrees of certainty) how many individual loans in the pool contain material breaches\").

The futility of applying an individualized remedy to allegedly widespread misrepresentations is evident in the fact that, of the 1,300 loans actually submitted under the repurchase protocol, EMC has remedied only 20. This .015% success rate does not bode well for the efficiency of employing the repurchase protocol for a generalized claim of breach. Accordingly, EMC cannot reasonably expect the Court to examine each of the 9,871 transactions to determine whether there has been a breach, with the sole remedy of putting them back one by one.

(Pls.' Mem. at 9.) Plaintiffs argue that Defendants, as sophisticated business entities, well understood that they were bound by these determinations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs primarily ground their arguments in the plain language of several provisions of the Client Guide. Most importantly, they point to Section 113(B), a provision that governs every section of the Client Guide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-253\">\n   Whenever any provision of this Client Guide contract\n   <em>\n    requires [ ]RFC to make a determination of fact or a decision to act\n   </em>\n   , or to permit, approve or deny another party's action\n   <em>\n    such determination or decision shall be made in\n   </em>\n   [ ]\n   <em>\n    RFC's sole discretion\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   (Client Guide \u00a7 113(B) (emphasis added).) Plaintiffs next point to Section A210, which envisions RFC's exercise of its sole discretion and provides\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-255\">\n   If [ ]RFC\n   <em>\n    determines that an Event of Default has occurred\n   </em>\n   with respect to a specific Loan, the\n   <em>\n    Client agrees to repurchase the Loan\n   </em>\n   and its servicing (if the Loan was sold servicing released) within 30 days of receiving a repurchase letter or other written notification from [ ]RFC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-256\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-257\">\n   Where [ ]RFC determines that repurchase of a Loan and/or the servicing is not appropriate,\n   <em>\n    the Client shall pay\n   </em>\n   [ ]\n   <em>\n    RFC all losses, costs, and expenses incurred by [ ]RFC and/or the Loan's Servicer as a result of an Event of Default\n   </em>\n   .

More specifically, Plaintiffs argue that Section 113(B), titled \"[ ]RFC's Sole Discretion,\" plainly grants them sole discretion to make a determination of fact, and that \"Events of Default\" are such determination of facts. Sections A210 and A212, Plaintiffs argue, then speak simply to the remedies that RFC is entitled to exercise once it makes a determination that an Event of Default has occurred. Plaintiffs\n   acknowledge that such discretion cannot be exercised in bad faith. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 19, 2018 Hr'g Tr. (\"June 19 Hr'g Tr.\") at 15 [Doc.

They contend that the Client Guide only grants RFC the sole discretion to determine breaches when exercising a particular remedy-repurchase under Section A210. According to Defendants, \"\n   <em>\n    Terrace\n   </em>\n   makes clear that Section A210 grants RFC discretion for a particular purpose: namely, 'to determine\n   <em>\n    if a particular loan must be repurchased\n   </em>\n   because it failed to meet the underwriting criteria provided in the Client Guides.' \" (Defs.' Opp'n at 3) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Terrace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027892\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/850/961/\">\n    850 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   969 ). In other words, they concede that RFC has the power to determine, in its sole discretion, if a loan is in breach of a R &amp; W, but\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   insofar as RFC seeks to have the originating bank repurchase that loan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. at 2 (\"\n   <em>\n    Terrace\n   </em>\n   affirmed RFC's discretion\n   <em>\n    in a specific context\n   </em>\n   (applying the Client Guide's repurchase protocol) to make\n   <em>\n    a specific determination\n   </em>\n   (whether loans breached the Guide) in connection with\n   <em>\n    a specific remedy\n   </em>\n   (repurchase).\").) In all other circumstances, Defendants contend, RFC does not have sole discretion to determine breaches. (Defs.' Opp'n at 2-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   This Court disagrees with Defendants' strained reading of the Client Guide and the\n   <em>\n    Terrace\n   </em>\n   decisions. Based on the plain language of the contract the parties willingly signed, the Court concludes that the Client Guide grants RFC sole discretion to determine Events of Default in all circumstances, and that that discretion is derived from Section 113(B). In clear, unambiguous language, Section 113(B) grants RFC sole, unreviewable discretion to make determinations of fact. And as this Court held in\n   <em>\n    Terrace\n   </em>\n   , one such determination of fact involves declaring Events of Default. Indeed, in affirming this Court's\n   <em>\n    Terrace\n   </em>\n   decision, the Eighth Circuit held that \"[t]he Client Guide gives [RFC] 'sole discretion' to determine whether an Event of Default has occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Terrace II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070616\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/910/\">\n    725 F.3d at 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   Once that determination of fact has occurred, i.e., once RFC determines that an Event of Default has occurred, Sections A210 and A212 simply speak of\n   <em>\n    remedies\n   </em>\n   that RFC may exercise under the contract. For instance, Section A210 simply states that \"\n   <em>\n    If [ ]RFC determines that an Event of Default has occurred\n   </em>\n   with respect to a specific Loan, the\n   <em>\n    Client agrees to repurchase the Loan\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Client Guide \u00a7 A210 (emphasis added).) Contrary to Defendants' contention, this section does not empower RFC with sole discretion. Rather, Section A210\n   <em>\n    presupposes\n   </em>\n   that RFC has such power and then simply sets forth the clients' obligations once that discretion has been exercised. The source of the power is Section 113(B). Similarly, Section A212 speaks of a remedy that RFC may utilize after it has determined that an Event of\n   Default has occurred. It provides that Defendants \"\n   <em>\n    shall indemnify\n   </em>\n   [ ]RFC from all losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees, judgments, and any other costs, fees and expenses\n   <em>\n    resulting from any Event of Default\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 A212) (emphasis added). Like Section A210, this provision does not empower RFC with sole discretion to make a determination of fact-it presupposes that RFC has that authority-an authority again derived from Section 113(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   Dispelling any doubt about this interpretation, the Eighth Circuit essentially held as much in\n   <em>\n    Terrace II\n   </em>\n   . In a particularly relevant passage, the Eighth Circuit noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-270\">\n   The Client Guide gives Residential \"sole discretion\" to determine whether an Event of Default has occurred, and Terrace agreed to buy back the loan if Residential determined as much. There is nothing ambiguous about this language.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   <em>\n    Terrace II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070616\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/910/\">\n    725 F.3d at 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted). In other words, as just described, Section 113(B) gives RFC sole discretion to determine breaches, and Defendants contractually agreed to certain remedies in the event that RFC made such determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   Admittedly, the Client Guide gives RFC considerable discretion to act and wide-ranging remedies. But as the Eighth Circuit has stated, Defendants here have \"identifie[d] no ambiguity in the language of the contract which would permit us to look beyond its plain language.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070616\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/910/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Syncora\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201135007\">\n    2011 WL 1135007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5, addressed a similarly expansive contract, explaining that \"[t]he Operative Documents grant especially broad rights and remedies to Syncora because, as the financial guarantor under an unconditional and irrevocable insurance policy, it bears the greatest loss if the loans underperform and the other parties break their contractual obligations.\" The contract here was one that several sophisticated entities willingly signed.

(Pls.' Mem. at 11.) They point out that Section A212 of the Client Guide provides that RFC \"has the right to control any litigation or governmental proceeding related to a Loan, including but not limited to ....\n   <em>\n    making settlement decisions\n   </em>\n   .\" (Client Guide \u00a7 A212 (emphasis added).) And \"making settlement decisions,\" according to Plaintiffs, is a \"determination of fact or a decision to act\" that Section 113(B) of the Client Guide empowers RFC to make in its \"sole discretion.\" (Pls.' Mem. at 12.) Thus, Plaintiffs argue, Defendants may not challenge RFC's settlement decisions at all and Plaintiffs need not show that the Settlements were reasonable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   Defendants disagree. They contend that Plaintiffs misread the Client Guide, as the language of Section A212 merely \"gives RFC 'the right to control' the litigation, including 'choosing defense counsel and making settlement decisions,' \" (Defs.' Opp'n at 9), but in no way precludes Defendants\n   from later challenging the reasonableness of a settlement pursuant to the principle of Minnesota law that \"a party seeking indemnity for a pre-trial settlement must prove not only the existence of indemnifiable claims, but also the reasonableness of the settlement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   This Court agrees with Defendants.

The contract language on which Plaintiffs rely provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-277\">\n   Except for notices for reimbursement, [ ]RFC is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   required to give Client notice of any litigation ... that may trigger indemnification obligations....

As relevant here, the import of this language is twofold. First, as Plaintiffs point out, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Reply at 8-9), Defendants waived notice of any litigation that could trigger indemnification obligations of the type asserted here. Although no Minnesota precedent addressing notice in these precise circumstances has been called to this Court's attention, the general rule is that an indemnitee's duty, if any, to provide notice to an indemnitor is discerned from the express language of the indemnity provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Iowa July 19, 1999) (\"[T]he general rule is that an indemnitee is not required to provide notice ... to the indemnitor under an indemnification contract, unless the contract itself requires notification ....\"). Here, the unambiguous terms of the indemnity contract provide that RFC did not need to notify Defendants of any litigation or proceeding that may trigger indemnification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   Second, the indemnity provision on which RFC relies gives RFC the sole discretion to\n   <em>\n    enter\n   </em>\n   into settlements that would trigger Defendants' duty to indemnify. The relevant language of Section A212 gave RFC the \"right to control any litigation ... related to a Loan, including ... making settlement decisions.\" Interpreted in tandem with Section 113(B), this clause unambiguously gives RFC the power, and discretion, to control litigation, such that RFC need not consult with Defendants when making any litigation-related decisions, including whether to settle or actually litigate any claims related to a loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   It is well-established in Minnesota, however, that a party seeking indemnity for a settlement must show that the settlement was reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brownsdale Coop.

App. 1991) (\"Although notice was not required, the settlement must be reasonable and entered in good faith to be enforceable.\"). Nothing in the Client Guide-and certainly nothing in the provision on which Plaintiffs rely-overrides this principle. While this Court finds that the Client Guide grants RFC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   sole discretion to settle without notice to the indemnitor, the Client Guide does not grant RFC sole discretion to determine the reasonableness of the Settlements. Accordingly, as the party seeking indemnity, RFC has the burden of proving that the Settlements were reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that, even if they do not have sole discretion to determine the reasonableness of the Settlements, this Court should hold that no reasonable juror could find otherwise and that, therefore, the Settlements were reasonable as a matter of law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. at 15.) Plaintiffs argue that the Settlements \"meet the standard for approval under Minnesota law, which asks whether a reasonably prudent person would have entered into the settlements based upon the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying merits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants disagree, contending that their rebuttal of Plaintiffs' experts \"raise triable issues of fact as to whether RFC can meet its burden of proving reasonableness.\" (Defs.' Opp'n at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   In his opinion on the reasonableness of RFC's Settlements, Plaintiffs' expert Donald Hawthorne describes RFC's business model, the underlying litigation, the Settlements, and RFC's bankruptcy. (Scheck Decl., Ex. 19 (Corr. Hawthorne Rpt. \u00b6\u00b6 16-29, 463).) Among other things, in formulating his opinion, Hawthorne evaluates RFC's representations that gave rise to liability, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the underlying claims and defenses, the cost of litigating the underlying claims, various settlement benchmarks in similar cases, and the settling parties' good faith in reaching the Settlements. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 164-462.) Hawthorne notes that the Settlements for which RFC seeks recovery here were \"the product of arms-length negotiation and mediation,\" and were \"approved as reasonable by the Bankruptcy Court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 463.) Ultimately, he concludes at the end of his 236-page report that the Settlements were reasonable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   Defendants disagree. They dispute Hawthorne's opinion on reasonableness, pointing in particular to RFC's settlement with MBIA. This settlement was \"facially unreasonable,\" Defendants contend, because RFC settled with MBIA for allowed claims that exceeded MBIA's losses by over one billion dollars. (Defs.' Opp'n at 10-11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. at 78-85.) In addition to singling out the MBIA Settlement as one basis for denying summary judgment to Plaintiffs, Defendants affirmatively seek summary judgment that the MBIA Settlement was unreasonable and therefore not indemnifiable. (Defs.' Mem. at 78-85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   In making their calculations challenging the reasonableness of the MBIA Settlement, Defendants include MBIA's separate settlements with GMAC Mortgage and ResCap LLC, in the total amount, arguing that they are related to MBIA's claims on the RFC-sponsored trusts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80.) Asserting that Plaintiffs' experts \"ignore that the MBIA [S]ettlement provided MBIA with allowed claims against ResCap and GMACM on the same RFC-sponsored trusts,\" Defendants contend that the total amount of allowed claims that MBIA obtained for RFC-sponsored trusts exceeded MBIA's total losses on those trusts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81.) They maintain that MBIA essentially obtained a double recovery, rendering the MBIA Settlement facially unreasonable.

At oral argument, counsel for Defendants suggested that the parties could, before trial, submit evidence to the Court on the issue of reasonableness such that the question would not need to be decided by a jury. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 19 Hr'g Tr. at 55-56 (\"There is Minnesota authority saying that that factual decision can be made by the Court rather than by the jury.

The Court has asked for supplemental briefing on this issue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order for Suppl. Briefing [Doc. No. 4128].) Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiffs' summary judgment motion on the reasonableness of the Settlements and denies Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to indemnification for the MBIA Settlement.

(Pls.' Mem. at 16.) Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that Section A212 expressly provides for indemnification from all \"judgments,\" \"liabilities,\" and \"claim[s]\" against or involving RFC-terms that all encompass the Allowed Claims.

(Pls.' Reply at 10-12.) First, they contend that the only grammatical reading of the clause is that Defendants would indemnify RFC \"\n   <em>\n    from all losses\n   </em>\n   , damages ..., judgments ...;\n   <em>\n    or from any claim\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.) And this reading, Plaintiffs contend, clearly distinguishes \"losses\" from \"claims,\" i.e., liabilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Second, they argue, even the pre-December 2005 language included indemnification for \"judgments,\" a term, as described above, that includes liabilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   Defendants take a contrary view. First, they disagree with Plaintiffs' contention that the term \"any claim\" is distinct from the term \"losses.\" (Defs.' Opp'n at 13.) Rather, they argue, \"any claim\" is merely a subset of \"losses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Second, and relatedly, they contend that Section A212 was amended in December of 2005 precisely to\n   <em>\n    add\n   </em>\n   indemnity for \"liabilities,\" a term that is notably absent from the pre-December 2005 Client Guide, although they cite no factual evidence to support that contention. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   In the beginning of this case, the Court considered the same arguments that the parties advance now, but in the context of a motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 16, 2015 Am. Order at 17.) At that juncture, the Court found the pre-December 2005 language to be \"sufficiently ambiguous to prevent resolution of th[e] issue on a motion to dismiss\" and thus permitted the parties to conduct discovery. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) Now, at the summary judgment stage, the parties again raise the issue, but alert the Court that they have no extrinsic evidence to present. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 19 Hr'g Tr. at 156 (counsel for Defendants indicating that there was no extrinsic evidence);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 186 (same) ). Accordingly, the issue is one for the Court to determine as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mervin v. Magney Const.

First, Section A212 has always included indemnity for judgments as well as actual losses. As described above, indemnity for judgments necessarily encompasses the Allowed Claims in this case. Second, the language \"the Client shall indemnify ...\n   <em>\n    from all losses\n   </em>\n   ...;\n   <em>\n    or from any claim\n   </em>\n   \" seems clearly to distinguish losses from claims. Defendants' contrary interpretation-that \"claim\" is a subset of \"losses\"-is simply an ungrammatical construction, which this Court declines to adopt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brookfield Trade Ctr., Inc. v.

As described, the pre-December 2005 Guide included\n   <em>\n    claims\n   </em>\n   , which denote\n   liability. To be sure, the contract was later amended to expressly include \"liabilities,\" but this Court is persuaded this change only served to\n   <em>\n    clarify\n   </em>\n   the language rather than to materially alter the terms of the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   Likewise, this Court is unpersuaded by Defendants' argument that it must construe the provision against Plaintiffs because RFC drafted the contract. \"[T]his rule has less application as between parties of equal bargaining power or sophistication.\"\n   <em>\n    Re-Sols.

Accordingly, it grants Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   Alternatively, this Court also holds that Plaintiffs are entitled to indemnity for liabilities under Section A202(II) of the Client Guide. Section A202(II), titled \"Loan Securitization,\" provides that Defendants \"recognize[d] that it [wa]s [ ]RFC's intent to securitize some or all of the Loans sold to [ ]RFC by [Defendants],\" and \"agree[d] to provide [ ]RFC with all such information concerning the [Defendants] generally ... as may be reasonably requested by [ ]RFC for inclusion in a prospectus or private placement memorandum published in connection with such securitization.\" (Client Guide \u00a7 A202(II).) This provision further states that Defendants would \"cooperate in a similar manner with [ ]RFC in connection with any whole Loan sale or other disposition of any Loan sold to [ ]RFC by [Defendants].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Immediately after these provisions, Section A202(II) provides that Defendants \"agree[d]\" to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-314\">\n   indemnify and hold [ ]RFC harmless from and against any loss, damage, ... reasonable attorneys' fees, judgment, ... or\n   <em>\n    liability incurred\n   </em>\n   by [ ]RFC as a result of any material misstatement in or omission from any information provided by the Client to [ ]RFC; or from any\n   <em>\n    claim, demand, defense or assertion\n   </em>\n   against or involving [ ]RFC based on or grounded upon, or resulting from such misstatement or omission or a breach of any representation, warranty or obligation made by [ ]RFC in reliance upon such misstatement or omission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphases added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that this provision has two separate clauses obligating Defendants\n   to indemnify RFC for its liabilities. (Pls.' Mem. at 17.) First, Plaintiffs contend, Section A202(II) includes indemnification for \"liability incurred,\" which encompasses the Allowed Claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Second, they again point to the words \"claim,\" \"demand,\" and \"assertion,\" all which \"denote[ ] indemnification of liability.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Trapp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10666596\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/359/323/#p328\">\n    359 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   327 ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   Defendants do not dispute Plaintiffs' textual arguments. They dispute, however, that Section A202(II) applies to the facts of this case. (Defs.' Opp'n at 14.) Defendants contend that Plaintiffs' reliance on Section A202(II) is altogether misplaced, as that clause does not apply to indemnity for alleged breaches of loan-level R &amp; Ws, but rather deals exclusively with Defendants' obligation to indemnify RFC for losses or liabilities associated with any misrepresentation/omission of information that Defendants were required to provide to RFC about\n   <em>\n    themselves\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   Defendants read Section A202(II) too narrowly. Here, the unambiguous language of Section A202(II) states that Defendants agreed to indemnify RFC for \"\n   <em>\n    any ... liability incurred\n   </em>\n   by [ ]RFC as a result of any material misstatement in or omission from\n   <em>\n    any information\n   </em>\n   provided by [Defendants] to [ ]RFC.\" (Client Guide \u00a7 A202(II).) Simply, the limitation Defendants advocate for is not present in the language of the contract. As Plaintiffs contend, \" '[a]ny' is the broadest possible term.\" (Pls.' Reply at 10.) Indeed, as the Eighth Circuit has reasoned, \"[u]nless 'any' does not mean\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   ... we see nothing equivocal about this provision.\"\n   <em>\n    Harleysville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3570361\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/451/#p457\">\n    716 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   458 (citing\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   97 (1993) (defining \"any\" as \"one, no matter what one\").) Section A202(II) provides that Defendants would indemnify RFC for any claims or liabilities \"incurred by [ ]RFC as a result of any material misstatement in or omission from any information provided by the Client to [ ]RFC,\" and thus presents an alternative avenue through which RFC may seek indemnity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Recovery for All Losses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   To avoid redundancy, the Court addresses this issue in the context of its discussion of Dr. Snow's proposed Breaching Loss Approach,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , Section III.G.3. In accordance with that reasoning, Plaintiffs' summary judgment motion as to recovery of all losses resulting from Defendants' breaches is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   Plaintiffs next move for summary judgment on three issues related to causation. First, they ask this Court to \"grant summary judgment\n   <em>\n    interpreting the [Client] Guide\n   </em>\n   , as a matter of law, to provide that Plaintiffs need only establish 'a causal connection' between Defendants' breaches and the liabilities and losses that RFC incurred in the Settlements\"-or, in other words, that the legal standard for causation for indemnification under the Client Guide is \"but for\" cause rather than \"proximate cause.\" (Pls.' Mem. at 27 (emphasis added).) Second, they ask this Court to hold, as a matter of law, that they have met their burden of proving \"but for\" causation, as \"there is no genuine dispute that RFC's potential liability to the RMBS Trusts and Monolines, and thus the resulting Settlements, were caused by Defendants' underwriting breaches.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, they ask this Court to dismiss Defendants' \"affirmative defenses that RFC's actions or other 'superseding and intervening factors' may\n   have contributed to RFC's liabilities, because RFC need show only that Defendants' breaches were a 'but for' cause of those liabilities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28.) Each issue is discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Applicable Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   As described, the Client Guide requires Defendants to indemnify RFC against,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , losses and liabilities: \"\n   <em>\n    resulting from\n   </em>\n   any Event of Default\" or \"\n   <em>\n    arising from\n   </em>\n   ... any breach of [R &amp; Ws],\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Client Guide \u00a7 A212 (emphasis added) ), or \"incurred ...\n   <em>\n    as a result\n   </em>\n   of any material misstatement in or omission from any information provided by [Defendants] to [ ]RFC,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 A202(II) ). Plaintiffs argue that under Minnesota law, \"each of these formulations-'as a result of,' 'resulting from,' and 'arising from'-is synonymous,\" and denotes a \"but-for causal connection, not a proximate cause.\" (Pls.' Mem. at 28.) Accordingly, Plaintiffs argue, they need not prove that Defendants' breaches were the\n   <em>\n    sole\n   </em>\n   cause of RFC's losses and liabilities; rather, they need only prove that \"Defendants' breaches were a contributing cause.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   Defendants contend that \"[i]n Minnesota, as elsewhere, it is black-letter law that a contract plaintiff must prove the defendant's breach\n   <em>\n    proximately caused\n   </em>\n   its damages,\" and that \"nothing in the Client Guide displaces this bedrock rule.\" (Defs.' Opp'n at 31.) In the alternative, they contend that even if only a \"causal connection\" is needed under the contract, \"something more than\n   <em>\n    literal\n   </em>\n   but-for causation is necessary to find that an injury 'arose out of' a particular event.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Capitol Indem.

Minn. 2014).) In any event, Defendants contend, \"[t]he Court need not decide the precise test for causation, ... as RFC's motion fails under any conceivable standard.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   At the outset, the Court underscores that its focus is on the narrow issue on which Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment-the causation standard\n   <em>\n    under the Client Guide's indemnity provisions\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, as a preliminary matter, the Court rejects Defendants' contention that the common law breach of contract standard of proximate cause applies. Defendants generally conflate the causation requirement required for a breach of contract claim with the causation standard under the Client Guide's indemnity provisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"In contractual indemnity, liability is controlled by the provisions of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    N.

A contrary conclusion would, in effect, entirely absolve Defendants of their contracted-for obligation to indemnify Plaintiffs for losses and liabilities that resulted from\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   breaches because no breach allegedly would be material. Defendants understood and expressly acknowledged that their loans would be bundled with other originators' loans, so they may not now claim that they could breach the contract with impunity, with no consequence, because any given loan is not material, rendering this important remedy under the Client Guide superfluous and meaningless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   Nevertheless, Defendants do highlight a potential issue with\n   <em>\n    allocation\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    calculation\n   </em>\n   of damages. To be sure, an individual Defendant may only be held liable for the portion of the Settlements reasonably calculated as \"flowing from\" or \"originating from\" its own breaches. But this inquiry is analytically distinct from causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mastercraft Furniture, Inc. v. Saba N. Am., LLC\n   </em>\n   , Civ.

Genuine Issues of Material Fact Preclude a Finding of Causation as a Matter of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   Plaintiffs urge this Court to hold, as a matter of law, that Defendants' underwriting breaches were a contributing cause of RFC's potential liability to the RMBS Trusts and Monolines, and thus of the resulting Settlements. (Pls.' Mem. at 27.) They contend that the undisputed evidence confirms that the claims that the RMBS Trusts and Monolines asserted against RFC were all \"based on defects in the loans that Defendants originated and sold to RFC.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31.) In support of that assertion, Plaintiffs point to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-339\">\n   (1) the re-underwriting analysis that the RMBS Trustees' financial advisor, Duff &amp; Phelps, conducted to \"determine\" the \"RMBS R+W Claims,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   and which was intended to \"identify breaches of representations and warranties made by the Debtors,\" (Scheck Decl., Ex. 46 (Pfeiffer Decl. \u00b6 18) );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-340\">\n   (2) the testimony of Lewis Kruger, RFC's Chief Restructuring Officer who bound RFC to the Settlements, that his \"impression\"-based on \"extensive review of the claims asserted in RFC's bankruptcy case, the litigation over the Original RMBS Settlement, and RFC's own expert's analysis of the claims,\" (Pls.' Mem. at 31-32)-was that \"the claims [of the RMBS Trusts] were primarily related to breach of contract claims for [R &amp; Ws],\" (Scheck Decl., Ex. 47 (Kruger Dep. at 160, 225-26) );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-341\">\n   (3) the testimony of the Debtors' lead bankruptcy counsel, Gary Lee, who purportedly shared Kruger's view that the R &amp; W claims \"were primarily at issue,\" (Pls.'

Mem. at 32) (quoting Scheck Decl., Ex. 28 (Bankr. Findings of Fact \u00b6 106).)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   Defendants counter that genuine issues of material fact preclude a ruling on summary judgment on causation. First, they argue that RFC's causation theory is fundamentally flawed, as it \"improperly treats unaffiliated 'Defendants' as if they were joint actors and implies that each should be held liable if, as a group, they collectively caused RFC's aggregate losses or liabilities.\" (Defs.' Opp'n at 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   Here, as a preliminary matter, the Court disagrees with Defendants' contention that RFC impermissibly \"lumps\" all Defendants together under a joint liability theory, warranting denial of summary judgment on causation for that reason alone. The Court does not understand Plaintiffs to be attempting to hold Defendants \"jointly liable.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.) As the Court discussed in the context of the applicable causation standard under the Client Guide, (\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   , Section III.F.3.a), each Defendant agreed to indemnify RFC for losses\n   and liabilities that have a \"causal connection\" to its particular breaches. The amount of damages for which each Defendant may ultimately be held liable is properly considered an allocation issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   Nevertheless, this Court agrees with Defendants that the parties' experts raise genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment on causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ingram v. Syverson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9295336\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/674/233/#p237\">\n    674 N.W.2d 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 237 (Minn. Ct. App. 2004) (\"Where reasonable minds can differ on the issue of causation, the [factfinder] should resolve the issue, and it would be error to grant summary judgment.\"). For example, one such disputed factual issue that Defendants raise in opposition to Plaintiffs' causation argument concerns liability as to RFC's underlying pool-wide representations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n at 36.) Defendants also raise this issue affirmatively in their summary judgment motion, in the context of whether Plaintiffs may obtain damages for claims based on underlying breaches of pool-wide representations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. at 71-78.) In either context, the analysis is essentially the same, as discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the claims that the RMBS Trusts and Monolines asserted against RFC were\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   based on Defendants' breaches of underwriting guidelines. (Pls.' Mem. at 30-31.) Defendants counter, however, that an originator could breach a representation to RFC without that breach resulting in any breach of RFC's separate trust representations. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' Opp'n at 35.) As a result of this \"gap,\" Defendants argue, they cannot be found to be a contributing cause of some of the claims asserted against RFC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9295336\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/674/233/#p237\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-347\">\n   Moreover, Defendant Home Loan Center's expert, Steven Schwarcz, opines that RFC gave \"trust-level underwriting representations,\" i.e., represented that the loans were underwritten in substantial compliance with the Client Guide, to only 17 out of the more than 500 Trusts. (Decl. of Sascha N. Rand (\"Rand Decl.\") [Doc. No. 3256], Ex. 22 (Schwarcz Rpt. \u00b6 63).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Defendants argue, their breaches of underwriting guidelines have no causal connection to the claims asserted against RFC by the Trusts that did not receive trust-level underwriting representations. (Defs.' Opp'n at 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-348\">\n   RFC responds that although only 17 Trusts may have received \"explicit\" underwriting representations, \"there were other important representations that were dependent on Defendants' compliance with the Guide,\" including the pool-wide representations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Reply at 22.) In such instances, instead of giving explicit underwriting representations, RFC represented to settling Trusts that RFC's pooled loans met particular \"Credit Grade\" requirements, and classified these loans, by percentages of the pool, into specific Credit Grades (\"Credit Grade R &amp; Ws\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pls.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-349\">\n   Opp'n. at 41; Defs.' Mem. at 72.) Additionally, in some instances, RFC represented that its pooled loans were underwritten to either a full documentation program or a reduced documentation program, (\"Documentation Program R &amp; Ws\"), and that no more than a certain percentage of loans were underwritten to the reduced documentation program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pls.' Opp'n. at 41; Defs.' Mem. at 72.) Defendants assert that RFC made pool-wide Credit Grade R &amp; Ws to 70 of the 506 Settling Trusts, and pool-wide Documentation Program R &amp; Ws to 244 of 506 settling trusts. (Defs.' Mem. at 73 (citing Smallwood Decl., Ex. 34 (Schwarcz Rpt. \u00b6\u00b6 68, 75) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-350\">\n   As noted, Section A212 provides for indemnification for RFC's breaches if they are \"based on or resulting from\" Defendants' breaches. (Client Guide \u00a7 A212.) The Client Guide required that Defendants' loans meet RFC's quality standards, which required the \"credit, character, capacity and collateral\" to be \"consistent with the Loan Program and credit grade\" under which the loan was sold to RFC. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9295336\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/674/233/#p237\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Ch. 4, p. 4.1) In addition, the Client Guide included detailed tables containing the criteria necessary to meet each credit grade and documentation program.

At the outset, the Court underscores that it reads Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on this issue as necessarily pertaining only to its indemnity claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Opp'n at 37.) Relying on breach-of-warranty cases, Defendants argue that \"[w]here the record shows that there are several possible causes of an injury, for one or more of which the defendant was not responsible, and it is just as reasonable and probable that the injury was the result of the latter, the plaintiff may not recover.\" (Defs.'

The standard agreed to by the parties is whether Defendants' breaches were a contributing cause of RFC's losses and liabilities. In that inquiry, whether other causes-such as macroeconomic factors-were also a contributing cause is irrelevant. In essence, Defendants seek to argue that they should be absolved of their duty to indemnify, despite their breaches, because other factors, including unforeseeable circumstances and market forces over which they have no control, were superseding, intervening causes of the losses and liabilities incurred by RFC.

Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiffs' summary judgment motion dismissing any defenses that allege that superseding, intervening causes absolve Defendants from their duty to indemnify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-365\">\n   Next, Defendants argue that the second category of defenses-that RFC's claims are barred because their losses and damages \"were caused by RFC's own acts or omissions\"-should not be dismissed because Defendants have identified \"claims based on breaches of RFC's representations to [T]rusts for which RFC was solely responsible.\" (Defs.'

Opp'n at 37.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Defendants' expert Steven Schwarcz, some of RFC's breaches of the R &amp; Ws it made to the Trusts and Monolines do not overlap with Defendants' breaches of the R &amp; Ws they made to RFC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Smallwood Decl., Ex. 34 (Schwarcz Rpt., \u00b6\u00b6 114-27).) In those circumstances, Defendants argue, their breaches are not even a contributing cause of RFC's losses and liabilities. (Defs.' Mem. at 32.) The three areas of non-overlap that Schwarcz identifies are (1) any breach of RFC's R &amp; Ws concerning RFC's own legal status, i.e. authorization or corporate capacity, rather than the characteristics of the loans; (2) any breach of RFC's representation that loans were underwritten pursuant to the standards in the Client Guide, when applied to loans for which RFC had granted originating banks an exception to the Client Guide's underwriting standards; and (3) any loss due to events that occurred (e.g., borrower loses his job) after the effective date of the originating bank's R &amp; Ws (i.e., after RFC's purchase of the loan). (Smallwood Decl., Ex. 34 (Schwarz Rpt. \u00a7\u00a7 114-27).) As to this third area of nonoverlap, Defendants explain that \"[t]o the extent an event that occurred between RFC's loan purchase and a securitization's closing caused a breach of RFC's representations to the Trusts (e.g., borrowers defaulting), that breach could not have resulted from an originator breach.\" (Defs.' Mem. at 33.) Plaintiffs respond that Schwarcz speculates as to these RFC \"sole cause\" hypotheses without citing any evidence from the record to support his arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-366\">\n   On this record, the Court finds that summary judgment as to Defendants' \"sole cause\" defense at this stage would be premature. The Court will defer ruling as to the admissibility of Schwarcz's testimony on these issues, pending the development of the factual record, to evaluate whether there is evidence in the record, presumably supplied by fact witnesses to support his hypothetical argument. Accordingly, at\n   this time, the Court denies Plaintiffs' summary judgment motion as to the sole cause defense without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-367\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Affirmative Defenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-368\">\n   Plaintiffs next move for summary judgment on certain \"affirmative\" defenses. They argue that this Court should interpret the Client Guide, as a matter of law, as requiring dismissal of Defendants': (1) defense of estoppel; (2) \"knowledge- and reliance-based defenses\"; (3) waiver defenses based on RFC's \"Assetwise\" system; and (4) defense of good faith and fair dealing.

Defendants disagree, and in their Defendant-specific responses, assert that RFC should,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , be \"estopped from arguing that the Client Guide underwriting criteria governed [Defendants'] sale of loans to RFC.\" (HLC Opp'n to Pls.'

HLC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-373\">\n   HLC argues that RFC, in order to effectuate its goal of buying an increasing number of HLC loans, sidestepped the requirements of the Client Guide using \"three principal strategies.\" (HLC Opp'n at 1.) First, HLC argues, RFC agreed to purchase loans approved by Assetwise, RFC's \" 'black box' automated underwriting system, ... which offered advantageous variations from the Client Guide.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to HLC, although its initial \"Client Contracts\" with RFC required it to sell loans to RFC underwritten to the Client Guide, a subsequent agreement-the Assetwise Direct Criteria Agreement (\"AW Agreement\")-allowed and encouraged HLC to sell RFC more loans by underwriting them utilizing RFC's automated underwriting program, Assetwise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) This agreement, according to HLC,\n   specified certain representations that continued to be HLC's responsibility, but that \"absent ... was any representation that a loan complied with all Client Guide requirements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In essence, HLC argues that RFC and HLC entered into a \"pact\" whereby RFC would \"buy HLC loans pursuant to Assetwise approvals whether or not they complied with the Client Guide.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) HLC cites to RFC repurchase personnel testifying that if Assetwise approved a loan, it \"meant RFC would purchase [it]\" so long as \"all the information that was input was correct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (citing Smallwood HLC Decl. [Doc. No. 3620], Ex. 14 (Whealdon Dep. at 161).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-374\">\n   Second, according to HLC, RFC bought loans that HLC originated for RFC competitors in \"bulk\" packages that RFC knew were prepared for other buyers and per those buyers' underwriting guidelines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) As just one example, HLC asserts that after RFC bought its first \"bulk\" pool from HLC, RFC asked: \"Can you send me the current underwriting guidelines that were used for the Home Equity deal we just purchased?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (citing Smallwood HLC Decl., Ex. 16 (Dep. Ex. 262-0014 to Forget Dep.).) HLC contends that it did not send the Client Guide, but rather sent the Countrywide-based guidelines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (citing Smallwood HLC Decl., Ex. 18 (Weiler Dep. at 364).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-375\">\n   And finally, HLC argues, RFC bought loans that HLC originated through \"Clues,\" the automated underwriting system of RFC's competitor, Countrywide. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10662015\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/411/1/#p4\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10662015\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/411/1/#p4\">\n    at 7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) As just one example of this practice, HLC asserts that \"[a]n RFC trader e-mailed that RFC 'will stand behind buying the Clues approval' \" when buying loans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8) (citing Smallwood Decl., Ex. 35 (Dep. Ex. 262-0026 to Forget Dep.).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-376\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that HLC's evidence is insufficient to create a triable issue of fact on equitable estoppel, which requires a showing that RFC \" 'misrepresented a material fact or was silent when it had a duty to speak,' \" and that \"Defendants 'reasonably relied' on it.\" (Pls.' Reply at 43-45) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Slidell, Inc. v.

At most, RFC argues, HLC's evidence shows RFC's \"knowledge\" or \"acknowledgement\" that the Client Guide did not apply to certain loans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Specifically, as to the evidence related to Assetwise approvals and loans underwritten to third-party loan parameters, RFC argues that it \"at most suggests that RFC sometimes made internal business decisions to buy loans outside the Guide,\" but that \"[n]one of the evidence shows an agreement by RFC that HLC did not have to comply with the Guide.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46.) And with respect to evidence relating to bulk purchases, RFC contends that it at most shows \"RFC's awareness that other loan parameters may have been used to underwrite certain loans,\" but that it does not suggest that RFC would refrain from exercising its rights under the Client Guide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In fact, RFC argues, although HLC's highlights two internal RFC emails stating that some bulk purchases included loans underwritten to third-party parameters, the contracts governing those transactions \"state that the variances RFC granted to HLC\" were still subject to the Client Guide's terms and conditions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-377\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Standard Pacific and CTX\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-378\">\n   For their part, Standard Pacific and CTX jointly argue that RFC should not be permitted to hold them to the requirements of the Client Guide \"when the parties' course of business dealings makes crystal clear that the Client Guide does not apply to the at-issue loans.\" (Standard Pac.-CTX Opp'n at 1.) As to the parties' course of business dealings, Standard Pacific and CTX point to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , RFC's\n   practice of buying loans\n   <em>\n    en masse\n   </em>\n   through a \"bulk\" online auction process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Through this auction process, RFC would obtain \"bid tapes\" that, according to these Defendants, plainly disclosed that some of the loans were not underwritten to the Client Guide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (citing Decl. of Enza Boderone (\"Boderone Decl.\") [Doc. No. 3589], Ex. 2 (Siats Dep. at 58) (agreeing that a seller \"would disclose which underwriting guidelines the loans were underwritten to when it was offering the pool for sale\").) And after placing a winning bid, Defendants argue, RFC would perform \"additional, independent due diligence on the loans,\" which revealed not only the applicable guidelines, but also the specific characteristics of the loans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-379\">\n   Moreover, Standard Pacific and CTX argue, \"the loan files in RFC's possession contained loan approvals that often underscored again the guidelines used to underwrite the loan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) These loan approvals included \"Automated Underwriting System\" (\"AUS\") approvals \"showing that a loan had been approved under another company's AUS after that loan's characteristics had been entered into the system.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In sum, Standard Pacific and CTX argue that \"[RFC] is now seeking to enforce remedies under the Client Guide despite years of acknowledgment-in deposition testimony, in AUS approvals in the loan files, and in RFC worksheets in the loan files-that Client Guide guidelines did not apply.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-380\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that, at most, Standard Pacific and CTX's evidence-evidence that Plaintiffs argue is inadmissible and mischaracterized-shows RFC's knowledge or acknowledgement that the loans were not underwritten to the Client Guide, but that knowledge or acknowledgment are insufficient for equitable estoppel. (Pls.' Reply at 43-44.) For instance, RFC argues that the \"bid tapes\" and \"AUS approvals\" that Standard Pacific and CTX reference were contained in RFC's\n   <em>\n    internal\n   </em>\n   deliberations that Defendants have not shown RFC communicated to them.

Mem. at 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-386\">\n   As Plaintiffs describe it, \"Assetwise was a tool that [RFC's] seller clients used ... to grade and slot their loans for eligibility to submit to RFC for sale.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Scheck Decl., Ex. 50 (Edstrom Dep. at 137).) The Client Guide itself states that \"[b]y utilizing Assetwise, the Client can submit Loans electronically and receive a[n RFC] credit grade and program determination (slot) within a matter of minutes. Loans evaluated by Assetwise and approved by the Client may receive a streamlined review process when submitted to [RFC] for purchase.\" (Client Guide \u00a7 G401(A).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-387\">\n   After clients entered particular loan data into Assetwise, the program would produce an \"Assetwise Findings Report.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Scheck Decl., Ex. 51 (Example Assetwise Findings Rpt. at 1).) This report contained a \"Recommendation\" as to whether RFC should approve the loan.

Mem. at 36.) First, Plaintiffs point to the Client Guide's clause expressly requiring that any waivers be documented in writing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Client Guide Section A209(B) provides that \"[RFC] may waive any default ... only by a written waiver specifying the nature and terms of such waiver.\" Second, they contend that the Client Guide expressly contemplated the use of Assetwise, and, in fact, in unambiguous, express language, provided that: (1) \"Clients who use Assetwise\n   <em>\n    are still bound by the representations and warranties as set forth in this Client Guide\n   </em>\n   ;\" (2) the \"use of Assetwise\n   <em>\n    does not relieve Clients\n   </em>\n   of Loan eligibility and\n   <em>\n    underwriting requirements\n   </em>\n   set forth in th[e] Client Guide;\" and (3) each \"Loan must conform to Program Criteria ... [and] Clients are responsible to ensure the Loan conforms to [RFC]'s guidelines.\" (Client Guide \u00a7 G401(B)-(C) ) (emphasis added). Faced with these provisions, Plaintiffs argue, \"[n]o reasonable factfinder could conclude that Assetwise constituted or granted a written waiver of breaches.\" (Pls.' Mem. at 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-389\">\n   Plaintiffs further contend that these Client Guide provisions \"were reinforced\" by the fact that the Assetwise Findings Reports indicated only a \"recommendation\" as to whether the loan would be approved, rather than an express waiver of Client Guide requirements or a promise to purchase. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.) Moreover, they contend that in\n   <em>\n    Terrace II\n   </em>\n   , the Eighth Circuit \"affirmed enforcement of the Guide provision stating that breaches may be waived only in writing, and rejected a course of conduct argument to the contrary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) They urge this Court to reach the same conclusion as to Defendants' Assetwise waiver defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-390\">\n   Defendants argue that RFC is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this defense because its use of Assetwise constitutes a waiver of enforcing the Client Guide as to certain loans. Defendants first argue that the Client Guide's requirement that all waivers be in writing is not dispositive, because, as recognized by the Eighth Circuit, \"Minnesota courts have held that despite a contract's requirement that a waiver be in writing, certain provisions of the contract may be waived even if they are not in writing.\" (Defs.' Opp'n at 41) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Slidell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674325\" index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/460/1047/#p1053\">\n    460 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1055 ). And here, Defendants argue, RFC's \"documented practice of accepting Assetwise-approved loans even where the loans did not comply with certain Client Guide requirements\" constitutes waiver of the Client Guide provision expressly stating that clients who use Assetwise are still bound by the representations and warranties set forth in the Client Guide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-391\">\n   HLC filed a Defendant-specific response addressing Assetwise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   HLC raises two distinct arguments in opposition. First, it argues that it sold Assetwise-approved loans to RFC not pursuant to the Client Guide, but pursuant to the Assetwise Direct Criteria Agreement (\"AW Agreement\") that the parties entered into in June of 2002. (HLC Opp'n at 2.) According to HLC, although its initial \"Client Contracts\" with RFC permitted it to sell loans to RFC underwritten to the Client Guide, the AW Agreement allowed and encouraged HLC to sell RFC more loans by underwriting them using Assetwise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) This AW Agreement, according to HLC, specified certain representations\n   that continued to be HLC's responsibility, but that absent from the requirements \"was any representation that a loan complied with all Client Guide requirements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In essence, HLC argues that the AW Agreement supersedes the Client Guide's requirements with respect to representations and warranties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-392\">\n   Second, HLC argues that even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that the parties had not entered into the AW Agreement, the parties' course of conduct, i.e., RFC's \"acceptance of Assetwise approvals,\" was inconsistent with the Client Guide and therefore constitutes waiver of breaches. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) In support of this argument, HLC claims that: (1) RFC represented to HLC that it could rely on Assetwise approvals, which HLC characterizes as wholly synonymous with RFC's agreement to buy a loan; (2) RFC's policy was that Assetwise approvals were valid even though certain loan parameters contained in the Client Guide were not met; and (3) RFC's own loan-level \"due diligence\" shows that it manually approved loans that deviated from the Client Guide if those loans were approved by Assetwise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-393\">\n   On this record, the Court denies in part and grants in part Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on Defendants' waiver defense based on Assetwise. Although the Court notes that it does not view it as an issue of \"waiver\" per se, but rather estoppel, it concludes that HLC has raised a triable issue of fact as to whether the AW Agreement superseded the Client Guide. While HLC contends that the AW Agreement controls with respect to the representations and warranties for which HLC was responsible, RFC's expert Richard Payne opines that the AW Agreement was \"purely a licensing agreement\" that in no way \"waive[d] RFC's rights under the Client Guide.\" (Smallwood HLC Decl., Ex. 43 (Payne Dep. at 108-09).) The Court cannot resolve that dispute on summary judgment. Accordingly, it will be a fact question for the jury whether the AW Agreement between HLC and RFC superseded the Client Guide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-394\">\n   The Court, however, finds that HLC has failed to raise a triable issue of fact that Plaintiffs' use of Assetwise constitutes a blanket waiver of the requirements of the Client Guide. As the parties point out, under Minnesota law, \"[w]aiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right.\"\n   <em>\n    Frandsen v.

First, it relies heavily on a document labeled \"Revised Credit Policy Issue # 10\" that describes RFC's internal practice of accepting loans approved by Assetwise. (Smallwood HLC Decl., Ex. 9 (Ex. 145-0011 to Maki Dep.).) This document states, for instance, that \"[a]n Assetwise approval IS valid even though certain loan parameters outlined in the Client Guide are not met.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Second, it relies on the testimony of Sharon Maki, a former RFC Credit Risk Associate. Maki testified that if Assetwise \"produced\n   ... an approval, then that would constitute an automated loan decision.\" (Smallwood HLC Decl., Ex. 7 (Maki Dep. at 49).) However, if it did not, and the client \"still wanted to sell [RFC] that loan, then that became a manual decision.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When asked about the \"Revised Credit Policy Issue # 10,\" Maki agreed that she understood this policy to mean that if Assetwise recommended a loan for approval, it would be acceptable to RFC notwithstanding any discrepancies with the Client Guide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 154-55.) Maki, however, also testified that regardless of whether or not a particular client used Assetwise, it was still bound by the representations and warranties of the Client Guide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 244.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-396\">\n   HLC also points to the testimony of Julie Hessel, a former RFC underwriter. When asked about the \"Revised Credit Policy Issue # 10,\" and if \"it [wa]s fair to say that an Assetwise approval was valid even though certain loan parameters outlined in the Client Guide were not met,\" Hessel testified that that would be \"depending on which loan parameters we're talking about,\" as it was \"not a blanket statement that all loan parameters would be acceptable.\" (Smallwood HLC Decl., Ex. 10 (Hessel Dep. at 245-46).) Hessel, however, also testified that an Assetwise Findings Report included certain pre-closing conditions and requirements \"[t]o remind the seller that the loan had to be in compliance with our Client Guide.\" (Scheck Decl., Ex. 81 (Hessel Dep. at 224).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-397\">\n   HLC also identifies evidence surrounding RFC's \"loan level diligence\" that it argues \"reflects [RFC's] pact to buy HLC loans pursuant to Assetwise approvals whether or not they complied with the Client Guide.\" (HLC Opp'n at 4.) It relies on RFC's process of utilizing an internal loan boarding and funding system-Caf\u00e9 2.2-that HLC claims RFC used to evaluate whether loans met the Client Guide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Christine Trenholm, a former RFC employee, testified that she would enter loan data into Caf\u00e9 2.2, and that it would sometimes generate a \"pend\" for the loan if certain criteria were not met. (Smallwood HLC Decl., Ex. 11 (Trenholm Dep. at 39-41).) Trenholm indicated that she could clear \"pends\" if the information on the Assetwise report matched up with the documents in the loan file and there was an Assetwise approval. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55.) According to HLC, \"[f]or at-issue HLC loans, Caf\u00e9 2.2 reflects\n   <em>\n    hundreds\n   </em>\n   of 'pended' loans that failed to meet Client Guide requirements but were cleared based on Assetwise approvals.\" (HLC Opp'n at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-398\">\n   This anecdotal evidence is insufficient to raise a triable issue as to whether RFC intended a blanket waiver of its remedies or the provisions of the Client Guide when utilizing Assetwise. And nor could it, as Section G401 of the Client Guide\n   <em>\n    expressly anticipates\n   </em>\n   RFC's use of Assetwise and gives notice to Defendants that they would still be \"bound by the representations and warranties as set forth in th[e] Client Guide,\" even if the parties used Assetwise. (Client Guide \u00a7 G401(B).) In no uncertain terms, this provision states that \"use of Assetwise does not relieve Clients of Loan eligibility and underwriting requirements set forth in this Client Guide.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As such, as Plaintiffs point out, \"RFC's purported knowing purchase of Assetwise-approved loans that deviate from the Guide is not inconsistent with RFC's rights-it is what RFC bargained for.\" (Pls.' Reply at 35.) Accordingly, Defendants are barred-by the contract that the parties signed-from arguing that RFC's purchase of Assetwise-approved loans constitutes a blanket waiver of RFC's rights to enforce the Client Guide and its remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-399\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Knowledge- and Reliance-Based Defenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-400\">\n   Plaintiffs next argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on the following\n   defenses: (1) that \"RFC did not rely on the R &amp; Ws on which Plaintiffs are suing\"; (2) that RFC's \"reliance on Defendants' R &amp; Ws was not reasonable or justified\"; (3) that \"RFC would have purchased loans from Defendants even if it had known about defects\"; and (4) that \"RFC knew of defects prior to sale and purchased loans anyway.\" (Pls.' Mem. at 33-34.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-401\">\n   At the motion to strike stage, this Court denied without prejudice Plaintiffs' motion to strike, or in the alternative, for judgment on the pleadings as to some of the same knowledge- and reliance-base defenses that are at issue here. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 21, 2015 Am. Mem. &amp; Order [Doc. No. 469] at 15.) Specifically, the Court denied without prejudice Plaintiffs' motion with respect to the following defenses: \"(1) because [RFC] would have purchased the loans ... even if it knew the alleged deficiencies in the loan documents, and any alleged deficiencies were not material; (2) because [RFC] did not rely on the representations and warranties on which Plaintiff[s] [are] suing, and to the extent [RFC] did rely on such representations and warranties, [RFC]'s reliance was not reasonable or justified.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15 n.5 (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).) Although the Court did not expressly consider the fourth defense now at issue-that RFC knew of defects prior to sale and purchased loans anyway-the Court did consider and denied without prejudice Plaintiffs' motion to strike three defenses that each generally require \"the element of full knowledge of the party against whom the doctrines are to be applied\": consent, acquiescence, and ratification. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-402\">\n   Plaintiffs argued that the Court should strike these defenses because they were precluded by Section A200 of the Client Guide. In that section, Plaintiffs argued, Defendants agreed to be fully liable for any misrepresentation or breach of warranty regardless of whether RFC actually had, or reasonably could have been expected to have, knowledge of the facts giving rise to misrepresentations or breaches of warranty, and further acknowledged that RFC purchased loans in reliance of the accuracy and truth of Defendant's R &amp; Ws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (quoting Client Guide \u00a7 A200).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-403\">\n   This Court found, however, that questions of fact precluded relief on a motion to strike under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) The Court reasoned that not all of the relevant contracts were before the Court, and that due to the limited record, it could not rule out, for instance, whether the terms of the Client Guide had been altered or superseded by any conflicting terms in the parties' seller contracts or commitment letters, as Defendants asserted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) With respect to the knowledge-based defenses of consent, acquiescence, and ratification, the Court similarly found that \"[g]iven the limited development of the record at this point, particularly with respect to the applicable versions of the Client Guide and any other documents that might impact the Client Guide, the Court is unable to rule that no genuine issues of fact remain in dispute\" as to those defenses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.) Plaintiffs\n   now renew their arguments at the summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-404\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

Accordingly, Plaintiffs argue, reliance and knowledge are irrelevant to their breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-406\">\n   In their memorandum opposing Plaintiffs' summary judgment motion, Defendants do not explicitly address\n   <em>\n    Krause\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Midland\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   . They do, however, state that \"[u]nlike a warranty claim, the Guide's indemnity provision expressly requires proof of reliance.\" (Defs.' Opp'n at 52.) At oral argument, Plaintiffs' counsel suggested that it \"appear[ed] to be conceded that knowledge[-] and reliance-based defenses are not defenses to breach of contract,\" requiring dismissal. (June 19 Hr'g Tr. at 202.) Defendants' counsel, however, responded that although Defendants \"agree that [they] have the strongest argument with respect to [Plaintiffs'] indemnification claims,\" reliance and knowledge may still be relevant to Plaintiffs' ability to prove the elements of their breach of contract claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 220-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-407\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the knowledge- and reliance-based defenses on which they move for summary judgment are not applicable to their breach of contract claim, and therefore it grants their motion for summary judgment in that respect. The Court notes, however, that it need not opine at this time whether reliance is a required element of a breach of warranty claim. Although Plaintiffs point to\n   <em>\n    Krause\n   </em>\n   , an unpublished and therefore nonprecedential decision, the Minnesota Supreme Court has not definitively addressed whether reliance is required in a breach of warranty claim. In\n   <em>\n    Lyon Financial Services, Inc. v. Illinois Paper &amp; Copier Co.\n   </em>\n   , the Minnesota Supreme Court acknowledged the disagreement between its decisions regarding reliance, but declined to resolve it.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6934818\" index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/848/539/#p545\">\n    848 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   543-44 &amp; n.6. Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Hendricks v. Callahan\n   </em>\n   , the Eighth Circuit \"was not persuaded\" that \"Minnesota would adopt the 'modern view' which provides that the buyer's reliance on the warranty is 'wholly irrelevant.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1871519\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/972/190/#p194\">\n    972 F.2d 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 194 (8th Cir. 1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-408\">\n   Resolving this apparent conflict now is unnecessary because, as described below in the context of Plaintiffs' indemnity claim, even if proof of reliance were required generally, Section A200 precludes any arguments regarding knowledge and reliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-409\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

According to Plaintiffs, Section A200 was a critical component of the parties' contract, which shifted the risk of liability for defective loans to correspondent lenders. Such risk-shifting scheme, Plaintiffs contend, was previously recognized by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Terrace I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027892\" index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/850/961/\">\n    850 F.Supp.2d at 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , where the Court emphasized that RFC \"paid Terrace a premium for the loans it purchased from Terrace under this agreement.... In exchange, Terrace took the risk of [RFC] determining that particular loans did not meet the stated criteria.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Reply at 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-415\">\n   Defendants disagree, and argue that Section A200 does not preclude their reliance- and knowledge-based defenses for two primary reasons. First, they argue that although Section A200 states that RFC\n   <em>\n    purchased\n   </em>\n   loans in reliance on Defendants' R &amp; Ws, it does not provide that RFC in turn made representations to the Trusts in reliance on Defendants' R &amp; Ws. (Defs.' Opp'n at 39.) In fact, Defendants argue, Section A212 expressly requires reliance, as it provides that \"Defendants will indemnify RFC for liabilities arising from,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , 'any breach of any representation ... or representation made by [ ]RFC\n   <em>\n    in reliance upon\n   </em>\n   any ... representation made by the Client contained in the Client Contract.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40 (quoting the Client Guide \u00a7 A212);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at n.27 (arguing the same as to Section A202(II) ).) Second, they argue that even if Section A200 facially precluded reliance- and knowledge-based defenses, they are nevertheless \"entitled to present evidence that RFC waived or is estopped by its words and deeds from enforcing these Guide provisions, including the non-waiver language.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-416\">\n   This Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the plain language of Section A200, especially when read in context of the entire contract, precludes Defendants' knowledge- and reliance-based defenses. Furthermore, the Court concludes that Defendants have not raised a triable issue of fact that RFC waived or is estopped from enforcing this particular provision. If the threshold determination is made that the Client Guide applies, Defendants are precluded, as a matter of law, from asserting the reliance- and knowledge-based defenses at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-417\">\n   First, this Court finds that the unambiguous language of the Client Guide allocated certain risks to Defendants that they may not now dispute. \"Under freedom of contract principles, parties are generally free to allocate rights, duties, and risks,\"\n   <em>\n    Lyon Fin. Servs.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6934818\" index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/848/539/#p545\">\n    848 N.W.2d at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and \"[c]ourts are not warranted in interfering with the contract rights of parties as evidenced by their writings which purport to express their full agreement,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-418\">\n   <em>\n    Cady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304490\" index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/283/105/\">\n    166 N.W.2d at 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In Section A200, Defendants expressly acknowledged the following: (1) that Plaintiffs were buying loans in reliance upon the accuracy of their R &amp; Ws; (2) that Defendants were fully liable for any misrepresentation of or breach of warranty\n   <em>\n    regardless\n   </em>\n   of whether RFC had any knowledge of the misrepresentation or breach; and (3) that Defendants' R &amp; Ws were not affected by any investigation or review made by RFC unless expressly waived in writing. The plain language of these provisions is clear: under the parties' bargain, whether RFC actually relied on the R &amp; Ws or had knowledge of any potential defects is wholly irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-419\">\n   Furthermore, the Court is unpersuaded by Defendants' contention that, even if they stipulated that RFC purchased loans in reliance on the accuracy and truth of Defendants' R &amp; Ws, they did not stipulate that RFC necessarily relied on that same accuracy and truth of Defendants' R &amp; Ws when making its\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   R &amp; Ws to the Trusts. Defendants' interpretation would run afoul of several provisions of the Client Guide and its structure as a whole. First, it would contradict the explicit risk-shifting scheme of Section A200 if Defendants could dispute RFC's securitization-related reliance on Defendants' R &amp; Ws,\n   <em>\n    especially\n   </em>\n   because the Client Guide alerted Defendants at various turns that RFC intended to securitize the loans it bought from them. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Client Guide \u00a7 A202(II) (\"Client recognizes that it is [ ]RFC's intent to securitize some or all of the Loans ....\").) Additionally, Defendants' interpretation would render Section A200 superfluous, as it would require RFC to prove the same reliance that Section A200 presumes. Finally, Defendants' interpretation of Section A200 ignores some of that same section's provisions. As Plaintiffs point out,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-420\">\n   To prove a reliance defense to indemnification, Defendants would have to prove that RFC learned of Defendants' R &amp; W breaches after RFC bought the loans but before it made R &amp; Ws to Trusts. But Section A200 forecloses that defense by stating that Defendants' R &amp; Ws \"are not affected by any investigation or review made by, or on behalf of, [RFC] except when expressly waived in writing by [RFC].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-421\">\n   (Pls.' Reply at 30) (quoting Client Guide \u00a7 A200).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-422\">\n   Moreover, Defendants may not repackage what is essentially a causation argument as one of reliance. Standard Pacific and CTX argue that \"RFC could never rely\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   on Defendants' alleged representations because there was always a time lag (often a substantial one) between the purported representations made by Defendants to RFC and the very different, subsequent representations made by RFC to other parties.\" (Standard Pac.-CTX Opp'n at 9-10.) They also argue that \"RFC could not rely upon Defendants' alleged representations in making its own subsequent representations because the substance of the two types of representations differed fundamentally.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) As this Court explained in its discussion of causation, Defendants are free to argue that RFC is\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   responsible for some Trust-level breaches. But these arguments have no bearing on whether Section A200, a contractual provision to which the parties willingly agreed, forecloses the reliance- and knowledge-based defenses on which Plaintiffs move for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   , Section III.F.4.c.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-423\">\n   Finally, the Court finds that Defendants have failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether \"RFC waived or is estopped by its words and deeds\" from enforcing Section A200. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n at 39.) Under Minnesota law, \"[w]aiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-424\">\n   <em>\n    Frandsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7071944\" index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/801/177/#p182\">\n    801 N.W.2d at 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To show a valid waiver, the party asserting waiver must prove two elements: \"(1) knowledge of the right, and (2) an intent to waive the right.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7071944\" index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/801/177/#p182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Waiver may be express or implied-'knowledge may be actual or constructive and the intent to waive may be inferred from conduct.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7071944\" index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/801/177/#p182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Valspar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6116137\" index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/764/359/#p367\">\n    764 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   367 ). However, mere inaction is insufficient to establish waiver.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6116137\" index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/764/359/#p367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As applied here, the issue is thus whether Defendants have adduced evidence creating a triable issue of fact that Plaintiffs intended to waive the reliance and knowledge provisions of Section A200.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-425\">\n   Here, Defendants do not cite to any evidence indicating that RFC waived or should be estopped from enforcing Section A200. (Defs.' Opp'n at 40-42.) Rather, Defendants rely on the same generalized arguments they made in support of their general estoppel defense, described\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   Section III.F.4.a. In their common memorandum in opposition, Defendants make the cursory assertion that \"RFC's repeated, intentional conduct over many years-where it deliberately sought to acquire loans from Defendants in greater volume knowing they were not underwritten to the Client Guide-creates a triable issue on whether RFC waived or is estopped from enforcing\" Section A200. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-426\">\n   Their Defendant-specific memorandums fare no better. HLC simply alleges that there is \"voluminous record evidence that RFC deliberately chose to buy HLC loans that did not comply with the Client Guide through Assetwise approvals, bulk purchases, and buying loans to competitor guidelines.\" (HLC Opp'n at 9.) Standard Pacific and CTX similarly point to no evidence indicating that RFC expressed the intent to waive Section A200, or that it made any promises or inducements indicating that it was specifically abandoning or modifying that clause. Rather, the section of their brief devoted to waiver and estoppel seems only to address their general estoppel argument that the Client Guide did not apply in the first instance. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Standard Pac.-CTX Opp'n at 2) (as to waiver and estoppel, arguing that RFC \"knew the loans it purchased were not underwritten to the Client Guide and it cannot now claim that alleged failures to conform to the Guide's underwriting guidelines mark those loans as 'defective' or 'breaching' \").) Tellingly, both Defendant-specific responses opposing summary judgment do not mention or cite to Section A200.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-427\">\n   As Plaintiffs argue, these generalized assertions are simply insufficient to survive summary judgment as to whether RFC waived or should be estopped from enforcing Section A200. In fact, it would render Section A200 entirely meaningless if Defendants could claim that RFC waived that provision, or should be estopped from enforcing it, because it purchased loans it knew were defective or without relying on R &amp; Ws. As Plaintiffs point out, \"[e]ven if RFC bought loans knowing they did not comply with the Guide and without relying on Defendants' R &amp; Ws, doing so would not waive A200 or estop RFC from enforcing it. Indeed, the very\n   <em>\n    purpose\n   </em>\n   of A200 was to enable RFC to buy loans under those circumstances.\" (Pls.' Reply at 34.) In sum, for loans governed by the Client Guide, Section A200 is unambiguous in rendering RFC's knowledge and reliance irrelevant, and Defendants have not produced sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact that RFC waived or is estopped from enforcing this particular provision. Accordingly, this Court grants Plaintiffs' summary judgment motion as to these reliance- and knowledge-based defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-428\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-429\">\n   Plaintiffs next argue that this Court should enter summary judgment dismissing defenses based on the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. at 37-39.) They argue that Defendants cannot demonstrate RFC has acted in bad faith, as it has only ever asserted its legal and contractual rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants disagree, and argue that they must be permitted to present to the jury evidence that RFC has breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In a general sense, all Defendants argue that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing operates here to limit the \"sole discretion\" that the Client Guide grants to RFC. (Defs.' Opp'n at 43.)

Opp'n at 44 (\"[A] triable issue\n   exists ... as to whether RFC's litigation-driven declaration of Events of Default is a 'good faith' exercise of discretion.\").) They argue that the contract envisioned, and they reasonably expected, a loan-by-loan protocol by which RFC would \"identify a specific 'Event of Default' for\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   Loan, afford a loan seller with a right to appeal and, if repurchase ensue[d], return the loan to the seller in exchange for a repurchase price.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Instead of following this loan-by-loan protocol, however, they argue that RFC \"used its pleadings to declare\n   <em>\n    en masse\n   </em>\n   unspecified 'Events of Default,' \" \"provided no accompanying loan-level notice,\" and \"broadly attempted to impugn loans without any discretion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-433\">\n   This Court is unpersuaded.

Similarly, Standard Pacific and CTX contend that it was not \"reasonably understood\" that RFC would agree to purchase their loans \"in bulk at auctions-loans openly and notoriously underwritten to third party guidelines-and then, many years later, fault these Defendants for not having underwritten them to the RFC Client Guide.\" (Standard Pac.-CTX Opp'n at 11.) These two Defendants also argue that, even if the Client Guide applied, it was not reasonably understood that \"RFC could demand that Defendants indemnify them for 'failures' to do things not called for even under the Client Guide.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-435\">\n   As explained above, Defendants have raised triable issues of fact as to whether the Client Guide governed their sale of loans to RFC. However, if the Guide applies, to the extent they argue that Plaintiffs have breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by holding them to the requirements of the Guide, the argument fails. As Plaintiffs point out, the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied in every\n   <em>\n    contract\n   </em>\n   . This Court agrees with Plaintiffs that, definitionally, then, the covenant presupposes an applicable\n   contract.

(Scheck Decl., Ex. 38 (Corr. Snow Rpt. \u00b6\u00b6 69-78).) In its second model for measuring damages, RFC offers an \"Allocated Breaching Loss Approach\" that attempts to assess and allocate damages by measuring each defendant's share of the liabilities RFC incurred in the Settlements rather than the economic harm caused by breaching mortgages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79-86.) In the third model for measuring damages, RFC offers an \"Allocated Loss Approach\" that again measures damages in relation to the liabilities RFC incurred in the Settlements, but this time assesses damages based on each Defendant's share of total losses on all at-issue loans,\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   not just breaching loans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Defendants contend that each approach fails to supply a legally supportable or non-speculative basis to assess and allocate damages among the parties, and therefore argue the Court should enter summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-467\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Breaching Loss Approach\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-468\">\n   As previously stated, the Breaching Loss Approach measures damages based on the economic losses incurred from breaching loans that Defendants sold to RFC that were later securitized into the RMBS Trusts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scheck Decl., Ex. 38 (Corr. Snow Rpt. \u00b6\u00b6 69-78).) To do so, the Breaching Loss Approach calculates the total losses from a defendant's at-issue loans based on monthly loan-level data. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) The model then multiplies the total losses by a defendant's Trust Breach Rate, which is the rate at which the loans a Defendant sold to RFC are estimated to have breached the representations and warranties in both the Client Guide and Trust Agreements based on a sampling protocol. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) The resulting number,\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   . the Trust Breaching Loss, is the total measure of economic loss attributable to a particular defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-469\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Whether RFC May Recover Repurchase Damages Under Section A210\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-470\">\n   Defendants argue that the Breaching Loss Approach advances a non-viable theory of recovery because RFC may not recover damages for loan-level losses it did not actually incur. (Defs.' Mem. at 12-24.) More specifically, Defendants contend that the Breaching Loss Approach seeks to improperly recover the entirety of \"repurchase damages\" as provided by Section A210 of the Client Guide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That provision enables RFC to demand that an originating bank repurchase a mortgage it sold to RFC whenever RFC determines the originating bank breached the representations and warranties it made with respect to that particular mortgage. Again, in relevant part, Section A210(A) provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-471\">\n   If [ ]RFC determines that an Event of Default has occurred with respect to a specific Loan, the Client agrees to repurchase the Loan and its servicing (if the Loan was sold servicing released) within 30 days of receiving a repurchase letter or other written notification from [ ]RFC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-472\">\n   If the Client discovers an Event of Default, it should give [ ]RFC prompt\n   written notice... If [ ]RFC decides to require repurchase, the Client shall repurchase the loan ... within 30 days after [ ]RFC's decision is communicated to the Client in writing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-473\">\n   ... [ ]RFC is not required to demand repurchase within any particular period of time, and may elect not to require immediate repurchase. However, any delay in making this demand does not constitute a waiver by [ ]RFC of any of its right or remedies ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-474\">\n   Where [ ]RFC determines that repurchase of a Loan ... is not appropriate, the Client shall pay [ ]RFC all losses, costs and expenses incurred ... as a result of an Event of Default.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-475\">\n   (Client Guide \u00a7 A210(A).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-476\">\n   Section A210(B) of the Client Guide then sets the repurchase price as equal to the sum of the unpaid principal, unpaid interest, and related expenses for a particular loan while subtracting any proceeds realized by the liquidation of that loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 A210(B).) In other words, the repurchase remedy, like the Breaching Loss Approach, calculates damages based on the deficient performance of individual loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-477\">\n   Here, Defendants argue that RFC cannot recover repurchase damages under the Client Guide because RFC never suffered the losses that the repurchase remedy is intended to address-outside investors did.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Defs.' Mem. at 12-15.) RFC sold the loans it purchased from originating banks at a profit to third-party trusts, and those third-party trusts ultimately experienced whatever losses may be attributed to the breaching loans. Thus, Defendants contend that there is no basis in the Client Guide or contract law to award RFC any damages it did not incur in the Settlements-that is, the entirety of repurchase damages-and therefore, this Court should rule, as a matter of law, that the entirety of these damages are not recoverable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-478\">\n   As support, Defendants point to a recent decision in a similar RMBS action,\n   <em>\n    Quicken Loans,\n   </em>\n   where the state court granted partial summary judgment to originating banks and dismissed RFC's claims for repurchase damages under the Client Guide.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"389\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205571222\">\n    2017 WL 5571222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8. There, the court analyzed contractual language that mirrors the language at issue in the instant case, and concluded the repurchase remedy is unavailable where the subject loan is no longer in the possession of the buyer because \"repurchase\" requires \"buying something back or again.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"390\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205571222\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Repurchase, Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-479\">\n   The court additionally noted that, in circumstances where a loan was sold prior to RFC exercising the repurchase remedy, the contract provides an alternative remedy to repurchase. Specifically, the contract provides that where \"repurchase of a Loan ... is not appropriate, the Client shall pay [ ]RFC all losses, costs and expenses\n   <em>\n    incurred by RFC\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <em>\n    as a result of an\n   </em>\n   Event of Default.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"391\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205571222\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original). Based on that language, the court concluded that RFC's recovery for an originating bank's breaches on loans it later sold into RMBS trusts is limited to the actual losses it incurred and therefore the repurchase formula, which calculates damages based on the performance of the loan, \"has no bearing on the assessment of damages that RFC may have suffered.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5, 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-480\">\n   Here, Defendants argue RFC is barred from recovering Breaching Loss damages under Section A210's repurchase price formula in light of\n   <em>\n    Quicken Loans\n   </em>\n   ' preclusive effect, or alternatively that RFC should be barred from doing so under the same reasoning applied in\n   <em>\n    Quicken Loans\n   </em>\n   . (Defs.' Mem. at 16-17.) As was the case in\n   <em>\n    Quicken Loans,\n   </em>\n   RFC does not own the loans upon which its claims are premised. Consequently, Defendants assert that RFC is unable to demand repurchase and Section A210(A) only allows RFC to recover the losses, costs, and expenses it actually incurred as a result of the allegedly breaching mortgages. The Breaching Loss Approach is insufficient to that task, according to Defendants, because it measures damages based on loan-level losses incurred by the RMBS Trusts, not by RFC. Therefore, Defendants assert that the Court should grant summary judgment as to loan-level damages measured by the Breaching Loss Approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-481\">\n   RFC counters that Section A210 allows it to recover under the repurchase remedy, regardless of whether RFC maintains possession of the loans or experienced actual losses on them. (Pls.' Mem. at 18-25.) According to RFC, the plain terms of the contract demonstrate that the repurchase remedy in Section A210 is a liquidated damages provision that enables it to recover a fixed formulaic amount from an originating bank. Thus, RFC asserts the word \"repurchase\" is actually a term of art that describes the manner in which liquidated damages are assessed under the contract, not an actual requirement that originating banks repurchase a loan if the remedy is exercised. As support, RFC points to a number of different portions of Section A210.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-482\">\n   First, RFC notes that Section A210(A) provides that if RFC determines that an Event of Default has occurred, \"the Client agrees to repurchase the loan.\" (Client Guide \u00a7 A210.) Section A210 also provides that \"[i]f the Client discovers an Event of Default,\" it must notify RFC of the breach and \"[i]f [ ]RFC decides to require repurchase, the Client shall repurchase the Loan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Under either scenario, the Client's obligation to repurchase is not contingent upon whether RFC incurred a loss or even owns the loan. Rather, the Client's obligation to \"repurchase\" is triggered solely by the determination that an Event of Default has occurred, for instance, by an originating bank's material breach of a representation or warranty contained in the Client Guide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 A208.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-483\">\n   Second, RFC highlights that Section A210(A) supplies it with the alternative option to demand payment for actual losses it incurred from a breaching mortgage in lieu of the fixed formula repurchase amount, which indicates that actual losses are relevant only when the alternative option is exercised by RFC. (Pls.' Mem. at 21.) Specifically, Section A210(A) provides that \"[w]here [ ]RFC determines that repurchase of a Loan ... is not appropriate, the Client shall pay [ ]RFC all losses, costs and expenses incurred by [ ]RFC ... as a result of an Event of Default.\" (Client Guide \u00a7 A210.) Thus, under the default scenario, an originating bank owes the repurchase amount for an Event of Default under the formula set out in Section A210(B). If RFC determines that recovering actual losses from a breaching mortgage is the better option, it may elect to recover them instead of a repurchase formula payment by notifying the originating bank. As such, RFC asserts the question of actual losses,\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   . losses, costs and expenses incurred as a result of an event of default, is irrelevant to the standard repurchase remedy and only comes into play when RFC exercises its alternative option to recover. Therefore, RFC argues it need\n   not demonstrate actual losses on a loan to recover under the standard repurchase remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-484\">\n   Third, RFC argues that its own obligations under Section A210 illustrate that the availability of the repurchase remedy is not contingent upon it possessing the breaching loan. (Pls.' Mem. at 21-22.) Section A210(A) provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-485\">\n   Upon the Client's satisfaction of its repurchase obligation, [ ]RFC will endorse the Note evidencing the Loan in blank and will deliver it and other Loan Documents to the Client. If [ ]RFC acquired title to any of the real property securing the Loan pursuant to a foreclosure sale and has not disposed of such property, it will transfer such property to the Client on a \"quit claim\" basis or ... a \"warranty deed\" basis. However, if [ ]RFC has disposed of the real property securing the Loan, the Loan Documents will not be returned to the Client unless requested.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-486\">\n   (Client Guide \u00a7 A210.) In other words, Plaintiffs contend, Section A210(A) provides that after RFC receives a repurchase payment from an originating bank, RFC is required to either sign over the loan to the originating bank or transfer title to it for property that collateralized the loan. If RFC has neither, it is required to do nothing unless the originating bank requests the loan documents, at which point RFC is required to provide them with the loan documents and nothing more. Hence, because Section A210 specifically envisions repurchase payments being made if a loan has been liquidated and a subject property has been foreclosed upon, RFC argues the Client Guide's own terms indicate that RFC need not possess a loan in order for the repurchase remedy to be available to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-487\">\n   Fourth, RFC contends that the formula for calculating the repurchase price explicitly provides that the repurchase remedy is available even if the loan no longer exists. (Pls.' Mem. at 22-23.) Section A210(B) provides that \"in the event the Client is obligated to repurchase a Loan, the Client must pay to [ ]RFC a repurchase price equal to\" the borrower's outstanding principal and interest plus certain expenses incurred by RFC or its affiliates in connection with the loan. (Client Guide \u00a7 A210(B).) From that sum, the formula then subtracts any liquidation proceeds realized by the \"owner of the loan\" to arrive at the repurchase price. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-488\">\n   RFC argues the repurchase price formula is illuminating for two reasons. First, RFC notes that the repurchase price is based on the loan's losses, not RFC's losses, which demonstrates that the repurchase remedy is available regardless of whether RFC actually experienced losses on the loan. Second, RFC highlights that the repurchase formula specifically envisions repurchase payments will be made after a loan is liquidated, either by RFC itself or by a third-party, because liquidation proceeds realized by the \"owner of the loan\" are subtracted from the repurchase price. Therefore, RFC argues it need not possess a loan in order to exercise its repurchase remedy related to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-489\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Whether RFC May Recover Repurchase Damages Under the Indemnification Provisions in Section A212\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-490\">\n   Defendants argue that RFC may not recover Breaching Loss damages under the indemnification provisions in Section A212 for three reasons. (Defs.' Mem. at 17-19.) First, Defendants argue that RFC cannot seek indemnification for losses it never incurred. Defendants note that Section A212 provides that \"[t]he Client shall indemnify [ ]RFC from all losses ... resulting from any Event of Default.\" (Client Guide \u00a7 A212.) However, Defendants argue that this provision can only relate to\n   losses RFC actually incurred, because to indemnify means to \"reimburse\" or \"hold harmless.\" (Defs.' Mem. at 17) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Indemnify, Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014) );\n   <em>\n    see also,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feed Mgmt.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5917918\" index=\"392\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/488/\">\n    823 F.3d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that an indemnitor was not required to pay an indemnitee's claim for attorney's fees paid by a third party because those fees were not damages that the indemnitee suffered).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-491\">\n   Here, Defendants argue that RFC did not suffer loan-level losses on the allegedly breaching mortgages that Defendants securitized because those losses were borne by the RMBS trust investors. Consequently, Defendants assert that their indemnification responsibilities do not extend to loan-level losses incurred by the third-party RMBS Trusts because, under the basic principles of indemnity law, they are only required to indemnify RFC for losses it incurred as a result of alleged breaches in the Client Guide. Therefore, Defendants argue that the Breaching Loss Approach, which measures loan level losses in the RMBS Trusts, cannot be used to measure the extent to which Defendants are responsible for indemnifying RFC for its own losses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-492\">\n   Next, Defendants argue that RFC may not rely on the Breaching Loss Approach to measure the extent to which Defendants must indemnify RFC for liabilities it incurred when settling the Trusts' claims in bankruptcy, because doing so would result in a windfall to RFC. (Defs.' Mem. at 20-22.) Defendants note that RFC settled the Trusts' claims for unsecured Allowed Claims in the bankruptcy estate that were a fraction of the losses on allegedly breaching loans. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Smallwood Decl., Ex. 30 (Corr. Snow Rpt. \u00b6 80).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-493\">\n   In particular, Defendants note that RFC's own expert concluded that RFC faced claims by trusts for $23.7 billion in breaching losses, and that RFC settled those claims for $6.749 billion,\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   . roughly 29 cents on the dollar. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91.) Nevertheless, Defendants argue that RFC would use the Breaching Loss Approach to measure each Defendant's share of the indemnification liability as equal to 100% of the losses on the Defendant's allegedly breaching loans, despite the steep discount agreed to in the Settlements. Therefore, Defendants assert that applying the Breaching Loss Approach to measure indemnification damages for liabilities incurred in bankruptcy would produce a manifestly unfair result in violation of basic contract law principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-494\">\n   Defendants additionally argue the Breaching Loss Approach is flawed with respect to measuring indemnification liability for a different reason-it assigns individual Defendants with more than their proportional share of RFC's alleged liabilities. (Defs.' Mem. at 22.) The Client Guide requires a Client to indemnify RFC for \"liabilities ... resulting from any Event of Default.\" (Client Guide \u00a7 A212.) Furthermore the Client Guide specifies that an Event of Default occurs where \"[t]he\n   <em>\n    Client breaches\n   </em>\n   any of the representation, warranties, or covenants set forth in this Client Guide.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 A208(3).) Thus, under the plain terms of the Client Guide, Defendants assert that a Client may only be held accountable for the liabilities resulting from its own breaches, not the breaches of other originating banks selling loans to RFC. Yet Defendants contend that RFC aims to do just that by saddling Defendants with liability owed by other originating banks that RFC never sued. As support, Defendants point to Dr. Snow's testimony in which he estimated that Defendants would have accounted for about 20 percent of the breaching loss damages across all originators. (Smallwood Decl., Ex. 27 (Snow Dep. at 114).) However, under the Breaching Loss Approach, Dr.\n   Snow estimates that Defendants would bear 65% of RFC's purported liabilities to trusts, or $4.382 billion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 122-123.) In other words, Defendants contend they would be required under the Breaching Loss Approach to pay for a large portion of RFC's liabilities attributable to non-defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-495\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that the Breaching Loss Approach fails to demonstrate that loan-level losses were proximately caused by Defendants' alleged breaches of representations. (Defs.' Mem. 23-24.) Here, Defendants contend that no facts have been submitted to show that loan-level losses were more probably caused by material breaches in the Client Guide rather than other factors such as poor servicing practices, after-the-fact changes in the economic circumstances of borrowers, or macroeconomic factors attendant to the housing market collapse. Therefore, Defendants assert summary judgment is appropriate to preclude RFC from offering the Breaching Loss Approach on the issue of indemnification, because the Breaching Loss Approach fails to supply a basis for concluding that the losses were proximately caused by the breaches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-496\">\n   RFC argues that Defendants err in arguing that Section A212 prevents RFC from seeking indemnification for losses it never incurred. (Pls.' Opp'n at 7.) RFC notes that Section A212's first sentence requires Defendants to \"indemnify all losses\" resulting from any breach, with no limitation that indemnifiable losses are limited to those actually borne by RFC. RFC concedes that indemnity language later in Section A212 explicitly applies losses \"incurred by ... RFC,\" but argues that language does not negate the overall principle stated at the outset of the section. At most, RFC contends that the conflicting language creates an ambiguity that precludes summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-497\">\n   RFC additionally argues that Defendants err in arguing that breaching losses are unavailable as an indemnity remedy because they may exceed the liability that RFC incurred to the trusts, because disputed issues of fact concerning the amount of RFC's losses do not supply a basis for summary judgment. For instance, RFC argues that Defendants do not account for the fact that RFC is also entitled to indemnification for the Monoline Settlements and fees and expenses before, during, and after the bankruptcy case in addition to the payments made to the Trusts. Altogether, RFC contends that amount might exceed loan-level losses. Furthermore, RFC argues that no Defendant has demonstrated that RFC incurred liability that was less than loan losses on the specific at-issue loans. And although RFC concedes that RFC settled claims in its bankruptcy at a discount, RFC contends that fact does not establish that RFC settled claims at a discount with respect to any specific loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-498\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-499\">\n   The material flaw in the Breaching Loss Approach is that it results in a windfall for RFC because RFC's damages ultimately sound in indemnity-they are fixed by the Allowed Claims-for the losses and liabilities RFC actually incurred in the Settlements. When a party seeks \"compensat[ion] for loss or damage sustained,\" it seeks indemnification.\n   <em>\n    State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Lennartson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6836737\" index=\"393\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/872/524/#p530\">\n    872 N.W.2d 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 530 (Minn. 2015). The Breaching Loss Approach employs a model that assesses each Defendant's share of the total economic losses experienced by the loans it sold into the RMBS Trusts. To do so, it measures loan-level losses based on the performance of at-issue loans. Such a measurement does not take into account\n   the discount that RFC bargained for in the Settlements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-500\">\n   Although perhaps academic, given the Court's ruling limiting RFC's damages to its losses and liabilities incurred in the Settlements, the Court does nonetheless respectfully take exception with the holding in\n   <em>\n    Quicken Loans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"394\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205571222\">\n    2017 WL 5571222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court finds that, as a matter of contract interpretation, the repurchase remedy in Section A210 remains available to RFC, regardless of whether it retained possession of a loan or experienced an actual loss on a loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   The language of Section A210 and related provisions in the Client Guide provide that RFC is able to exercise the repurchase remedy whenever it determines an Event of Default has occurred, even if the loan for which the Event of Default relates is no longer in its possession. All that RFC is required to do to exercise the repurchase remedy is notify a selling originating bank of an Event of Default, at which point the selling originating bank has the option to appeal that determination. Furthermore, Section A210 does not impose a duty upon to RFC to demonstrate that it experienced losses on a breaching loan before it can demand repurchase. To the contrary, the contract language enables RFC to demand repurchase of a loan before it or a third party trust experiences any losses, and in so doing head off any potential consequences for having purchased a loan that does not meet the standards set forth in the Client Guide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-501\">\n   Here, however, those potential consequences are realized. RFC's exposure is fixed and hence its damages are likewise limited to the losses and liabilities it actually incurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-502\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Allocated Breaching Loss Approach\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-503\">\n   In its second model for measuring damages, RFC offers an \"Allocated Breaching Loss Approach\" that measures damages in relation to the liabilities RFC incurred in the Settlements rather than the economic harm caused by breaching mortgages. (Scheck Decl., Ex. 38 (Corr. Snow Rpt. \u00b6\u00b6 79-86).) To do so, RFC attempts to divide and allocate RFC's bankruptcy liabilities associated with the Trust Claims and Monoline Claims among the loans that Defendants and non-defendants sold to RFC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.) RFC also introduces a \"Settlement Factor\" to reflect the discount from the bankruptcy settlement relative to the overall value of claims by investors and insurers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 80-83.) RFC then multiplies the Settlement Factor by the defendant's Trust Breaching Losses to determine the Defendant's share of the allowed claims in favor of investors. RFC then repeats this process for the Monoline Breaching Losses to determine the Defendant's share of the allowed claims in favor of each insurer. The resulting number is a\n   Defendant's purported measure of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-504\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

Thus, the court concluded, UHG was not able to prove its claim under the insurance policy because it was not able to identify a non-speculative basis upon which to allocate which portion of the settlement applied to the potentially insurable antitrust claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275387\" index=\"401\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/856/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275387\" index=\"401\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/856/\">\n    at 865-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court explained that the \"allocation inquiry examines how a reasonable party in [the plaintiff's] position would have valued the covered and non-covered claims ... at the time of the settlement\" and that in \"complex lawsuits involving different legal claims and theories\" a plaintiff must provide evidence about the relative value of claims in order to properly allocate them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275387\" index=\"402\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/856/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275387\" index=\"402\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/856/\">\n    at 863-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Defs.' Mem. at 25-30.) Similarly, in the instant action, Defendants argue that RFC may seek indemnity only for the portion of the bankruptcy settlement attributable to RFC's breaches of representations to the RMBS Trusts that stem from its reliance on Defendants' allegedly faulty Client Guide representations. They argue that RFC may not seek indemnity for settled claims for which Defendants bear no responsibility. Those non-indemnifiable claims, according to Defendants, include breaches by non-defendant originating banks, breaches that RFC is solely responsible for, fraud and negligence claims against RFC, defective servicing claims against RFC, and claims based on RFC's sale of loans to Non-Defendant Sponsored (\"NDS\") Trusts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Defendants argue that RFC's attempts to allocate the settlement liability among parties to the bankruptcy case must conform to the standard announced in\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth\n   </em>\n   and provide a non-speculative way to allocate indemnification liability based on the relative strength and value of the claims at issue in the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-510\">\n   Plaintiffs counter that\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth\n   </em>\n   arises under insurance law and that Defendants have incorrectly construed the case as having imposed enhanced requirements under Minnesota law for proving contract damages. (Pls.' Opp'n at 11-16.) \"Under Minnesota law, damages for breach of contract must be proved to a reasonable certainty, and a party cannot recover speculative, remote, or conjectural damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Children's Broad.

Thus, RFC asserts its only burden is to provide a reasonable basis to approximate and allocate damages and argues that, unlike the parties in\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth\n   </em>\n   , it has done so via the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach and related expert testimony. RFC further contends that mathematical precision is not required by Minnesota law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-511\">\n   To the extent that\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth\n   </em>\n   does impose additional requirements for allocating responsibility for sums awarded in a settlement, Plaintiffs further argue that those requirements do not apply here. (Pls.' Opp'n at 15-16.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) Furthermore, Plaintiffs point out that\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth\n   </em>\n   was not decided in the context of allocating damages among culpable defendants, as is the case here. Instead, that case involved allocating the portion of a settlement potentially covered by an insurer who was innocent of the wrongdoing that gave rise to the liability. Furthermore, the court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth\n   </em>\n   turned on insurance law as opposed to the law of contractual indemnity. Given these significant differences, Plaintiffs argue\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth\n   </em>\n   does not support the exclusion of Dr. Snow's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-512\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) Defendants' Criticisms of the Methodology of the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-513\">\n   Defendants argue that RFC's Allocated Breaching Loss Approach fails for six reasons. In essence, Defendants argue that each of these alleged shortcomings fail in one way or another to measure the relative strength or value of the claims that were settled in bankruptcy, which makes it impossible to assess their indemnification damages on a non-speculative basis. RFC responds to each of Defendants' six arguments in turn, and argues that, at most, Defendants raise triable issues of fact not appropriate for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-514\">\n   First, Defendants assert that the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach is speculative because it does not value the indemnifiable claims and should therefore be excluded. (Defs.' Mem. at 30-32.) Instead, Defendants assert that RFC expert Dr. Snow simply deducts values attributed to certain non-indemnifiable claims from the overall settlement amount to arrive at \"Net Trust Allowed Claims.\" Using that figure, he then parses out each Defendant's share of damages based on the remaining indemnifiable claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-515\">\n   RFC counters that neither Minnesota law nor\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth\n   </em>\n   require such mathematical precision because proving damages only requires \" 'a reasonable basis upon which to approximate the amount [of damages].' \"\n   <em>\n    Poppler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7062212\" index=\"407\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/834/527/#p546\">\n    834 N.W.2d at 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Leoni\n   </em>\n   , 255 N.W.2d at 826 ). Furthermore, RFC suggests there is no reasonable way to isolate and value claims based on loan-by-loan distinctions.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (\"Once the fact of loss has been shown, the difficulty of proving its amount will not preclude recovery\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-516\">\n   Second, Defendants assert that the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach is speculative because it fails to analyze the value of claims based on breaches of representations for which RFC is solely responsible. (Defs.' Mem. at 32-36.) These include circumstances where, Defendants argue, RFC agreed to purchase loans pursuant to an originator's own underwriting guidelines, or made exceptions to purchase loans that did not comply with the Client Guide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) These also include circumstances where changes in a borrower's circumstances occurred between the sale of the mortgage and the closing of the securitization, whereby representations made in the Client Guide were true at the time originators sold the loans, but were no longer true by the time that RFC entered into the Trust Agreements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Smallwood Decl., Ex. 34 (Schwarcz Rpt. \u00b6 124).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-517\">\n   But RFC responds that it has presented strong evidence that defects in the loans Defendants sold to them were the primary driver of the settlements. (Pls.' Opp'n at 21-24, 34-40.) RFC argues that Defendants, on the other hand, have presented no evidence to show that the Settlements were based \"on breaches for which RFC is solely responsible.\" Instead, RFC contends that Defendants merely posit that RFC's own actions could have incurred liability to RMBS investors, and therefore the Settlements must have accounted for that possibility. Moreover, Plaintiffs assert, the model targets its assessment of damages toward only those loans that it estimates contained material breaches by the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-518\">\n   Third, Defendants argue that the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach is speculative because it fails to analyze the value of the Trusts' fraud claims. (Defs.' Mem. at 36-39.) Even though the fraud claims alleged against RFC were explicitly settled for value in the bankruptcy, Defendants note that RFC expert Dr. Snow treated those claims as if they had effectively no value. (Smallwood Decl., Ex. 27 (Snow Dep. at 212).) Without assessing the weight assigned to those fraud claims, Defendants contend it is impossible to know what portion of the settlement can be attributed to their own alleged wrongdoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-519\">\n   RFC rejoins that Dr. Snow did properly consider the value of the fraud claims when crafting the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach and, based on an RMBS litigation expert's conclusions, determined the fraud claims had no particular value. (Pls.' Mem. at 21-23; Smallwood Decl., Ex. 31 (Hawthorne Dep. at 158).) At oral argument, RFC further contended that assigning little value to the fraud claims made good sense given that the fraud claims overlapped the breach of contract claims, yet are significantly more difficult to prove-a plaintiff must show scienter and justifiable reliance, which are not elements of a breach of contract claim. (June 19 Hr'g Tr. at 123.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-520\">\n   Fourth, Defendants argue that RFC expert Dr. Snow improperly relies on post-settlement evidence in order to value servicing claims, and his opinion is therefore unreliable. (Defs.' Mem. at 39-42.)\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth\n   </em>\n   provides that, when allocating a settlement, the parties must rely on what the parties knew at the time of the settlement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275387\" index=\"408\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/856/\">\n    870 F.3d at 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet here, Defendants argue, Dr. Snow deducts $73 million from the aggregate amount in allowed claims based on two schedules attached to the bankruptcy court's confirmation order which was entered after the parties had\n   agreed to settle. (Smallwood Decl., Ex. 30 (Corr. Snow Rpt. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-521\">\n   RFC counters that the Settlements did establish the value of the servicing claims, and thus no post-settlement allocation is necessary. (Pls.' Opp'n at 21-24; Scheck Decl., Ex. 28 (Bankr. Findings of Fact \u00b6 119).) Furthermore,\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth\n   </em>\n   provides guidance only when \"the settlement did not allocate the amount paid among the various claims.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275387\" index=\"409\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/856/\">\n    870 F.3d at 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the settlement did definitively allocate the amount paid for servicing claims and thus does not raise the same doubts or uncertainties that were present in\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-522\">\n   Fifth, Defendants argue the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach is speculative because it offers no valid basis for valuing claims by NDS Trusts. (Defs.' Mem. at 42-43.) In particular, Defendants note that Dr. Snow allocates only $269 million to the NDS Trust claims out of the total $7.091 billion in aggregate allowed claims. (Smallwood Decl., Ex. 30 (Corr. Snow Rpt. \u00b6 21).) To reach that figure, Dr. Snow multiplies the \"Trust Allowed Claim by the ratio of Total Losses in the 33 NDS Trusts relative to the combined Total Losses of the RFC and NDS Trusts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Defendants, such an approach neither accounts for the full value of the NDS claims nor the likelihood they would prevail in violation of the\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth\n   </em>\n   standard. Furthermore, Defendants assert that Dr. Snow's method for deducting the NDS Trust claims is arbitrary, because he did not sample the breach rates for NDS Trusts. Instead, he assumed without basis that the NDS Trusts have the same global breach rate as RFC-sponsored trusts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-523\">\n   RFC agrees that Dr. Snow relied on the global breach rate to assess the value of the NDS Trusts, but argues that his methodological approach was entirely appropriate because, again, mathematical precision is not required. (Pls.' Opp'n at 27-28);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Poppler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7062212\" index=\"410\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/834/527/#p546\">\n    834 N.W.2d at 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, RFC contends that utilizing the global breach rate was a reasonable basis upon which to approximate the rate at which breaches likely occurred in NDS Trusts based on the similar circumstances of the indemnifiable trusts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-524\">\n   Sixth, Defendants contend that the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach is speculative because it does not value the relative strength of any of the claims,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the relative likelihood that claims would prevail at trial. (Defs.' Mem. at 43-46.) In particular, Defendants note the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach deducts non-indemnifiable claims from the total amount of allowed claims in the bankruptcy settlement to arrive at the Net Trust Allowed Claim of $6.748 billion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Smallwood Decl., Ex. 30 (Corr. Snow Rpt. \u00b6 79).) The Allocated Breaching Loss Approach then calculates a settlement factor to reflect the discount at which RFC settled claims relative to its potential exposure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 93-94.) Then, it multiplies the settlement factor by the losses on each Defendant's allegedly breaching loans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.) At no point in that process, Defendants argue, does RFC take into account the strength of one Defendant's claims relative to another. Thus, Defendants contend the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach is speculative as a matter of law under\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth\n   </em>\n   , because it provides no way of assessing the relative strength of the claims in allocating damages related to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-525\">\n   RFC again avers that Defendants seek to impose requirements for proving contractual damages beyond those imposed by Minnesota law. (Pls.' Opp'n at 28-30.) Assessing the relative strength of claims among individual Defendants would require RFC to conduct a loan-by-loan and trust-by-trust analysis that, according to\n   RFC, is simply not necessary to supply a \"reasonable basis\" to \"approximate\" the amount of damages.\n   <em>\n    Poppler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7062212\" index=\"411\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/834/527/#p546\">\n    834 N.W.2d at 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, RFC contends that Defendants merely raise questions of fact by claiming that the Allocated Loss Approaches paid insufficient attention to the differences in the strength of the individual claims for the Trusts and Monolines. On the one side, Defendants' expert asserts that there are material differences in the strength of certain representations that RFC made to the RMBS Trusts or Monolines. (Smallwood Decl., Ex. 34 (Schwarcz Rpt. \u00b6\u00b6 63-65).) On the other side, RFC's experts have opposing views. (Scheck Decl., Ex. 61 (Butler Rpt. at 131-36);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7062212\" index=\"412\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/834/527/#p546\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 19 (Corr. Hawthorne Rpt. \u00b6\u00b6 265-71\n   <em>\n    );\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7062212\" index=\"413\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/834/527/#p546\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 62 (Payne Rpt. at 108-11).) Therefore, RFC asserts that summary judgment may not be granted with respect to the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach on the basis that it fails to assess the relative strength of claims because genuine issues of material fact remain in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-526\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-527\">\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth\n   </em>\n   does not impose as rigid a standard for assessing contract damages or mandate that a specific formula be applied to allocate them among multiple parties, as Defendants argue. Rather,\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that an \"insured ... must present a non-speculative basis to allocate a settlement between covered and non-covered claims,\" but \"need not prove allocation with precision.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275387\" index=\"414\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/856/\">\n    870 F.3d at 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus,\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth's\n   </em>\n   holding regarding an insured's responsibility to sort covered claims from non-covered claims in a multi-party settlement is entirely consistent with the long standing requirements of Minnesota law of contract damages. To prove damages, a plaintiff must offer a reasonably certain, though not necessarily mathematically precise, basis to demonstrate who owes what for its claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eklund\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10667439\" index=\"415\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/351/371/#p379\">\n    351 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   379 ;\n   <em>\n    Poppler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7062212\" index=\"416\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/834/527/#p546\">\n    834 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   546-47 ;\n   <em>\n    Hydra-Mac\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10608375\" index=\"417\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/450/913/#p919\">\n    450 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   921 ;\n   <em>\n    Leoni\n   </em>\n   , 255 N.W.2d at 826. With that standard in mind, the court in\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth\n   </em>\n   then considered the factual circumstances of the settlement and determined that in order for UHG to provide a non-speculative basis for its damages, it needed to demonstrate how the covered antitrust claims were weighted against non-covered ERISA claims. To do so, the court determined that some assessment of the strength and value of the ERISA claims relative to the antitrust claims was necessary in order to determine the potential damages owed by the insurers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-528\">\n   After consideration of the arguments and careful review of the record, the Court finds the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach offers a reasonably certain basis for assessing and allocating damages that is not \"speculative, remote, or conjectural.\"\n   <em>\n    Poppler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7062212\" index=\"418\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/834/527/#p546\">\n    834 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   546 (citing\n   <em>\n    Cardinal Consulting Co. v. Circo Resorts, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10681424\" index=\"419\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/297/260/#p267\">\n    297 N.W.2d 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 267 (Minn. 1980) ). The instant case does not present the same uncertainty with respect to the relative strength and value of indemnifiable and non-indemnifiable claims as were present in\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth\n   </em>\n   . First, the Settlements at issue here involved related claims in a single action whereas\n   <em>\n    UnitedHealth\n   </em>\n   predominantly involved unrelated ERISA and antitrust claims from two separate cases from different jurisdictions. Second, the claims at issue here are premised on very similar or even identical Trust Agreement contracts and, as one would expect given that commonality, investors raised similar types of arguments against RFC. Third, RFC has offered competent expert testimony to assess the relative value of the settled claims. In particular, Donald Hawthorne, a seasoned RMBS litigator with experience settling RMBS cases, offers his\n   opinion as to the weight a reasonable party would assign to the different categories of claims that were asserted in the bankruptcy based on his assessment of RFC's exposure to those claims and their likelihood of succeeding. (Scheck Decl., Ex. 19 (Corr. Hawthorne Rpt. \u00b6 31).) His opinions were subsequently incorporated into the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach developed by Dr. Snow. Therefore, RFC provides the factfinder with a non-speculative basis to assess the value of the claims that are indemnifiable by Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-529\">\n   To arrive at the measure of damages under the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach, Dr. Snow builds upon his Breaching Loss Approach by incorporating a Settlement Factor to account for the discount the settling parties agreed to in bankruptcy. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10681424\" index=\"420\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/297/260/#p267\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 38 (Corr. Snow Rpt. \u00b6 80).) As such, the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach cures the windfall issue that was presented by the initial approach. Furthermore, the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach offers a highly sophisticated methodology to provide a basis for the factfinder to determine a Defendant's damages, if any. The model assigns damages to a Defendant based on the number of loans it sold to RFC, which is a concrete and verifiable number. The model also assesses economic losses to at-issue mortgages based on reliable loan data. Further, the model targets its assessment of damages toward only those loans that it estimates contained breaches of the Client Guide and Trust Agreement based on a sampling protocol. Given these features, the Court finds that the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach provides a reliable, non-speculative basis for calculating damages in this case.\n   <em>\n    Staffing Specifix, Inc. v. TempWorks Mgmt. Servs. Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12333719\" index=\"421\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/896/115/#p125\">\n    896 N.W.2d 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 125 (Minn.

Accordingly, the Court denies Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and will permit the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach to be presented to the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-530\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Allocated Loss Approach\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-531\">\n   In its third method of measuring damages, RFC offers an \"Allocated Loss Approach\" which, like the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach, measures damages in relation to the liabilities RFC incurred in the bankruptcy settlement. Under this approach, however, Dr. Snow attempts to assign each Defendant a share of RFC's bankruptcy liabilities that is proportional to the Defendant's share of total losses on all At-Issue Loans, not just breaching loans. (Scheck Decl., Ex. 38 (Corr. Snow Rpt. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 113).) Further, RFC caps each Defendant's allocated liability at the amount of its Total Breaching Losses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) By adopting this approach, RFC asserts it is able to identify each originating bank's share of the liability incurred from the bankruptcy settlement, albeit from a different angle than provided by the Allocated Breaching Loss Approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-532\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Whether the Allocated Loss Approach Offers Non-Speculative Bases to Allocate the Settlements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-533\">\n   Defendants argue that the Allocated Loss Approach offers a speculative basis to measure damages because it fails to consider\n   whether, and to what extent, a Defendant's loans breached representations and warranties contained in the Client Guide. Indemnification damages may only be appropriately attributed to breaching loans, according to Defendants, because Section A212 of the Client Guide provides that \"[t]he Client shall indemnify [ ]RFC from all losses ... resulting from any Event of Default.\" (Client Guide \u00a7 A212.) The Allocated Loss Approach thus conflicts with Section A212, Defendants argue, by assigning damages based on\n   <em>\n    all loans that incurred losses\n   </em>\n   , rather than breaching loans that incurred losses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-534\">\n   RFC counters that the Allocated Loss Approach provides an alternative, non-speculative method for allocating damages, and thus satisfies the requirements of Minnesota law. According to RFC, the Allocated Loss Approach's design to allocate damages\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   based on the total losses experienced by the loans provides an objective, measurable standard that justifiably approximates each Defendant's share of the settlement liability. The resulting number,\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   . the net loss, is reliable because it correlates with a Defendant's breaches. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Smallwood Decl., Ex. 27 (Snow Dep. at 119-120, 122); Scheck Decl., Ex. 66 (Pendley, Costello, &amp; Kelsch Rpt.);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"890847\" index=\"424\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/302/419/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 67 (Piskorski, Seru, &amp; Witkin Article);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"890847\" index=\"425\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/302/419/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 68 (Griffin &amp; Maturana Paper).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-535\">\n   As support, RFC notes that large settlements of RMBS cases have allocated claims among RMBS trusts by net losses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scheck Decl., Ex. 71 (Countrywide Agmt. \u00a7 3(c) );\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"890847\" index=\"426\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/302/419/\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 73 (Citigroup Agmt. \u00a7 3.04);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"890847\" index=\"427\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/302/419/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 74 (JP Morgan Agmt. \u00a7 3.05);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"890847\" index=\"428\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/302/419/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 75 (Wash.

Mut. Allocation Order).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-536\">\n   Furthermore, RFC contends that, contrary to Defendants' assertions, the Allocated Loss Approach\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   account for Defendants' breaches because it caps damages at Breaching Losses. In other words, the methodology is designed such that damages attributable to a Defendant will not exceed the amount of economic losses the trusts incurred from a Defendant's breaching loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-537\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-538\">\n   The Court grants Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to the Allocated Loss Approach. First, for the same reasons as the Court articulated with respect to the Breaching Loss Approach, the Allocated Loss Approach could allow RFC to recover a windfall. By setting the cap on damages at Breaching Losses, the Allocated Loss Approach does not account for the discount that the parties agreed to in the bankruptcy settlement. Thus, the approach would allow certain defendants to be charged with a greater share of indemnification liability than provided by the Settlements. Second, the Court finds that assessing damages without accounting for a Defendant's breach rate results in an inaccurate measure of damages. Therefore, the Court will enter summary judgment precluding admission of the Allocated Loss Approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-539\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
