The photodiode is formed from a silicon semiconductor substrate that has two types of charge-neutral impurities: (1) those that donate electrons (n-type impurities) and (2) those that accept electrons (p-type impurities), which can be said to have electron \"holes.\" (ECF 377-1 at 87). When n-doped silicon is placed next to p-doped silicon, it creates a p-n junction, around which the electrons and holes rearrange themselves until they reach an equilibrium. (ECF 377-1 at 88-89). At equilibrium, there is a thin insulating layer at the juncture where the electrons and holes (charge carriers) have recombined (depletion region), and an electric field-created by the ions left behind when the electrons and holes diffused away-preventing further diffusion. (ECF 377-1 at 89;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 201 at 13:10-14:20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The outermost electrons associated with the silicon substrate are said to be in the \"valence band,\" and have a certain energy. The next-highest energy state available is in the \"conduction band.\" The difference in energy between the valence band and the conduction band is a physical property of the semiconductor material; for silicon, the band-gap energy is about 1.07 eV, which corresponds to light with a wavelength around 1100 nm. (ECF 377-1 at 1, 63-64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   If a photon of sufficient energy (that is, for silicon, one with a wavelength of less than 1100 nm) interacts with the silicon substrate, it may transfer its energy to an electron in the valence band and promote it to the conduction band; in other words, the photon is absorbed. (ECF 377-1 at 63;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 201 at 10:21-11:21). Higher-energy photons will be absorbed closer to the light-incident surface, while lower-energy photons are absorbed deeper in the substrate. (ECF 386 Ex E at HPK0022535;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 201 at 12:8-13:9, 15:11-16:16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   When a photon is absorbed, it creates an electron-hole pair (by promoting an electron to the conduction band). (ECF 377-1 at 93). If the photon is absorbed in the depletion region of the photodiode, the electron and the hole are immediately separated because of the electric field, which creates a current. (ECF 377-1 at 93-94). Photons absorbed too far away from the depletion region are much less likely to produce a current. (ECF 201 at 15:11-16:16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Thus, in an ordinary p-n photodiode, light enters through one surface of the photodiode and, to some extent, is absorbed in the depletion region, resulting in electric current. (ECF 377-1 at 63). Light that is not absorbed will either go right through the photodiode (in which case it does not contribute to the sensitivity of the photodiode) or reflect off the back surface of the photodiode back into the photodiode, in which case it has another opportunity to be absorbed and turned into current. ( '109 patent, col. 7 ll. 24-34). Whatever portion of that light is still unabsorbed after a second trip through the photodiode will either pass through the light-incident surface (again without contributing to the sensitivity of the photodiode) or be reflected by that surface, and so on. ( '109 patent, col. 7 ll. 34-37). Infrared light is more likely to go through the photodiode without being absorbed than visible light, because its longer wavelength (and correspondingly lower energy) is absorbed deeper in the substrate and its energy may be insufficient to bridge the band gap of the silicon semiconductor. (ECF 377-1 at 6-7, 63-64;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 201 at 9:3-13; 12:1-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The technology at issue seeks to improve the sensitivity of the photodiode to near-infrared light by irradiating a surface of the silicon substrate with a laser. That irradiation creates an irregular texture on the surface, so that, instead of being smooth, it has micro- or nanometer-scale features that cause the surface to look black to the human eye. (ECF 377-1 at 6-7). Changing the parameters of the irradiation protocol can change the size and shape of those features. (ECF 377-1 at 55 tbl.3.2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   When applied to the back surface of a photodiode, the irregular asperity has the effect of improving the sensitivity of the photodiode to infrared light. In that case, the light enters the photodiode from one surface, and, as before, some is absorbed by the substrate. But instead of meeting a smooth surface on the backside of the photodetector, the unabsorbed light meets the irregular asperity. Light components that hit the asperity an angles greater than or equal to 16.6\u00b0 will be totally reflected, and because the asperity is irregular, they will be reflected back toward the first surface and the side surfaces in many different directions. ( '109 patent, col. 7 ll. 39-50). Because they are arriving from all different directions, they \"are extremely highly likely to be totally reflected\" on the first and side surfaces, and therefore to be \"repeatedly totally reflected on different faces to further increase their travel distance\" inside the photodiode. ( '109 patent col. 7 ll. 51-59). By increasing the travel distance of light inside the photodiode, the asperity makes a thinner piece of silicon act \"thicker,\" and infrared light that otherwise would pass through can be absorbed \"deeper\" than the photodiode actually is. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 201 at 16:12-18:3). The longer the light is trapped within the photodiode, the more likely it is to be absorbed and generate current, and the more sensitive the photodiode will be. ( '109 patent, col. 7 l. 59-col.8 l. 2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 201 at 12:8-13:9; 17:20-18:3; 20:6-21:3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The 2007 Nondisclosure Agreement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In late 2006, SiOnyx, through Mazur, reached out to HPK about a possible business\n   relationship. (ECF 337-40 at 14:3-15:15; ECF 353 Ex. B at 119:4-24). Mazur, Carey, and Saylor went to Japan in November 2006 to meet with representatives of HPK, where Mazur gave a presentation introducing the technology. (ECF 386 Ex.

E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   SiOnyx and HPK entered into a mutual nondisclosure agreement on January 11, 2007, to facilitate a possible business relationship. (ECF 337-2). The parties agree that this is a valid and enforceable contact. (ECF 400 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The nondisclosure agreement provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Each of the parties has developed certain products, technology and methodologies, including information that each party regards as confidential, proprietary, trade secret information. Each party proposes to disclose certain of such information to the other party, to be used by the other party solely for the limited purpose of\n   <em>\n    EVALUATING APPLICATIONS AND JOINTS [sic] DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITES OF PULSED LASER PROCESS DOPED PHOTONIC DEVICES\n   </em>\n   and for no other purposes whatsoever (the \"Permitted Purpose.\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (ECF 337-2 at 1).

(ECF 337-2 at 2). And they agreed that all ownership rights in any intellectual property arising from \"Confidential Information\" would remain with the \"Disclosing Party\" in the absence of a separate written instrument expressly granting those rights.

(ECF 337-3; ECF 337-40 at 17:13-19, 19:19-20:9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The following day, on January 17, 2007, Carey emailed Kobayashi \"the first draft of a device architecture we would like to pursue.\" (ECF 337-3 at 2). He explained that \"[t]he suggested device architecture was selected based on our past experiments and what we believe is compatible with current Hamamatsu photodetectors,\" and he \"also included two possible alternatives if the preferred architecture is difficult.\" (ECF 337-3 at 2-3). The first of those alternatives-\"Alternative # 1\"-showed a p-n photodiode where the laser-textured layer was positioned on the back of the device, opposite the side where light would enter the device. (ECF 337-3 at 5; ECF 337-40 at 19:13-20:21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Carey marked these architectures \"confidential,\" and Kobayashi responded that he \"forwarded the device diagram to Mr. Yamamoto and other related people who were notified of the confidentiality.\" (ECF 337-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Carey testified that he had discussed the architectures with Mazur prior to disclosing them to HPK and that the discussion was \"collaborative.\" (ECF 353 Ex. A at 334:20-335:9). He said, \"We discussed architectures together ... specifically that architecture that I feel like we taught to Hamamatsu was not one we had publicly disclosed and would benefit shortwave response, like it said in the description of architecture Alternative Number 1. How to take advantage of different properties ranging from the shortwave infrared response, the gain, and the photovoltaic near-infrared response.\" (ECF 353 Ex. A at 336:14-22). But he also testified that he could not recall any writing or email between him and Mazur that would demonstrate that Mazur had collaborated on the architectures. (ECF 353 Ex. A at 335:10-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Mazur also testified that he discussed the architectures with Carey. Looking at claim 1 of the '945 patent, he testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Q. Based upon that, what, if anything, do you believe you contributed to this claim?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A.

Did you actually conceive of that while SiOnyx was collaborating with [HPK]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   A.

Did you tell it to Jim Carey and Steve Saylor, or did Jim Carey tell it to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   A. It sort of emerged in a conversation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Q. Was there anybody else there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A. No. Because the only two people I really dealt with on a regular basis were [Carey], who was my former student, and [Saylor].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Q. Did you write it down?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A. I did not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Q. So all there was was a conversation with you and Dr. Carey?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   A. But he didn't write it out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   (ECF 353 Ex. B at 176:8-177:23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Carey testified that prior to his January 17, 2007 email, neither he nor anyone else at SiOnyx had ever discussed the idea of locating the laser-textured layer as depicted in Alternative # 1 with anyone outside SiOnyx. (ECF 337-4 at 345:20-346:2; ECF 337-40 at 20:10-21:1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   HPK produced a slide presentation created by Terumasa Nagano (of HPK's Microelectrical Mechanical Systems Manufacturing Development Group) in November 2006, prior to receiving the architectures from Carey. That presentation includes a device architecture that has a laser-textured surface on one side, and p-type region on the other side, like Carey's Alternative # 1. (ECF 377-14 at HPK0068533). The diagram does not indicate the surface through which the light enters the device, and it needs to be flipped upside-down to match up with Alternative # 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     The SiOnyx-HPK Collaboration\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   On April 4, 2007, Saylor traveled to Japan to meet with representatives of HPK. At the meeting, HPK representatives showed a presentation created by Akira Sakamoto (of HPK's Solid-State Production Development Group) at the direction of Yamamoto. The presentation outlined a plan for HPK to make four types of silicon test wafers, each created by up to three different processes. (ECF 337-8 at 55:5-57:17; ECF 337-7). The wafers would be laser textured by SiOnyx, sent back to HPK for final processing, and tested for their optical-response characteristics. (ECF 337-8 at 14:6-15:3). That presentation showed architectures very similar to those proposed by Carey. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF 337-3\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF 337-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Between April and November 2007, SiOnyx and HPK jointly tested 38 wafers. HPK fabricated the test devices up until the laser-texturing step, and mailed them to SiOnyx for texturing. SiOnyx then returned them to HPK for final processing and testing. (ECF 337-8 at 14:3-15:3; ECF 337-40 at 44:21-45:20). The results of the testing showed that at least some of the devices that were laser-textured by SiOnyx had improved infrared photosensitivity as compared to one of HPK's standard devices. (ECF 337-9 at HPK0010411). The testing also showed that the photosensitivity of devices having the laser-textured surface on the side of the device opposite from the direction of incident light (front illuminated, in this case where the textured surface is on the back) had stronger performance than devices having the laser-textured surface on the same side as the incident light (back illuminated), which performed significantly worse than the reference device. (ECF 337-11 at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Some knowledge about laser-texturing devices was in the public domain-due, in part, to Mazur's many academic publications on the topic. Carey testified, however, that SiOnyx had discovered that there was a preferred target size for the structures making up the texture, which balanced optical response against certain disadvantageous properties. That texture, and the process for making it, was confidential information of commercial value to SiOnyx. (ECF 337-40 at 21:2-22:1). SiOnyx, when it textured the test devices from HPK, used its confidential process to produce its preferred texture. (ECF 337-40 at 49:21-50:14). But SiOnyx shared very limited information as to the process parameters\n   for achieving that texture with HPK-nothing except the identity of the ambient gas in the laser-processing chamber. (ECF 337-10; ECF 45-2 at 69:4-15, 94:3-7). As part of the testing procedure, HPK took scanning-electron-microscope (\"SEM\") images of the textures, which showed detailed images of textures achieved and allowed structural features of the textures to be measured. (ECF 337-9 at HPK0010405-08, HPK0010415). Carey testified that the size of the features shown in these SEM images were within the target range identified by SiOnyx, which he considered to be confidential. (ECF 337-40 at 49:5-50:14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The joint-testing program primarily took place between SiOnyx and HPK. Mazur was present at the initial meeting in November 2006 and discussed the confidential architectures with Carey. However, he was \"kept out of the details\" of the SiOnyx-HPK talks; \"[o]ther than knowing that something was going on, [he] didn't know\" what was being discussed. (ECF 382-17 at 149:18-152:8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF 353 Ex. A at 334:9-336:6 (Carey testifying that he does not recall Mazur being involved) ). Mazur testified that he had \"technical input into what SiOnyx was doing, but [he] was not informed of any-and [he] knew that [HPK] was making devices that were being structured at SiOnyx and then sent back. And [he] knew about plans to modify the architecture, but that's about the extent to which [his] exchanges ... with [Carey] went,\" and that he had not reviewed any technical documents during this time. (ECF 382-17 at 152:2-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Harvard had no confidentiality agreement with HPK, and had no involvement in the collaboration apart from the activities of Mazur. (ECF 342 Ex. F at 57:22-24). Harvard's Rule 30(b)(6) deposition witness testified that Harvard did not have any authority to approve or deny any terms within the nondisclosure agreement between SiOnyx and HPK. (ECF 342 Ex. F at 58:10-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   An employee of HC was at the initial November 2006 meeting, and another employee of HC actually signed the nondisclosure agreement on behalf of HPK, but following that there were no communications between SiOnyx and HC.

(ECF 337-12). But on January 15, 2008, Kobayashi responded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   After discussing with related people mainly from technical aspects, we reached to the following conclusions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   As a commercial entity, [HPK], of course, has to study the possibility to enhance our product capability. However, we are not confident that black silicon technology will greatly contribute. We would rather like to stick with our own technique/technology for that purpose because we would like to keep our own pace of development and accumulate our own know-hows. In [HPK] culture, business decisions almost always come after full technical evaluation, which seems to be quite different from your company. Therefore, we would like to do study by ourselves without further reference to proprietary information of SiOnyx.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   (ECF 337-12 at 1). The collaboration effectively ended at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   That same day, someone from HPK's Central Research Laboratory emailed Kobayashi to say that technology regarding the processing of black silicon was a top priority. (ECF 337 \u00b6 45 (Pl. SMF);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 377 \u00b6 45 (Def.

Prototype reports from April 29 and May 22, 2008, show that HPK's Central Research Laboratory was attempting to replicate the quantum efficiency of the SiOnyx-textured device and comparing the textures they were able to achieve to those SiOnyx achieved. (ECF 337-36 at SIONYXHARVARD_00107908, SIONYXHARVARD_00107916; ECF 337-43 at HPK0012401, HPK0012412, HPK0012425;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 337 \u00b6 53). A presentation dated July 17, 2008-authored by Sakamoto and Nagano and titled \"Black Silicon Technology In-House Production\"-has, as its first page, a slide titled \"PD sensitivity characteristics increase by SiOnyx Company laser processing.\" (ECF 337-13 at 131:22-132:25;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF 337-14 (mostly in Japanese, but containing the words \"Black Si\" and \"SiOnyx\" in English) ). That slide shows a graph of photosensitivity at different wavelengths of light (the same characteristics measured during the SiOnyx-HPK collaboration) that compares the performance of SiOnyx's device (labeled \"SPL Si PD\") with HPK's standard silicon photodiode (labeled \"STD Si PD\"). (ECF 337-13 at 134:11-136:10; ECF 337-14 at HPK0038509). Another slide in that presentation states that HPK had attempted its own laser texturing, but was not able to achieve the same infrared-sensitivity improvement as SiOnyx. (EDF 337-13 at 137:16-139:15; ECF 337-14 at HPK0038511). And another slide contains a schedule, as to which Nagano testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Q.

(ECF 337-13 at 142:15-23; ECF 337-17 at HPK0024515). The leftmost image is labeled \"SiOnyx.\" (ECF 337-13 at 142:24-25; ECF 337-17 at HPK0024515). Under the third image, the text reads \"visually equivalent to SiOnyx's wafer\" and that, like SiOnyx's wafer, \"no silicon scum is attached.\" (ECF 337-13 at 145:4-13; ECF 337-17 at HPK0024515).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Sakamoto testified that HPK's Central Research Laboratory had examined SiOnyx's publications and attempted to estimate the process conditions for the laser texturing. However, it was unable to recreate the texture shown in those publications, and saw almost no surface roughness. (ECF 337-8 at 119:5-122:16). He also testified that \"[t]he samples provided to us by SiOnyx, we looked at them in the prototyping of the silicon photodiode black silicon processing.\" (ECF 337-8 at 122:1-16). Yamamoto testified that for the photodiode product that HPK produced, the \"wafers were prepared by Hamamatsu without using the wafers from SiOnyx.\" (ECF 337-19 at 140:12-15). He further testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Q.

E at 1). It reminded Saylor and Mazur that when the HPK-SiOnyx talks terminated, HPK had \"informed you that we, by ourselves, would like to focus our development efforts on photovoltaic type,\" and explained that \"while we are greatly appreciating having given us an opportunity to think about further enhancement/improvement of our accumulated know-how as a photonics company, we do not think we are infringing any of your IP or originality, or breaching any obligation of confidentiality.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The email attached a file showing the architecture of HPK's device and a chart of its spectral photosensitivity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). The email also described the device, stating that it \"has PN junction on the one side and the back side consists of an accumulation layer by ion implantation over the black silicon surface fabricated by laser in the inert gas atmosphere.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Saylor responded by email ten days later, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Regarding our prior collaboration and information exchanged under Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, SiOnyx is confident that [HPK] will ensure the integrity of SiOnyx confidential information. While the diagram provided in your email is insufficient for our understanding, it looks very similar to the work product of our collaboration.

Although we briefly discussed the results, our structure and processes in the attached file are our own idea.

I at 1). That email attached a step-by-step process flow diagram, in English, describing how HPK's photodiode was made. (ECF 316 Ex. I at 4). HPK admits that the process-flow diagram was very similar to one discussed by the parties during the collaboration. (ECF 315 at 2-3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 316 Ex. B at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Saylor replied on March 10, 2009, that SiOnyx would \"review the information provided,\" and reiterated its interest in a possible business relationship with HPK. (ECF 316 Ex. K at 1). That same day, Kobayashi replied that HPK was not interested in a business relationship with SiOnyx at that time. (ECF 316 Ex. L at 1). On April 15, 2009, Kobayashi contacted Saylor again to say that he hadn't heard from him about the proposed disclosure at the Photon Fair and thanking him for his \"understanding that our technique explained in our e-mails is not infringing your intellectual property.\" (ECF 316 Ex. M at 1). There was no other communication between the parties about the photodiode HPK planned to show at the Photon Fair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The parties were asked about those communications in their depositions. Carey testified that HPK's first email was concerning because it seemed to him that the diagram HPK sent depicted a device that would be covered by SiOnyx's intellectual property. (ECF 316 Ex. F at 265:16-266:11, 273:17). Mazur also testified that he thought the device shown in the diagram would be covered by SiOnyx's intellectual property. (ECF 316 Ex. G at 157:14-24). He further testified that the differences HPK pointed out in their second email failed to convince him that the HPK product did not infringe SiOnyx's rights. (ECF 316 Ex. G at 161:5-24, 163:1-165:24, 167:1-171:24). Saylor, testifying as SiOnyx's Rule 30(b)(6) deposition witness, stated that the architecture of HPK's photodiode was \"the same architecture from an optical perspective as what Jim Carey disclosed.\" (ECF 316 Ex. J at 191:16-23). But he also testified that while Carey and another employee had suspicions because it was close to what SiOnyx and HPK had worked on together, Saylor \"emphasized with them that [HPK] is clearly articulating to us that they had independently developed all of this.\" (ECF 316 Ex. J at 192:4-19). He read the emails \"to mean that none of the people who worked on the project with us would have worked on this, because in big companies, you typically-what you would do is, you would firewall your team, so I'm assuming that's what they've done; otherwise, I don't know how he can claim that it's all their own know-how. They must have firewalled the team.\" (ECF 316 Ex. J at 189:3-10). He found Kobayashi's final email to be \"amusing\" because it thanked him for an understanding that he never gave, but he never corrected him or sent a response. (ECF 316 Ex. J at 201:14-202:15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   A certified translation of an email sent on February 6, 2009, from Sakamoto to Kobayashi contains a draft of the email to SiOnyx. The text above that draft states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   Thank you for all you'd done during the infrared high sensitivity device studies performed with SiOnyx the year before last. One sample prepared at that time was commercialized this time and the technology will be displayed at the Photon Fair. Although considered not likely to be in conflict with the patent filed by Harvard College, because there is a description, \"photodetector that detects even at the wavelength of energy at or less than the Si bandgap due to a femtosecond laser processing\" in one claim, and the N2 gas atmosphere is also described, we have been reviewing how to\n   make the presentation. As a result, if it is commercialized and becomes successful business in the future, rather than hiding a risky notation, we have decided to appeal that our processing is completely different than the one performed by SiOnyx by clarifying the specifics. It is a fact that it was jointly studied in 2007 and since the structure of the sample fabricated at that time and the technique used were already defined, please convey this and notify of the commercialization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   (ECF 326-4 at 6-7). In response to the draft, Kobayashi asked, \"Was the sample prepared at that time the one we prepared? And what kinds of information did we receive from SiOnyx for our preparing the sample?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). Sakamoto responded that the sample was the one HPK had prepared, but that SiOnyx had done the black-silicon laser processing; that he thought they had received some information concerning the laser conditions from SiOnyx; and that while they had also received information concerning annealing conditions from SiOnyx, they were not currently using those annealing conditions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   When asked about that email exchange, Kobayashi testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   Q.

Although it was not legally binding, the MOU stated that Godzilla had proposed to pay SiOnyx $5,000,000 for the development and supply of the custom sensor, and $2,000,000 for an exclusive supply of a non-custom sensor. (ECF 349 Ex. A at 1-2). It also outlined several milestones to be reached before the binding agreement would be executed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   On February 20, 2015, SiOnyx and Godzilla executed a Feasibility Study Agreement, under which Godzilla paid SiOnyx $250,000 to evaluate the feasibility of using SiOnyx's technology for the application Godzilla had in mind. (ECF 349 Ex. C, Ex. E, Ex. F). Godzilla also performed its own feasibility study at that time. (ECF 349 Ex. G). In an email to SiOnyx on March 5, 2015, Godzilla seemed to conclude that the results from its feasibility study were discouraging enough to require \"time ... to reconsider a specification\" for the custom sensor, but also indicated that it would \"like to continue technical discussion about cross point of your customization category and our new plan.\" (ECF 349 Ex. H at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   On March 20, 2015, SiOnyx proposed a revised schedule for project milestones. (ECF 349 Ex. I). Godzilla expressed reservations about that proposal, but agreed to talk about it at the next SiOnyx-Godzilla meeting. (ECF 350 Ex. J).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   On March 30, 2015, Godzilla canceled the upcoming meeting. A representative of Godzilla, who copied at least nine Godzilla employees, sent an e-mail that stated the following: \"We are very sorry but we are required to suspend the WebEx meeting by our IP section. The period is not clear at this moment, unfortunately. It might be very delicate because of IP related issue, I guess. I ask for your kind understanding and cooperation.\" (ECF 350 Ex. K at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   No SiOnyx-Godzilla transaction ultimately went forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   In August 2015, after SiOnyx discovered the existence of HPK's patents, it confronted HPK. At that time, SiOnyx and HPK entered into a \"standstill agreement,\" by which they agreed not to sue each other for at least 30 days in order that they might attempt to negotiate a settlement out of court. (ECF 388-3 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Carey testified that Saylor told him that Godzilla had terminated its business relationship with SiOnyx because it had discovered the existence of two of HPK's patents. (ECF 350 Ex. N at 342:7-343:19). Mazur also testified that Saylor told him that \"the deal with [Godzilla] was off because of there's [sic] a discovery process that had shown the filing of the patent that infringed on our intellectual property,\" but that Saylor did not tell him which patent or anything else about it. (ECF 350 Ex. M at 103:7-11, 110:8-20). Saylor himself testified that, at an in-person meeting at Godzilla's offices sometime in the first quarter of 2015, an \"executive officer\" of Godzilla, or maybe its \"inside counsel,\" told him that Godzilla had suspended the relationship because of HPK's patent portfolio. (ECF 350 Ex. O at 77:19-78:4, Ex. P at 25:5-26:1; ECF 388-1 at 43:8-44:4, 45:9-24). He testified that the entire Godzilla team he had been working with was present at that meeting, about a dozen people, and that a senior vice president or general manager might have been there too. (ECF 388-1 at 45:25-46:3, 46:19-47:24). But he could not remember the identity of the \"executive officer\" who told him that the reason the deal was off was HPK's patents. No one else from SiOnyx appears to have been at the meeting. (ECF 388-1 at 45:25-46:3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Yamamoto, the senior managing director of HPK, testified that he discussed HPK's patents with thousands of people at the Photon Fair, and that he had also discussed them with customers. (ECF 388-4 at 157:16-159:4). Hisanori Suzuki, one of HPK's Rule 30(b)(6) deposition witnesses, testified that Godzilla was a customer of HPK at the time when Godzilla broke off discussions with SiOnyx. (ECF 388-5 at 19:20-20:9, 20:22-21:4, 22:4-11, 27:2-28:11). Much later, on January 4, 2018, Godzilla emailed SiOnyx to say that it would like to sign a new NDA with SiOnyx, but the \"corporate legal team decided recently that [Godzilla] should wait for the final [judgment] of legal matter between SiOnyx and [HPK].\" (ECF 388-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   SiOnyx and Harvard filed this action on October 1, 2015.

(ECF 163-2 \u00b6\u00b6 215-261).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Defendants have filed six motions for partial summary judgment asserting the following contentions: (1) that Harvard and SiOnyx's claims for breach of contract are barred by the statute of limitations; (2) that SiOnyx cannot prove an unjust-enrichment claim against HPK; (3) that Harvard cannot prove an unjust-enrichment claim against HPK; (4) that SiOnyx and Harvard cannot prove unjust-enrichment claims against HC; (5) that SiOnyx and Harvard have failed to prove consequential damages; and (6) that SiOnyx and Harvard have failed to prove that Mazur is a co-inventor of HPK's patents.

Because the limitations period is six years, the latest date their claim could have accrued for this action to be considered timely, absent tolling, was October 1, 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Defendants contend that plaintiffs must have been aware of their potential breach-of-contract claim as early as February 2009, when Kobayashi sent Saylor the two emails disclosing the architecture and manufacturing methods of the photodiode HPK planned to exhibit at the Photon Fair in Japan. In defendants' view, if those diagrams and processes indeed contained plaintiffs' confidential information (which defendants dispute), attaching them to an email and announcing an intent to commercialize them should have put plaintiffs on notice of their claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Defendants also point to the statements by Carey and Mazur that they were concerned and suspicious because the device depicted looked like it was covered by their intellectual property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Plaintiffs, however, have put forth sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether their claims accrued at that time. The principal claim at issue here is for breach of contract-specifically, the nondisclosure agreement that prohibits HPK from using SiOnyx's confidential information for any purpose other than \"evaluating applications and joint[ ] development opportunities of pulsed laser process doped photonic devices.\" (ECF 316 Ex. A at 1). Therefore, the question is whether the e-mails put plaintiffs on notice that HPK had\n   <em>\n    used\n   </em>\n   SiOnyx's confidential information for the improper purpose of developing their own commercial photodiode.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Ordinarily, evidence of great similarity between the device HPK proposed to show at the Photon Fair and the confidential information SiOnyx had shared would be enough to raise a reasonable inference that HPK misused SiOnyx's information. That would seem to be sufficient to put a plaintiff on notice of its claim, or at least to trigger a duty to investigate further. Here, however, HPK's emails went out of their way to repeatedly assure plaintiffs that the device had been developed entirely from HPK's own knowledge and expertise. HPK witnesses testified that they intended the emails to communicate to SiOnyx that the device had been developed independently from the confidential information provided by SiOnyx. And Saylor testified that he interpreted HPK's email to mean that they had likely walled off the engineers who\n   had been part of the potential SiOnyx-HPK collaboration from working on HPK's further enhanced-IR photodiode development because (1) such arrangements were common in the industry and (2) \"otherwise, I don't know how he can claim that it's all their own know-how. They must have firewalled the team.\" (ECF 316 Ex. J at 189:3-10). That evidence is sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether SiOnyx reasonably should have known that it had a potential claim for breach of contract prior to October 1, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   SiOnyx has also proffered internal HPK emails that tend to show that HPK knew that the assurances it was giving SiOnyx were false.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the translation may be less than perfect, read in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, they suggest that the very sample prepared with SiOnyx was the basis of the product about to be commercialized. (ECF 326-4 at 6). That is enough to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether HPK \"concealed the existence of a cause of action through some affirmative act done with intent to deceive,\"\n   <em>\n    Puritan Med.

Plaintiffs explained at the hearing that the only reason they sought such amendment was so that they could raise those issues in response to defendants' motion for partial summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds. All parties, and the Court, agree that plaintiffs may raise those issues whether or not the complaint is amended to expressly include them. (March 16, 2018 Hearing Tr. 36:21-37:24). Therefore, plaintiff's motion to amend has no practical effect and will be denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Breach of Contract\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   SiOnyx has moved for summary judgment in its favor on the breach-of-contract claim, on the ground that \"HPK breached the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (1) by reverse engineering the laser-processed texture created on prototype samples provided to HPK by SiOnyx under the NDA, (2) by utilizing its reverse engineering results and other SiOnyx Confidential Information, and disclosing the same, in Japanese and United States Patent Applications, (3) by developing and selling products derived from those reverse engineering efforts, and (4) by claiming ownership of the Patents that issued from Patent Applications based on SiOnyx confidential information.\" (ECF 336 at 2). Because the agreement provides that confidential information is to be kept confidential (not disclosed in patents), used only for joint development (not for\n   reverse engineering or HPK product development), and owned by the disclosing party absent an express intellectual-property agreement (not made available for the receiving party to patent), those alleged actions would constitute a breach of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   It is useful at the outset to clarify exactly what SiOnyx claims is the confidential information at issue: it is, first, a photodiode architecture wherein the laser-textured surface is that opposite the surface through which light enters the device, and second, the particular texture achieved by SiOnyx's laser processing, which SiOnyx asserts has features of a particular target size. (ECF 336 at 7-8; ECF 337-40 at 20:10-22:1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   With respect to the architecture, HPK does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   argue either (1) that it came up with the architectures to test contained in the April 2007 presentation\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   wholly or partially independently from the architectures disclosed by SiOnyx; (2) that the April 2007 architectures were meaningfully different from the architectures disclosed by SiOnyx; or (3) that the architectures disclosed in the patent were meaningfully different from either the architectures disclosed by SiOnyx or the architectures in the April 2007 presentation. Instead, it argues that the architectures were not actually \"Confidential Information\" within the meaning of the agreement, because HPK had already conceived of a photodetector having \"the textured silicon layer positioned on the surface\n   <em>\n    opposite\n   </em>\n   the p-n junction, just as in Dr. Carey's proposal\" prior to its meetings with SiOnyx. (ECF 376 at 11 (footnote omitted) ). It points to a presentation made by Nagano in November 2006 that includes a device architecture with a (non-laser) textured surface on one side and a p-doped region on the other side, like Carey's Alternative # 1. (ECF 377-14 at HPK0068533). That evidence, however, is not dispositive of the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   First, a textured surface opposite the p-n junction is not what SiOnyx claims is its confidential contribution (although its architecture exhibits that feature); to defeat summary judgment, it appears that HPK must show that it had already conceived of a device having a textured surface opposite the surface through which light enters the device.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Second, the November 2006 diagram does not show what side the light comes in, and HPK has offered no testimony, either by the author or someone skilled at looking at such diagrams, as to the side from which the light would be understood to enter the device. There are three large black arrows that, if they did represent light, would show that it was incident on the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   surface as the texturing. In addition, the diagram must be flipped upside-down to make it resemble the architecture disclosed by Carey and present in the patents. That makes it even more critical to understand from which side the light is entering the device-in every other diagram, even other diagrams that do not show the direction of the light, there appears to be no dispute that it comes in from the top. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 337-3 at 5; ECF 337-7 at HPK0010142). Furthermore, another slide in the same presentation shows a close-up of the irregular asperity with light seeming to enter from the same side on which the asperity was formed. (ECF 377-14 at HPK0068525).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Nevertheless, the diagram is evidence at least that HPK was already considering using texturing, and had already conceived of an architecture where the texturing was opposite the p-n junction. The Court simply cannot determine from the evidence provided whether light would always or typically come from the p-side of a p-n photodiode or whether, at least, it would be understood to come from that direction in that image. Absent any testimony one way or the other, the November 2006 diagram appears to raise a genuine question of material fact as to whether HPK had already considered the key feature of the architecture proposed by Carey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   As to the textured surface, HPK does not contest that it retained SiOnyx's textured samples and used them as a visual and performance reference in the course of developing its own black silicon technology. Instead, HPK first argues that it could not possibly have copied the laser processing from SiOnyx because SiOnyx never disclosed the parameters of its process. But that argument misses the point. SiOnyx does not accuse HPK of stealing its laser parameters; it accuses HPK of using its images of SiOnyx's successful surface asperity to reverse-engineer the appropriate parameters. SiOnyx has presented ample evidence to show that HPK was comparing its surfaces with the surface achieved by SiOnyx and shared under the nondisclosure agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Second, HPK contends that the texture of HPK's development samples, actual product, and patent figures is (1) observably different from the texture of SiOnyx's samples, even on the slide where HPK's sample is labelled \"visually equivalent\" to that of SiOnyx; and (2) closer to the textures disclosed in Mazur's and Carey's publicly available data (which, according to HPK, show rounded structures) than to the textures of SiOnyx's samples (which show sharper, conical structures). HPK cites to a statement by SiOnyx's infringement expert that microstructures in HPK's CCD photodiode product are similar to the structures disclosed in Harvard's '467 patent, which claims priority to an application that first published in 2005. (ECF 377-18 at 70). SiOnyx contends that this is only attorney argument about their relative similarity and points out that, according to the presentation, HPK considered its development sample and SiOnyx's wafer \"visually equivalent\" at the time. But the pictures, side by side, in combination with expert testimony tending to show that HPK's textures are similar to publicly available textures, is sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether SiOnyx's confidential texture was ultimately incorporated into HPK's patents or products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   The Court acknowledges that even if the texture HPK ultimately achieved looked more like publicly available textures than the texture provided to it by SiOnyx, the evidence shows-and HPK does not dispute-that it\n   <em>\n    actually used\n   </em>\n   SiOnyx's wafer during its black silicon development. That use is prohibited under the nondisclosure agreement as long as the texture SiOnyx gave them was confidential. HPK does not argue that that texture was publicly available-indeed, their whole opposition is premised on the idea that the texture on SiOnyx's wafer was\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   from the publicly available textures (which HPK says its patent and product incorporate). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 376 at 14 (\"Not only are HPK's textures different from the ones formed by SiOnyx during the joint development, but they are actually more similar to the prior art that Harvard and Dr. Carey had previously published.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   The consequences, however, of HP's use of SiOnyx's wafer are far from clear. It\n   may have been a breach of the agreement to have used the wafers at all. But if in fact the wafers gave HPK very little to go on, if HPK had to guess at the parameters from publicly available documents, and if the design HPK ultimately came up with was very different from the particular texture SiOnyx claims was confidential, then the full extent of relief SiOnyx requests is not appropriate. For example, if the texture ultimately arrived at was materially different from SiOnyx's confidential texture, then HPK cannot be said to have disclosed SiOnyx's confidential information in its patents or to have breached the agreement by claiming ownership in the patents. It cannot be that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   use of SiOnyx's wafers in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   step of HPK's development process of its own black silicon entitles SiOnyx to complete ownership of everything discovered and commercialized from that point forward. While the evidence may establish\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   breach of the agreement, at a minimum, there is a genuine question of material fact as to the scope of that breach. Summary judgment as to the breach of contract claim is therefore inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Unjust Enrichment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   \"Unjust enrichment provides an equitable stopgap for occasional inadequacies in contractual remedies at law by mandating that '[a] person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is required to make restitution to the other.' \"\n   <em>\n    Mass.

In other words, the scope of the contract covers the exchange even of nonconfidential information, as the parties expressly agreed as to what would constitute confidential information and what the allowed and prohibited uses of confidential and nonconfidential information were.

SiOnyx argues that Harvard nonetheless had an interest in the confidential information provided by SiOnyx to HPK (because it was the same technology that was covered by the patent), and that HPK was unjustly enriched when it misappropriated that information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Harvard, however, has not provided any evidence that it had any interest in that confidential information separate and apart from its interest in the patents licensed to SiOnyx. It points to some evidence tending to show that Mazur was present at the first meeting between SiOnyx\n   and HPK, and that he had collaborated with Carey on the architectures shared with HPK. (ECF 342 Ex. E at 335:3-336:22; ECF 380-2 at 149:18-152:16). Mazur was affiliated with both Harvard and SiOnyx at that time. He stated in his deposition that he represented both Harvard and SiOnyx at the initial meeting. (ECF 380-2 at 149:18-23). But he could only represent Harvard to the extent that Harvard had an interest in the technology conveyed. Harvard has not presented any evidence that Mazur's involvement alone would give them an interest. And the only intellectual-property agreement between Harvard and SiOnyx appears to be the patent-license agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Harvard is correct that the patent-license agreement does not provide a remedy for foreign sales of products developed through misuse of the confidential information provided to HPK or for reputational harm from wrongful use of its intellectual property. (ECF 379 at 4). But that is because Harvard did not bargain for that. Even assuming that the confidential information shared by SiOnyx was developed jointly with Harvard, and that Harvard therefore had some right to determine how it was used, Harvard did not contractually retain that right. If it had wanted SiOnyx to keep information confidential or to use it for only certain purposes, it should have included that in its agreement with SiOnyx. It did not do that. Instead it granted SiOnyx the exclusive right to use the technology covered by the patents according to certain conditions stated in the license. In other words: either the allegedly misused confidential information at issue here is within the scope of the exclusive license agreement (in which case Harvard's rights to it are governed by that license agreement), or it is not covered by the agreement (in which case there is no evidence that Harvard has any right to it at all).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Harvard argues that even if the patent-license agreement provides for an adequate remedy at law, it should be allowed to maintain its unjust-enrichment claims in parallel. While Harvard is correct that courts sometimes allow legal and equitable claims to proceed in parallel at the pleadings state, that is not appropriate here. Again, unjust enrichment is a quasi-contractual claim that can arise when there is no enforceable contract governing the conduct at issue.\n   <em>\n    Broderick v. PNC Mortg.

Mar. 20, 2013). Here, there is no dispute that Harvard's contract with SiOnyx is valid and enforceable.

But the rule, by its terms, expressly allows out-of-court\n   statements made to show motivation. Defendant is correct that, when used to show intent or an emotional condition, the state of mind exception \"has been held not to allow more expansive statements elaborating upon the underlying reasons for the declarant's state of mind.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But that means that Rule 803 cannot be used to show causation of the declarant's state of mind; here, it means Rule 803 could not be invoked to allow testimony about the declarant's reasons for believing that HPK's patents posed a problem. Furthermore, out-of-court statements are routinely admitted pursuant to Rule 803 to show intent, even where intent is the very thing sought to be proved.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The fact that Saylor cannot remember the name or title of the person who actually said it to him-even though it was only two years ago and Godzilla represented a multimillion dollar business deal that abruptly halted-is certainly an avenue open for cross-examination, and may ultimately affect the credibility of the testimony.

Godzilla was a customer of HPK around the time that it terminated its talks with SiOnyx, and a senior manager of HPK testified that he spoke to customers about HPK's patents and showed a graph from a patent to thousands of people at the Photonics Fair. No other patents concerning the technology at issue have materialized as candidates for the \"IP related issue\" that allegedly scared away Godzilla.

(ECF 353 Ex. A at 336:14-22; ECF 353 Ex. B at 176:8-177:23). As they are both seeking to be named as inventors on HPK's patents, their testimony must be corroborated in some way. They both testified that there was no contemporaneous document tending to corroborate their joint invention. (ECF 353 Ex. A at 335:10-15; ECF 353 Ex. B at 177:19-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   Plaintiffs primarily point to Carey's January 17, 2007 email showing the architectures and referring to \"past experiments\" as documentary evidence corroborating the testimony that he and Mazur jointly conceived of those architectures. (ECF 337-3). But there is no indication, either in that email or in the testimony to be corroborated, that those \"past experiments,\" whatever they were, involved Mazur-indeed, the testimony suggests only that there were \"discussions\" about the architectures, not experiments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that both Mazur and Carey testified that Saylor was involved in the architecture conversations, and therefore Saylor could testify as to Mazur's involvement. Apart from the fact that Saylor is another SiOnyx employee and therefore not exactly disinterested (although not seeking to be named as an inventor), SiOnyx has not put forth any actual testimony by Saylor on this point. Because Saylor has not submitted a sworn statement, the Court cannot consider his hypothetical testimony as part of this summary judgment proceeding. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Absent any direct corroboration of Mazur's conception of the confidential architectures, plaintiffs present a hodgepodge of circumstantial evidence tending to show that Mazur was contributing to SiOnyx. First, plaintiffs present evidence that Mazur was the alleged inventor of black silicon in the 1990s and that HPK understood him to be the original inventor of laser-processed black silicon. They further point to evidence that Mazur was affiliated with SiOnyx as an owner and advisory-board member, that he consulted with the company during the period the nondisclosure agreement was in force, and that he presented information on black-silicon technology at the first meeting between SiOnyx and HPK. But plaintiffs do not attempt to show that Mazur (or Carey) contributed to the particular laser texturing that is included in the patents; nor does it argue in its opposition that a contribution to the particular laser texturing disclosed in the patents would, on its own, be sufficient to constitute joint inventorship. Rather, plaintiffs base their inventorship argument on the transmission of the confidential architectures (in particular, the idea that the textured surface should be opposite the light-incident surface).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Mazur's contributions to black-silicon\n   technology (some of which has long been in the public domain) do not speak to the question of whether he in fact conceived of the architectures in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Finally, the fact that HPK copied Mazur on the 2009 emails does not show that HPK thought Mazur was an inventor of the architectures. Mazur had a prior relationship with HPK, was the person to introduce Carey to HPK, and was still affiliated with SiOnyx-copying him on the email could not be viewed by a reasonable jury as corroboration that he conceived of the architectures with Carey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   Even taken together, a reasonable jury could not find that evidence to be clear and convincing proof that Mazur is a co-inventor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, HPK's motion for partial summary judgment that Mazur is not a co-inventor of HPK's patents will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   For the foregoing reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-233\">\n   \u2022 HPK and HC's motion for partial summary judgment that SiOnyx's and Harvard's claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment are barred by the statute of limitations is DENIED;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-234\">\n   \u2022 SiOnyx and Harvard's motion for leave to amend the second amended complaint is DENIED as moot;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-235\">\n   \u2022 SiOnyx's motion for partial summary judgment that HPK breached the nondisclosure agreement is DENIED;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-236\">\n   \u2022 HPK's motion for partial summary judgment on SiOnyx's unjust enrichment claim is GRANTED;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-237\">\n   \u2022 HPK's motion for partial summary judgment on Harvard's unjust enrichment claim is GRANTED;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-238\">\n   \u2022 HC's motion for partial summary judgment on SiOnyx's and Harvard's unjust enrichment claims is GRANTED as to the claim of Harvard and otherwise DENIED;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-239\">\n   \u2022 HPK's motion for partial summary judgment on SiOnyx's claim for consequential damages is DENIED;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-240\">\n   \u2022 HPK's motion for partial summary judgment that Mazur is not a co-inventor is GRANTED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   <strong>\n    So Ordered.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-244\">\n    After the hearing on these motions, defendants collectively filed six additional motions for summary judgment, and plaintiffs filed two additional motions for summary judgment.
