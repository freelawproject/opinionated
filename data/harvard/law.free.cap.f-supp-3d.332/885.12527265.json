Until 2013, the price of silver bullion was set in part through a daily private auction among a small group of silver dealers (\"the Silver Fixing\"). Based on a sophisticated econometric analysis of thousands of price quotes from the silver markets, Plaintiffs alleged that this daily private auction was a cover for a conspiracy among the participating banks, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and Bank of Nova Scotia (together, the \"Fixing Banks\"), to suppress the price for physical silver and silver-denominated financial products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In September 2016, the Court held that Plaintiffs had stated claims against HSBC and Bank of Nova Scotia. Plaintiffs settled with Deutsche Bank for $38 million dollars and what Plaintiffs hoped would be a treasure trove of preserved electronic chat messages among precious metals traders employed by Deutsche Bank and traders at Bank of America, Barclays, Standard Chartered, BNP Paribas, and UBS (the \"Non-Fixing Banks\"). The chat messages, many of which are quoted in the Third Amended Complaint (the \"TAC\") (Dkt. 258), appear to document sharing of proprietary information and episodic attempts to coordinate trading, apparently in the hopes of profiting from resulting movement in the prices of silver and silver-denominated financial instruments. After acquiring these chat messages, Plaintiffs amended their complaint to allege that the Non-Fixing Banks conspired with the Fixing Banks and among themselves to manipulate the Silver Fixing and the silver markets more generally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   But what Plaintiffs represented to be a mother lode of evidence of a vast conspiracy turns out to be less than overwhelming. The Non-Fixing Banks have moved to dismiss on the grounds that the chat messages do not connect them to a conspiracy with the Fixing Banks and do not document any actionable manipulation of the silver markets (among other things). For the reasons that follow, the Court agrees in part. Plaintiffs' allegations of an overarching conspiracy involving the Fixing Banks and Non-Fixing Banks are implausible. The chat messages provide a basis to infer the existence of a more limited conspiracy to episodically manipulate the silver markets, but Plaintiffs lack antitrust standing to bring a claim based on that theory. Plaintiffs also fail to allege market manipulation by any of the Non-Fixing Banks. Thus, the Non-Fixing Banks' motion to dismiss is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   From 1897 to 2014, the price of silver bullion was set through the Silver Fixing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re London Silver Fixing, Ltd., Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271754\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/213/530/#p542\">\n    213 F.Supp.3d 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 542 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    Silver I\n   </em>\n   \").

The TAC alleges a much broader conspiracy to manipulate the markets for physical silver and silver-denominated assets. According to Plaintiffs, Defendants' \"comprehensive strategy\" has three elements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first element is the Silver Fixing scheme described above and addressed at length in\n   <em>\n    Silver I\n   </em>\n   . Relying on chat messages between traders at Deutsche Bank and the other defendants (the \"Deutsche Bank Cooperation Materials\"), the TAC also alleges a scheme to manipulate the \"bid-ask\" spread in the market for physical silver and a scheme to manipulate the silver markets through coordinated trading and information sharing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The TAC also added as defendants a handful of banks that were not involved in the Silver Fixing: Barclays Bank PLC (\"Barclays\"), BNP Paribas Fortis S.A./N.V. (\"BNP Paribas\"), Standard Chartered Bank (\"Standard Chartered\"), and Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiary unit Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. (together, \"BAML\") (collectively, the \"New Defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   One of the means allegedly used by the Non-Fixing Banks to profit from their manipulation of the silver markets was manipulation of bid-ask spreads in the market for physical silver. Plaintiffs allege occasions on which traders at Deutsche Bank and UBS discussed how \"wide\" they would quote prices for 500,000 ounces of silver, settling on a spread of 10 cents. TAC \u00b6 230;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 231 (comparing spreads for different quantities of silver), 240 (\"if they call me in 1 lac [100,000 ounces of silver] I will quote 7-8 cents\"). Traders at Barclays, BNP Paribas, HSBC, and BAML are alleged to have engaged in similar discussions with traders at Deutsche Bank.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 232-43. For example, on July 4, 2008, in a conversation with a trader at Barclays, a London-based Deutsche Bank trader said, \"just be wide.\" TAC \u00b6 239;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 240 (UBS trader told trader at Deutsche Bank \"just quote wider\"). Many of the chats involve a single trader at Deutsche Bank, who communicated with individual traders at each\n   of the Non-Fixing Banks and was aware that the information he shared was proprietary and could be used to gain an advantage over other market participants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 238 (\"[UBS]: 10 cents is ridiculous.\" \"[Deutsche Bank]: u shudnt have told me hahahaa[sic]hahahaha: D [smiley face].\"). As the TAC explains, \"wider spreads generated increased profits from Defendants' illegitimate market making activities at the expense of Plaintiffs and the Class by removing price competition and requiring that market participants pay an artificial price set by the cartel.\" TAC \u00b6 243.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The TAC also alleges collusion in the silver markets by traders at each of the Non-Fixing Banks. Numerous chats between a trader at UBS and a trader at Deutsche Bank describe efforts to coordinate positions, TAC \u00b6\u00b6 253, 279; to time coordinated trades for maximum market impact, TAC \u00b6 252 (\"if we are correct and do it together, we screw other people harder\"); and to employ manipulative techniques artificially to push the price of silver-denominated assets up or down, TAC \u00b6\u00b6 256-57, 259 (the \"blade\" and the \"muscle\"), 264 (\"sniping\"). Several of the chats between traders at UBS and Deutsche Bank refer to collusion with traders at other banks. For example, on March 31, 2011, a UBS trader shared a stop-loss position with Deutsche Bank and said \"in one hour im gonna call reinforcement,\" i.e., another trader to help move the market price and trigger the stop-loss order. TAC \u00b6 251. On June 8, 2011, the same UBS trader told the same Deutsche Bank trader that \"we need to grow our mafia a lil get a third position involved,\" to which the Deutsche Bank trader responded, \"ok calling barx.\" TAC \u00b6 250. On another occasion, the same Deutsche Bank trader added the UBS trader to a chat with traders at HSBC and Barclays, to which the UBS trader responded, \"wow this is going to be the mother of all chats.\" TAC \u00b6 274;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 280 (describing information possibly learned from discussions with Bank of Nova Scotia).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Traders at Barclays also shared information with Deutsche Bank. In addition to sharing information regarding bid-ask spreads,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 233, a Barclays trader discussed another bank's attempt to \"spoof\" the silver markets on July 4, 2008. TAC \u00b6 263;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 264 (Deutsche Bank and Barclays discussed \"sniping\"). On other occasions, traders at Barclays and Deutsche Bank compared positions and coordinated purchases. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 291-96. In one chat, a Barclays trader, referring to himself and a trader at Deutsche Bank, said \"we are one team one dream.\" TAC \u00b6 295. Chats between Deutsche Bank and UBS also reference collusion with traders at Barclays.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 250, 274.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Deutsche Bank Cooperation Materials also include messages between a trader at Deutsche Bank and traders at BNP Paribas. Several chats describe real-time sharing of market positions and conditions including bid-ask spreads quoted by BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank's position heading into the Silver Fixing. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 236, 298-99, 306-07. Two of the chats between Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas reference collusive trading techniques.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 300 (BNP Paribas trader described taking the \"bulldozer\" out on a prior occasion-potentially a reference to triggering stop-loss orders), 310 (BNP Paribas trader suggested to Deutsche Bank trader that they go \"smash\" the Silver Fixing).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A trader at Standard Chartered (and formerly of HSBC) also shared proprietary information with a trader at Deutsche Bank. The TAC includes only three chat messages involving Standard Chartered, but those chats include sharing of current\n   trading positions, TAC \u00b6\u00b6 286-88, 290, and Deutsche Bank's position in the Silver Fixing, TAC \u00b6 289.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, the TAC alleges six conversations between Deutsche Bank and BAML. One of the chats includes an exchange of information regarding bid-ask spreads. TAC \u00b6 301. Deutsche Bank and BAML also shared information about the price level of stop-loss orders in the market, TAC \u00b6\u00b6 301-02, and their current positions in silver-denominated derivatives, TAC \u00b6 303.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \"CFTC\") and Department of Justice have recently undertaken enforcement actions directly relevant to Plaintiffs' claims against the Non-Fixing Banks. On January 29, 2018, the CFTC announced a settlement with UBS to resolve allegations that UBS traders \"spoofed\" the markets for precious metals and collaborated with traders at another financial institution to trigger stop-loss orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 344 Ex. 1 (\"UBS CFTC Order\"). The CFTC consent order references specific instances of manipulation in the silver markets, including the COMEX futures market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UBS CFTC Order at 3-5. UBS agreed to pay a $15 million monetary penalty to the CFTC. UBS CFTC Order at 11. Deutsche Bank settled similar claims with the CFTC on the same day for $30 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 344 Ex.2 at 3-7, 13. The CFTC has also initiated civil proceedings against three individual traders at Deutsche Bank and UBS for alleged spoofing in the COMEX futures markets between 2008 and 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkts. 344 Exs.4, 5. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice has charged two BAML traders with commodities fraud (among other things) in connection with alleged spoofing in the precious metals futures markets, including the COMEX silver futures market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 344 Ex.6 (the \"BAML Complaint\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs are individuals and entities that transacted in physical silver and silver-denominated financial instruments during the class period. There are many silver-based derivatives, but Plaintiffs allege they traded in physical silver or silver bullion; Chicago Board of Trade (\"CBOT\") silver futures; COMEX silver futures; COMEX \"miNY\" silver futures; New York Stock Exchange LIFFE mini silver futures; and CBOT \"mini\" silver futures. Appendix D to the TAC includes a list of days on which the price of silver was allegedly affected by Defendants' manipulative conduct on which Plaintiffs traded. The list in Appendix D does not specify whether Plaintiffs' alleged injury was the result of manipulation of the Silver Fixing, manipulation of bid-ask spreads for physical silver, or manipulative trading. The TAC also does not identify the counterparties to Plaintiffs' transactions. It is unclear whether any of the Plaintiffs dealt directly with any of the Defendants-much less dealt with a Defendant in an allegedly manipulated transaction or in the immediate wake of a manipulated transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Non-Fixing Banks have moved to dismiss the TAC. They argue that the TAC's allegations of a \"comprehensive\" conspiracy among the Fixing Banks and\n   Non-Fixing Banks are not plausible. The connection between an agreement to depress the Fix Price and information-sharing and collusion in the silver markets is not clear. Because of the Fixing Banks' complete control over the Silver Fixing, other conspirators and collusive trading were unnecessary to profit from foreknowledge of the Silver Fixing. Joint Mem. (Dkt. 303) at 9-10. None of the chat messages reference an agreement with the Non-Fixing Banks to fix the Silver Fixing. Joint Mem. at 11-12. As the Non-Fixing Banks point out, they are conspicuously absent from the TAC's allegations of parallel and below-market trading: \"Of the roughly 850 trading days on which Plaintiffs allege the occurrence of spot price manipulation, Plaintiffs assert that two of the Non-Fixing Banks collectively submitted lower quotes around the Silver Fixing on just six purportedly illustrative days (representing less than 1% of the sample). Joint Mem. at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Non-Fixing Banks also argue that Plaintiffs lack antitrust standing as to the Non-Fixing Banks. Because the Non-Fixing Banks' involvement in the conspiracy differs in important respects from the Fixing Banks, the Non-Fixing Banks contend that they are differently situated. They argue that because no Plaintiff alleges that he traded with the Non-Fixing Banks, there is only an indirect connection between Plaintiffs' trades and the market manipulation identified in the Deutsche Bank Cooperation Materials. Joint Mem. at 25. For the same reason, they assert that Plaintiffs' injuries are attenuated from the alleged collusion and are highly speculative. Joint Mem. at 26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   With respect to Plaintiffs' claims pursuant to the CEA, the Non-Fixing Banks argue that Plaintiffs' claims are untimely because Plaintiffs were on notice of possible manipulation of the silver markets more than two years before they sought leave to amend in November 2017. Assuming Plaintiffs' claims are not time-barred, the Non-Fixing Banks contend in the alternative that Plaintiffs' allegations are insufficient because they do not adequately allege that the Non-Fixing Banks intended to manipulate the silver futures markets or that they were successful in doing so. The Non-Fixing Banks also contend that Plaintiffs' CEA claims are impermissibly extraterritorial because there is no alleged impact on a\n   <em>\n    domestic\n   </em>\n   market from the Non-Fixing Banks' manipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Failing these defenses, certain of the Non-Fixing Banks contend the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over them.

Even though the TAC plausibly alleges that the Fixing Banks conspired to depress the Fix Price, it does not explain why the Non-Fixing Banks, which are competitors and counterparties, would be in on the agreement. The coordinated trading alleged in the TAC lacks a connection to suppression of the Fix Price and, in fact, could have made it more difficult to profit from foreknowledge of the Fix Price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The TAC does not include any direct evidence of an agreement between the Non-Fixing Banks and the Fixing Banks involving the Silver Fix. The chat messages that reference the Silver Fixing do not reference or suggest an overarching scheme to depress the Silver Fix and many are inconsistent with Plaintiffs' theory that the Non-Fixing Banks had foreknowledge of the Fix Price. For example, chats between Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas appear to involve sharing by Deutsche Bank of its anticipated position heading into the Silver Fixing. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 297-98, 310. The information in these messages could have been used by BNP Paribas to predict the direction of the Silver Fixing, but the messages do not suggest that BNP Paribas was part of an agreement to manipulate the Fix Price, and the fact that this information was worth sharing suggests that the result of the Silver Fixing was otherwise uncertain to BNP Paribas. Other chats reference apparently unilateral or bilateral attempts to manipulate the Silver Fixing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 307 ( [Deutsche Bank]: \"HE SPOOFED IT TO BUY IT AND I THINK HE JUST SOLD IT TO BUY IT ... JUST LIKE THEM TO BID IT UP BEFORE THE FIX THEN GO IN AS A SELLER....\"), 308 ( [UBS]: \"oh ok did I tell u I saw a\n   300k loss on the fixing before too ... started pushing too early lol\"), 310 ( [Deutsche Bank]: \"I got the fix in 3 minutes\" [BNP Paribas]: \"I'm bearish.... Let's go and smash it together\"), 311 ( [Deutsche Bank]: \"well you told me too but i told no one u just said you sold on fix\" [UBS]: \"we smashed it good\"), 322. A few of the chats describe the results of the Silver Fixing, essentially after-action reports, and suggest that the chat participants did not have foreknowledge of the Fix Price.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 289 ( [Standard Chartered]: \"what was that all aboyt\" [Deutsche Bank]: \"silver fix?\" [Standard Chartered]: \"yeah\" [Deutsche Bank]: \"I had 2 m to sell no one wanted it.\"). The fact that the Non-Fixing Banks agreed, on occasion, to \"smash\" or \"push\" the Silver Fixing is inconsistent with being members of a broader conspiracy to depress the Fix Price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   It is also hard to understand why the Fixing Banks, major market-makers with their own trading operations and collective control over the Silver Fixing, would involve numerous other market makers in their scheme.\n   <em>\n    In re Zinc Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304822\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/155/337/#p372\">\n    155 F.Supp.3d at 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the fact that defendant and affiliated entities controlled a significant market share made it less likely they would involve non-affiliated entities in an anticompetitive scheme). This is particularly true because in the zero-sum world of commodities trading, the other banks were potentially counterparties at whose expense the Fixing Banks would have sought to profit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The manipulative techniques described in the Deutsche Bank Cooperation Materials also lack a connection to Plaintiffs' theory that the Fixing Banks conspired to depress the Fix Price. Coordinated trading could further the Fixing Banks' alleged conspiracy by masking otherwise suspicious changes in the price of silver-denominated assets. But the chats are not direct or circumstantial evidence of this theory. Because Plaintiffs did not include the time of the messages on which the TAC relies, it is impossible to tell from the TAC whether the manipulative trades being discussed were timed to conceal a reversion in the Fix Price.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The chats describe tactics that could move prices up or down and therefore are not necessarily consistent with a conspiracy, the goal of which was to suppress prices.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , TAC \u00b6\u00b6 257-59 (discussing the \"muscle\" and \"blade\" strategies, which could provide \"artificial support for silver prices\" and recommending that a trader hold-off on manipulation because \"its gonna go fast like rollercoaster going up\"). \"Spoofing,\"-placing and then canceling orders to give an appearance of demand at a given price-can create artificial price pressure in either direction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 261 (spoofing causes artificial prices \"either above or below where the market was trading\"). \"Pushing,\" \"smashing,\" and\n   \"hammering\" silver prices cause prices to fall (or to increase, TAC \u00b6\u00b6 307, 312), but are profitable because a trader \"pushing\" the market can trade at an artificial price, knowing that prices will revert to normal post-manipulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 307-09, 320-21 (Deutsche Bank and UBS conspired to \"push silver prices down through stop-loss orders to generate illegitimate profits by trading in advance of the 'wave' created when prices shot back up.\").

The TAC does not link the New Defendants to this pattern of below market quotes.

Whether these communications are sufficient to prove a single, unified conspiracy is a question for summary\n   judgment or trial. As Judge Schofield explained in\n   <em>\n    FOREX III\n   </em>\n   , it is possible that bilateral or group chats were merely opportunistic attempts at collusion-rather than a part of an overarching conspiracy-but it is also plausible that the communications are evidence of a broader agreement. \"Questions as to each Defendant's participation in the conspiracy and the conspiracy's scope may be raised later in litigation, but do not merit dismissal at this phase.\"\n   <em>\n    FOREX III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205108131\">\n    2016 WL 5108131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4. Finally, Defendants contend the chat messages show sharing of price and order information but not market manipulation.

In a benchmark-fixing case the impact of the manipulated benchmark on the financial instruments traded by the plaintiff is relatively clear. For example, and as relevant here, the Fix Price is the price for physical silver, and the price of physical silver has a 99.85% correlation to the price of silver futures traded on COMEX.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 137;\n   <em>\n    Silver I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271754\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/213/530/#p542\">\n    213 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   553 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FOREX III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205108131\">\n    2016 WL 5108131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9. Even in cases in which the benchmark is not the sole determinant of prices, there is frequently a mathematically-defined relationship between prices in the affected market and the benchmark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20685570\">\n    2017 WL 685570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (describing mathematical relationship between Euribor and CME-traded futures contracts). By contrast, the effect of the Defendants' coordinated trading and information sharing is undefined, both in the manipulated market (which, as noted previously, is not specified) and in related markets.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 263 (\"[Deutsche Bank]: did u see the spoof ... when he called ... the futures went a buck wide.\"). Plaintiffs have made no effort to explain, in concrete terms, the impact of spoofing, smashing, or pushing on the various markets for silver derivatives in which they traded; nor have they identified which silver markets were allegedly manipulated. The TAC's vague allegations of causation are particularly problematic because it appears to the Court that any impact on the market may be transient by design. For example, in order to spoof the market, a trader submits false trades, temporarily driving the market price up or down and enabling the trader to purchase or sell at an artificial price. The trader profits when the impact of the spoof on prices dissipates and he or she is able to repurchase or sell the position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 307 (\"[Deutsche Bank]: HE SPOOFED IT TO BUY IT AND I THINK HE JUST SOLD IT TO BUY IT ... JUST LIKE THEM TO BID IT UP BEFORE THE FIX THEN GO IN AS A SELLER....\"). Put differently, in a highly liquid, broad market, manipulative trading is highly unlikely to have a persistent impact on market prices. It is therefore unclear, and the TAC alleges nothing to make it clear, the extent to which class members were injured by Defendants' manipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The fact that Plaintiffs are umbrella purchasers makes the causal connection between their injury and Defendants' manipulation even less clear. In\n   <em>\n    Gelboim\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit understood there to be little difference, if any, between plaintiffs\n   who purchased directly from the defendants and umbrella plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gelboim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5916444\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/759/#p781\">\n    823 F.3d at 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[a]t first glance ... there appears to be no difference in the injury alleged by those who dealt in LIBOR-denominated instruments, whether their transactions were conducted directly or indirectly with the Banks\"). Because the benchmark price has a defined relationship to the affected market, there is not a significant difference between class-members who transact with the defendants at the manipulated price and class-members who transact with other market-participants.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5916444\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/759/#p781\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    CHF LIBOR\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419351\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/277/521/\">\n    277 F.Supp.3d at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Class members who traded directly with the Defendants during an episode of manipulation experienced the greatest distortion in prices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether class members who traded minutes or hours or days later were injured depends on the persistence of the impact of manipulation on the market. The TAC includes no allegations relevant to that question and, as explained above, the economics of manipulative trading on a broad, highly liquid market suggest that the impact on prices is likely to be temporally-limited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   It is also likely that there are numerous intervening causative factors between Plaintiffs' trades and Defendants manipulative trading. The likelihood of intervening causative factors is greater in this case than in other similar cases.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Platinum &amp; Palladium Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201169626\">\n    2017 WL 1169626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *22 (quoting\n   <em>\n    LIBOR VI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207378980\">\n    2016 WL 7378980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16 ) (\"[P]laintiffs who did not purchase directly from defendants continue to face the same hurdle: they made their own decisions to incorporate LIBOR into their transactions, over which defendants had no control, in which defendants had no input, and from which defendants did not profit.\").

Recognizing the potential\n   for open-ended liability in cases involving umbrella purchasers of financial instruments, Judge Schofield focused on the defendants' relative control over the affected markets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FOREX III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205108131\">\n    2016 WL 5108131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9. Judge Schofield's \"market control\" test has gained traction in this district \"as a proxy for the question of direct causation\" for class-members who purchased financial instruments on an exchange such as COMEX or CBOT.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LIBOR VI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207378980\">\n    2016 WL 7378980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16 ;\n   <em>\n    CHF LIBOR\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419351\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/277/521/\">\n    277 F.Supp.3d at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court agrees. Where the defendants substantially control the market-in\n   <em>\n    FOREX III\n   </em>\n   , the complaint alleged that the defendants controlled 90% of the market,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FOREX III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205108131\">\n    2016 WL 5108131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 -there is little risk of disproportionate liability. In such a market, although in a technical sense the plaintiffs may not have traded directly with the defendants, the defendants are, de facto, \"the market,\" and their potential liability is, therefore, in proportion to their economic control of the market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The TAC does not allege market control by the Non-Fixing Defendants. According to the TAC, \"UBS was the third most active market maker in the silver spot market\" during the class period. TAC \u00b6 76. \"Barclays was the eleventh most active U.S. market maker in the silver spot market.\" TAC \u00b6 89. \"Standard Chartered was the eighth most active U.S. market maker in the silver spot market.\" TAC \u00b6 98. The TAC does not include similar allegations about the role of BNP Paribas or BAML in the physical silver markets. In all events, this information does not shed much light on the Non-Fixing Banks' role in the exchange-traded silver futures markets. At the risk of stating the obvious, the Non-Fixing Banks' role/influence on the spot market for physical silver has no necessary relationship to their role in the futures markets. Even as to physical silver, the TAC gives no indication of any of the Non-Fixing Banks' influence relative to other participants in the market. The physical silver market may be roughly equally divided among a dozen market makers or there may be a few giants and a much larger number of bit players; the TAC leaves the Court guessing. Any inference of market control is further undermined by the fact that nothing in the chat messages indicates which futures and options markets were being manipulated.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , TAC \u00b6\u00b6 301 (discussion of wide \"vols\" between BAML and Deutsche Bank traders without any indication of which silver-denominated instrument they were discussing), 303 (\"Somejackass [sic], ... sold me 1mm ozs of 1 week 35 silver call at 29 vol yesterday\" but no indication on which futures or options market the complained-of trade occurred.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In sum, the TAC provides no support for Plaintiffs' argument that they have suffered a direct injury from the Non-Fixing Banks' manipulation of the silver markets. Although this is an independently adequate basis to find that Plaintiffs are not efficient enforcers, the other efficient enforcer factors also weigh against Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Existence of More Direct Victims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Class-members who traded directly with the Non-Fixing Banks were more directly injured than Plaintiffs. As discussed above, in a benchmark-fixing case, there is little difference between direct and umbrella purchasers because benchmark-manipulation affects all market participants equally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Platinum &amp; Palladium Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201169626\">\n    2017 WL 1169626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *23. That is not true with episodic manipulation of individual trades because the impact of the manipulation is not clear, and there is no allegation that the episodic manipulation had a persistent effect on price. Market\n   participants who were counterparties to the Non-Fixing Banks in the physical silver market during a period of manipulation would presumably have experienced the maximum impact of the manipulation. With respect to manipulation of exchange-traded silver-denominated financial instruments, the most directly impacted class members would be class members who were counterparties or traded during or immediately after the Non-Fixing Banks' manipulation. The TAC includes no allegations from which the Court could infer that Plaintiffs were counterparties to the Non-Fixing Banks' manipulative trades in the silver derivatives markets or that Plaintiffs traded with the Non-Fixing Banks in the market for physical silver. Accordingly, this factor does not favor Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    (c) Speculative Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   This case would present difficult damages issues against the Non-Fixing Banks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In order to determine damages, the parties would be required to reconstruct a hypothetical market in which the Non-Fixing Banks did not engage in episodic manipulation of the silver market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CHF LIBOR\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419351\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/277/521/\">\n    277 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   563 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Platinum &amp; Palladium Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201169626\">\n    2017 WL 1169626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *23-24 ;\n   <em>\n    Sullivan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20685570\">\n    2017 WL 685570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *19.

The Non-Fixing Banks have moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' CEA claims. They contend that Plaintiffs were on notice of possible manipulation in the silver futures markets by January 2014 at the latest.

The Non-Fixing Banks rely on three statements by the CFTC in September 2008, February 2013, and September 2013, which, they contend, put Plaintiffs on inquiry notice of manipulation in the silver markets. The 2008 press release reads, in its entirety: \"In September 2008 the CFTC confirmed that its Division of Enforcement has been investigating complaints of misconduct in the silver market.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 345 &amp; n.190. The press release includes no information about the financial products involved, the time period of the alleged misconduct, or the markets in which the misconduct allegedly occurred.

Chilton's discussion of the Silver Fixing might be a basis for the Court to find that Plaintiffs were on notice of manipulation of the Silver Fixing, but the statement has little relevance to Plaintiffs' CEA claims against the Non-Fixing Banks, which seek to recover for artificial prices caused by episodic market manipulation. The CFTC's September 2013 closure notice is more directly on point and includes more specificity than the 2008 announcement, but because the CFTC concluded that there \"is not a viable basis to bring an enforcement action with respect to any firm or its employees,\" the Court cannot say that a reasonable investor would have been on notice that he had probably been injured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 345 &amp; n.191.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The other articles cited by the Non-Fixing Banks also relate to manipulation of the Silver Fixing or are too general to put Plaintiffs on inquiry notice.

As conceptualized by the Court in\n   <em>\n    North Sea Brent Crude Oil\n   </em>\n   , the extraterritoriality analysis under the CEA has two parts: at step one the Court must determine whether the plaintiff's claim involves a \"domestic transaction.\" Assuming this requirement is satisfied, the Court must proceed to step two and consider\n   whether the claims are \"so predominantly foreign as to be impermissibly extraterritorial,\"\n   <em>\n    Parkcentral\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180621\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/198/\">\n    763 F.3d at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re North Sea Brent Crude Oil Futures Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273527\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/298/#p307\">\n    256 F.Supp.3d at 308-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The parties dispute the framework for the Court's analysis and, unsurprisingly, the result at each step. The Non-Fixing Banks contend that both the plaintiffs' and defendants' transactions must be \"domestic\" under\n   <em>\n    Loginovskaya\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    . See\n   </em>\n   Joint Supp. Mem. (Dkt. 352) at 2. Because Plaintiffs do not allege that they were counterparties to the Non-Fixing Banks' alleged manipulative trades, the Non-Fixing Banks' position is that the transactions at issue are \"domestic\" only if both the manipulative trading activity (e.g., spoofing) and the transaction in which the Plaintiff was injured are domestic. Even assuming Plaintiffs' claims involve a \"domestic\" transaction, the Non-Fixing Banks contend that the underlying conduct is so predominantly foreign that, under\n   <em>\n    Parkcentral\n   </em>\n   , the CEA does not apply. Joint Mem. at 46. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, take the position that the extraterritoriality analysis begins and ends with whether their transactions are \"domestic.\" The parties agree that Plaintiffs transacted on COMEX and so, according to Plaintiffs, that is the end of the analysis. Opp'n at 39-40. Plaintiffs contend\n   <em>\n    Parkcentral\n   </em>\n   does not apply to the CEA because Plaintiffs transacted on a \"domestic exchange,\" rather than through domestic, over-the-counter transactions. Opp'n at 39-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Although the issue is a close one, the Court finds that the relevant transaction for purposes of Section 22 is the transaction in which the plaintiff is injured-in this case Plaintiffs' trades of COMEX and CBOT futures and options. So far as the Court is aware, this issue has been squarely presented only once before, in\n   <em>\n    In re North Sea Brent Crude Oil Futures Litigation\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    . See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273527\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/298/#p307\">\n    256 F.Supp.3d at 308-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (assuming, without deciding, that the relevant transaction is the futures or options transaction in which plaintiff is injured). Nevertheless, the result clearly follows from the text of Section 22 and the Supreme Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   . As relevant here, Section 22 provides a private right of action to \"[a]ny [ ] person ... who purchased or sold [any contract of sale of any commodity for future delivery (or option on such contract or any commodity) or any swap] ... if the violation constitutes ... (ii) a manipulation of the price of any such contract or swap or the price of the commodity underlying such contract or swap.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2025\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(D)(ii). The statute is concerned with the protection of market participants injured by manipulation of the price of the \"contract or swap\" itself. As Judge Carter explained in\n   <em>\n    North Sea Brent Crude Oil\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court understood similar language in the Exchange Act to be focused on the plaintiff's\n   transaction, rather than the manipulation itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re North Sea Brent Crude Oil Futures Litig.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273527\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/298/#p307\">\n    256 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   308 (citing\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455280,3644388\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/247/\">\n    561 U.S. at 266-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455280,3644388\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/247/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   );\n   <em>\n    but see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Loginovskaya v.

(describing Section 22 as \"an explicit, statutory right of action framed in terms of prohibited conduct\"). Because the \"manipulation\" referenced in Section 25(a)(1)(D)(ii) is not necessarily manipulative trading (i.e., a transaction), the alternative understanding of the statute would untether the analysis from a \"transaction\" as required by\n   <em>\n    Loginovskaya\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Having determined that the relevant transaction is the plaintiff's, there is no dispute that these Plaintiffs' claims involve \"domestic transactions,\" and the Court proceeds to step two of the analysis.

Because\n   <em>\n    Parkcentral\n   </em>\n   considered a \"domestic transaction,\" rather than a transaction on a \"domestic exchange,\" Plaintiffs contend it is distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument is unconvincing, and likely foreclosed by the Second Circuit's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Tower Research Capital\n   </em>\n   . As\n   <em>\n    Tower Research Capital\n   </em>\n   explained, the Supreme Court's reference to transactions on a \"domestic exchange\" is rooted in the language of the Exchange Act, which applies to deceptive conduct \"in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange....\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) ;\n   <em>\n    Tower Research Capital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516973\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/60/#p66\">\n    890 F.3d at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The language of the CEA is different. Section 22 does not reference an exchange. Instead, it creates a private right of action for four categories of injured persons: plaintiffs who \"(A) received trading advice from Defendants for a fee; (B) traded through Defendants or deposited money with Defendants in connection with a commodities trade; (C) purchased from or sold to Defendants or placed an order for purchase or sale of a commodity through them; or (D) [suffered actual damages resulting from] certain market manipulation activities in connection with the purchase or sale of a commodity contract.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Starshinova v.

Under Plaintiffs' reading, a course of conduct that is entirely foreign-undertaken by foreign actors, executed in foreign transactions, and intended to have an impact primarily on foreign interests-could be deemed domestic, and subject to U.S. law, simply because it had an effect on a U.S.-based transaction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parkcentral\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180621\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/198/\">\n    763 F.3d at 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that such a holding would \"seriously undermine\" the presumption against extraterritoriality).\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   's most colorful passage addresses this approach directly: \"the presumption against extraterritorial application would be a craven watchdog indeed if it retreated to its kennel whenever\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   domestic activity is involved in the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455280,3644388\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/247/\">\n    561 U.S. at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455280,3644388\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/247/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The TAC's factual allegations against these three defendants have only an attenuated connection to Plaintiffs' domestic transactions. The factual allegations against Barclays relate to thirteen chat conversations in which Barclays traders shared confidential information or coordinated trading strategies with traders at Deutsche Bank.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Michael S. Feldberg (\"Feldberg Declr.\") (Dkt. 313) Ex. C. The chat messages involve traders in London and Singapore. It is entirely speculative whether the silver products discussed in the chat messages include COMEX or CBOT futures or options; Plaintiffs have made no factual allegations from which the Court could infer that these traders manipulated COMEX- or CBOT-traded products directly. Plaintiffs\n   also do not allege they were the counterparties to any of the manipulative conduct described in the chats. The only connection between the chats and Plaintiffs' domestic transactions appears to be the alleged \"ripple\" effect of the manipulation referenced in the chats on the COMEX and CBOT markets. Even that potential impact on Plaintiffs' domestic transactions is not free from doubt. Plaintiffs do not allege the frequency of the Non-Fixing Banks' manipulation, the persistence of the impact of episodic manipulation in the relevant silver market (much less in related silver markets), or that Plaintiffs traded close in time to the alleged manipulation (other than a few occasions on which the chats took place on the same day as Plaintiffs traded).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   What has been said about Barclays is true for Standard Chartered and BNP Paribas as well: there are only eight chat messages involving BNP Paribas traders,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   BNP Paribas Supp. Mem. (Dkt. 306) at 1, and no indication that any of the misconduct discussed in the chats involved COMEX- or CBOT-traded products,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Joshua A. Goldberg (\"Goldberg Declr.\") (Dkt. 314) Ex. A. For example, the most egregious message involving BNP Paribas states: \"CANT WAIT FOR ANOTHER DAY WHEN WE GET THE BULLDOZER OUT THE GARAGE ON GOLD OR SIL, THEY ARE MY FIRST PORT OF CALL HAHAHAHAHAH LET ME KNOW WHEN THEY START QUOPTING [sic] 10K'S THO.\" TAC \u00b6 300. But Plaintiffs do not allege that the trader ever, in fact, took his \"bulldozer\" out of the garage relative to silver, and if he did, in which silver market, or when the alleged manipulation occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 286-90;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Hannah Chouikhi (\"Chouikhi Declr.\") (Dkt. 317) Ex. A. The chats describe sharing information,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 286-90, but do not describe any particular manipulative trading tactics or reference particular silver products (much less domestic silver products). The only inference that can be gleaned from the messages is that BNP Paribas and Standard Chartered traders, like Barclays traders, engaged in what appears to be wrongful conduct abroad. How or whether that conduct affected any domestic transactions, let alone Plaintiffs' specifically, is entirely speculative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Plaintiffs do not respond directly to these arguments. Instead, they cite to three categories of evidence that are either inapposite under\n   <em>\n    Parkcentral\n   </em>\n   or too general to be persuasive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 40. Although Plaintiffs claim the \"defendants\" (which defendant is not specified) traded COMEX futures during the class period, they provide no factual allegations to substantiate this claim or to link Defendants' COMEX trades to the manipulation at issue in their CEA claims. Plaintiffs contend the \"defendants\" \"conspired to illegitimately increase profits on their silver trading positions,\" but the paragraphs of the TAC cited for support concern the Silver Fixing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 40 (citing TAC \u00b6\u00b6 14, 164-67, and 172-75). For the reasons given above (at length), Plaintiffs' allegations regarding the Non-Fixing Banks' involvement in a conspiracy to manipulate the Silver Fixing are implausible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Next, Plaintiffs focus on the domestic trading operations maintained by UBS, Barclays,\n   BNP Paribas, and Standard Chartered during the class period. The TAC includes no factual allegations that U.S.-based traders from Barclays, BNP Paribas, or Standard Chartered were involved in the manipulation alleged in the TAC; U.S. based traders are included in none of the referenced chats. Finally, Plaintiffs rely on the chats themselves, and a blanket reference to a \"conspiracy,\" but, for the reasons discussed above, the chats involving Standard Chartered, Barclays, and BNP Paribas do not reference manipulation connected to the Plaintiffs' domestic transactions. Furthermore, the existence of a conspiracy writ large does not connect these Plaintiffs to the more specific allegations of CEA violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   By contrast, there are sufficient facts alleged (although barely) for the Court to find that Plaintiffs' CEA claims against UBS and BAML are plausibly domestic. Although the chats involving UBS and BAML do not specifically reference manipulation of COMEX or CBOT-futures (or any domestic market for that matter), recent enforcement actions by the CFTC and Department of Justice indicate that UBS and BAML traders manipulated the domestic markets in which Plaintiffs traded. These allegations are sufficient-at this stage-to allege that Plaintiffs claims are not \"so predominantly foreign as to be impermissibly extraterritorial.\"\n   <em>\n    Parkcentral\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180621\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/198/\">\n    763 F.3d at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On January 29, 2018, UBS settled the CFTC's allegations that UBS traders manipulated the price of precious metals futures contracts, including silver-denominated futures on COMEX, the same platform allegedly used by the Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UBS CFTC Order at 2-3. The conduct alleged in the CFTC's accompanying order is similar to the conduct alleged in the TAC, and the Order appears to quote some of the same chat messages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UBS CFTC Order at 5-6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Letter from Eric J. Stock (Dkt. 347) at 2 (acknowledging on behalf of UBS that the UBS CFTC Order describes some of the same incidents as in the TAC). The conduct alleged in the Order includes \"spoofing\" futures markets, coordinated trading, and coordinated price manipulation intended to trigger stop-loss orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UBS CFTC Order at 3 (\"Generally, the Traders placed relatively large bids or offers in the futures market with the intent to cancel before execution.\"), 4 (describing incident in which a UBS trader colluded with a trader at another bank to trigger a stop-loss order in the precious metals futures market).\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, the Department of Justice indicted two BAML traders who are alleged to have \"spoofed\" COMEX futures between 2010 and 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BAML Complaint at 1-2. The spoofing alleged by the Department of Justice includes silver futures. BAML Complaint \u00b6 15. This conduct, involving manipulation of the domestic markets using the same tactics and involving some of the same individuals as alleged in the TAC, is sufficient at this stage to establish that Plaintiffs' claims against UBS and BAML are not \"predominantly foreign.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The more prominent theory is that the Non-Fixing Banks conspired with the Fixing Banks to suppress the Silver Fixing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 398, 401-02. The TAC also alleges that the Non-Fixing Banks manipulated the silver markets through a campaign of episodic market manipulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 399-402. For the reasons the Court has already discussed, the alleged connection between the Non-Fixing Banks and a conspiracy to suppress the Silver Fixing is implausible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 896-901. To summarize briefly: the chat messages referencing the Silver Fixing describe bilateral and unilateral attempts to manipulate the Silver Fixing and are inconsistent with a broader conspiracy to suppress the Fix Price; Plaintiffs' econometric analysis does not tie the Non-Fixing Banks to a conspiracy to suppress the Fix Price;\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, the manipulative conduct referenced in the chat messages was profitable to the traders involved regardless of whether they also were part of a conspiracy to suppress the Fix Price. Accordingly, because Plaintiffs have not plausibly linked the Non-Fixing Banks to a conspiracy to suppress the Silver Fixing, Plaintiffs also have not plausibly alleged a CEA claim based on that theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that they suffered actual damages from episodic manipulation of the silver markets. Plaintiffs' allegations of the impact of Defendants' manipulation on prices in the COMEX futures market (or CBOT futures market) depend almost entirely on an econometric analysis of the impact of the Silver Fixing on the price of COMEX futures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 36 (citing econometric analysis of the impact of the Silver Fixing on other markets contained in TAC \u00b6\u00b6 143-98). Stripped of this analysis-which\n   is irrelevant to Plaintiffs' episodic manipulation theory-the TAC alleges essentially no connection between Defendants' manipulative conduct and trades by the Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs have made no factual allegations of the frequency of episodic manipulation or the predicted impact of episodic manipulation on silver prices. For similar reasons, and even assuming Plaintiffs alleged actual damages, they have not alleged a connection between the alleged episodic market manipulation by the Non-Fixing Banks and the existence of artificial prices in the COMEX silver futures market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In order to plead \"actual damages\" under Section 22, Plaintiffs must make \"a showing of actual injury caused by the violation.\"\n   <em>\n    CHF LIBOR\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419351\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/277/521/\">\n    277 F.Supp.3d at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Harry v.

As the Second Circuit recently explained in\n   <em>\n    Total Gas\n   </em>\n   , the relative difficulty of pleading actual damages depends on the predictability of the impact of the defendant's manipulation on a market and the connection between that market and the plaintiff's trades. 889 F.3d at 112 (\"In some contexts, the alleged facts can be quite general statements....

Although this statement is a truism to a degree, it is borne out by other benchmark-fixing cases in this district. In\n   <em>\n    LIBOR I\n   </em>\n   , Judge Buchwald concluded that allegations of persistent suppression of the LIBOR benchmark were sufficient to allege actual injury in LIBOR-denominated assets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LIBOR I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3897633\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/935/666/#p697\">\n    935 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   718-19 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Silver I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271754\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/213/530/#p542\">\n    213 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   564-65 ;\n   <em>\n    In Platinum &amp; Palladium Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201169626\">\n    2017 WL 1169626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *29 (concluding plaintiffs adequately alleged actual damages in a persistent suppression case by cross-referencing the days on which they traded with a preliminary list of \"suppression[ ] dates\");\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20685570\">\n    2017 WL 685570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *31.

Manipulative trading strategies like \"spoofing\" or triggering stop-loss orders depend for their profitability on a reversion of prices to the market-level, meaning that the period of artificiality may be brief. Market liquidity is also relevant, because the impact of manipulation in highly liquid markets (like the silver markets,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6 125), is likely to be less than the impact of manipulation in less liquid or illiquid markets.

It is a closer case as to UBS and BAML because, buttressed by the CFTC settlements, Plaintiffs are at least able to connect UBS and BAML to manipulation of the COMEX futures market generally. Nonetheless, the Court finds the numerous inferences required to connect UBS's and BAML's manipulative conduct to Plaintiffs' alleged injury (if they suffered any injury at all) to be too attenuated and speculative to survive a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   There are no facts alleged in the TAC to connect Barclays to artificial prices in the COMEX silver futures market, much less to an injury suffered by the Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   To be sure, there are adequate allegations that Barclays traders engaged in misconduct,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 263-64, 291-96, but it is entirely guesswork to conclude that those traders' misconduct included COMEX silver futures or that their misconduct had any effect in the futures market. None of the chat messages involving Barclays indicates the traders planned to manipulate COMEX futures. Plaintiffs' theory appears to be that manipulation of any silver-denominated product that is sold anywhere in the world would necessarily influence the price of COMEX silver futures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 36. Acknowledging that the various silver-denominated financial markets are linked, as Plaintiffs' econometric analysis demonstrates, does not plausibly lead to the conclusion Plaintiffs urge-that episodic market manipulation in unspecified silver products, with no factual allegations related to the frequency or magnitude of the manipulation, necessarily caused persistent artificiality in prices on COMEX and CBOT. Even assuming Plaintiffs' allegations were sufficient to allege that at some point in time Barclays caused artificial prices in the COMEX or CBOT silver markets, the TAC does not allege the direction of the artificiality,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Total Gas &amp; Power N. Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274727\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/244/402/#p412\">\n    244 F.Supp.3d at 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or that the artificiality can be connected to trades by the Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The chat messages involving BNP Paribas and Standard Chartered also do not support an inference that their misconduct caused Plaintiffs actual damage. Plaintiffs do not allege plausibly that BNP Paribas or Standard Chartered caused artificiality in the COMEX silver markets, much less explain how that artificiality affected trades by the Plaintiffs. The chat messages involving BNP Paribas and Standard Chartered describe various types of misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 236, 297-99, 300, 306-07, 310. But none of the chat messages appears to reference silver futures or describes a transaction from which the Court could infer any effect at all on the price of COMEX silver futures. Assuming that Plaintiffs had adequately alleged artificiality, it would still require additional logical leaps to connect that artificiality to a negative impact on specific trades by the Plaintiffs. Tellingly, to support their allegations of a connection between manipulative conduct by BNP Paribas and their injury, Plaintiffs cite only the econometric analysis\n   of the impact of suppression of the Silver Fixing, which is entirely inapposite.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 31 n.32 (citing TAC \u00b6\u00b6 125-98), 32 (citing TAC \u00b6\u00b6 143-98);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 356 at 2-3 (citing to Appendix D to the TAC (a list of days of alleged Fix-manipulation) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Plaintiffs' claims against BAML (and UBS, as discussed below) present a closer case because the DOJ Complaint and CFTC orders make it plausible that BAML and UBS manipulated the COMEX futures markets. The chats contained in the TAC itself are of limited evidentiary value. Only six chat messages involve BAML traders and most do not reference silver futures. It is speculative to infer that the traders were discussing manipulation of COMEX products. Nonetheless, the Department of Justice's complaint charges BAML traders with spoofing of COMEX silver futures between 2010 and 2014, and the Department's Complaint is supported by a detailed analysis of spoofed orders placed by the traders on specific days during the class period. BAML Complaint \u00b6 18-19. Accepting that those allegations are sufficient for the Court to conclude that Plaintiffs have alleged the existence of artificial prices in the COMEX silver futures markets caused by BAML, the series of inferences required to connect that artificiality to actual damage suffered by Plaintiffs is collectively implausible. First, the Court would be required to assume that spoofing-or other manipulative conduct that is entirely unalleged-occurred on more occasions than are alleged in the Department of Justice complaint. Next, the Court would be required to infer that the artificiality caused by these spoofs altered market prices for an unspecified period of time. The Court would then need to infer a connection between the artificiality-of-unknown-duration and a specific trade by Plaintiffs. And finally, the Court would need to infer that this artificiality moved the market\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' position. In isolation the Court might draw any of these four inferences in Plaintiffs' favor, but collectively they amount to rank speculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Plaintiffs' allegations against UBS require the Court to draw a similar series of collectively implausible inferences. To begin with, Plaintiffs' theory requires the Court to infer that the manipulation described in the chat messages occurred in the COMEX silver futures markets, despite the fact that the chat messages do not indicate what financial instruments (or markets) were the subject of manipulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 252 (coordinating trading to maximize market impact), 256-64 (describing manipulative tactics with colorful names). The CFTC proceedings against UBS and the Department of Justice's criminal complaint against a UBS trader who was acquitted make it plausible that at least some of the conduct referenced in the chat messages occurred in the COMEX futures market or that UBS traders engaged in similar behavior affecting the COMEX futures market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 342-44; UBS CFTC Order at 2-3. But, again, a plausible allegation that UBS manipulated the COMEX silver futures market is insufficient to allege plausibly that UBS caused Plaintiffs to suffer actual damages. Despite the fact that the chat messages are time-stamped and that the CFTC UBS Order and the criminal complaint identify specific dates and times on which alleged manipulation occurred, Plaintiffs have made no attempt to connect those identified instances of manipulation to artificial prices at the time of any of their trades.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    LIBOR II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3876929\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/962/606/#p620\">\n    962 F.Supp.2d at 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"despite the fact that plaintiffs indisputably have access to their own Eurodollar futures contract trading records, the [complaint] is devoid of any references to particular Eurodollar contracts\");\n   <em>\n    Total Gas &amp; Power N.

The TAC includes chat messages between traders at UBS and Deutsche Bank suggesting that UBS and Deutsche Bank coordinated attempts to manipulate the markets for unspecified silver-denominated assets. The chats are some evidence of a conspiracy to manipulate prices because they evidence a high degree of intrafirm communication and a willingness to collude and use manipulative trading techniques in the subject market or a related market. Nonetheless, they are not so probative as to make UBS's involvement in a conspiracy to manipulate the Fix Price plausible. To the extent they reference the Silver Fixing, the chats describe unilateral manipulation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TAC \u00b6\u00b6 308, 311. Unilateral attempts to manipulate the Silver Fixing are inconsistent with an overarching conspiracy among the Fixing Banks and UBS to depress the Fix Price. The other chats involving UBS describe manipulation of the markets for silver-denominated assets more generally. But, as the Non-Fixing Banks have noted, these chats involve a UBS trader stationed in Singapore and did not take place during London trading hours, making it highly unlikely they related to the Silver Fix.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    The chat messages, as reproduced in the TAC, do not specify which silver-denominated instruments were to be manipulated.

Others appear to reference silver futures but do not specify whether they involve COMEX silver futures, CBOT silver futures, or NYSE silver futures. Nonetheless, it is plausible that the manipulation involved the silver futures markets in which Plaintiffs traded: the CFTC's settlements with Deutsche Bank and UBS describe manipulation of COMEX futures,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Dkt 344 Ex. 1 at 3, Ex. 2 at 3; the CFTC's complaints against individual traders at Deutsche Bank and UBS also refer to manipulation of COMEX futures contracts, Dkt. 344 Exs. 4, 5; and the Department of Justice's complaint against two traders at BAML also describes manipulation of COMEX futures.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 344 Ex. 6.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    A comparison to the chat messages in\n    <em>\n     CHF LIBOR\n    </em>\n    is helpful.

Judge Stein concluded that the complaint plausibly alleged a conspiracy against RBS, but not against any of the other defendants.

The fact that Plaintiffs may have traded in the same 24 hour period as traders at the Non-Fixing Banks discussed manipulation of the silver markets is simply too thin a basis for the Court to infer that it is plausible that the traders' employers caused the Plaintiffs actual damages.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"37\">\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    The parties are encouraged to coordinate discovery with the parallel gold fixing case pending before the Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
