Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff James Cryer was hired by the Idaho Department of Labor (\"IDOL\") in 1993.\n   <em>\n    Birch Decl.\n   </em>\n   Ex. E at 17:20-23, Dkt. 47-5 (\"Cryer Dep.\"). Defendant IDOL is an executive department of the state of Idaho.\n   <em>\n    First Amended Compl.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1;\n   <em>\n    Ans.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. Defendant Kenneth Edmunds was the Director of IDOL, and Defendant Jay Engstrom was IDOL's Chief Operating Officer.\n   <em>\n    Birch. Decl.\n   </em>\n   Ex. M, Dkt. 47-13 (\"Org. Chart\"). Defendant Michael Kalm was the Chief Technology/Security Officer at IDOL.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2014, Mr. Cryer was asked to take on purchasing duties at IDOL.\n   <em>\n    Cryer Dep.\n   </em>\n   at 24:18-20, Dkt. 47-5. At that time, Defendant Engstrom informed Mr. Cryer that his duties would entail \"buy[ing] the things that we need with the littlest amount of intervention [and] keep[ing] us within the\n   rules and within the laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Cryer Dep.\n   </em>\n   at 25:3-6, Dkt. 47-5. During his time in the purchasing department, Mr. Cryer alleges that he became suspicious that IT department employees had engaged in various measures to circumvent mandatory purchasing rules regarding state contracts. Mr. Cryer further alleges that he communicated his suspicions to various persons at IDOL and at other relevant agencies, and that he refused to approve purchases that he believed would violate state law. Mr. Cryer alleges that he was terminated from IDOL in retaliation for these activities, as well as for sending seven anonymous emails raising concerns about purchasing and hiring practices at IDOL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Purchasing Violations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Cryer alleges three specific incidents where he suspected IDOL employees were attempting to circumvent the purchasing rules. In 2015, the IT department submitted a request to Mr. Cryer to purchase an uninterrupted power source (\"UPS\").\n   <em>\n    Birch Decl.\n   </em>\n   Ex. N, Dkt. 47-5. After consulting with the Idaho State Division of Purchasing (\"DOP\"), Mr. Cryer determined that the UPS was not on a state contract, and that it could not be purchased without going through a bid process.\n   <em>\n    Cryer Dep.\n   </em>\n   at 90:2-9, Dkt. 47-5. When he informed the IT department, he received a second request accompanied by a \"spec sheet\" stating that the UPS was a Dell product.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90:9-16. IDOL had a contract with Dell at the time, and Mr. Cryer suspected that someone had cut and pasted the Dell logo onto the document, in an attempt to avoid the bid process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Despite this, he processed the request and submitted the order to DOP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   DOP informed Mr. Cryer again that the UPS was not on a state contract, which Mr. Cryer then relayed again to the IT department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90:16-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Sometime afterwards, Mr. Cryer received a third request from IT to purchase the UPS, which explicitly stated that the UPS was on the Dell contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90:20-21. He then looked for the UPS on the Dell contract and could not find it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90:22. On July 24, 2015, Mr. Cryer emailed Shawna West, a buyer at DOP, to confirm whether he could purchase the UPS.\n   <em>\n    Birch Decl.\n   </em>\n   Ex. N at 3, Dkt. 47-14;\n   <em>\n    Birch Decl.\n   </em>\n   Ex. O at 5, Dkt. 49. The email stated \"Before I spend a [sic] 100,000 I want to be sure I am even supposed to buy this item. Apparently Dell is saying it is part of their contract but I am not finding it. Could you tell me if it is on the contract before I buy this.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The DOP confirmed again that the UPS was not on contract, but then worked to add it to the Dell contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1;\n   <em>\n    Cryer Dep.\n   </em>\n   at 90:23-91:3, Dkt. 47-5. Mr. Cryer approved the purchase of the UPS once it was added to the Dell contract.\n   <em>\n    Cryer Dep.\n   </em>\n   at 90:23-91:3, Dkt. 47-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In another incident, Mr. Cryer received a request to purchase a certain cable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108:9-10. Mr. Cryer determined that the cable was on a Dell parts contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   and relayed that information the requestor, stating that it would take a couple days to obtain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108:24-109:2. On January 20, 2016, Defendant Kalm emailed John Taylor, the Financial Executive Officer at IDOL, regarding \"[t]he cost of the numerous people involved in purchasing a $10 cable and waiting weeks to have it installed, instead of having one of the techs being able to go down the street and pick it up and have it installed in less that [sic] 30 mins not to mention the lack of customer service ...\".\n   <em>\n    Birch Decl.\n   </em>\n   Ex T, Dkt. 49-5. Mr. Taylor forwarded the email to Mr. Cryer and asked how long it would take to get the cable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Cryer responded that IDOL was obligated to purchase the cable from the contract.\n   <em>\n    Cryer Dep.\n   </em>\n   at 109:15-19, Dkt. 47-5. Mr. Taylor reprimanded\n   him for his tone, and told Mr. Cryer \"to work with our internal customers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 109:21-110:7;\n   <em>\n    Taylor Dep.\n   </em>\n   at 60:17-61:6, Dkt. 47-12. Mr. Cryer informed Mr. Taylor that this was not the first time he'd had to defend himself for requiring purchases to be made on contract.\n   <em>\n    Cryer Dep.\n   </em>\n   at 110:1-7, Dkt. 47-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Taylor held a meeting with Mr. Cryer, John Brown, and Defendant Kalm to discuss the cable and the purchasing rules.\n   <em>\n    Taylor Dep.\n   </em>\n   at 112:8-114:17, Dkt. 47-12. Mr. Brown was IDOL's IT Resource Manager.\n   <em>\n    Amend. Compl.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Mr. Taylor informed Mr. Cryer that he must be misinterpreting the rules.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Engstrom also spoke with Mr. Cryer about the cable, telling him, \"Let's move this thing along if at all possible. Let's just get the cable and give it to him.\"\n   <em>\n    Engstrom Dep.\n   </em>\n   at 67:21-23, Dkt. 47-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 21, 2016, Mr. Cryer emailed Chelsea Cameron, a Purchasing Officer in DOP, seeking clarification on whether the cables needed to be purchased through state contract.\n   <em>\n    Birch Decl.\n   </em>\n   Ex. U, Dkt. 49-6. Ms. Cameron did not answer whether the cable was on contract, but she confirmed that most items on open contracts are \"mandatory use,\" \"regardless of dollar amount.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Cameron also noted that \"[t]here are statutory penalties (enforced against the individual employee) for failure to utilize an open contract, regardless of dollar amount.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The cable was eventually purchased through the Dell contract.\n   <em>\n    Taylor Dep.\n   </em>\n   at 39:22-24, Dkt. 47-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, Mr. Cryer suspected that Eric Beck, the IDOL Information Technology Chief Information Officer, had violated rules governing the use of purchasing cards (\"P-cards\") by allowing other staff to use his P-card to make purchases.\n   <em>\n    Org. Chart\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 47-13;\n   <em>\n    Cryer Dep.\n   </em>\n   62:10-22, Dkt. 47-5. On November 25, 2015, Mr. Cryer emailed Jason Urquhart, a Purchasing Officer at DOP, stating \"I was told to contact you and let you know, the attached P-Card is believed to be getting used to circumvent the State Contracts put in place for the items on them. I glanced at them, but haven't researched all of the items to insure [sic] there are contracts. I was told to solicit your opinion on the situation.\"\n   <em>\n    Birch Decl.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. W at 1, Dkt. 50. Mr. Urquhart responded the same day, and confirmed that \"[a]ll of those items should have been purchased on statewide contracts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He directed Mr. Cryer to \"escalate this\" to Joni Booth, the Financial Executive Officer at IDOL and Mr. Cryer's supervisor at that time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Amend.

AA, Dkt. 50-3. He explained that they were \"not purchased off of the State contract,\" \"[n]o prior authorization was given to acquire via an emergency purchase,\" and [t]here was no documentation for the emergency purchases.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He further stated that \"In the future, all purchases in the open market of products that are on the state contract will have the payment held until a written explanation for not following state purchasing rules is provided.

The Idaho Supreme Court has not further interpreted this phrase. The Court finds, however, that communications must either be made up the reporter's chain of command, or to a person with authority over the person committing the suspected waste or violations, in order to be protected under the IPPEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) Purchasing Violations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Mr. Cryer alleges that his communications related to the purchase of the UPS are protected under the IPPEA. He also alleges that by refusing to purchase the UPS until it was on contract, he engaged in protected activity. The Court disagrees. While the evidence shows that Mr. Cryer received three requests to purchase the UPS, there is no evidence that Mr. Cryer received a directive to purchase the UPS, much less one that he refused to carry out. Indeed, the evidence shows that Mr. Cryer submitted the purchase requests despite suspecting the UPS was not on contract. Thus, there is no evidence that Mr. Cryer refused a directive to violate the purchasing rules, in such a way that his actions were protected under the IPPEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Nor were Mr. Cryer's communications related to the UPS protected under the IPPEA. Even if Mr. Cryer reasonably suspected that the IT department was purposefully attempting to circumvent the purchasing rules to obtain the UPS, there is no evidence that he communicated those suspicions to anyone with the authority to remedy them. For example, although Mr. Cryer suspected someone had falsified a document to make it look like the UPS was on the Dell contract, there is no evidence that he communicated this suspicion to anyone. Instead, when Mr. Cryer emailed\n   Ms. West to confirm again that the UPS was not on contract, he indicated that Dell was the source of the misinformation, rather than anyone at IDOL.\n   <em>\n    Birch Decl.\n   </em>\n   Ex. N at 3, Dkt 47-14 (\"Apparently Dell is saying [the UPS] is part of their contract but I am not finding it.\"). It is not reasonable, therefore, to infer that his communications were sufficient to put Ms. West or anyone else at DOP on notice that the IT department was attempting to violate the purchasing rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Finally, Mr. Cryer's communications about the UPS were made before the item was purchased. Consulting an authority about whether a future purchase would constitute a violation does not constitute a protected communication under the IPPEA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Van I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072563\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/147/552/\">\n    212 P.3d at 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the IPPEA only protects communications related to an existing violation, not a future one.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Mr. Cryer next alleges that his refusal to purchase the cable constituted protected activity under the IPPEA. A reasonable jury could agree. Mr. Cryer testified in his deposition that he determined the cable was on a Dell parts contract.\n   <em>\n    Cryer Dep.\n   </em>\n   at 108:9-12, Dkt. 47-5. Although there is conflicting evidence as to whether the cable actually was on contract, at this stage, the Court must take Mr. Cryer's testimony as true.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Mr. Cryer consulted Ms. Cameron at DOP, he was informed that most items on open contracts are \"mandatory use,\" \"regardless of dollar amount,\" and that \"[t]here are statutory penalties (enforced against the individual employee) for failure to utilize an open contract, regardless of dollar amount.\"\n   <em>\n    Birch Decl.\n   </em>\n   Ex. U, Dkt. 49-6. A jury could reasonably infer from this evidence that Mr. Cryer suspected that purchasing the cable off-contract was a violation of state purchasing laws, and that his suspicion was reasonable, even if it eventually turned out to be unfounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Further, a jury could reasonably find that Mr. Cryer received a directive to purchase the cable off-contract, and that he refused to carry that directive out.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite knowing that Mr. Cryer believed the cable had to be purchased on contract, Defendant Engstrom testified that he told Mr. Cryer \"Let's move this thing along if at all possible.

Defendant Engstrom was the Chief Operating Officer of IDOL, and it is reasonable to infer that he could issue a directive to Mr. Cryer, an IDOL employee.\n   <em>\n    Org. Chart\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 47-13. It is also reasonable, when considering his statement in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, to interpret \"Let's just get the cable and give it to him\" as a directive to purchase the cable off-contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   A jury could reasonably find that Mr. Taylor, the Chief Financial Officer at IDOL, also directed Mr. Cryer to purchase the cable off-contract. After receiving the complaint from Mr. Kalm, Mr. Taylor reprimanded Mr. Cryer for his tone, and told Mr. Cryer \"[t]here's something wrong here\" and \"[y]ou don't understand something.\"\n   <em>\n    Cryer Dep.\n   </em>\n   at 109:21-110:7, Dkt. 47-5. Mr. Taylor also told Mr. Cryer to \"work with our internal customers.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor Dep.\n   </em>\n   at 60:17-61:6, Dkt. 47-12. Taken in the light most favorable to Mr. Cryer, a reasonable inference can be drawn that these statements represented an implicit directive to purchase the cable off contract, even if it violated the rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Further, a jury could reasonably find that Mr. Cryer refused these directives. Mr. Cryer informed both Mr. Taylor and Defendant Engstrom that the cable had to be purchased on contract.\n   <em>\n    Cryer Dep.\n   </em>\n   at 109:15-19, Dkt. 47-5. When the cable was finally purchased, it ordered through the Dell contract.\n   <em>\n    Taylor Dep.\n   </em>\n   at 39:22-24, Dkt. 47-12. Thus, a juror could reasonably find that Mr. Cryer refused a directive to purchase the cable off-contract based on a reasonable suspicion that doing so would violate state law, and that his refusal constitutes protected activity under the IPPEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, a jury could reasonably find that Mr. Cryer's communications regarding Mr. Beck's P-Card constitute protected activity under the \"Communications Prong\" of the IPPEA. The evidence shows that Mr. Cryer suspected that Mr. Beck's P-Card was being used to circumvent state contracts, and that the card was indeed used to purchase items that should have been purchased through state contracts.\n   <em>\n    See Birch Decl.\n   </em>\n   , Ex.

Thus, there is sufficient evidence from which a jury could find that Mr. Cryer's suspicions were reasonable, and that actual violations occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Further, a jury could reasonably find that Mr. Cryer communicated the suspected violations to DOP, as well as to his own superior at IDOL, Joni Booth.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072563\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/147/552/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (email to Mr. Urquhart);\n   <em>\n    Birch Decl.\n   </em>\n   , Ex.

W at 1, Dkt. 50 (stating to Mr. Urquhart that \"I was told to contact you.\"). Rather, it could simply mean that someone else informed Mr. Cryer that Mr. Urquhart was the proper person to contact regarding his suspicions.

Further, it relates to purchases that had already been made, not future purchases. Thus, a reasonable jury could find that Mr. Cryer sought Mr. Urquhart's opinion on what to do about the suspected violations, rather than on whether the purchases violated the law. Finally, the email to Mr. Beck laid out clear steps for preventing future violations, such that a jury could reasonably find that Mr. Cryer communicated to DOP and IDOL in a manner that allowed them to address the violations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Birch Decl.\n   </em>\n   , Ex.

For example, Defendants contest that Defendant Kalm hired Mr. Brown.\n   <em>\n    See Birch Decl.\n   </em>\n   Ex. C at 9:23-10:12, Dkt. 47-3 (\"Brown Dep.\"). But, they do not appear to contest that more than one person held the same position at the IT department, nor did they offer any objective evidence to dispute Mr. Cryer's characterization of such positions as duplicative and unnecessary. Finally, Defendants have not rebutted Mr. Cryer's assertions that several employees in the IT department were\n   not qualified for the jobs they held. Instead, Defendants merely argue that Mr. Cryer's suspicions were based on hearsay, and that his communications were motivated by malice.\n   <em>\n    See Def.'s Br.\n   </em>\n   at 21, Dkt. 51-1. The Court finds, therefore, that the question of whether Mr. Cryer's concerns about waste in hiring were objectively reasonable is in dispute, and must be resolved by the fact-finder at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, one of the anonymous emails alleged that the IDOL was violating purchasing rules, and purchasing unnecessary equipment.\n   <em>\n    See Birch Decl.\n   </em>\n   Ex. EE at 4, Dkt. 52-1. As discussed above, there is sufficient grounds for a jury to find that Mr. Cryer's suspicions related to purchasing violations were reasonable. Further, a jury could reasonably conclude that Mr. Cryer's email to Susan Hilderbrand communicated waste of public funds, as he alleged that IDOL was purchasing unnecessary equipment. Finally, a jury could reasonably find that Ms. Hilderbrand, the Administrator for the DOP, had the authority to correct violations involving falsifications on purchasing requests. Therefore, the Court finds that a jury could reasonably conclude that six of the seven emails constitute protected activity under the IPPEA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    (3) Good Faith\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendants contend that even if Mr. Cryer's communications would otherwise be protected under the IPPEA, the record shows that the communications were made in bad faith and therefore they are not protected. For example, Mr. Taylor testified that Mr. Cryer could not explain to him why a purchase order from Mr. Kalm took longer to process than a similar purchase order for another employee.\n   <em>\n    Kelly Aff.\n   </em>\n   Ex. B 28:23-29:25, 41:10-13, Dkt. 60-4.

Mr. Cryer also testified that when he described \"the jerk destroying the Legacy of IDOL\" in his April 26 email, he was referring to Defendant Kalm.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206-2104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court finds this evidence establishes a genuine issue of fact as to whether Mr. Cryer acted in good faith.

Here, the question of causation boils down to a single disputed fact-whether Mr. Cryer was fired solely on the basis of the April 26 email, or whether IDOL took into account activities protected under the IPPEA in deciding to terminate him. Resolving this issue will involve weighing the evidence and evaluating the credibility of witnesses, which the Court\n   may not do at this stage, and therefore summary judgment is precluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Because the Court has found that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Mr. Cryer engaged in protected activity under the IPPEA, and as to whether IDOL fired him on the basis of protected activity, it will deny Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's IPPEA claim. For the same reasons the Court will deny Plaintiff's motion as to the first and third elements of his IPPEA claim. As discussed above, however, the Court will grant partial summary judgment to Plaintiff on the second element of his IPPEA claim, because it is undisputed that his termination from IPPEA qualifies as an \"adverse action\" under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

In considering Mr. Cryer's motion, however, the Court must look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the Defendants.

Exhibit U is an email exchange between Mr. Cryer and a DOP Purchasing Officer that is relevant to the disputed issue of whether Mr. Cryer communicated a suspected violation of the purchasing rules with regards to the UPS to someone with the authority remedy the violation. Thus, the Court will deny Defendants' motion as to Exhibit U on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Because the Court did not rely on the remainder of the challenged material, it makes no evaluation of its materiality or factual support at this time. Instead, the Court will deny as moot the remainder of Defendants' Motion to Strike, without prejudice to Defendants to raise these issues in future proceedings in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    6.
