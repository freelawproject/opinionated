Ellis, III, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   At issue in this diversity action is defendants' Motions to Dismiss the Amended Complaint. The matter has been fully briefed and argued and is now ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This action arises out of (i) defendant Alden Alberto's (\"Alberto\") payment of allegedly unauthorized bonuses to himself and to co-conspirators over the course of four years, (ii) Alberto's allegedly false communications to plaintiffs' business contacts, and (iii) Alberto's allegedly unauthorized withdrawal of significant sums of\n   money from plaintiffs' bank accounts. Plaintiffs allege that defendant Alberto took all of these actions in an attempt to destroy plaintiffs' business and to start a competing company, Vulcan Aviation LLC (\"Vulcan Aviation\"). Based on these actions, plaintiffs assert eight claims against individual defendant Alberto, including: breach of fiduciary duty, common law and statutory conspiracy, fraud, tortious interference with business relationships, defamation, conversion, and unjust enrichment. Plaintiffs also assert one claim of Virginia statutory conspiracy against corporate defendant Vulcan Aviation. Defendants have now moved to dismissed each of these claims, arguing that plaintiffs have failed to state claims upon which relief may be granted and that some portions of each claim are time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff NorthStar Aviation USA LLC (\"NorthStar USA\") is a limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of Delaware with its principal place of business in Florida. NorthStar USA's sole member is plaintiff NorthStar Aviation LLC (\"NorthStar UAE\"), which is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the United Arab Emirates with its principal place of business in the UAE. NorthStar UAE's two members are Rotana Jet Aviation LLC and Dr. Ahmed Bin Saif (\"Dr. Bin Saif\"). Dr. Bin Saif serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors for NorthStar UAE (\"NorthStar Board\"). Plaintiffs NorthStar USA and NorthStar UAE (collectively \"NorthStar\") are in the business of manufacturing and selling helicopters and providing aircraft maintenance, repair, and pilot training.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant Alberto, a resident of Virginia, is the former Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") of NorthStar USA and CEO and Managing Director of NorthStar UAE. Defendant Alberto worked for NorthStar USA from the company's offices in McLean, Virginia. Defendant Vulcan Aviation is a Virginia limited liability company also in the business of selling helicopters and providing maintenance, repair, and pilot training services. The Amended Complaint alleges that Vulcan Aviation's members include Alberto, Terry Key (\"Key\"), and Hillary Holcombe (\"Holcombe\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Key and Holcombe were also former employees of NorthStar USA who worked from McLean, Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that in 2011, NorthStar UAE's members entered into a Memorandum of Association and formed NorthStar UAE. The Memorandum of Association named Alberto as Managing Director of NorthStar UAE and provided that Alberto would be at all times responsible to, and subject to the control of, NorthStar UAE's Board of Directors (\"NorthStar Board\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NorthStar Mem. of Association \u00b6\u00b6 9.8, 9.10. The Memorandum of Association also gave Alberto the power to carry out the day-to-day management of the company's affairs, including the power to enter into agreements on behalf of the company, to draw and issue checks on behalf of the company, and to fix the salaries of employees on behalf of the company.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9.8, 9.9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The next year, in May 2012, NorthStar USA was incorporated in Delaware, and Alberto was named CEO of both NorthStar UAE and NorthStar USA. And in 2013, Northstar UAE granted Alberto Power of Attorney over NorthStar UAE. Alberto's Power of Attorney again authorized Alberto to conduct the day-to-day management on behalf of the company, including entering into agreements, drawing and issuing checks, and fixing the salaries of employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NorthStar Power of Attorney \u00b6\u00b6 (a), (e), (n).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that from May 2012 through October 2017, Alberto improperly used his authority as CEO to direct NorthStar's Finance Director to transfer funds and issue checks from NorthStar's accounts to cover \"improper, unmerited, and unauthorized bonus payments\" to Alberto, Key, and Holcombe in total amounts of $19,307,399, $1,990,000, and $220,000, respectively. The Amended Complaint alleges that Alberto knew that he did not have the authority to issue these bonus payments without approval from the NorthStar Board but that Alberto nonetheless failed to seek such approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that by 2016, NorthStar was experiencing significant financial difficulties. Despite Alberto's awareness of these financial difficulties, the Amended Complaint alleges that Alberto continued to pay improper bonuses to himself, Key, and Holcombe and that Alberto concealed these bonuses from Dr. Bin Saif. For example, the Amended Complaint alleges that Alberto disclosed to Dr. Bin Saif that company-wide bonus payments in November 2016 totaled $3,678,970, but that Alberto did not disclose to Dr. Bin Saif that Alberto, Key, and Holcombe received nearly 75 percent of this amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Amended Complaint further alleges that in the summer of 2017, Dr. Bin Saif explicitly directed Alberto to find ways to reduce NorthStar's expenses. The Amended Complaint also alleges that despite these instructions, Alberto paid himself approximately $10 million in bonuses in late June and early October 2017 and authorized additional bonuses for Key and Holcombe. Around the same time, the Amended Complaint alleges that Alberto laid off ten of the forty-six people working for NorthStar, targeting the highest-paid corporate and operations employees as well as those employees who had questioned NorthStar's finances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Amended Complaint further alleges that around this time, Alberto, Key, and Holcombe began planning to launch a new company named Vulcan Aviation to compete with NorthStar. The Amended Complaint alleges that, as part of this plan, Alberto attempted to transfer NorthStar's equipment from a hanger in the UAE to a hanger in Florida for use by Vulcan Aviation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 17, 2017, Alberto attended a meeting of the NorthStar Board. At this meeting, the NorthStar Board indicated that they intended to audit NorthStar's finances. Two days later, on October 19, 2017, NorthStar UAE revoked Alberto's Power of Attorney, and on the same day, Alberto registered Vulcan Aviation with the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The Amended Complaint alleges that around this same time Alberto, Key, and Holcombe also (i) began informing NorthStar USA's vendors that NorthStar USA was renaming itself as Vulcan Aviation and (ii) began contacting NorthStar USA employees to lure them to Vulcan Aviation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Key, it is alleged, also contacted a representative of Kuwait, with whom NorthStar had been discussing the potential for a new contract, and ordered the Kuwaiti representative to withdraw any plans concerning NorthStar's potential sale of helicopters to Kuwait. And the Amended Complaint further alleges that Alberto attempted to transfer NorthStar USA's International Traffic in Arms Regulation (\"ITAR\") export license to Vulcan Aviation. The Amended Complaint alleges that after Alberto's attempts to transfer the license were unsuccessful, Alberto requested that the U.S. State Department rescind NorthStar USA's ITAR licenses. Alberto also drafted a letter to the UAE Armed Forces, a client of NorthStar's, informing the UAE Armed Forces that NorthStar's services under their contract would terminate on October 25, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   That same day, on October 25, 2017, Alberto resigned from NorthStar. After resigning, the Amended Complaint alleges that Alberto continued to access NorthStar USA's bank accounts, and from October 26, 2017 through October 31, 2017, Alberto transferred and withdrew more than $664,000 from NorthStar USA's bank accounts, leaving the accounts with a negative balance. Alberto also used his NorthStar USA credit card to make purchases for his new company, Vulcan Aviation, including charging payments to attorneys and a graphic designer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs filed the Amended Complaint in this diversity action on April 13, 2018, asserting eight claims against four defendants, Alberto, Key, Holcombe, and Vulcan Aviation. On May 3, 2018, the parties entered into a stipulation of dismissal, dismissing the claims against Key and Holcombe. As such, the remaining claims in plaintiffs' Amended Complaint include: (i) breach of fiduciary duty against Alberto, (ii) common law conspiracy against Alberto, (iii) fraud against Alberto, (iv) statutory conspiracy against Alberto and Vulcan Aviation, (v) tortious interference with business expectancy against Alberto, (vi) conversion against Alberto, (vii) defamation against Alberto, and (viii) unjust enrichment against Alberto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants filed the Motion to Dismiss at issue here on April 27, 2018, arguing that each of plaintiffs' claims should be dismissed. Specifically, defendants argue as a threshold matter that portions of plaintiffs' fraud, fiduciary duty, conversion, and unjust enrichment claims are time-barred. Defendants also argue that the Amended Complaint cannot survive threshold dismissal because it is unclear from the Amended Complaint which law governs plaintiffs' claims. Finally, defendants contend that plaintiffs have failed to state claims for relief sufficient to survive threshold dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P. Plaintiffs oppose each of these arguments, contending (i) that the continuing violations doctrine saves the portions of their claims that would otherwise be time-barred, (ii) that the Amended Complaint makes clear that Virginia law applies, and (iii) that they have adequately alleged the necessary elements of each of their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The standard on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P., is too well-settled to warrant extensive elaboration. Put simply, a court may dismiss a claim if, after accepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable factual inferences in the plaintiff's favor, the complaint does not allege \"enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on\n   its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

With respect to choice of law, it is undisputed that a court sitting in diversity must apply the choice-of-law rules of the state in which it sits.\n   <em>\n    Klaxon v. Stentor Mfg.

And it is also undisputed that in determining which law governs a tort action, the Supreme Court of Virginia \"adhere[s] to the\n   <em>\n    lex loci delicti\n   </em>\n   , or place of the wrong, standard ....\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

In this regard, Virginia law defines \"the place of the wrong\" as \"the place where the last event necessary to make an actor liable for an alleged tort takes place.\"\n   <em>\n    Quillen v. Int'l Playtex, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1573861\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/789/1041/#p1044\">\n    789 F.2d 1041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1044 (4th Cir. 1986) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs assert in their opposition that the injuries occurred in Virginia where Alberto worked and where NorthStar USA's offices were located, and both parties apply Virginia law for the purposes of this motion. Accordingly, although a more complete record at summary judgment might require the application of a different state's laws, the facts alleged in the Amended Complaint are sufficient to warrant the application of Virginia law at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   With respect to the statute of limitations, it is well-settled (i) that the applicable limitations period for claims of breach of fiduciary duty is two years,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ii) that the applicable limitations period for claims of fraud is two years,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (iii) that the applicable limitations period for claims of conversion is five years,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (iv) that the applicable limitations period for unjust enrichment is three years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, any conduct occurring prior to the following dates cannot be the basis for plaintiffs' claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 Count I - Breach of Fiduciary Duty: All claims before February 20, 2016 are time-barred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 Count III - Fraud: All claims before February 20, 2016 are time-barred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 Count VI - Conversion: All claims before February 20, 2013 are time-barred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 Count VIII - Unjust Enrichment: All claims before February 20, 2015 are time-barred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In an effort to avoid this straightforward conclusion, plaintiffs argue that the conduct occurring before the relevant limitations period is part of a continuing violation. But plaintiffs have not identified any Virginia authority supporting the application of the continuing violation doctrine to the common law torts at issue here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the Fourth Circuit has affirmed a decision in which a district court in the Western District of Virginia declined to extend the continuing violation doctrine to the common law tort sphere.\n   <em>\n    Hurst v.

Ultimately, plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, defamation, and unjust enrichment claims survive. Plaintiffs' conspiracy, fraud, and tortious interference with business expectancy claims must be dismissed, but with leave to amend if plaintiffs can do so consistently with the strictures of Rule 11, Fed. R. Civ. P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty claim survives threshold dismissal. To state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under Virginia law, a plaintiff must allege \"(1) a fiduciary duty, (2) breach, and (3) damages resulting from the breach.\"\n   <em>\n    Informatics Applications Grp., Inc. v. Shkolnikov\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4141816\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/836/400/#p424\">\n    836 F.Supp.2d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424 (E.D. Va. 2011). Plaintiffs here have stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against defendant Alberto. The Amended Complaint alleges that defendant Alberto owed a fiduciary duty to NorthStar based on his role as CEO, Managing Director, and attorney-in-fact and that this fiduciary duty was expressly contained in defendant Alberto's employment agreement. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 18, 20, 24. The Amended Complaint further alleges that defendant Alberto breached the fiduciary duties he owed to NorthStar (i) when Alberto misappropriated funds from NorthStar by paying himself excessive bonuses and making cash withdrawals, (ii) when Alberto worked to sabotage and undermine NorthStar's business by attempting to transfer Northstar's\n   equipment and ITAR license, (iii) when Alberto worked to sabotage NorthStar's potential business relationships by withdrawing business proposals, and (iv) when Alberto withdrew funds from NorthStar's bank accounts for his own personal expenditures and those of a competing company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118. And finally, the Amended Complaint alleges that plaintiffs suffered damages, in excess of $20 million, as a result of these breaches. As such, the Amended Complaint adequately alleges a claim of breach of fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants argue that plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty claim must fail because the Memorandum of Association and Power of Attorney authorized Alberto to pay himself these bonuses and Alberto was simply exercising his business judgment in doing so. But this argument fails because although the Memorandum of Association and the Power of Attorney gave Alberto broad authority to transact business on behalf of NorthStar, these documents did not explicitly authorize Alberto to make the specific bonus payments at issue. And importantly, the Memorandum of Association makes clear that despite his broad power, Alberto was at all times responsible to, and subject to the control of, the NorthStar Board.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NorthStar Mem. of Association \u00b6 9.10. Accordingly, the Amended Complaint's allegations that Alberto's actions were unauthorized and that Alberto continued to funnel money into his own pocket despite the fact that the Chairman instructed Alberto to save money are sufficient to satisfy plaintiffs' burden at this stage and on this record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiffs' statutory and common law conspiracy claims against both corporate defendant Vulcan Aviation and Alberto must be dismissed, but with leave to amend if plaintiffs can do so consistently with the strictures of Rule 11, Fed. R. Civ. P. It is well-settled that both statutory conspiracy and common law conspiracy under Virginia law require an agreement between two or more parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Va. Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-499, 18.2-500 ;\n   <em>\n    Firestone v.

Va. 2007). In this regard, Virginia law makes clear that because a corporation and its agents are essentially one actor, \"a conspiracy between a corporation and its agents, acting within the scope of their employment, is a legal impossibility.\"\n   <em>\n    Marmott v. Maryland Lumber Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1649766\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/807/1180/#p1184\">\n    807 F.2d 1180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1184 (4th Cir. 1986). As such, it is legally impossible for Vulcan Aviation to have conspired with its members-Alberto, Key, and Holcombe-and hence plaintiffs' conspiracy claim against Vulcan Aviation must be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the conspiracy claim against Alberto can nonetheless survive because the Amended Complaint alleges that Alberto, Key, and Holcombe engaged in acts in furtherance of the conspiracy before Vulcan Aviation was formed in October 2017 Although the Amended Complaint does allege that Alberto, Key, and Holcombe began converting funds\n   from NorthStar before Vulcan Aviation was incorporated, the conspiracy claim against Alberto must fail because the Supreme Court of Virginia has recognized the principle that a claim for civil conspiracy \"cannot be maintained in a suit involving a single defendant where the same underlying torts are also asserted by separate counts against the same defendant[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Gelber v.

Rule 9(b), Fed. R. Civ. P., provides that where, as here, a plaintiff asserts a claim of fraud, the plaintiff \"must state with particularity the circumstances constituting the fraud[.]\" In this respect, if the plaintiff alleges that defendants committed fraud via affirmative misrepresentations, the Fourth Circuit has required plaintiffs to state with particularity \"the time, place, and contents of the false representations, as well as the identity of the person making the misrepresentation and what he obtained thereby.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Mut.

Compl. \u00b6 182. According to the Amended Complaint, Alberto, the next day, wrote to the UAE Armed Forces falsely reporting that \"all activities associated with [NorthStar's contract\n   would] cease effective October 25, 2017.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 183.

But the facts alleged in the Amended Complaint do not support a conclusion on this record that Alberto made these statements in response to a governmentally imposed duty to inform or in response to a query from an official government investigator. Defendants rely on ITAR regulations in support of their argument that Alberto was required to report these facts, but the regulations cited require ITAR registrants to report changes in ownership and control of subject entities or plans for sale of the entity, not changes in contracting plans or financial status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20122.4\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 122.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), 122.4(b).

But, as described above, the Memorandum of Association and the Power of Attorney gave Alberto general powers; these documents did not explicitly authorize Alberto to pay the specific bonuses at issue in this action. And importantly, plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim does not rely exclusively on Alberto's payment of bonuses to himself over three years.
