This memorandum constitutes the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 52(a) and 55(b)(2), and equity\n   and common law and applicable administrative law, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 13a-1, following a bench trial held from July 9 through July 12, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See, infra\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 32-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   2. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\" or \"Commission\") seeks decrees and judgments against Defendants Patrick K. McDonnell (\"McDonnell\") and CabbageTech, Corp. d/b/a Coin Drop Markets (\"CabbageTech,\" and together with McDonnell, \"Defendants\") for violations of Section 6(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the \"Act\" or \"CEA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), and Commission Regulation (\"Regulation\") 180.1(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20180.1\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 180.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The CFTC seeks a permanent injunction as well as an award of restitution and imposition of civil monetary penalties against Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   3. The Commission relies for its jurisdiction on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). It reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to use or employ, or attempt to use or employ, in connection with any swap, or a contract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity,\n   <em>\n    any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance\n   </em>\n   , in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission shall promulgate by not later than 1 year after July 21, 2010, provided no rule or regulation promulgated by the Commission shall require any person to disclose to another person nonpublic information that may be material to the market price, rate, or level of the commodity transaction, except as necessary to make any statement made to the other person in or in connection with the transaction not misleading in any material respect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   4. The court's jurisdiction to grant relief is set forth in 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 13a-1(a) as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any registered entity or other person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of this chapter or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder, or is restraining trading in any commodity for future delivery or any swap, the Commission may bring an action in the proper district court of the United States or the proper United States court of any territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to enjoin such act or practice, or to enforce compliance with this chapter, or any rule, regulation or order thereunder, and said courts shall have jurisdiction to entertain such actions: Provided, That no restraining order (other than a restraining order which prohibits any person from destroying, altering or disposing of, or refusing to permit authorized representatives of the Commission to inspect, when and as requested, any books and records or other documents or which prohibits any person from withdrawing, transferring, removing, dissipating, or disposing of any funds, assets, or other property, and other than an order appointing a temporary receiver to administer such restraining order and to perform such other duties as the court may consider appropriate) or injunction for violation of the provisions of this chapter shall be issued ex parte by said court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   5. Civil monetary penalties are provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   In any action brought under this section, the Commission may seek and the court shall have jurisdiction to impose, on a proper showing, on any person found in the action to have committed any violation-\n   (A) a civil penalty in the amount of not more than the greater of $100,000 or triple the monetary gain to the person for each violation; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (B) in any case of manipulation or attempted manipulation in violation of section 9, 15, 13b, or 13(a)(2) of this title, a civil penalty in the amount of not more than the greater of $1,000,000 or triple the monetary gain to the person for each violation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   7 U.S.C. \u00a7 13a-1(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   6.

In extensive memoranda and orders, the court has found the Commission has standing and authority to bring\n   this action for fraud involving virtual currencies (also referred to commercially as \"cryptocurrencies,\" \"crypto,\" \"crypto coins,\" \"digital currencies,\" and \"digital tokens\").\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v.

The litigation has been particularly difficult to administrate because McDonnell has appeared pro se despite various attempts of the court to explain why he needs counsel. He has appeared in court intermittently.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 1:20-22, 146:20-22, 296:20-22, 426:20-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   11. The court has urged defendant to retain counsel on various occasions, but he has refused to do so. He was referred by this court to the Eastern District's City Bar Justice Center's Pro Se Legal Assistance Project (\"Clinic\"), with whom he met on April 23, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ltr. from Clinic, ECF No. 151, July 18, 2018. The Clinic attempted to place McDonnell with pro bono counsel and arranged meetings with two different law firms. But McDonnell cut himself off from the Clinic on May 9, 2018 after just two weeks, expressing skepticism that the firms were interested in his case. He expressed concern that the firms were using these meetings as \"fishing expeditions\" to \"acquire [confidential] information\" about him. Ltr. from Patrick K. McDonnell, ECF No. 129, July 13, 2018;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Email correspondence between Patrick K. McDonnell and Clinic, ECF No. 137-1, July 16, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   12. Despite defendant's contention that he lacks sufficient funds to hire counsel, McDonnell has yet to show\n   <em>\n    in pauperis\n   </em>\n   status warranting appointment of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Order, ECF No. 153, July 20, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   13. The defendant's primary contention from the outset was that the Commission has no power to proceed against him, and that the case should be dismissed for lack of standing and authority to prosecute. On this point, one court has issued an opinion arguably supporting his view.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Monex Credit Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525266\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/1173/\">\n    311 F.Supp.3d 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.D. Cal. 2018). The district court in that case was aware of, and distinguished, this court's prior opinion finding that the Commission had authority to bring the instant action against McDonnell.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525266\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/1173/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1189 ;\n   <em>\n    but see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525266\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/1173/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525266\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/1173/\">\n    at 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Section 6(c)(1) unambiguously applies broadly to the use or attempted use of any manipulative or deceptive device 'in connection with any swap, or a contract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   14. If the Commission is ultimately found to be without jurisdiction and standing, this case should be dismissed. But, assuming that this court is correct in its finding of authority to prosecute by the Commission, the evidence demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt a bold and vicious fraud executed by Defendants to illegally deprive large numbers of investors in different states and countries of their assets by trickery, false statements, and misappropriation of funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   15. McDonnell's \"boiler room\" scheme defrauded members of the public by conning them into believing they were paying for, and receiving, bona fide advice on investing in virtual currencies-that is to\n   say: expert virtual currency trading advice from him and an imaginary team of advisors-and that he was making purchases and sales of virtual currencies using their assets on their behalf and for their benefit. In reality, McDonnell never provided or intended to provide these services. Instead, he ruthlessly misled customers and misappropriated their funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   16. As part of his scheme to defraud, McDonnell employed various pseudonyms, phone numbers, and bank accounts to conceal his identity and invented fictional employees, a fictional Wall Street office address, and fictional corporate titles to add an aura of legitimacy to his business. He used a wide array of social media accounts, promised his customers exorbitant gains and lifetime trading services, lied about his own trading record and experience as a virtual currency promoter and developer, and sent customers false reports showing imaginary large profits-all in a scheme to defraud his victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   17. McDonnell skillfully built personal relationships with his customers, gaining their trust so that he could later defraud them. He offered them loss-leaders: hooking victims by offering entry into trading advice groups for relatively low starter fees and then enticing them to send additional funds to join more advanced trading advice groups, purchase virtual currencies from him, and allow him to trade in virtual currencies on their behalf using their assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   18. When his victims caught onto this grift, McDonnell made a variety of false excuses, including a hacking of his accounts, to explain why he could not return their investments, eventually cutting-off all communication with his customers, destroying records, and hiding their funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   19. The evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt that McDonnell and CabbageTech engaged in a systematic pervasive fraudulent scheme between January and July 2017. The precision of Defendants' scheme, and his detailed method of operations, allows extrapolation backwards and forwards with respect to specific actions of fraud against specific customers (whether or not they testified). The evidence establishes a detailed modus operandi requiring the inference that all funds obtained by Defendants' illegal enterprise during the relevant time period must be attributed to Defendants' scheme to defraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   20. Judgment is required by fact and law to be entered in favor of the Commission, including entry of a permanent injunction, an award of restitution, and imposition of civil monetary penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   21. A permanent injunction is warranted including, among other elements, a permanent ban on Defendants controlling trading accounts for themselves or other persons, or soliciting or accepting payments from persons for trading in their commodity interests, or giving trading advice, or applying for or claiming exemption from registration with the Commission or engaging in any activity requiring such registration or exempt from registration pursuant to Commission Regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   22. The Commission's request for the injunction to preclude McDonnell himself from dealing in assets owned by himself is granted. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is rightly concerned with the capacity and ability of fraudulent operators such as the defendant to earn a living.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9054119\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/79/1309/#p1319\">\n    79 F.3d 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1319 (2d Cir. 1996) (\"[W]e carefully scrutinize unusual and severe conditions, such as one requiring the defendant to give up a lawful livelihood.\") (internal quotations omitted);\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jenkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276862\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/181/#p195\">\n    854 F.3d 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 195 (2d Cir. 2017) (vacating condition of supervised release where \"the nature of these employment restrictions\n   mean that, as a practical matter, he may never be employable\"). The instant case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    United States v. Doe\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jenkins\n   </em>\n   . Those cases involved criminal defendants who could be constantly controlled while on supervised release. If those defendants deviated from the terms of their supervised release, it would be reported to the court by Probation, and the court could punish them with, among other things, incarceration. There is no such procedure in place for the monitoring of McDonnell by the Commission. It would be almost impossible for the Commission to supervise McDonnell's individual trading. The extreme nature of defendant's fraudulent activities, as well as his general mendacity, have demonstrated that he cannot be trusted to trade only on his own behalf. He has used a number of pseudonyms, such as Jason Flack and others,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 94, and lied about his place of business,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 56. In addition, he has utilized his wife to transfer assets owed to others to her for hiding abroad,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 127, he has lied about the location of assets,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 127-128, he has violated the terms of the preliminary injunction entered against him on March 6, 2018,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 153, and he has refused to take responsibility for his actions that resulted in his victims being defrauded of assets worth hundreds of thousands of dollars,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 246.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   23. Restitution in the amount $290,429.29 is awarded in favor of CFTC against McDonnell. Defendant wrongfully received $292,693.54 in United States dollar and virtual currency transfers between February and June 2017. The final award of restitution requested by the Commission is reduced by $2,264.25, the value of a virtual currency transfer made by McDonnell to an investor in May 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   24. A civil monetary penalty of triple the monetary gain is appropriate in the instant case in view of the vicious defrauding of customers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7 U.S.C. \u00a7 13a-1(d)(1)(A).

McDonnell and his company-fully owned and controlled by McDonnell-CabbageTech, were charged by the Commission with operating \"a deceptive and fraudulent virtual currency scheme ... for purported virtual currency trading advice\" and \"for virtual currency purchases and trading ... misappropriat[ing investor] funds.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CFTC Complaint, ECF No. 1, at 1, Jan. 18, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   26.

On March 6, 2018, with advance notice,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order, ECF No. 23, Feb. 27, 2018, the court held an evidentiary hearing (the \"preliminary injunction hearing\") on the CFTC's motion for entry of a preliminary injunction; it received testimony and documentary evidence from the CFTC. McDonnell invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   28. The court explained that it expected fuller proof before it could grant relief other than a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   29. CabbageTech failed to appear, answer, or otherwise move. The court granted a default as to CabbageTech.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Entry for Proceedings, ECF No. 40, March 6, 2018;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Clerk's Certificate of Default as to Defendant CabbageTech, Corp., d/b/a Coin Drop Markets, ECF No. 164, Aug. 01, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   30. Following the preliminary injunction hearing, the court issued a Memorandum\n   and Order granting the Commission's motion for a preliminary injunction and holding that under the CFTC's broad anti-fraud authority the Commission may exercise its enforcement power over fraud related to virtual currencies transacted in interstate commerce.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Memorandum and Order of Preliminary Injunction and Other Relief, ECF No. 29, March 6, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   31.

From July 9, 2018, to July 12, 2018, a bench trial was held by the court. Testimony was heard from six witnesses and extensive written evidence was received in the form of more than 150 exhibits in support of the CFTC's allegations. The court determined that four alleged victims who testified were credible. Trial Tr. 432:08-18, 433:12-14, 433:24-25.

He provided responses to the preliminary injunction order in the form of an e-mail dated March 16, 2018, Trial Ex. 62; after a discovery conference before the magistrate judge, he made responses to the CFTC's interrogatories and document requests,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Ex. 73 (conference transcript excerpt). He made his interrogatory responses under penalty of perjury. Trial Ex. 63. With respect to all three of his interrogatory responses, document requests responses, Trial Ex. 64, and March 16 e-mail, Trial Ex. 62, McDonnell confirmed, under oath, that each was true, complete, and accurate, and that there was nothing to add to them.

ECF No. 137;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 138. Defendant's motion was made subsequent to his participation in the first day of trial, where he was made aware at the beginning of the trial that the court intended to hold a bench trial on all of CFTC's claims.

J. 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). Defendant participated in the bench trial after it was clear to him and all others participating in the litigation that the right to all remedies sought by the Commission were being tried. As a practical matter, McDonnell waived any of his jury trial rights. Such a waiver of jury was made in a formal manner by the plaintiff at the end of the bench trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 40. The defendant, by deliberately absenting himself, denied himself the right to protest the Commission's waiver. Pro se inadequacy to deal with procedural subtleties of a trial, including waiver of a jury, does not warrant, in this case, denial of waiver.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Richard H Fallon, Jr, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Hart &amp; Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System\n   </em>\n   388-389 (7\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   ed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   2015) (\"Few observers would view the Supreme Court's shifting decisions in this area as having provided a coherent approach to the general question of non-Article III adjudication.\"). Defendant has not properly sought legal assistance for himself,\n   <em>\n    see, supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, nor has he demonstrated non-possession of sufficient assets to retain an attorney (even if the assets were wrongfully acquired),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 12. At this stage of the proceeding, after a full bench trial with full awards sought by the Commission, the litigation is not subject to an attack of lack of jurisdiction of the court and Commission or of a denial of a jury trial. The special factual circumstances of this case require this ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   44. The nature of these proceedings-in which the defendant has substantial interests at stake in terms of his livelihood, as well as injunction, restitution, and monetary penalties-raises the issue of whether the instant administrative enforcement action brought by the Commission circumvents the Constitution, and forces McDonnell to try what, in effect, is a criminal case without counsel and without the protections afforded to him by the Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment, and other constitutional and statutory provisions. The basic structure of administrative agencies, such as the Commission, is premised upon the conception that it is the agency, rather than a jury, which will find guilt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Comment,\n   <em>\n    The Imposition of Administrative Penalties and the Right to Trial by Jury -An Unheralded Expansion of Criminal Law\n   </em>\n   ? 65 J. Crim. L. &amp; C. 345 (1974) (\"Today agencies commonly utilize the imposition of some type of monetary sanction for an alleged violation of an agency rule. In the majority of instances, an individual accused of a violation receives no jury trial to determine guilt or innocence.\n   <em>\n    The agency itself performs this function.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis added). Administrative agencies can be thought of as the fourth branch of government; they, like the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, are bound by the Constitution. They cannot avoid a constitutional right of trial by jury in what is, in essence, a criminal case; nor can administrative agencies avoid their burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in such cases. But, in view of the defaults of McDonnell, waiver by the Commission, and the special circumstances of this case, the court believes there is no point in addressing this fundamental administrative law issue further. It should be noted, however, that all relevant material facts were proven beyond a reasonable doubt in this case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 19;\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6\u00b6 47, 179, 229.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   45.

In or around April 2017, Defendants advertised \"membership\" in trading groups such as RedliteGreenLite, BTC (\"RLGLBTC\"), relating to Bitcoin, and RedliteGreenLite, LTC (\"RLGLLTC\"), relating to the virtual currency Litecoin.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Exs. 1 (e-mail confirming RLGLLTC membership), 70 at \"Exhibit 19\" and \"Exhibit 20\" (bitcoin forum advertisements), 162-63 (Twitter messages regarding RLGLLTC); Trial Tr. 173:09-20.

Those \"memberships\" were of no help to customers and were used to defraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   104.

Such expert services were not delivered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   106. The nominal price of the trial membership and the relatively inexpensive prices of the next-higher membership levels fraudulently produced income for McDonnell.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Ex. 125 (Coin Drop Markets PayPal account transaction log, payments received worksheet). The low\n   entry prices deliberately developed targets softened up to be defrauded by McDonnell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   107. Once customers had made an initial purchase, McDonnell solicited \"lifetime\" memberships in a more exclusive trading sector or \"elite\" group that supposedly would provide greater opportunities to profit from virtual currency trading.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Exs. 6 (\"You may wanna consider joining RLGLBTC it's direct 1-on-1 trading alongside me and all members involved real-time.\"; \"The program is 1 BTC for it's [sic] lifetime been running since 2010 so there is a lot of BTC buying power\"), 163 (\"You send me 1 BTC I'll trade w/you personally minute-2- minute all coins\"); Trial Tr. 52:20-53:16, 56:13-57:09, 161:07-161:22.

McDonnell shut his company down in mid-2017, well before he and CabbageTech had provided a year's worth of services.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Tr. 174:20-24, 239:20-240:01; Trial Ex. 84 (June 5 dep.) at 160:23- 161:11. McDonnell never provided, and never intended to provide, the promised entry-and-exit-point guidance for a specific transaction related to Titcoin via the Slack group that he had formed.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Tr. 163:20-165:14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   110. McDonnell directed his customers to buy Titcoin \"at any price,\" and then ceased communicating with customers as part of his scheme to defraud.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, investors who followed this direction suffered substantial losses.

Many customers made payments in United States dollars and in virtual currency to McDonnell and CabbageTech in exchange for promised expert-guidance subscription services.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Tr. 45:22-46:14, 159:23-160:04, 161:07-13, 206:05-207:17, 337:01-342:14, 348:09-356:11; Trial Exs. 90-91 (Bittrex account records). The expected guidance was never intended to be supplied, and was never supplied as promised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   113. The customers knew McDonnell's bitcoin, litecoin, and other virtual currency addresses because McDonnell specified various of these addresses to them.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Tr. 54:01-08, 54:14-56:22; Trial Exs. 8 at 2, 163. The addresses were furnished as part of a fraud to obtain assets from customers by McDonnell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   114. McDonnell never provided promised expert services, and he ceased providing any services at all after receiving customer funds.

McDonnell has not disputed this; when asked, McDonnell claimed under oath that he did not even recall a customer's request for a refund. Trial Ex. 84 (June 5 dep.) at 254:17-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   116. The large numbers of memberships claimed were a figment of imagination of McDonnell with no basis in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   117. McDonnell never intended to provide a year's worth or a lifetime's worth of\n   promised expert services. He was not capable of doing so. Instead, the only reasonable inference is that the fraudulent membership offers were designed not only to generate Defendants' income, but to get victims in the door and to position them for further fraudulent solicitations for greater and greater amounts.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Tr. 52:17-53:02, 53:13-54:08, 58:11-59:15, 161:03-22, 205:19-206:20, 208:18-209:11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   v.

From that time until June, quite a few times. A lot of times, actually.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-276\">\n   Q Did you ever call him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-277\">\n   A Yes, I have called him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-278\">\n   Q And when you called him, what phone number did you dial?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-279\">\n   A I dialed the number that he sent me in the e-mail, which was a 1-888 number....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-280\">\n   Q Did you ever correspond with him by e-mail?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-281\">\n   A Yes, I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-282\">\n   Q When you received e-mails from him, what e-mail address did you receive them at?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-283\">\n   A They are from coindropmarkets@gmail.com....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-284\">\n   Q And about how many times would you say you corresponded with him over e-mail?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-285\">\n   A A lot of times. I e-mail, like, almost every day. So, all the time, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-286\">\n   Q During around what time period were you e-mailing with him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-287\">\n   A From January of 2017 until June, middle of June [2017] somewhere....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-288\">\n   Q Aside from the 888 number that you mentioned, were there any other phone numbers that were associated with Coin Drop Markets?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-289\">\n   A He sent me another number, but I very rarely got him on that number. So, it was mostly the 1-888 number that we used.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-290\">\n   Q Do you recall what phone number that was?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-291\">\n   A I think it's 718 number....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-292\">\n   Q Mr. Taylor, if you take a look at this e-mail, Exhibit 42, do you see a phone number in this e-mail?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-293\">\n   A Yes.

And he was Jason's boss, as far as Jason would say to me....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-301\">\n   Q In your conversions with Jason Flack, did he ever offer any services?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-302\">\n   A Yes. He called me and he offered me -- to sell me a membership that would allow me then to recommend stocks and cryptocurrencies as a service.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-303\">\n   Q And did you ever sign up for any of those services?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-304\">\n   A Yes, I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-305\">\n   Q Which ones?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-306\">\n   A I signed up for two services; one was a diamond service, and one was an agritech service....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-307\">\n   Q And when you signed up for these services, what did you believe you would receive?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-308\">\n   A Well, they were for a year and I was supposed to get recommendations every week.... So, my concept was that this was a recommendation service to buy and sell crypto coins and stocks....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-309\">\n   Q And after you paid and signed up for the services, did you receive any type of invoice or receipt?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-310\">\n   A I got an e-mail stating that they received the payment, how much the payment was, and what the service was proposed to me....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-311\">\n   Q With respect to [Exhibit] 44, do you recognize this document?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-312\">\n   A Yes. This was a diamond service.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-313\">\n   Q And what does this e-mail reflect?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-314\">\n   A It tells me that I'm now a member of the service and what the privileges that was listed on the website, when they had the website there, and the cost of $1.99, which was more of a teaser-type service....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-315\">\n   Q Could you turn to [Exhibit] 45? Do you recognize this document?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-316\">\n   A Yes. This was for the agritech analyzer and it was more in-depth membership for 249.99.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-318\">\n   Q This is a receipt for signing up?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-319\">\n   A Yes, it is.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-320\">\n   Q Let me draw your attention down to the middle of the page. There's a reference to \"membership rewards.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-321\">\n   A Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-322\">\n   Q What was membership rewards?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-323\">\n   A It was 250 off their Cabbage dollar, which was supposed to be their own crypto token. So, it's a form of, like, Bitcoin, only it was just a small fraction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-324\">\n   Q Was that a reward for signing up for this subscription?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-325\">\n   A That was a reward for signing up for the subscription....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-326\">\n   Q Now, what made you want to sign up for these services from Coin Drop and Jason Flack?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-327\">\n   A Well, he called me and he told me he offered these services. When I signed up with the $1.99, he actually sent me recommendations for two stocks and they did very well. And then afterwards, he called me up and said I can get more of an in-depth membership for the 249 and that would also be cryptocurrency. And with a cryptocurrency, they could offer -- I'm trying to find the word here. Anyway, they could keep the currency for me and trade it for that service.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-328\">\n   Q So, aside from signing up for subscriptions, are you saying they offered\n   another service in which they would buy cryptocurrency for you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-329\">\n   A That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-330\">\n   Q Did you receive solicitations for Coin Drop Markets to buy virtual currency for you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-331\">\n   A Yes. The first was they offered me Bitcoins at $1,011, I think it was, and I said, Okay, yeah, I'll buy four of them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-332\">\n   Q And how did you receive those solicitations?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-333\">\n   A He called me by phone. And after I said I will buy four, he sent me an e-mail with somewhat of an invoice, stating what the transaction was, how much it would cost, and what I would need to send him....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-334\">\n   Q Do you recognize this document [Exhibit 43]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-335\">\n   A Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-336\">\n   Q What is it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-337\">\n   A This one was offering to sell me Bitcoins at $1,000 because he said that there was someone in his -- one of his clients wanted to sell some of their Bitcoins, so he could get me them at $1,000....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-339\">\n   Q About how many times did you end up buying virtual currencies from Jason Flack and Coin Drop?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-340\">\n   A Ten.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-341\">\n   Q And what types of virtual currencies did you buy?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-342\">\n   A Bitcoin, Botcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ethereum Lite. And, also, Tigr ICO.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-343\">\n   Q And during what time period was it that you were making these virtual currency purchases?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-344\">\n   A Between February and June of 2017....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-345\">\n   Q When you were buying virtual currencies, how did you go about making your purchase?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-346\">\n   A I would buy a money order from the bank. And first few times, what he did was he send me a Federal Express package that had his self-addressed FedEx envelope, and I would put the money order into the envelopes and drop it at the Federal Express office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-347\">\n   Q You mentioned you got cashier's checks from the bank. What bank was that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-348\">\n   A The Bank of Nova Scotia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-349\">\n   Q And when you sent the Federal Express back to Jason Flack, were you using an account number he provided?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-350\">\n   A Yes. He always provided, give me an account number.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-351\">\n   Q And you mentioned you would receive an invoice for your purchases; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-352\">\n   A Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-353\">\n   Q When you received the invoice, how did you receive it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-354\">\n   A By e-mail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-355\">\n   Q And what would the invoice reflect?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-356\">\n   A It would state the number of coins that it was buying, how much it would cost, when is the closing, the settlement date, send -- yeah, how I need to send it back, send him money....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-357\">\n   Q What is [Exhibit 47]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-358\">\n   A This is an invoice for Bitcoin tokens at $1,011 each for $4,044.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-359\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-360\">\n   Q And after you purchased the virtual currency, how did you receive it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-361\">\n   A I didn't receive the tokens like as it said here, settlement funds and CDM escrow, because they would -- as part of the service that they offered was to keep the coins in escrow and they trade because they have other clients that they offer the service to, and, so, because they're buying in bulk and trading in bulk, they could get better prices for them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-362\">\n   Q Just to make sure I understand, you understood that they were going to be holding it in escrow, but trading it for you; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-363\">\n   A Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-364\">\n   Q In total, how many money orders did you send to Jason Flack?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-365\">\n   A Ten....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-366\">\n   Q And in total, what was the total -- around the total amount of the 10 checks?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-367\">\n   A Somewhere around $25,000....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-368\">\n   Q Mr. Taylor, you said when you sent the money orders you sent them by Fed Ex; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-369\">\n   A That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-370\">\n   Q And you sent them using a Fed Ex account number Jason Flack provided?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-371\">\n   A That's correct....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-372\">\n   Q Where did you send the Fed Exes to?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-373\">\n   A They are to 20 Rawson Place, ... Staten Island....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-374\">\n   Q After you signed up for the services from Jason Flack and Coin Drop Markets, did you receive recommendations for virtual currency purchases?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-375\">\n   A Yes, I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-376\">\n   Q And how did you receive those recommendations?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-377\">\n   A By e-mail ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-378\">\n   Q Could you turn to [Exhibit] 46. Do you recognize this document?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-379\">\n   A Yes, I do. It was a sell alert for Ethereum coin.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-380\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-381\">\n   Q At the time you received this alert, had you already purchased Ethereum from Coin Drop Markets?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-382\">\n   A Yes, I purchased from them. But with this alert -- because when I got this alert and he says, okay, you have this stuff in escrow, but we're selling it. And he said well, this is for the people who they don't have an escrow for. For the stuff in escrow, he's managing it for me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-383\">\n   Q Could you turn to the second page of Exhibit 46. What is this document?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-384\">\n   A This is their recommendation for the Ethereum currency and it gives a breakdown of -- well, they have a graph, a breakdown of the entry point and what target they're looking at and then an analysis of why they think it would get to that price.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-385\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-386\">\n   Q And after receiving this type of analysis, what was your impression?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-387\">\n   A I thought it was good. I thought they were professional and they seemed to know what they were doing, so....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-388\">\n   COURT: What does it mean when it says we are exiting Ethereum, BLOCKCHAIN in caps, symbol ETH, for the following reasons, and then in black letter it says projected RO1 realized ...?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-389\">\n   WITNESS: So the initial purchase that they recommended I think was for $12 and something, and they had a goal of getting to $50. So the stock was -- the crypto was -- went over -- I think at $53 at the time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-390\">\n   COURT: Was in that the 300 percent increase?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-391\">\n   WITNESS: That's correct....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-392\">\n   COURT: So your impression was that they were selling your investment in this security or ... commodity?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-393\">\n   WITNESS: Because they had that investment for me in escrow.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-394\">\n   COURT: Well, did you receive that profit?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-395\">\n   WITNESS: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-396\">\n   COURT: What happened to the profit?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-397\">\n   WITNESS: I didn't receive anything from them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-398\">\n   COURT: Did you ask for it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-399\">\n   WITNESS: Yes, I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-400\">\n   COURT: You asked for the 300 percent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-401\">\n   WITNESS: Not at that moment. I asked for it; they said -- well, they said they had sold -- they sold Ethereum and he bought the Litecoin because he was trading it in this account, so he sold Ethereum and bought Litecoin at the time....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-402\">\n   COURT: Did you have any other [virtual currencies]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-403\">\n   WITNESS: I had Bitcoin....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-404\">\n   COURT: You had more [virtual currency]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-405\">\n   WITNESS: Yes\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-406\">\n   COURT: That he didn't sell?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-407\">\n   WITNESS: Right, he didn't sell.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-408\">\n   COURT: How much more?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-409\">\n   WITNESS: I would have to look at it. I don't remember how much it was at the time, because at this time both Bitcoin and Ethereum had appreciated, so this\n   was like a couple months after I had initially bought them and he was managing the account, so all I looked at was what they sent me, a daily report -- I mean, a daily report saying that your investment is at this level. I didn't print off the stuff every day, I just looked at it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-410\">\n   COURT: But you gave him permission to manage the account, did you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-411\">\n   WITNESS: Yes.... Because that was one of the services that they offered, to keep the account, the coins in escrow, and to trade them because that would give a better return than just putting the coins in an account and just let it appreciate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-412\">\n   Q And, Mr. Taylor, after you made your virtual currency purchases and Flack was holding them in escrow, was there a way for you to know what was being held in escrow?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-413\">\n   A Yes, they sent me -- they sent me an update, an account update every week day. Every morning on each week day they would send me an e-mail with an account update, how much was in the account, and also a link to their web pages that had my account summary in it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-414\">\n   Q Was it important to you to know what your account balance was?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-415\">\n   A Yes, it was, because if the thing wasn't appreciating, then, you know, I don't know if it's going up or down so you can tell him to get rid of it and get your money out of it, right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-416\">\n   Q Can you turn to [Exhibit] 49. Do you recognize this document?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-417\">\n   A Yes\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-418\">\n   Q What is it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-419\">\n   A It was one of the daily e-mail reports.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-421\">\n   Q Now, at the top of the page it states digital currency multi-wallet as of June 20, 2017, and there is a figure there of about $176,000.... What did this reflect?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-422\">\n   A That reflects the current value of all the coins that he had in escrow for me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-423\">\n   Q And is $176,000 more than you originally sent him to purchase the coins?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-424\">\n   A Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-425\">\n   Q Is it significantly more?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-426\">\n   A It is significantly more.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-427\">\n   Q Now, you mentioned that you could click on the link and it would take you to a website; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-428\">\n   A Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-429\">\n   Q What website was that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-430\">\n   A That would be Coin Drop Markets website, which had a -- which took me right into my account on their website. That was their member -- they have -- just a regular site and their membership section, and that took me into the member's section with my account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-431\">\n   Q And once you had logged into the website and were looking at your account, what could you see?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-432\">\n   A I could see the summary of all the transactions that was done, how much it's worth, and how many coins I had and what coins I had.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-433\">\n   Q And about how many times would you say did you log into the website to look at your account?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-434\">\n   A Two or three times a week ... [d]uring the course of February to June ... 2017....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-435\">\n   Q Would you turn to [Exhibit] 50. Do you recognize this document?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-436\">\n   A Yes, I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-437\">\n   Q What is it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-438\">\n   A This is the -- my account summary of my membership page that I would go to to see what I had and the value of it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-439\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-440\">\n   Q And is this a screen shot of what you saw on the website when you logged in?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-441\">\n   A Yes [from June 2017]....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-442\">\n   Q Now, drawing your attention to the left-hand side of the document, there is a section that says member interest and there are some entries below it. What did the member interest represent?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-443\">\n   A This is the amount of coins that I had. At that time I had Litecoin, I had Ethereum Classic, and I had some of that IDCO, TIGR that they were offering.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-444\">\n   Q If you go a little bit farther down on the left side, it says multi-wallet estimated combined value. What does the figure below that represent?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-445\">\n   A That's the combined value of all of the above coins.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-446\">\n   Q And below that it says escrow charge summary waived indefinitely. What does that reflect?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-447\">\n   A They waive the escrow charges because they're doing their -- their charges from the trading....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-448\">\n   Q A little bit farther on the left-hand side, there is a section that says member deposits and there are some entries below it.

So then I went onto Coin Base, used my passport and all that to create the know-your-customer information set up in Coin Base, and then I sent him back that information, and then a day later he came back and says, well, Coin Base said that CDM needs to set up their own know-your-customer. And then I just said well, I mean, you're not coming -- you are not being forthcoming with my money. So we went back and forth and back and forth and then that was it.

There was a lot of -- a lot of angry people there, but also in the Slack channel Mr. McDonnell was pushing a crypto currency that he claimed he was designing and coding at the time called TIGR tokens. He was, I think, trying to sell this to members of the Slack group.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-805\">\n   Q And so you were describing that there were a number of users complaining about it. And then what happened?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-806\">\n   A They just started to disappear overnight.

He was very personable and he built a relationship with you. There were days we would message quite often. We would talk about the market. He would try to be your friend. He built a relationship with you and he became a trustworthy figure in my mind after spending so much time talking to him and being so personable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-890\">\n   Q Was there anything about the Coin Drop Markets Twitter account that lent it a sense of legitimacy the way that you mentioned the Facebook page had?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-891\">\n   A So Mr. McDonnell's Twitter accounts had thousands of followers, you know, which legitimized in my mind his credentials.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-892\">\n   Q In the mind of a [new trader] lots of followers seemed a positive aspects?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-893\">\n   A That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-894\">\n   Q Sitting here today, is that still your view?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-895\">\n   A No, it isn't....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-896\">\n   Q After you bought the trial membership, did you ever send Mr. McDonnell any more money?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-897\">\n   A Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-898\">\n   Q What was the second amount of money that you sent him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-899\">\n   A On McDonnell's Coin Drop Markets website, there was an upgraded gold or diamond membership, which I recall was $50 or $60, which I signed up for.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-900\">\n   Q What were the factors in your decision to sign up for that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-901\">\n   A I signed up for that because Patrick McDonnell portrayed that he had a Wall Street background and he could make me a more profitable and better trader. It was an upgraded package with more sophisticated trade exit and trade entry signals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-902\">\n   Q You expected a higher level of service and expertise based on that membership?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-903\">\n   A That is correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-904\">\n   Q And that expectation was from what Mr. McDonnell told you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-905\">\n   A That is correct....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-906\">\n   Q Did Mr. McDonnell ever talk to you about his background in cryptocurrency?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-907\">\n   A Yes, he did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-908\">\n   Q What did he tell you his background in cryptocurrency was?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-909\">\n   A Mr. McDonnell told me that he was a developer/promoter of several coins that were introduced during 2014, during the past years, previous to my time with McDonnell, including Potcoin, Titcoin, and he was a promoter of Dogecoin....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-910\">\n   Q And did Mr. McDonnell's supposed background in virtual currency and supposed to Wall Street trading background, were those things that factored into your decision to buy membership services from him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-911\">\n   A Yes, it was.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-912\">\n   Q Did you send McDonnell any more money for any membership service at any point in time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-913\">\n   A Yes, I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-914\">\n   Q What was the next one?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-915\">\n   A The next one was sending McDonnell Bitcoin for more minute-to-minute\n   guidance on trading. McDonnell told me show me you're committed, you know, within a year, you know, you will be an expert trader and you'll never have to pay me again, bro, I love you as one of my kids.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-916\">\n   Q And what did you pay for that membership?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-917\">\n   A I sent McDonnell Bitcoin.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-918\">\n   Q Do you remember the name of that membership or how it was described?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-919\">\n   A The -- from what I recall, the membership was not on his website.

Well, Mr. McDonnell told us to buy but never when to exit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-928\">\n   Q I should ask two questions. Did he say that he was going to give a specific entry and exit trade guidance with respect to a Titcoin trade through the Slack group?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-929\">\n   A Mr. McDonnell just only told us to buy it. He never told us -- he never gave us an exit -- he never told us when to exit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-930\">\n   Q He told you to get in?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-931\">\n   A At any price.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-932\">\n   Q And did you follow that advice?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-933\">\n   A I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-934\">\n   Q What was your understanding about receiving exit guidance?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-935\">\n   A My understanding was, you know, I would listen to Pat since he was so knowledgeable and I would sell when he told me to.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-936\">\n   Q And you understood he was going to tell you when to sell?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-937\">\n   A Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-938\">\n   Q And you thought he was going to tell you when to sell and you thought it was going to be profitable?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-939\">\n   A Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-940\">\n   Q What happened when he didn't tell you when to sell?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-941\">\n   A Shortly after, whether it was minutes or hours, the price crashed significantly. I don't remember the exact percentage, but it crashed pretty significantly....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-942\">\n   Q And the result of the trade, was it profitable or unprofitable for you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-943\">\n   A Unprofitable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-944\">\n   Q How unprofitable was it for you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-945\">\n   A Definitely more than 50 percent.

Mr. McDonnell told me via message that he made approximately 120 to 123K trading Litecoin that day,\n   that he wished he had my capital to also trade with it, and he told me that there was a day where he made 73 Bitcoin, and he was pushing on the subject where he said I wish I was trading with your capital.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-950\">\n   Q He suggested to you that he was enjoying a great trading success?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-951\">\n   A Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-952\">\n   Q And that he could accomplish the same results with your virtual currency?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-953\">\n   A Yes. He said with my capital he could -- you know, I would make half to two Bitcoin a day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-954\">\n   COURT: Was that before you sold or after?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-955\">\n   WITNESS: This was my capital not associated with Titcoin. On Titcoin, I didn't go all in, I only went with a portion of my funds at the time. So, with Titcoin, there was only about like maybe five, ten percent of my funds, and McDonnell was trying to, you know, get the majority of -- he was implying that he wanted to use the majority of my capital -- if I lent him the majority of my capital to trade with, then he could make good profits....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-956\">\n   COURT: Approximately how much [virtual currency capital in total did you have]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-957\">\n   WITNESS: At the time it was worth about 40 to 50,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-958\">\n   COURT: Was he aware of that?

You're the first one to pop its cherry....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-980\">\n   Q Did you have any sense or did you see at the time that Coin Drop Markets was offering a service that sounded something like Redlite or Greenlite?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-981\">\n   A Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-982\">\n   Q What do you remember of that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-983\">\n   A Mr. McDonnell was going to offer a new service for -- going to buy Litecoin and he would give entry and exit signals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-984\">\n   Q And that was called Redlite Greenlite LTC?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-985\">\n   A That is correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-986\">\n   Q And Mr. McDonnell told you about this at some point?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-987\">\n   A Yes, he did, through Twitter messages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-988\">\n   Q After your Titcoin trade around about May 2017, did you understand anything about any security issues at Coin Drop Markets?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-989\">\n   A In June the website Coin Drop Markets had a brief message that said, We have been hacked and for safety concerns we are suspending membership services. And that was also updated on the Coin Drop Markets Twitter....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-990\">\n   Q Do you remember any deactivation of any of the accounts that you associated with Mr. McDonnell?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-991\">\n   A Yes. Mr. McDonnell deactivated the -- several Twitter accounts, including the Coin Drop Markets, the XBT Trading Group Twitter account was suspended, and the only Twitter account that, you know, from June to early July that was active was the Mr. Pat McDonnell account, and that soon was -- it soon vanished as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-992\">\n   Q Did you ever -- did you get a year's worth of an annual membership from Mr. McDonnell?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-993\">\n   A No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-994\">\n   Q Did you get a lifetime of expert trading guidance?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-995\">\n   A No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-996\">\n   Q Did you get any TIGR token?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-997\">\n   A No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-998\">\n   Q Never?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-999\">\n   A Never.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-1000\">\n   Q Did you try to contact Mr. McDonnell to get your money back or to follow up on these services?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-1001\">\n   A Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-1002\">\n   Q How many times?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-1003\">\n   A So I tried calling Mr. McDonnell previously in April. April -- late April, early May he sent me a phone number, which was supposed to be Mr. McDonnell's direct access. I called that number, you know, during -- you know, several times during the month of June. I also kept trying to message McDonnell through his -- the Mr. Pat McDonnell Twitter account which was still active, and I tried e-mailing the Coin Drop Markets Gmail account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-1004\">\n   Q What happened to the Slack account?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-1005\">\n   A Shortly after the Titcoin scenario where the price crashed, the Slack account was deleted shortly after then....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-1006\">\n   Q And did you ever speak with Mr. McDonnell by telephone?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-1007\">\n   A Yes, I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-1008\">\n   Q And so you are aware of what his voice sounds like?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-1009\">\n   A Yes, I am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-1010\">\n   Q Have you looked on any publicly-available websites to try to find other\n   instances of recordings of his voice being available?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-1011\">\n   A Yes, I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-1012\">\n   Q What did you find?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-1013\">\n   A On YouTube there were a couple of videos, PK McDonnell, Pat McDonnell, like Wolf of Wall Street videos, the name of it had Wolf of Wall Street in it like Crypto PK McDonnell.

It looked shady to me, but developing a relationship with Mr. McDonnell who said that his past misdeeds, he was a changed man. He was very personable with me. He would always message me. It took a lot of effort on McDonnell's behalf to communicate with me. And emotionally I, you know, formed a relationship with him.

And the second part of that statement, \"it's been a ride, though, but there's a better way,\" was Mr. McDonnell trying to change my opinion into, you know, giving him some capital for his new ICO cryptocurrency that he was coming out with -- allegedly coming out with.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-1147\">\n   Q You understood this to be Mr. McDonnell soliciting you for your Litecoin so that he could trade and essentially double the money?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-1148\">\n   A Yes, I do, sir. Yes, I did, sir.... There was also an additional message where Mr. McDonnell said: Man, I wish I had your capital. I made about 120 grand trading today. That was an additional message that I got, which I assume was him, you know, trying to talk me into trading with my capital.

The solicitations promised services for 12 or more months in exchange for an up-front fee.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Trial Exs. 1 (referring to \"2 Year\" membership), 44 (referring to \"Annual Fee\"); Trial Tr. 257:22-258:12 (referring to \"lifetime membership\" for guidance and training). Customers did not receive a year's worth of annual membership.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Tr. 174:20-24. Instead, McDonnell ceased all communications with customers around June or July 2017.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Tr. 239:20-240:01. As an example of the execution of Defendants' scheme to defraud, Dimovski testified that McDonnell gave him entry advice for a specific trade concerning Titcoin, but McDonnell then failed to give any exit signal; this ultimately resulted in Dimovski incurring significant trading losses. Trial Tr. 163:20-165:14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1182\">\n   211. In connection with the scheme to defraud, Defendants made misrepresentations and omissions in solicitations concerning trading virtual currencies on behalf of customers. For example, McDonnell falsely claimed a virtual currency trading track record and an ongoing record of exceptional trading performance.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Exs. 14, 161. These claims were false: rather than trading over $50 million in BTC for an established group, Trial Ex. 14, or earning 73 BTC in a single day, Tr. Ex. 161, McDonnell was simply misappropriating customer funds and issuing false reports to them,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Tr. 278:22-280:04. McDonnell also made false and misleading claims about his experience and expertise with virtual currency, including in the development and promotion of new virtual currencies. Trial Tr. 160:05-161:02. Under oath, McDonnell stated that he did not recall being involved in the development of any such currencies. Trial Ex. 84 (June 5 dep.) at 86:19-87:14. McDonnell also falsely promised customers rapidly\n   profitable in-and-out virtual currency investments.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Exs. 6 (promising 300 percent returns in less than three days and stating \"1 BTC in should produce 3 BTC out\"), 8 at 2 (promising 2 to 300 percent profit on 76 Litecoin each day of trading), 167 (promising to make 0.5 to 2 bitcoin daily for a customer). These solicitations were false; in fact McDonnell never accomplished such trading results for customers; he misappropriated the funds.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Tr. 70:20-25, 106:02-07, 229:05-230:13; Trial Exs. 51, 77, 79, 82, 83. Defendants represented to Taylor that Defendants would purchase virtual currencies on his behalf, hold the virtual currencies in escrow, and trade them on Taylor's behalf. Trial Tr. 213:9-21, 218:14-20, 221:12-20. In reality, Defendants misappropriated Taylor's funds and never returned them in connection with Defendants' scheme to defraud.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Tr. 232:07-18, 278:22-280:04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1183\">\n   212. In connection with their scheme to defraud, Defendants misrepresented to CabbageTech's managed trading customers the value of their investments and the profitability of trades. For example, Defendants sent Taylor multiple emails showing the value of Taylor's account, including one showing that the account balance had grown to $176,703.34 from an original investment of about $25,000. Trial Tr. 221:22-222:23; Trial Ex. 49. Defendants sent another customer an email on June 17, 2018 stating that the customer's account balance was up to 676 Litecoin, when at the same time McDonnell had been looting the Bittrex cdmmerchant account and had begun transferring litecoins to the account opened in his wife's name.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. 82 at 4; Trial Tr. 357:22-367:12. Defendants made false account information, including account balances, available to CabbageTech customers through the CabbageTech website. Trial Tr. 223:4-225:17; Trial Ex. 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1184\">\n   213. In connection with their scheme to defraud, Defendants made repeated misrepresentations concerning the availability of customer funds for withdrawal and in connection with withdrawal requests. For example, Defendants falsely represented to Taylor that he could withdraw funds at any time, Trial Tr. 228:18-229:4, but when Taylor requested to withdraw $25,000, McDonnell gave Taylor a litany of false excuses and misrepresentations, including that Taylor's check was on the secretary's desk, that the refund would be sent by FedEx, and that funds would be repaid in bitcoin deposited into a Coin Base account, Trial Tr. 229:5-230:20; Tr. Ex. 51. Defendants omitted to tell Taylor that his funds had been misappropriated; Taylor never received any of his money or virtual currency back. Trial Tr. 236:19-23. Defendants falsely represented to multiple CabbageTech customers that the company's website had been hacked and shut down to cover up the fact that CabbageTech customer funds had been misappropriated, used by McDonnell for personal expenses almost immediately after depositing his customers' checks or secreted in an account in his wife's name. Trial Ex. 52; Trial Tr. 237:14-239:4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1185\">\n   214. In order to conceal their fraudulent scheme, Defendants omitted to disclose their misappropriation of CabbageTech customer funds or that they would not return customer funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1186\">\n   215. Misappropriation of customer funds constitutes fraud that violates Section 6(c)(1) of the Act and Regulation 180.1(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CFTC v.

Defendants misappropriated all of the funds obtained from customers as part of their scheme to defraud. McDonnell often withdrew customer funds deposited into the CabbageTech TD Bank Account through ATMs soon after receipt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. 139; Trial Tr. 394:18-22, 395:5-11.

On June 17, 18, and 19, 2017--at the same time that customer demands for refunds were mounting--McDonnell improperly transferred more than 660 litecoin from the Bittrex cdmmerchant account to the Bittrex cryptoclown account. Trial Exs. 90-91, 95-96, 150-152; Trial Tr. 133:17-136:23, 357:22-367:12. No customer received funds or virtual currency back.

Each of Defendants' numerous misrepresentations are individually and collectively material. A reasonable investor would consider each important in deciding whether to invest, remain invested, or make additional investments with CabbageTech and McDonnell in the purchase or sale of virtual currencies, or to seek advice on trading from Defendants. For example, the Defendants' misrepresentations concerning CabbageTech's business are material: a reasonable investor would find it important to know if the firm he had entrusted his funds to was only a one-man boiler room in Staten Island that did not have a prestigious Wall Street address, virtual currency expertise, or multiple employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

Scienter was proven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1196\">\n   225. Defendants' conduct in making material misrepresentations and omissions and misappropriating customer funds was intentional or, at a minimum, reckless. For example, Defendants intentionally, or with reckless disregard to their truth, made representations concerning CabbageTech's size, location, and number of employees were false. McDonnell himself owned and controlled CabbageTech and knew that he operated it by himself from his home basement in Staten Island.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. 84 (June 5 dep.) at 144:10-145:12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1197\">\n   226. When Defendants solicited customers, they intentionally, or with reckless disregard to their truth, made false representations concerning the trading advice subscriptions. Defendants' statements were false when made: customers were promised one or more years, or even a lifetime, of advice services shortly before McDonnell abruptly closed the enterprise.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Ex. 133 (showing Slack group creation on May 14, 2017 and deletion on June 15, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1198\">\n   227. When Defendants solicited customers to provide funds for virtual currency trading on the customers' behalf, they intentionally, or with reckless disregard to their truth, made exaggerated representations and promises of profits that were known by them to be false when made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1199\">\n   228. Defendants never intended to provide the promised trading signals and advice, or to trade on behalf of customers, as evidenced by the immediate misappropriation of customer funds. For example, McDonnell deposited one cashier's check for investments from Taylor, and the next day wrote a check in a similar amount to pay his rent. Trial Exs. 138, 139; Trial Tr. 455:01-09.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1200\">\n   229. The intentional nature of Defendants' conduct is evidenced and proven beyond a reasonable doubt by the blatant disregard of customers' complaints and their refusal to return investors' funds. When customers asked to withdraw their investments and purported gains, McDonnell would offer a series of false excuses for delays in repayment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Ex. 51, 77. Taylor sent repeated emails asking for his funds to be returned and made phone calls that went unanswered. Trial Tr. 231:06-08, 239:25-240:01; Trial Ex. 51. Other customers asked for withdrawals that were never honored. Trial Tr. 70:20-25; Trial Exs. 27, 82, 83. Instead, Defendants cut off communications with customers who asked for their money. Trial Tr. 174:12-19, 239:20-240:1. Except for the one minor gratuitous payment, no customer ever received money or virtual currency from Defendants. Trial Tr. 71:03-15, 109:03-109:12, 236:19-23. At deposition and under oath, McDonnell falsely stated that he \"d[idn't] recall\" any CabbageTech customer ever requesting a refund, Trial Ex. 84 (June 5 dep.) at 254:17-20, or complaining about anything, Trial Ex. 85 (June 19 dep.) at 50:3-51:15. McDonnell also falsely stated that he did not recall Brewell ever asking him for any money or virtual currency back,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 48:19-49:3, did not recall ever communicating with Anthony Dimovski,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 52:16-53:5, and did not recall any customer named Junor Taylor, or ever emailing Taylor, speaking with Taylor on the telephone, or sending or receiving anything to or from Taylor via Federal Express,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 58:13-61:7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1201\">\n   230.

The appropriate calculation of restitution in cases of pervasive fraud under the CEA includes all customer losses even where only a subset of those customers testified at trial.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter Wise\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272688\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/21/1317/#p1353\">\n    21 F.Supp.3d at 1352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (determining in connection with violations of Section 6(c) of the Act and Rule 180.1 that \"[t]he systematic and pervasive nature of [the defendant's] fraud necessitates restitution not only for the retail customers who testified to the losses they sustained due to [the defendant's] scheme, but for all of [defendant's] customers as well.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1226\">\n   251.

The records show money obtained and misappropriated from them by Defendants. Where customer funds are obtained under false pretenses, the appropriate calculation of restitution includes all customers who are reasonably found to\n   have relied on such misstatements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CFTC v.

The Commission has properly assumed reliance by customers who testified and who did not testify based on the testimony and documents showing a fraudulent mode of operation as to each of Defendants' clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1228\">\n   253. The testimony and evidence presented at trial established that Defendants--from January to July 2017--engaged in a systemic and pervasive scheme to mislead customers and misappropriate their funds. There can be no more fundamental omission than the Defendants' failure to disclose that they had no intent to provide the services promised, but rather, that they were executing a fraudulent scheme to misappropriate customer assets and intended to continue to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CFTC v.

The heart of the fraud was the Defendants' failure to tell pool participants of the Defendants' scheme to misappropriate the pool participants' funds ....\"). Accordingly, this court orders restitution in the full amount of customer losses from funds transferred by customers to the Defendants from February to June 2017 for the purchase and sale of virtual currencies and the trading services they did not receive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1229\">\n   254. It has not been shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the transfers made by Charles Mills to McDonnell between February 2015 to November 2016 were part of McDonnell's fraudulent scheme. The amount of restitution sought was accordingly reduced by $164,700.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-1230\">\n   255.
