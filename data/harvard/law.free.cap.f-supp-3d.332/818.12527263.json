The Recker Reports similarly discuss, among other things, \"[t]he causes of environmental impacts at, around and underneath\" the Central Chemical, North Little Rock, and Wallisville Road Sites and, for each of those sites, \"[t]he practices at the Site that resulted in the releases of chemicals and the migration of certain chemicals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex.

Olin does not object to the admission of these opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Rather, Olin objects only to the admission of opinions of Lamorak's experts concerning costs Olin incurred to address contamination at the Remaining Sites. Olin asserts three grounds for its motion to exclude these opinions. First, Olin asserts, Roux and Recker's opinions are irrelevant because the costs they categorized and opined on are not the same as the costs Olin seeks as damages in this case. Second, Olin asserts, the cost analyses are irrelevant because the categories applied by the experts have no legal significance to Olin's damages. Third, Olin asserts, Coulon, who is a professional engineer, is not qualified to offer an opinion as to whether the secondary sources of cost backup information that Olin's expert used to support Olin's damages claim are unreliable sources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The relevant \"task at hand\" with respect to Olin's costs is whether Olin is entitled to recover the costs it claims as damages if Lamorak is found liable for breaching its policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether Coulon Is Qualified To Opine on the Reliability of Accounting and Financial Information\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Olin argues that Chapter 16 of the Roux Report must be excluded because its author, Kelly Coulon, is not qualified as an expert to offer the cost opinions contained in that chapter. The main conclusion of Chapter 16 is that the \"secondary backup documentation\" supporting Olin's claimed damages-including accounts payable data, general ledger data, and other records,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Martin Motion to Strike Decl. Ex. E at 2-5-are \"not reliable evidence of the actual environmental response costs incurred\" at the sites at issue,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Roux Report at 145-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Coulon's primary training is not in cost accounting. She graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelor of Science in Biological Engineering.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Elaine Whiteman Klinger in Support of Lamorak Insurance Company's Response to Olin's Motion to Strike Portions of the Expert Reports and Testimony of Douglas J. Swanson, Sin Senh, Kelly Coulon, and Scott A. Recker (\"Klinger Motion to Strike Decl.\") Ex. A at 24:10-12, ECF No. 2246. She then earned a Master of Science in Environmental Engineering from Johns Hopkins University.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24:13-15. Her professional training is in the areas of \"environmental investigation, remediation and restoration of contaminated sites, and wastewater treatment.\" Roux Report at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Moreover, Coulon has never been qualified by a court to testify on account issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Martin Motion to Strike Decl. Ex. G at 30:21-24. She is not a certified public accountant or certified fraud examiner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:11-18. She is not certified in financial forensics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:22-30:15. She has never taken a class, or otherwise received formal training, in accounting, finance, or auditing, and she lacks any formal education in accounting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24:18-21, 25:1-15, 26:23-27:19. She has never prepared SEC filings and she has never been involved in any audit behind SEC filings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31:12-22. She has never had any role in a corporate accounting audit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31:23-32:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   However, in the course of her career as an engineer, Coulon has \"evaluated the nature and extent of contamination, timing of contamination, methods of releases of contamination and fate and transport; estimated costs to investigate and remediate sites across many industries; and evaluated the reasonableness of past and future environmental response costs.\" Roux Report at 3-4. In this context, a significant\n   portion of Coulon's day-to-day responsibilities include evaluating environmental investigation and remediation costs, and reviewing subcontractor invoices, engineering submittals and bids and cost-estimating.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Klinger Motion to Strike Decl. Ex. A at 25:1-28:24 (Coulon deposition). With regard to cost categorization, Coulon has been involved in similar matters where the same methodology used here has been used to analyze and evaluate environmental costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:7-20 and 40:11-42:20 (stating that she has reviewed reports made from SAP software in the context of reviewing past environmental response costs and that the methodology she used in this case was similar to the methodology she has used in prior litigation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Turning next to the opinion Coulon proffers, Coulon opines on the reliability of the sources that Olin's expert, Thomas Zetlmeisl, used to substantiate a spreadsheet tracking costs incurred by Olin (the so-called \"Lutz Report\"). Specifically, she challenges Zetlmeisl's conclusion that the Lutz Report is reliable and sufficient evidence of Olin's cost claim. She argues that (1) Zetlmeisl was unable to find invoice support for over 50% of the costs in the report and (2) the secondary sources he relied upon do not identify the scope of the services rendered or the relationship (if any) of the services to the environmental response action. Additionally, Coulon opines that the \"indemnity\" start dates used by Zetlmeisl are incorrect for certain sites because he did not make any determinations regarding the nature of the invoices. Roux Report at 144-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   It is difficult to discern from Coulon's report what expertise she even purports to rely on with respect to the challenged opinions. She simply asserts that the secondary sources of backup used by Zetlmeisl are not reliable evidence of past response costs because \"(1) the scope of services is not known and (2) the relationship of the services to the environmental response action is not known..... None of this information includes the actual invoices that comprise the alleged costs, or the specific scope of the services performed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 147.

Accordingly, the Court does not exclude Coulon's testimony for purposes of these motions for summary judgment but will hold, prior to trial, a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing regarding the admissibility of Coulon's cost opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether the Cost Opinions Are Unhelpful and Prejudicial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Olin asserts that Lamorak's Roux and Recker Reports are \"unhelpful\" because they are not directly responsive to the costs that Olin has claimed as damages. Instead of addressing only the costs that Olin actually is seeking to recover, the Roux Experts compiled their own cost information from discovery materials.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Martin Motion to Strike Decl. Ex. G (Coulon deposition) at 51:19-24 (\"Q: Are you aware that every invoice that was produced in this case is not necessarily the subject of Olin's claims for damages? A: I'm not aware which invoices are subject to Olin's claim and which ones are not.\"). As a result, Olin contends, there is a \"disconnect\" between what Olin seeks to recover and what the Roux Experts reviewed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   rendering the opinions confusing and misleading. For example, the Roux Report concludes that $11.2 million of the invoices produced in discovery should be categorized as duplicate costs (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , costs that are \"identical, yet appear separately with different Bates numbers,\" Roux Report at 9) and $7.5 million of the invoices produced in discovery are unrelated to environmental remediation. Roux Report at 1, 9. However, the Roux Report makes no effort to identify how many of those allegedly \"duplicate\" or \"unrelated\" costs Olin is actually seeking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Olin also objects that the Recker Report on the Central Chemical Site is overinclusive since it evaluates Olin's cost claim \"covering the period of 1984 through 2016,\" Martin Motion to Strike Decl. Ex. B at 13, yet the costs included in Olin's damages claim at Central Chemical begin in January of 2003.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. F, Ex. K.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Since Olin's primary objection to Lamorak's cost opinions is that they are overbroad, the Court declines to strike Lamorak's opinions at this stage in the proceeding. Lamorak asserts that its experts \"are prepared to explain and rebut whatever cost claim is ultimately put on trial by Olin.\" Lamorak Insurance Company's Response to Olin Corporation's Motion to Strike Portions of the Expert Reports and Testimony of Douglas J. Swanson, Sin Senh, Kelly Coulon, and Scott A. Recker (\"Lamorak Motion to Strike Mem.\") at 20, ECF No. 2245.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   While it is true that experts must disclose their opinions in discovery,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B), (D), Lamorak's experts\n   <em>\n    have\n   </em>\n   disclosed the relevant opinions (and more). Olin's motion to strike Lamorak's expert cost opinions as \"unhelpful\" is denied without prejudice to Olin's raising the issue again at trial if and when Lamorak seeks to introduce expert testimony on costs that Olin is not in fact claiming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Whether Lamorak's Categorization of Costs Is Relevant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, Olin argues that the categories into which the Roux Report classifies Olin's costs are irrelevant and therefore should be excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the Roux Experts categorized certain costs as related to \"Onsite Activities-not Groundwater-Related Response Actions,\" and other costs as related to \"Offsite Activities and/or Groundwater-Related Response Actions.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Roux Report at 1 &amp; App'x D. Likewise, Recker categorized \"the vast majority of costs\" at the North Little Rock site as \"onsite soil and sediment\" work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. C at 13-14. According to Olin, the experts placed costs into the onsite and offsite categories based primarily on the location of where the\n   remediation occurred, such that excavation or capping of soils on Olin's property was deemed \"onsite,\" even though these types of onsite remediation were undertaken to prevent offsite property damage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Roux Report at 8. According to Olin, this simplistic onsite/offsite distinction is not relevant where a cleanup was done to protect the public and to address or prevent offsite impacts at least in part, as all the on-site cleanups at issue here were.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   However, Lamorak disagrees with Olin's view of the law. Lamorak has taken the position that costs arising out of remediation of on-site property damage are not covered by its policies. As the Court has previously explained,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opinion and Order dated April 17, 2018, ECF No. 2176, the testimony of a party's expert must be evaluated within the context of that party's own theory of the case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Pfizer Sec.

Therefore, the Court finds that these categorizations are not irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the Roux Report assigns costs to categories such as \"Legal,\" \"Regulatory,\" \"Employee Expenses,\" \"Unspecified,\" and \"Unrelated.\" The \"legal\" category includes \"costs to support or perform legal work regarding [the] environmental response action[s]\" taken by Olin. Roux Report at 8-10. The \"regulatory\" category includes \"costs for the oversight regulatory agency ... response costs to oversee and/or implement environmental response actions at the Sites.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. The Employee Expenses category includes \"Olin employee expenses incurred to further the environmental response action[s]\" taken by Olin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The \"unspecified\" category includes costs for which \"[i]nsufficient information\" was provided to enable \"any further categorization.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And \"unrelated\" includes invoiced costs that the Roux Experts considered to be unrelated to the contamination environmental response actions taken by Olin at the Remaining Sites.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Olin argues that these categories are irrelevant because Lamorak's policies do not exclude coverage for these categories of costs. Rather, in Olin's view, these are costs are recoverable as \"sums which [Olin] shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability[;] (a) imposed upon the Insured by law, or (b) assumed under contract or agreement by [Olin] for damages, direct or consequential and expenses on account of ... Property Damage.\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Martin Motion to Strike Decl. at Ex. N \u00a7 I; Ex. 0 \u00a7 I; Ex. P \u00a7 I. Lamorak does not vigorously defend the relevance these categories. Nevertheless, since Olin has not adequately proven their irrelevance,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court finds that these categories are relevant to Lamorak's theory of the case and denies Olin's motion to exclude them, without prejudice to Olin's renewing the motion at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , the Roux Report uses the categories \"Unspecified,\" \"Unrelated,\" and \"Duplicate.\" Roux Report at 9-10. Olin argues that these categories are \"meaningless\" because the report has failed to identify what portion of the costs placed in these categories are actually part of Olin's damages claim. Plaintiff Olin Corporation's Motion To Strike Portions of the Expert Reports and Testimony of Douglas J. Swanson, Sin Senh, Kelly Coulon, and Scott A. Recker at 14, ECF No. 2223. A cost is only truly a \"duplicate\" if Olin is actually seeking to recover both the costs. Similarly, Olin argues it makes no difference\n   if an invoice is \"unspecified\" or \"unrelated\" if Olin is not seeking to recover for that invoice. Olin contends that it would be confusing and/or misleading to the jury to present them with a sorting of Olin's expenses that is irrelevant to Lamorak's coverage obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   However, experience suggests that testimony that may appear overbroad at this stage may prove to be relevant at the time it is offered at trial. Accordingly, the Court will not exclude the testimony now but will reconsider the matter if and when it is offered at trial, after the Court has had the benefit of hearing testimony on Olin's costs and Lamorak has had the opportunity to tailor its own expert testimony in response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In sum, for the foregoing reasons, the Court denies Olin's motion to strike Lamorak's cost opinions for purposes of these motions for summary judgment, without prejudice to Olin's renewing these motions at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Lamorak's Motion To Strike Olin's 56.1 Statement\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Lamorak for its part moves to strike those portions of Olin's 56.1 statement that: (1) rely on expert opinions; (2) are conclusory; or (3) are argumentative.

The citations given in support of this paragraph are the expert reports of William Hall and Neal Brody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Lamorak's conclusion that this statement is unsupported by admissible evidence does not follow, however, since Lamorak has not contended, let alone established, that any of the underlying evidence on which these experts rely is inadmissible.

Property Damage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Neither Olin nor Lamorak disputes that it is the law of the case that \"property damage occurs as long as contamination continues to increase or spread, whether or not the contamination is based on active pollution or the passive migration of contamination into the soil and groundwater.\"\n   <em>\n    Olin Corp. v.

The Court separately addressed the question of whether the particular damage that triggered the insured's liability was covered by the insurer's policy. The nature of the damage was not seriously in dispute and the court easily determined that the policy covered liability for that type of damage by looking at the language of the policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531142\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/780/1082/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531142\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/780/1082/\">\n    at 1092-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Nevertheless, the extension of\n   <em>\n    Luria\n   </em>\n   's reasoning to find that a settlement reasonably entered into suffices to establish not only the fact of liability but also the fact of a particular type of damage triggering that liability is not plainly erroneous.

Accordingly, Lamorak cannot be collaterally estopped from relying on materials showing general industry knowledge or Olin's membership in a trade organization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Lamorak could, however, be collaterally estopped from arguing that the same evidence establishes that Olin expected or intended the damage if the waste disposal practices at any of the Remaining Sites were \"identical\" to the waste disposal practices at the previously litigated sites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Lamorak does here rely on some of the same evidence it relied on during the Five Sites trial. In that trial, Lamorak disclosed the report of Robert Karls, who opined that Olin expected and intended the damage it remediated at those sites. Lamorak Counter Remaining Sites 56.1 at \u00b6 418. He based his opinion, in part, on industry knowledge about pollution and waste disposal, Olin's membership in chemical industry trade groups such as MCA, and proceedings at the Purdue Industrial Waste Conference related to waste disposal and water damage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 419, 421. He also testified at trial that the knowledge Olin gained through participation and membership in the MCA and attendance at the Purdue Industrial Waste Conference showed that Olin expected and intended the damage it remediated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 420-21. Sections of the Recker's reports on North Little Rock and Wallisville-but not the Roux Report-are substantially similar to the Karls Report disclosed as part of the Five Sites litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lamorak Counter 56.1 at \u00b6\u00b6 327-28, 407-08. In drafting his report, Recker confirmed that, where included, these sections were relevant to the sites at issue here.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Declaration of Ralph J. Luongo in Response to Olin Corporation's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts and in Support of Lamorak Insurance Company's Response to Olin Corporation's Motion for Summary Judgment on the Remaining Sites and Lamorak's Counterstatement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Luongo Remaining\n   Sites Opp. Decl.\") Ex.

Recker's report also includes sections addressing the specific facts relevant to the North Little Rock Site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   However, Olin does not claim that its waste practices at the sites on which Recker opines were similar to the waste practices at the Five Sites. Olin only contends that the practices at Charleston, North Little Rock, and Wallisville Road Sites are materially indistinguishable from the practices at previously litigated sites. Specifically, Olin asserts that Charleston is materially indistinguishable from Augusta and that North Little Rock and Wallisville Road are materially indistinguishable from Aberdeen. Olin Remaining Sites Mem. at 18. As to North Little Rock and Wallisville, Lamorak was not a participant in the Aberdeen Sites trial and so cannot be collaterally estopped from litigating disputes resolved in that proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lamorak Counter Remaining Sites 56.1 at \u00b6 446. As for Charleston, Olin cannot establish that its waste disposal practices there were \"identical\" to those at Augusta simply because at both sites mercury-contaminated wastes from plant operations were disposed of in landfills and/or a retention pond.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 144, 146, 426, 429. In addition, the Roux Report on the Charleston Site relies on different evidence than the Karls Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Whether Lamorak's Evidence Implies Subjective Knowledge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Olin argues that even if Lamorak is not collaterally estopped from relying on this evidence, the evidence Lamorak proffers cannot establish that Olin subjectively knew and intended that its actions would cause the specific, latent property damage that required remediation. The general publications identified by the experts do not discuss specific property damage resulting from specific waste handling practices at any Olin site. They also do not purport to identify Olin's subjective understanding about its operations. Rather, these publications indicate that \"instances of environmental pollution were gaining national attention as they were increasingly reported to the general public in newspapers, magazines, and other general periodicals.\" Martin Remaining Sites Decl. Ex. 13 at 120 [hereinafter Roux Report]. \"By 1950, the technical aspects of surface water and groundwater pollution had been extensively studied.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"By 1960, the technical aspects of landfills and liquid waste disposal ponds/lagoons had also been extensive studied.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Although these publications may not concern the fine details of the waste handling practices at Olin's various sites, a reasonable juror could find that their discussions of waste handling and pollution in general are applicable to Olin's practices. In addition, while these secondary sources do not directly establish Olin's subjective knowledge, a reasonable juror could infer from them that Olin had such subjective knowledge. Moreover, Lamorak does identify some evidence speaking more directly to Olin's subjective awareness: Olin's participation in MCA activities regarding pollution: \"Olin executives frequently participated in MCA meetings where pollution was discussed. Specifically, review of MCA meeting minutes reveals that approximately 30 Olin executives participated in over 140 MCA meetings from the 1950s and 1960s where the subject of either water pollution, lagoons, ponds, landfills, dumps, and/or waste burial were discussed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 121. In addition, \"Olin maintained an Industrial Environmental Control Department in the late 1950s that would perform analytical testing of its wastewaters and effluent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Olin also argues that Lamorak's site-specific evidence at best shows that Olin knowingly disposed of waste, not that Olin knew in 1970 that it was causing the resulting damage. That is not enough, Olin contends, to establish that it expected or intended the damage. Olin Remaining Sites Mem. at 15-16. For example, the evidence includes \"only a handful\" of documents from 1970 or earlier.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Such evidence includes a 1968 letter from Olin stating that there \"may be a pollution and/or drainage problem\" at the Assonet Site and that \"[l]eachate emanating from the toe of the landfill was ... visibly obvious\" at the Morgantown site. Lamorak Counter Remaining Sites 56.1 at \u00b6\u00b6 61, 63, 247. However, when considered in connection with the secondary just sources described, this site-specific evidence could lead a reasonable juror to conclude that Olin expected or intended the damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Lamorak's policies cover all sums Olin shall be obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed upon it by law or assumed under contract or agreement by Olin for damages and expenses on account of property damage caused by or arising out of an occurrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Where no complaint, pleading, or adversarial action has been taken against the insured, courts interpreting New York law have found that there is not even a duty to defend insureds against these claims, let alone a duty to indemnify. For example, the New York Appellate Division has found that mere letters from the EPA were not the equivalent of the commencement of a formal proceeding within the meaning of the subject comprehensive general liability policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Technicon Elecs.

Olin responds that the report is admissible as a business record given that it is \"a spreadsheet that Olin maintains regularly in the course of its business and that Olin has used since 1986 to track remediation costs at environmental sites.\" Olin Remaining Sites Mem. at 22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Martin Remaining Sites Decl.

Olin asserts that the genesis and use of the Lutz report-to compile costs, regardless of whether they are potentially covered by insurance or recoverable in litigation, and serve as the base for Olin's audited SEC statements related to remediation costs-further indicates its reliability.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

Although Olin has not offered an affidavit from such a witness or explained to the Court who would serve as a custodial witness, neither has Lamorak demonstrated that Olin will not be able to produce such a qualified custodial witness, which would seem likely, at trial. Given the indication that the Lutz Report is a business record, and in order to more forward expeditiously for present purposes, the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, will treat the Lutz Report as admissible for the limited purpose of ruling on these summary judgment motions, without prejudice to Lamorak's moving to exclude the Report at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , and finally, Lamorak argues that the report by Olin's cost expert, Tom\n   Zetlmeisl, is inadmissible.

Zetlmeisl opined that the Lutz Report \"provides a reliable indication of the cost incurred by Olin at each of The Sites.\" Lamorak Counter Remaining Sites 56.1 at \u00b6 30(c). Zetlmeisl also used other evidence to corroborate the Lutz Report, including Olin's tracking of environmental costs through project codes dedicated to each site, Olin's audited financial statements and SEC filings, invoices, accounts payable data, general ledger detail, Olin memos and other documentation, as well as depositions and prior reports related to other sites in this proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30(d).

Even though, in Olin's view, it was not obligated to obtain Lamorak's approval for each remediation expense once Lamorak made clear that it had no intention of paying Olin's claims, Olin provided notices that \"detailed Olin's damages at each site and described Olin's remediation measures.

That is, in Olin's view, Lamorak has had years to work collaboratively with Olin to manage these remediation projects. Olin complains that Lamorak \"cannot now benefit from its tactical decision to deny its contractual obligation to indemnify Olin for covered losses by avoiding liability\" based on its newfound gripes about those costs. Olin, however, cites no case law in support of this forfeiture argument.

First, Olin has never been ordered or directed to perform investigation or remediation, and has never received an inquiry letter, or indeed any communication from a federal, state or local agency, in connection with Assonet.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Luongo Remaining Sites Decl. Ex. B (Hall deposition) at 458:15-19. Second, Olin's expert, Hall, testified that the Massachusetts DEP issued an order to Polaroid and then Olin \"was pulled into this as equivalent to a PRP.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 426:8-11. He further explained that \"Olin is drawn into the cost and the actions that occur here due to the claims that Polaroid could have against them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 426:18-427:3.

Lamorak's expert described Olin's settlement with Polaroid as \"voluntary\" because \"Olin entered this agreement without any regulatory enforcement, to [his] knowledge.\" Luongo Remaining Sites Decl. Ex. WW at 143:13-20 (Senh deposition). The Court is doubtful that a reasonable juror would place as much weight as Lamorak does on Hall's statement that Olin's decision to settle was a \"business decision.\" Therefore, Lamorak is not entitled to summary judgment on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   <em>\n    Property Damage\n   </em>\n   . Lamorak alternatively argues that it is entitled to partial summary judgment because a portion of Olin's costs at the Assonet Site was limited to Olin's property and therefore not covered by Lamorak's policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   As part of the above-mentioned investigation of contamination at the Assonet Site, soil contamination from the buried drums near the PVC Site was determined to be limited to the site property boundaries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   A December 7, 1999 letter from\n   GEI Consultants, Inc. (\"GEI\") to the Massachusetts DEP reported that \"the Site boundary encompasses the horizontal event of contamination.\" Luongo Remaining Sites Decl. Ex. UU at 2018OLINFACSITES_00005083. GEI also concluded that \"groundwater contamination at the Site is limited vertically to the groundwater present in the silty sand unit and the top 10 feet of the till unit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In December 1999, it was determined that \"a condition of No Significant Risk of harm to safety exists\" at the PVC Disposal Area.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2018OLINFACSITES_00005071, 5095.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   There is some record evidence that this remediation was undertaken to prevent damage to third parties, but it is relatively weak. Olin argues that removing soil to protect the groundwater was \"consistent\" with the state's position that remediation at Assonet was needed \"to prevent harm to health, safety, public welfare and the environment from ... release and/or threat of release\" of contaminants. Martin Remaining Sites Opp. Decl. Ex. 68 (Notice of Responsibility dated November 14, 1997 sent by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection to Polaroid regarding the Assonet Site). This generic statement of concern for the \"public welfare\" and the \"environment\" is not strong evidence that the state required the site to be cleaned up in order to prevent damage to third-party property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Olin also contends that there was concern about groundwater contamination. For example, Olin's expert concluded that contaminants of concern at the site \"initially contaminated the soil on-Site and were transported via groundwater and surface water to sediments of the Taunton River.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hall Report at Assonet 8. On the other hand, Lamorak's experts agreed that monitoring wells were installed and that existing wells in the PVC dump area were sampled, but concluded that these wells do not indicate that the remedial work done at the time was undertaken to prevent third-party property damage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Roux Report at 85-86;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Martin Remaining Sites Decl.

Accordingly, it denies summary judgment on this site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   <em>\n    Expect or Intend Damage\n   </em>\n   . There is a genuine dispute as to whether Olin expected or intended the damage. Olin's experts concluded that Olin did not expect or intend the damage in part because \"none of Olin's practices [at Assonet] regarding the handling and disposal of waste materials were in violation of state and federal regulations existing during its time of operation.\" Brody Report at Assonet 9. In addition, \"[b]efore 1971, almost no information was known about contaminant migration from waste burial or leaks and connected impacts to the environment.\" Goodfellow Report at 24. With respect to Assonet in\n   particular, former employees have described Olin's housekeeping practices at the plant as \"good,\" \"very good,\" and \"excellent.\" Martin Remaining Sites Decl.

As with other sites that the Roux Report addresses (Morgantown, Pine Swamp, New Haven, and Charleston), the report's opinion is based on \"Historical Environmental Awareness of the General Public\" going back to the mid-nineteenth century, state and local environmental regulation dating back to 1899, creation of EPA in December 1970, and \"Historical Environmental Awareness of the Scientific and Engineering Community.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 121-32.

Nor must this judge trudge the dry desert of the record of this case, searching for some rumored water hole. Accordingly, the Court grants summary judgment for Olin on all of Lamorak's affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   In sum, the Court grants summary judgment for Lamorak on the Olin Water Services Site; the Court grants summary judgment for Olin with respect to the Bethany, Brazier Forest, Central Chemical, Crab Orchard, Frontier-Chemical, New Haven, and Niagara County Refuse Sites, except as concerns Olin's damages at those sites; and the Court denies summary judgment as to the Assonet, Charleston, Middletown, Morgantown, North Little Rock, Pine Swamp, and Wallisville sites, except that it grants summary judgment for Olin with respect to Lamorak's affirmative defenses at these sites. These rulings apply both to Olin's breach of contract claims for past damages and its declaratory judgment claims for future damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Motions for Summary Judgment of Lamorak, London Continental Casualty, Munich Reinsurance, and General Reinsurance on Lamorak's Third-Party Claims\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   Lamorak moves for summary judgment on its third-party claims; Olin, London, General Reinsurance, and Continental Casualty and Munich Reinsurance oppose. Olin moves for partial summary judgment on all of Lamorak's third-party claims except for those concerning Bethany; Lamorak opposes. General Reinsurance moves for summary judgment on Lamorak's third-party claims and Lamorak opposes. Finally, Continental Casualty and Munich Reinsurance jointly move for summary judgment on Lamorak's third-party claims and Lamorak opposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   After very full consideration, the Court concludes that, as a matter of law and contrary to the Court's earlier ruling, Lamorak\n   cannot seek contribution from London, General Reinsurance, Continental Casualty, and Munich Reinsurance for any claims those co-insurers have settled with Olin. The Court also finds that Lamorak is not entitled to indemnification from the settling insurers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   These two determinations largely resolve the motions for summary judgment on Lamorak's third-party claims in favor of the settling insurers and Olin. The exception is Lamorak's claim for contribution from General Reinsurance and Continental Casualty on the Bethany Site, which was not the subject of those insurers' settlements with Olin. With respect to that claim, the Court finds that there is no genuine dispute that Lamorak is not entitled to contribution on that site because it is virtually impossible for the attachment point of General Reinsurance and Continental Casualty's policies to be reached for that site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Lamorak's Claims for Contribution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether Lamorak Is Entitled To Contribution From Co-Insurers Who Have Settled Olin's Claims Against Them\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   The threshold question underlying all the motions for summary judgment regarding Lamorak's contribution claims is whether, as a matter of law, Lamorak can seek contribution from co-insurers that have settled their claims with Olin. In granting Lamorak leave to file its third-party complaint, the Court held that Lamorak was not barred, as a matter of law, from seeking contribution from co-insurers that settled. General Reinsurance, Continental Casualty, Munich Reinsurance, who did not previously have an opportunity to submit their views on Lamorak's motion for leave to file a third-party complaint, and Olin now move the Court to reconsider that ruling. The Court accordingly here reassesses its conclusion that Lamorak could seek contribution from its settled co-insurers with the benefit both of this new briefing by Lamorak's co-insurers and the implications of the Court's subsequent decision that the Prior Insurance Provision of Lamorak's policies allows it to set off its liability by amounts already paid by settled insurers. Upon such reconsideration, the Court reverses its previous ruling, and holds that Lamorak is not legally entitled to seek contribution from settled insurers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    In re Viking Pump, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777435\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/27/244/\">\n    27 N.Y.3d 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777435\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/27/244/\">\n    33 N.Y.S.3d 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777435\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/27/244/\">\n    52 N.E.3d 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1151-53 (2016), the New York Court of Appeals held that insurance policies that contain the \"Condition C\" language in Lamorak and the Co-Insurers' policies are subject to an \"all sums\" allocation.

ECF No. 2176. In that opinion, the Court concluded that the Second Circuit had clearly directed it to set off Lamorak's liability by the amounts actually paid in settlement by Lamorak's co-insurers (a so-called\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tanto\n   </em>\n   set-off) rather than by those settled insurers'\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    rata\n   </em>\n   shares of the liability.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Olin IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275665\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/130/\">\n    864 F.3d at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"if, as Olin suggests, Olin entered into a global settlement with the London Market Insurers releasing claims under those policies as to all sites potentially at issue-and not just those that were the subject of adjudication at trial in this matter-there is no easy way to determine the amount of this settlement that is properly associated with claims arising from the five manufacturing sites that are the focus of this appeal,\" and remanding to this Court to allow discovery on and resolve this question).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   At the same time, the Court recognized that applying a\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    rata\n   </em>\n   set-off rather than a\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tanto\n   </em>\n   set-off had some comparative advantages. A\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    rata\n   </em>\n   approach ensures that the insured does not double recover, while avoiding the possibility that an insured\n   might settle for a small amount with a preferred insurer, knowing that the other insurer(s) will be required to pay the remaining amount.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 2176 at 25 n.11. As previously noted, the inequity that can result from the\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tanto\n   </em>\n   approach, even in the absence of collusion, is stark in this case: Since Olin entered into global settlements with its other insurers, it was impossible for Lamorak to prove, as required by the Second Circuit, exactly how much of those settlements was properly allocated to the sites on which Olin was seeking indemnity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   Accordingly, were it writing on a blank slate, the Court might have interpreted the Prior Insurance Provision to require a\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    rata\n   </em>\n   set-off to account for settlements, which it believes is the more equitable approach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the same time, the Court felt that the potential for inequity inherent in the\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tanto\n   </em>\n   approach, and the inequity in fact present in this case, would be ameliorated by Lamorak's ability to seek contribution from the settling insurers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   However, the Court has now reached the conclusion that permitting Lamorak to both apply a\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tanto\n   </em>\n   set-off and seek contribution is the least sensible approach of all possible approaches. That is, applying a\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tanto\n   </em>\n   set-off and permitting contribution claims is worse than both (1) applying a\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tanto\n   </em>\n   set-off and not\n   permitting contribution claims and (2) applying a\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    rata\n   </em>\n   set-off.

Therefore, an indemnity claim requires that Lamorak was not responsible in its own right but instead merely vicariously liable to virtue of its relationships with the co-insurers. That is not the case here. As the Second Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    Olin IV\n   </em>\n   , Lamorak agreed in its policies to insure Olin on an all sums basis.

There, the insured was covered by a single insurer, Lumbermen's, when an accident occurred in June, but a month later the insured got coverage from Cosmopolitan, which was made retroactive to the previous month. The Cosmopolitan policy contained a co-insurance clause limiting Cosmopolitan's liability to its proportional share. The insured then \"canceled flat\" its policy with Lumbermen's, meaning that the binder was canceled from its inception without any premiums being collected-including with respect to the June accident, for which Cosmopolitan was now liable. The New York Court of Appeals held that Lumbermen's could not cancel flat its policy because it affected the rights of a third-party and, accordingly, that Lumbermen's was jointly liable for the June accident. This case has no bearing on whether or not Lamorak can seek contribution from co-insurers who legitimately settled their claims with Olin. As for the other cases cited in Lamorak's brief, they only speak to whether particular policy provisions (rather than settlement) preclude claims for equitable contribution.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     United States Fire Ins.
