HAIGHT, JR., Senior United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Stanley Works Israel Ltd., f/k/a ZAG Industries, Ltd. (\"Plaintiff\"), an Israeli limited liability company, brings this diversity action against Defendants 500 Group, Inc., a New York corporation, and Paolo Tiramani, a citizen of Nevada (collectively, \"Defendants\"). Plaintiff and Defendant 500 Group were parties to certain product license agreements that related generally to patent rights owned by 500 Group. Plaintiff's claims against Defendants arise from a dispute over monies paid pursuant to a settlement agreement between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants now move pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to dismiss the Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, Doc. 26. Plaintiff has resisted the motion, Doc. 29, and Defendants have filed a reply brief, Doc. 32. This Ruling resolves Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are derived from Plaintiff's Amended Complaint, and are assumed true for the purposes of this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff and Defendant 500 Group were parties to certain product license agreements and a letter agreement (collectively, the \"License Agreements\"), which related\n   generally to patent rights owned by 500 Group. Amended Complaint, Doc. 24 \u00b6 7. The License Agreements were silent on the tax treatment of royalty payments made under their terms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. However, under Israeli law, Plaintiff was required to withhold certain percentages of such royalty payments to 500 Group, and to then remit that amount to the Israeli tax authority to satisfy 500 Group's tax obligations in Israel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, during the term of the License Agreements, with 500 Group's consent and agreement, Plaintiff withheld the appropriate amounts from 500 Group's royalty payments, and remitted the tax to the Israeli tax authority.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Disputes between the parties relating to the License Agreements arose; these disputes resulted in a demand for arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. The disputes were then negotiated and the parties ultimately reached a settlement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Plaintiff and 500 Group entered into a Settlement Agreement on March 31, 2017, which provided, among other things, that Plaintiff would pay a sum of ten million dollars to Defendant 500 Group.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. The parties agreed that of this total, six million dollars constituted payment for Plaintiff's purchase of 500 Group's patent rights; the remaining four million dollars constituted royalty payments to 500 Group.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff was required to withhold a portion of total amount payable under the Settlement Agreement for tax purposes, and then remit the tax to the Israeli tax authority on behalf of 500 Group.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. In this situation, pursuant to Israeli law, Plaintiff was required to withhold $2,500,000, or 25% of the total payment amount, unless the parties obtained prior approval from the Israeli tax authority for a different withholding arrangement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. 500 Group would then be responsible to seek a refund of any portion of the withheld amount that was not taxable directly from the Israeli tax authority.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties decided to delay the payment of the amount due under the Settlement Agreement so that they could obtain pre-approval from the tax authority for \"structuring a reduced amount of withholding, in view of the agreed-upon structure of the Settlement Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. This agreement was made in mutually-signed electronic writings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The parties believed that under Israeli law, the six million dollar patent rights payment should not be taxed, and the four million dollar royalty payment should be taxed at the prior royalty rate of 15%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, if pre-approval was obtained, 500 Group's total tax burden would be $600,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to the signed electronic agreements between the parties, that amount would be withheld by Plaintiff and remitted to the Israeli tax authority.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   500 Group hired Ernst &amp; Young to act on its behalf to assist in obtaining the aforementioned pre-approval.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. Defendant Tiramani and other agents of 500 Group confirmed the parties' agreement relating to the tax withholdings multiple times in writing, including in emails signed by Tiramani and other agents of 500 Group.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Tiramani was personally involved in efforts to further the parties' tax withholdings agreement, and agreed that the parties should continue to seek approval for the withholdings under the current Settlement Agreement, rather than re-execute the Agreement to explicitly split the payments into two categories.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Pre-approval was ultimately obtained by Ernst &amp; Young, acting on behalf of 500 Group for the parties' proposal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. 500 Group agreed that Plaintiff was to retain $600,000 from the payment total under the Settlement Agreement. The parties' agreement to seek preapproval and\n   proceed with withholding 15% of the royalty payment was \"acted on to completion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   500 Group's agreements, representations and conduct regarding the tax withholding issue induced Plaintiff's reliance, in that Plaintiff aided 500 Group to obtain the preapproval, and Plaintiff performed its obligation under the agreement by remitting $600,000 to the Israeli tax authority in satisfaction of 500 Group's tax obligations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under the Settlement Agreement, 500 Group was to provide Plaintiff with instructions for wiring the payment from Plaintiff to 500 Group called for by the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. 500 Group instructed Plaintiff to wire the payment to its account at Patriot Bank in Stamford, Connecticut.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. The settlement funds were wired to this bank account on June 1, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. However, Plaintiff mistakenly failed to deduct $600,000 from the total as the agreed-upon tax withholdings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, Plaintiff overpaid 500 Group by $600,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 5, 2017, Plaintiff's bank requested that the funds which were erroneously transmitted be recalled; this request was denied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. On or about June 7, 2017, Plaintiff explained to 500 Group that it had mistakenly overpaid, and asked 500 Group to return the $600,000 overpayment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. 500 Group \"failed to diligently respond\" to Plaintiff's request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. Plaintiff then made multiple follow-up requests to 500 Group for it to return the money.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. Although Tiramani initially indicated by email that he intended to return the funds and asked about the logistics of such a transfer, all of Plaintiff's follow-up communications and requests were either ignored or refused, without any legal explanation by Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff was still liable on behalf of 500 Group to the Israeli tax authority for the full amount of the pre-approved withholdings under the Settlement Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. Accordingly, Plaintiff paid $600,000 to the tax authority on or about August 15, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants continue to refuse to return Plaintiff's $600,000, despite continued and repeated requests and demands.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

It states that it applies to the Agreement and the mutual release; not to all claims arising thereof. The Court follows these courts in deciding that the choice of law provision here is too narrow to encompass the CUTPA or civil theft claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thus, the Court turns to the 'most significant relationship' test. According to the allegations in the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff is an Israeli entity, with its principal place of business in Israel. It is owned by a Dutch company, which, in turn, is owned by a Canadian corporation. Defendant 500 Group is a New York corporation with its principal place of business in Nevada. It maintains a regular place of business in Connecticut. Defendant Tiramani is a citizen of Nevada. Tiramani previously resided in Connecticut and maintains a place of business in Connecticut. It is unclear from the record before the Court where the relationship between the parties is centered; there are no allegations as to where the contract was signed.

The Court stated, \"[t]he Agreement is silent on the 'net vs. inclusive' issue; at most, it is ambiguous on this issue.

The Second Circuit held that the District Court erred in concluding that the agreement unambiguously provided that the fund was net of payroll taxes; and because the plaintiffs did not present any extrinsic evidence relevant to \"resolving such ambiguity,\" and only \"chose to argue that the Agreement unambiguously provides that the Settlement Fund is net of payroll taxes,\" the district court could not \"be faulted for failing to resolve this ambiguity in [plaintiffs'] favor by considering extrinsic evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11159639\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/174/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    White Rose\n   </em>\n   appears to speak to the issue we encounter in this case: a Settlement Agreement that says nothing at all about the tax treatment of the settlement sum. The present Settlement Agreement provides that Plaintiff \"agrees to pay the sum of Ten Million U.S. Dollars ... to 500 Group within fourteen (14) business days,\" six million of which constitutes payment for Plaintiff's purchase of all patents, and four million of which constitutes a fixed-fee payment for future royalties. Doc. 24-1 at 3. The Agreement further states that payment of the sum of one million dollars should be wired to one account, and payment of the sum of nine million dollars should be wired to another. There is no mention of deductions or withholdings from those amounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    White Rose\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit found that silence on this similar issue could be characterized as an ambiguity in the contract; reading the contract to state otherwise, without more, was reversible error. To be sure, there are several differences between\n   <em>\n    White Rose\n   </em>\n   and the present case which can ultimately serve to distinguish that case from the circumstances here. Importantly, however, one must remember that the present case is in its initial stages. On a motion to dismiss, the Court is not only required to accept Plaintiff's allegations as true, but also to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiff. Guided by those principles, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that the Agreement's silence on the tax issue is an ambiguity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The cases that Defendants cite do not lead me to a different conclusion. In support of the proposition that a court will not modify a settlement agreement to account for taxes, Defendants refer the Court to a series of cases that involve the confirmation of arbitration awards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 32 at 4, 4 n.1.

Plaintiff alleges that in mutually-signed electronic writings, the parties agreed: (1) to delay payment of the amount due under the Settlement Agreement so that the parties could obtain pre-approval from the Israeli government for structuring a reduced amount of withholding; (2) that the four million dollar payment for royalties should be taxed at a rate of 15%; (3) that the six million dollar payment for patent rights should not be taxed; (4) that if the pre-approval was obtained, the total tax burden of $600,000 would be withheld by Plaintiff and remitted to the Israeli tax authority; (5) to continue to seek preapproval for the tax withholdings under the Settlement Agreement as originally executed, rather than re-execute the Agreement to account for separate payments; and (6) that Defendant Tiramani would return the $600,000 overpayment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Accepting the above allegations as true for the purposes of this motion, they are sufficient to assert a claim of breach of contract based on a modification of the original Settlement Agreement. Plaintiff has alleged the existence of a written agreement that the sum in question would be withheld from the amount due under the Settlement Agreement, and that the parties did not contemplate the execution of an additional formal agreement. Plaintiff has further alleged that following the mistaken overpayment, the parties agreed that Defendants would return the money. These agreements were memorialized in written form, signed by the parties. Under prevailing New York law, together with the remaining allegations concerning performance, breach, and damages, Plaintiff's allegations regarding the formation of the agreement are sufficient to support a claim for breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendants' arguments on this point are unavailing. Defendants contend that the allegations in the Amended Complaint fall short of alleging a modification of the Settlement Agreement, because,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff \"fail[s] to identify a single mutually-signed writing containing\" the terms of the modification. Doc. 32 at 5. I do not agree. The allegations in the Amended Complaint clearly state that the \"parties' agreement relating to the tax withholdings\" was \"confirmed ... multiple times in writing, such as in emails signed by Tiramani and other agents of 500 Group.\" Doc. 24 \u00b6 18. Further, \"[i]n a signed electronic writing on behalf of 500 Group, Tiramani agreed\" to not re-execute the Settlement Agreement and instead \"seek preapproval for the tax withholdings under the Settlement Agreement as originally executed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. \"[I]f pre-approval was obtained,\n   500 Group's total tax burden would be $600,000, which, according to signed electronic agreements between the parties, would be withheld by Stanley Israel and remitted to the Israeli tax authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Once pre-approval for withholding 15% of the royalty payment under the Settlement Agreement was obtained from the Israeli tax authority, \"500 Group agreed that Stanley Israel was to retain $600,000 from the payment total under the Settlement Agreement to fulfill 500 Group's tax obligations and its pre-approval arrangements with the Israeli tax authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that the parties agreed for Defendants to refund the sum erroneously transferred to Defendants. The Amended Complaint states that after Plaintiff mistakenly wired the overpayment of $600,000 to 500 Group, Defendant Tiramani \"indicated, in a signed electronic writing, an intention to return the $600,000 and inquired regarding the logistics of the return.... Stanley Works answered Tiramani's logistical inquiry\n   <em>\n    and reached agreement\n   </em>\n   on how the money should be returned....\" Doc. 30 \u00b6 30 (emphasis added). These allegations, taken together, clearly state the existence of signed writings, and set forth the terms of the modifications. At the pleading stage, such allegations are sufficient to survive dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendants also argue that a valid modification would have to identify the consideration for the modification. However, \"[w]hile consideration is required for a contract to be valid, modifications to a contract need not be supported by additional consideration when the modification is in writing and signed by the party against whom it is sought to be enforced.\"\n   <em>\n    LaRoss Partners, LLC v.

Plaintiff argues that Defendant 500 Group's actions in hiring a third party to assist it in obtaining preapproval for a specific withholding amount demonstrate the existence of such an agreement, and the parties' performance in seeking preapproval for 15% of the four million dollar sum is referable to the claimed modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendant contends that these allegations do not support performance of an agreement for Plaintiff to pay less than the ten million dollar sum under the Settlement Agreement.

The Court in\n   <em>\n    Rose\n   </em>\n   explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Parties to a written agreement who include a proscription against oral modification are protected by subdivision 1 of section 15-301 of the General Obligations Law. Any contract containing such a clause \"cannot be changed by an executory agreement unless such executory agreement is in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement ... is sought.\" Put otherwise, if the only proof of an alleged agreement to deviate from a written contract is the oral exchanges between the parties, the writing controls. Thus, the authenticity of any amendment is ensured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   On the other hand, when the oral agreement to modify has in fact been acted upon to completion, the same need to protect the integrity of the written agreement from false claims of modification does not arise. In such case, not only may past oral discussions be relied upon to test the alleged modification, but the actions taken may demonstrate, objectively, the nature and extent of the modification. Moreover, apart from statute, a contract once made can be unmade, and a contractual prohibition against oral modification may itself be waived. Thus, section 15-301 nullifies only \"executory\" oral modification. Once executed, the oral modification may be proved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Where there is partial performance of the oral modification sought to be enforced, the likelihood that false claims would go undetected is similarly diminished. Here, too, the court may consider not only past oral exchanges, but also the conduct of the parties.
