MCFADDEN, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Last year, two of the world's largest titanium dioxide (\"TiO2\") producers announced their intent to merge. Tronox Limited agreed to acquire the National Titanium Dioxide Company's TiO2 business, known as \"Cristal,\" for $1.67 billion in cash and a 24% equity stake in the combined firm. Believing that the acquisition would likely violate federal antitrust laws, the Federal Trade Commission issued an administrative complaint challenging the deal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   TiO2 is a pigment used to add whiteness, brightness, and opacity to products like paints, plastics, and paper. It is manufactured by subjecting raw titanium ores to either a chloride or a sulfate production process. Chloride-process TiO2 comprises nearly all the pigment sold in the United States and Canada. The FTC believes that the Tronox-Cristal merger will significantly reduce competition for chloride TiO2 in these two countries, a combined market referred to herein and by the parties as \"North America.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following discovery and briefing by the parties, the FTC's Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") held a month-long trial to determine the legality of the proposed transaction. The trial recently concluded, and the ALJ will soon issue an initial decision. That ruling is reviewable by the FTC's Commissioners, and a federal appeals court may in turn review the agency's final decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The transaction has now received conditional or final approval from the FTC's counterparts in the European Union, China, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere. The Commission therefore seeks a preliminary injunction under Section 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act to prevent Tronox and Cristal from consummating the merger until the agency's review process and any later judicial proceedings have concluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court finds that the FTC has met its burden under Section 13(b). It has shown a likelihood that the proposed transaction will substantially lessen competition for chloride-process TiO2 in North America, and it has shown that issuing a preliminary injunction is in the public interest. The Court will therefore grant the Commission's motion for preliminary injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Titanium Dioxide Industry\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Titanium dioxide is commercially available in two crystalline structures: anatase and rutile. Anatase is used in textiles, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food, while rutile is typically used in architectural and industrial paints and plastics. PX5000-013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cristal estimates that roughly 60% of all titanium dioxide produced worldwide is used in paints and coatings, while the rest is used in plastics, paper, and various other applications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 018. Rutile is thus the predominant form of TiO2; anatase accounts for only 10% of global production.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The sulfate production process can create either anatase or rutile TiO2. PX5000-016. It involves dissolving naturally occurring titanium ores (the \"feedstock\") into sulfuric acid to separate the titanium from other impurities in the ore.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The sulfate process relies on simpler technology than the chloride process, requires less skilled labor, and, because it produces TiO2 in batches, does not require an uninterrupted power supply.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Roughly half of all TiO2 made globally is produced using the sulfate process. PX5000-017. China accounts for the largest single-nation share of sulfate-process TiO2, producing 1.67 million metric tons in 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The chloride production process can only create rutile TiO2, and it involves using chlorine gas to produce titanium tetrachloride, which is then oxidized to produce TiO2. PX5000-015. The chloride process is continuous, so it requires an uninterrupted power supply. PX3011-013. Compared to sulfate, chloride tends to produce a higher grade TiO2 pigment, features lower conversion and labor costs, and results in less waste.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The process requires a highly skilled labor force, and its \"superior technology\" is \"closely guarded by Western producers.\" PX3011-019. In 2016, 99% of the TiO2 produced in the United States and Canada was made using the chloride process. PX5000-016. By contrast, in Europe, only 39% of all TiO2 manufactured was produced using chloride.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Customers and suppliers generally agree that there are noticeable differences between chloride - and sulfate-process\n   TiO2. A 2015 Tronox presentation notes, for example, that the chloride pigment is \"bluer in tone than sulfate pigment,\" which has a \"more yellow tone of white.\" PX1322-003. Dr. Paul Malichky, the Director of Raw Material Sourcing at PPG, a major multinational paints and coatings company, explained that while \"both would appear white if you physically looked at them,\" in a final product (like a can of white paint) with \"two colors, one with a chloride and one with a sulfate, the color would be different.\" Hr'g Tr. 100:6-13.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   PX7020-013 (George Young, a senior executive at Sherwin-Williams, another major paint company, stating that \"sulfate grade is not as bright a white as a chloride. It doesn't deliver the same physical performance as a chloride.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Chloride TiO2 can also be more durable than its sulfate counterpart. Sulfate has \"impurities that come as part of the process; most specifically, iron ... [which] decreases the durability.\" Hr'g Tr. 100:14-19. Chloride-process TiO2 products feature \"better durability, scrubability, and various other performance characteristics.\" Hr'g Tr. 169:19. And, because of \"the [consumer] preference for whiteness and durability, sulfate grades are not widely preferred for applications that have prolonged outdoor exposure.\" PX8005-002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Titanium dioxide is generally sold to customers in two formulations: \"dry\" and \"slurry.\" PX5000-017. Dry TiO2 is sold in a powdered form typically packaged in bags; slurry TiO2 is dry titanium dioxide combined with an aqueous solution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While most TiO2 sold globally is dry, large North American paint companies prefer slurry. PX0001-030.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Competitive Landscape\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The titanium dioxide market has been described as an \"oligopoly,\" as TiO2 is a \"commodity-like product with no substitutes, the market is dominated by a handful of firms, and there are substantial barriers to entry.\"\n   <em>\n    Valspar Corp. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours and Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263792\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/185/#p190\">\n    873 F.3d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 190 (3d Cir. 2017). Jeffry Quinn, the CEO of Tronox, explained that there are \"dozens and dozens of competitors worldwide, but there are really six companies that often are referred to as sort of the global TiO2 producers or the global companies.\" Hr'g Tr. 585:9-11. These firms are Chemours, Tronox, Cristal, Kronos, Venator, and Lomon Billions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 585:13-586:2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Of the six, the first five dominate the production of chloride TiO2. PX1532-051. In 2016, roughly 2.77 million metric tons of the pigment was produced globally.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Chemours, the world's largest TiO2 firm, accounted for about 37% of 2016 chloride production capacity. PX5000-021. With Chemours, Cristal (21%), Tronox (15%), Kronos (13%), and Venator (7%), together accounted for 93% of total chloride production capacity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on this data, the proposed transaction would result in two firms, Chemours and the Tronox-Cristal entity, that control nearly three-quarters of the global chloride TiO2 supply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Chinese manufacturers control around 51% of global sulfate production capacity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Sulfate production is more dispersed than chloride. Lomon Billions is China's largest TiO2 firm, and in 2016 it accounted for 13% of global supply.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A smattering of other Chinese firms had roughly 38%, while domestically, Venator (12%) and Kronos (4%) are also significant producers of sulfate TiO2.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The paint and coatings industry is the largest overall consumer of titanium dioxide, and PPG, Sherwin-Williams, RPM, and Masco (Behr) are among the largest paint producers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX9020-009; PX5000 at 18, 044-045. Representatives from these firms, other paint and plastics manufacturers, and Chemours, Tronox, Cristal, Kronos,\n   and Venator provided testimonial and documentary evidence about the TiO2 market during the administrative proceedings before the Commission. Additionally, Dr. Malichky (PPG), Mr. Christian (Kronos), Mr. Quinn (Tronox), and the parties' economic experts (Dr. Nicholas Hill for the Commission and Dr. Ramsey Shehadeh for the Defendants) testified about the market and the proposed merger during a three-day evidentiary hearing here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. History of Proceedings in This Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On December 5, 2017, the Commissioners of the FTC voted 2-0 to authorize the filing of an administrative complaint to block the Tronox-Cristal transaction, as they found reason to believe that it would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Commissioners' vote also authorized the FTC to seek a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") and preliminary injunction against the merger in federal district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After several months of discovery, the ALJ held an administrative trial from May 18 to June 22, 2018. The parties filed post-trial briefs, proposed findings of fact, and proposed conclusions of law with the ALJ last month. They will offer closing statements to him once briefing has concluded. His resulting decision may be reviewed by the Commission and potentially, an appellate court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On July 10, 2018, the FTC petitioned this Court for a TRO and a preliminary injunction to halt a potential closing of the deal. The Commission explained that \"[a]bsent such provisional relief, Tronox and Cristal ... will likely be free to consummate the merger as soon as July 16, 2018, the earliest date it appears the European Commission (\"EC\") is likely to complete its [antitrust regulatory review] process by approving\" remedies to mitigate the deal's anticompetitive effects in Europe. Compl. 2. Approval from the EC was \"the only remaining hurdle preventing Defendants from consummating the Acquisition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Three days later, the Court held a hearing on the Commission's TRO motion. Following that hearing, the parties stipulated that Tronox and Cristal would not seek to consummate the proposed transaction until four business days after the Court decided the Commission's request for a preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. A (Agreement Not to Close Transaction) 2, ECF No. 44-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On August 7, 2018, the Court began a three-day evidentiary hearing on the FTC's motion for injunctive relief. The Commission proposed that the hearing proceed with oral arguments based solely on the closed evidentiary record before the ALJ.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Proposed Hr'g Schedule 2, ECF No. 45. The Defendants objected, ultimately proposing that each side be allowed to present live testimony from two expert witnesses and a fact witness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Proposed Hr'g Schedule 4, ECF No. 47. The Court allowed each side to present live testimony from three witnesses of their choosing, and to present opening and closing arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties also submitted briefs outlining their positions and the complete administrative record before the ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Section 7 of the Clayton Act prohibits acquisitions \"the effect of [which] may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly\" in \"any line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If, on the other hand, customers can defeat the price increase \"by substitution away from the relevant product or by arbitrage,\" the market definition must be broadened.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1586899\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/12/34/#p49\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sysco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p22\">\n    113 F.Supp.3d at 33-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   To run the test, Dr. Hill conducted a \"critical loss analysis.\" PX5000-049. He began by calculating the \"critical loss,\" which is the percentage of \"lost unit sales that would leave profits unchanged\" if a hypothetical monopolist imposed a SSNIP. Merger Guidelines \u00a7 4.1.3. Dr. Hill determined that, with an SSNIP of 10%, a hypothetical monopolist could lose up to 15.4% of its sales and still break even. PX5000-051. The critical loss threshold is thus 15.4%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Next, Dr. Hill estimated the \"predicted loss\" that would be observed in the event of a SSNIP of 10%. If the predicted loss is less than the critical loss, imposing a SSNIP would be profitable for the hypothetical monopolist, and the relevant antitrust market has been correctly defined. Dr. Hill used three methods to calculate the predicted loss: the \"price elasticity of demand\" method, a \"substitution components\" method, and a \"documentary evidence\" method. Each showed that a hypothetical monopolist could profitably raise North American chloride TiO2 prices by 10%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX5000 at 051-057.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of a product's sales to a 1% change in the product's price. PX5000-051. Demand for a product is \"elastic\" if a 1% price increase decreases demand by more than 1%. It is \"inelastic\" if a 1% price increase decreases demand by less than 1%. The more inelastic a product's demand, the less likely it is that the product has adequate substitutes. Dr. Hill found that the price elasticity of North American chloride TiO2 is -0.45% (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a 1% increase in price reduces sales by 0.45%). He multiplied this number and a 10% SSNIP to show that the predicted loss of sales, 4.5%, would be considerably lower than the critical loss of 15.4%. PX5000-052. In other words, estimates of price elasticity show that a hypothetical monopolist could profitably increase North American chloride TiO2 prices by 10%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Dr. Hill's \"substitution components method\" used the Defendants' data to estimate the expected increase of TiO2 imports in response to a 10% SSNIP. The TiO2 that firms acquire from imports or from other producers repatriating their exports represents lost sales for a hypothetical\n   monopolist. Dr. Hill found that a 10% SSNIP would lead to roughly 75,000 more metric tons of TiO2 being imported or repatriated, and another 3% decrease in the monopolist's sales of rutile TiO2. PX5000-054. Together, this represents roughly 12.6% of total North American chloride TiO2 sales.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p22\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a 12.6% loss is lower than the critical loss threshold of 15.4%, the substitution components method predicts that the hypothetical monopolist could profitably raise prices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Finally, Dr. Hill used data from Tronox documents. At some future point, Tronox contends, \"Chinese sulfate could take up to 15 percent of [all TiO2] applications\" in North America, thus \"reducing the share of chloride titanium dioxide by at most five percent.\" PX5000-055. Dr. Hill assumed that such sulfate substitution would occur in response to a 10% SSNIP. He and calculated that the resulting loss of sales to the hypothetical monopolist would be about 8.7%, which again is lower than the critical loss threshold. PX5000-056. Based on these calculations and his other analyses, Dr. Hill concluded that the relevant market for evaluating the merger's potential anticompetitive effects consists of North American chloride TiO2 sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The Defendants Define the Market Too Broadly\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Defendants argue that the Commission's geographic market definition is impermissibly narrow, and they challenge many of Dr. Hill's calculations. The FTC's \"claim that the relevant geographic market is limited to North America,\" they contend, \"ignores that TiO2 is a globally-traded commodity.\" Defs.' Unredacted Opp. to Prelim. Inj. 8. If Dr. Hill's hypothetical monopolist \"were to attempt to implement a SSNIP post-merger, the significant volume of TiO2 'on the water' that would be diverted to North America ... would exceed the critical loss ... within the FTC's candidate market.\" RX0170.0015. This is because global trade in TiO2 is \"highly elastic.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p22\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   True, global trade flows of TiO2 are substantial. In 2016, 46% of the chloride TiO2 produced in North America was exported. PX5000-037. The largest producers of the chloride pigment in North America-Chemours, Tronox, and Cristal-are also its largest exporters.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p22\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p22\">\n    at 038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Upon a price increase in North America, these producers could conceivably repatriate some of this exported TiO2 to increase their profit margins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Commission, however, provided plausible explanations for why sizeable repatriation of titanium dioxide would not occur. First, there has been no evidence of this behavior in the past. As mentioned earlier, Dr. Hill's analysis suggests a persistent variance in prices between North America and other regions. Regional price differences show that profiting from export repatriation is possible. But the persistence of these differences shows that nontrivial repatriation does not happen in practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   One offered reason is that, in the TiO2 industry, \"customer relationships\" and \"security of supply\" are essential. Hr'g Tr. 399:15-22. TiO2 producers have large customers in export markets, and \"alienating a customer base\" could result in the long-term loss of business.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p22\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As revenues depend on both sales volume and product price, \"making a large change invoking the ire of your customers for a short period is probably not worth it.\" Hr'g Tr. 399:25-400:2.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   PX8005-004 (Venator explaining that \"[o]ur European business is stable, and our primary focus is on serving the established relationships we have built over time with large customers in Europe. Given the cost of shipping and duties, we are generally better off selling in Europe than exporting to North America. We have\n   not seen a sustained gap between North American prices and European prices large enough over a long enough period that it would make sense for us to export more to North America.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The North American preference for slurry rather than dry TiO2 presents another reason to question the extent to which export repatriation might defeat a price hike imposed by the hypothetical monopolist. The \"North American market is almost exclusively slurry,\" and customers in this region have \"some of the most strict\" quality of product and service demands. Hr'g Tr. 177:21-22; 178:5-11. While all titanium dioxide trading is subject to logistical challenges, import duties, and shipping costs, slurry TiO2 requires at least some additional capital expenditure (such as physical locations at which the dry TiO2 is mixed with an aqueous solution and repackaged). These costs may make export repatriation even more unlikely absent a large and sustained regional price disparity. Together, the persistence of regionalized pricing, the lack of evidence of prior export repatriation, the incentives for maintaining customer relationships and supply security, and the domestic preference for slurry raise significant questions about whether customers could import enough TiO2 to offset a SSNIP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Aside from ignoring global trade flows, the Defendants contend that the Commission's market definition is wrong because of the \"flawed method with which\" Dr. Hill implemented the hypothetical monopolist test. RX0170.0129. According to them, Dr. Hill wrongly \"gives the hypothetical monopolist control over supply both inside and outside his hypothesized relevant market.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p22\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p22\">\n    at 0130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, the Merger Guidelines suggest that \"[w]hen the hypothetical monopolist could discriminate based on customer location, [the Commission] may define geographic markets based on the locations of targeted customers .... Geographic markets of this type encompass the region into which sales are made.\" Merger Guidelines \u00a7 4.2.2. Persistent regional pricing shows that TiO2 producers can discriminate based on customers' locations. And, as Dr. Shehadeh testified, the Merger Guidelines are \"an excellent summary of a very broad set of tools that are used by economists\" to engage in antitrust analysis. Hr'g Tr. 478:6-8. They have also been repeatedly relied on by the courts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sysco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p22\">\n    113 F.Supp.3d at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The Merger Guidelines are not binding, but the Court of Appeals and other courts have looked to them for guidance in previous merger cases.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Heinz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11110250,3677531\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/246/708/\">\n    246 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   716 ;\n   <em>\n    H &amp; R Block\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4130667\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/833/36/#p53\">\n    833 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   52 n. 10 ). Thus, Dr. Hill's modeling assumptions seem reasonable given the nature of the TiO2 industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In summary, though the TiO2 market is characterized by considerable global trade, the Commission has credibly suggested that North American customers could not overcome a 10% SSNIP by increasing imports from foreign sources. It has also shown that customers cannot substitute away from chloride by using sulfate TiO2 in their coatings, paints, and plastics. The Court finds that the FTC has carried its burden, and that the market for chloride-process TiO2 in North America is the relevant market in which to assess the potential anticompetitive effects of Tronox's acquisition of Cristal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

From producer invoices, customer data, and third-party cost studies, Dr. Hill estimates that roughly 831,000 metric tons of chloride TiO2 was sold in North America in 2016. Of this volume, Chemours accounted for [redacted] of sales. Together, Tronox and Cristal accounted for [redacted]. PX5000-068.

Should Tronox and Cristal merge, the new four-firm market would feature an HHI of 3,046. The merger would thus increase the HHI by 726 points, resulting in a highly concentrated market.

On a 2016 earnings call, Mr. Casey explained that \"a very disciplined approach to production, to managing supply relative to demand, is what has facilitated the recovery in our markets, and we intend to continue to be disciplined about that.\" PX9003-010.

In 2016, Arjen Duvekot, then a managing director, told a distributer that \"to stop the price erosion in the market we reduced the production output in our pigment plants mid 2015 by 15%,\" adding that this withholding \"presents a great opportunity to turn around the price trend of the last 4 years and improve the prices for Tronox TiO2 pigment in the market.\" PX5002-009. Similarly, in 2015, Mr. Duvekot told a colleague that offering a consumer a lower price \"will cause a reaction from the competition, at this account or elsewhere in the market, which will just lead to more price erosion in the market. Tronox does not want to play this game (anymore).\" PX1432-001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Other TiO2 firms also acknowledge the benefits of strategic output withholding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX2022, PX2116, and PX2083 (statements in Cristal documents about idling production to raise prices); PX3000 at 003-004 ( [redacted] noting that \"capacity rationalization\" and an \"increasingly structured and consolidated market (Tronox / Cristal)\" mean that the \"[s]ignificant recovery in TiO2 prices [is] expected to continue through 2017 and 2018\"); PX5000-079 (describing plans by Chemours to \"dial back production\" at some plants in response to adding production capacity at a facility in Mexico).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   There is, of course, nothing improper about a firm making independent production decisions to maximize profits.

More broadly, Chemours and the Tronox-Cristal entity would often be able to maintain price discipline and control supply in a post-merger market simply by competing less vigorously against each other for major accounts. As Mr. Christian testified, \"more consolidation ... leads to more power for the producers ... [the proposed merger] gives us increased ... bargaining power as an industry.\" Hr'g Tr. 270:5-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The available real-world evidence thus suggests that (1) to counter declining prices, chloride TiO2 producers have incentives and the means to withhold supply, and (2) the proposed transaction, which would create two firms with nearly three-quarters of the total market share, will likely increase these incentives and make implicit price coordination easier. The evidence, in other words, strengthens the Commission's assertion that the Tronox-Cristal merger raises serious and substantial questions about likely anticompetitive effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Dr. Hill's Capacity Closure and Cournot Models are Subject to Valid Critiques, but Their Conclusions Track Business Realities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Dr. Hill used two economic models to prove that the merger will increase incentives to withhold TiO2 supply. He first presented findings from a new analysis he calls the \"Capacity Closure\" model. PX5000-085. It seeks to quantify the costs and benefits to the Tronox-Cristal entity associated with output reductions. Generally, the cost of reducing production is the lost profit on each unit of TiO2 that is withheld, while the benefit is the higher profit margin, attributable to a higher market price, of each unit that is sold.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 086. The model allows \"imports of chloride titanium dioxide to be affected by changes in the price,\" but it does not \"allow for an increase in North American domestic production of chloride titanium dioxide because of the current high operating rates in North America.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 087.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Capacity Closure model predicts that, \"under current market conditions, the merged firm would have an incentive to withhold output by idling two production lines at [Tronox's] Hamilton plant [in Mississippi].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 087. Specifically, the \"most profitable output withholding strategy is predicted to lead to a price increase of 23% and cause harm of $419 million per year.\" The model outlines many profitable withholding strategies that would result in price increases to consumers ranging from 8 - 38%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The Defendants present two criticisms of the Capacity Closure model that limit the persuasiveness of its conclusions. Dr. Shehadeh contends that the model is invalid as it \"predicts that Chemours should supply less to North America under current competitive conditions than Chemours is actually supplying.\" RX0170.0038. Because the model's predictions are unreliable for \"Chemours' actual conduct today,\" he argues, they are unreliable as they pertain to future conduct by the merged entity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Dr. Hill's rebuttal report does not respond directly to this allegation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX5004 at 041-045. During the evidentiary hearing, he explained that he did not try to address the issue, as he did not apply his model to Chemours. Hr'g Tr. 447:2-448:1. Instead, he claimed that he was unwilling to \"rely on the data\" used by Dr. Shehadeh,\n   because \"Chemours has a different production process than its rivals,\" and this makes \"margin information\" on the firm unreliable.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Hill did use this data, however, in conducting some of his hypothetical monopolist testing, as there he \"was able to mitigate the concerns about the data.\" Hr'g Tr. 448:5-7. While it is true that data fit for one purpose may not be fit for another, Dr. Hill's response does not fully allay the concerns raised by Dr. Shehadeh, and there is reason to question the model's predictive power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Dr. Shehadeh also questions the justification for the assumption that the \"current high operating rates in North America\" mean that producers cannot increase capacity at all. After all, high operating rates do not prevent firms from \"engaging in [the type of] expansions that have been so evident in the industry.\" RX0170.0039. Dr. Hill's rebuttal focuses on statements made by Venator and Chemours executives, who predict sustained capacity constraints and suggest that the industry's high utilization rate is unlikely to change over the next few years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX5004 at 043-44. But these statements assume that the status quo will continue, and not that a new Tronox-Cristal entity will increase its output withholding. It therefore seems reasonable to expect\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   efforts by rivals to increase capacity if such efforts could be profitable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Unlike the Capacity Closure model, the Cournot model is a \"fundamental economic\" tool used to analyze oligopolies. PX5000-090. Its \"key insight is that firms in oligopoly markets will recognize their mutual interdependence and restrict output-thereby increasing the market price above the competitive level.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And unlike the Capacity Closure method, the Cournot model allows firms to adjust output, so that each firm can expand capacity if it so chooses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Hill's Cournot analysis suggests that \"the merger would lead to a higher chloride titanium dioxide price unless the merger were to generate a more than 74% reduction in the merged firm's marginal cost as compared to those of the stand-alone firms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Unless the cost savings from the acquisition are so great as to reduce the price of producing a unit of TiO2 pigment by 74%, the Cournot model suggests that the merged entity would gain more from raising prices than increasing supply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Dr. Shehadeh contends that, in some circumstances, use of the Cournot model is not appropriate and leads to results that are inconsistent with market realities. RX0170.0044. Here, for instance, the Cournot model \"significantly\" understates the existing marginal costs of production.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 0045. Chemours' marginal cost of producing TiO2 is, according to the model, \"more than [redacted]\" lower than the \"actual\" marginal cost as measured by Dr. Hill.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because of this \"glaring inconsistency with basic industry facts,\" the Cournot model cannot yield reliable conclusions about the market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The Defendants also highlight, and Dr. Hill confirms, that his \"Cournot model predicts that in the North American chloride TiO2 market the merger will be unprofitable with respect to variable costs.\" Hr'g Tr. 450:21-24. He added that he did not use the Cournot model to analyze the overall profitability of the merger, but that a \"merger that generates significant fixed cost savings\" would still be profitable on an overall basis. Hr'g Tr. 452:18-453:14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Dr. Hill rejects the contention that these findings make the Cournot model inconsistent with market realities. He counters that Dr. Shehadeh \"confused the total cost of production,\" which is used in the Capacity Closure model, with \"the concept of marginal cost of production.\" PX5004-046. Using a corrected, apples-to-apples comparison,\n   the data offers \"striking support for the Cournot model's validity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Hill also suggests that the purpose of the Cournot model is not to analyze merger profitability, but rather to test the effects of output withholding. Hr'g Tr. 467:15-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Court finds that Dr. Hill's overall conclusions are more consistent with the business realities of the TiO2 industry than those proffered by Dr. Shehadeh, even if the Cournot and Capacity Closure models are subject to valid criticisms. Dr. Hill buttresses his modeling with several producer statements that support his findings. TiO2 producers are aware, for example, of their interdependence and the downsides of expanding output.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX5000-093 (collecting Tronox executives' statements like, \"we have not gained market share by trying to reduce price [and we] don't think that's the appropriate strategy going forward,\" and [redacted]. These statements lend credibility to the models' conclusions, as they suggest that firms are generally unwilling to take actions that will lower industry-wide prices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Ultimately, this Court need not decisively sift through various models and theories.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sysco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p22\">\n    113 F.Supp.3d at 36-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the court \"hesitates to rely on\" an expert's precise calculations where such calculations are subject to valid criticism, and concluding that \"when evaluated against the record as a whole, [the expert's] conclusions are more consistent with the business realities\" of the relevant market).

This is because, \"[i]n the absence of significant barriers, a company probably cannot maintain supracompetitive pricing for any length of time.\"\n   <em>\n    Baker Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540168,3483296\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/908/981/\">\n    908 F.2d at 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Merger Guidelines thus suggest that companies that are \"not current producers in a relevant market, but that would very likely provide rapid supply responses with direct competitive impact in the event of a SSNIP, without incurring significant sunk costs, are also considered market participants.\" Merger Guidelines \u00a7 5.1.

Unredacted Opp. to Prelim. Inj. 30. Lomon Billions \"plans to expand its chloride capacity ... by adding 200,000 tons per year during the year 2019 ... and 300,000 tons per year sometime in the mid-2020s.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31. Based on 2016 data, this expansion would make Lomon Billions almost twice as large as the current market leader in chloride-process production (Chemours, with roughly 290,000 tons), and would expand the overall chloride market by nearly 60%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX5000-068. Lomon's bold growth plan is feasible, \"real and unspeculative,\" the Defendants warn, because the firm \"benefit[s] from low capital costs, support from the Chinese government, and from inherited intellectual property.\" Defs.' Unredacted Opp. to Prelim. Inj. 30-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   It is no doubt possible, and perhaps inevitable, that competition from Lomon Billions and other Chinese TiO2 producers will someday redefine the North American market. But the pertinent question here is whether the emergence of Lomon Billions can be \"rapid enough to make unprofitable overall the [predicted] actions\" that otherwise lead to the Commission's concerns about anticompetitive effects. Merger Guidelines \u00a7 9.1. The evidence suggests that it cannot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Currently, neither Lomon Billions nor any supplier other than Chemours, Tronox, Cristal, Kronos, or Venator account for even 1% of North American chloride-process TiO2 supply. PX5000-068. Lomon Billions, like other Chinese firms, is \"predominantly\" a sulfate-process TiO2 producer. Hr'g Tr. 184:9-11. Tronox documents from 2016 suggest that \"China has built multiple chloride plants but struggles to commission them,\" and that \"almost no commercial grade [chloride] pigment is produced today.\" PX5000-113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Major TiO2 manufacturers do not appear to be worried about the prospect of a near-term increase in Chinese chloride production. In a 2015 email, then-Tronox CEO Mr. Casey said, \"I think it is a very remote prospect that China will be producing chloride capacity of any magnitude in the next 3-5 years. The only facility is a 30,000 ton plant being built by Billions, which they cannot get to work.\" PX1065-001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Similarly, from Kronos's perspective, Lomon Billions is \"just not a material threat today .... We've been thinking [about] this for a while, [and] we just don't see a lots [sic] of Chinese [chloride-process] products in the markets in which we compete.\" Hr'g Tr. 183:24-184:8. Kronos\n   does not see its \"customers ... switching from our [chloride-process] products to Lomon Billions.\" Hr'g Tr. 184:16-17. As Mr. Christian persuasively explained, Chinese companies' typical advantages are low labor costs and a relaxed environmental regulatory regime. Hr'g Tr. 186:11-25. These advantages are of little help in the chloride-process business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Indeed, the experiences of Chinese TiO2 manufacturers confirm the existence of two substantial barriers rendering rapid entry into the North American market unlikely: capital costs and technology constraints. Tronox estimates that \"on average, the greenfield cost per ton of TiO2 is between $5,000-$6,000 for chloride pigment plants.\" PX003-013. The construction of a new 200,000-ton plant would therefore cost between $1-$1.2 billion.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   PX5000-110 (noting similar estimates from Cristal and Kronos).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In addition to high entry costs, chloride-process TiO2 requires advanced technology and intellectual property that is \"closely guarded by Western producers.\" PX3011-019. Lomon Billions has \"struggled with the technology. They don't produce utilization rates anywhere near their ... nameplate capacity [and] they've had to lower the nameplate capacity of their plant.\" Hr'g Tr. 184:23-185:3.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   PX5000-113 (\"[redacted] deemed efforts by the largest Chinese producer, Lomon Billions, to produce chloride titanium dioxide a 'technology failure.\"); PX1000-018 (Tronox presentation noting that the \"[l]egitimacy of [Chinese] base technology [is] questionable,\" and that Chinese firms have \"[n]o know-how/experience of running CP plant\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Customers, like TiO2 producers, believe that technology and quality constraints preclude Chinese manufacturers from meaningful participation in the chloride market. [redacted] has tested Lomon Billions' chloride TiO2 but found it lacking. PX5000-114.

Trial Tr. 1094:21-1095:9 (North American customer noting that buying \"titanium dioxide from China\" would \"really be a last resort for us.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Finally, even if Chinese producers can radically increase their chloride TiO2 production over the next few years, recent trends show that much of this supply may be consumed by their domestic demand. China is currently a net importer of chloride TiO2. PX5000-115. As its economy grows and per capita incomes increase, demand for household paints and other products using TiO2 is expected to rise. An industry study, for example, estimates that China's share of TiO2 demand will \"expand[ ] from 4% of global demand in 2005 to an anticipated share of 27% in 2020.\" PX5000-115. [redacted]\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   PX3032 at 001 (\"Chinese TiO2 growth is primarily feeding local and Asian demand.\"). Reflecting these trends, Mr. Casey estimated that China's \"first production [of chloride TiO2] will go into the domestic market so the export market impact will be quite a while.\" PX1065-001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The limited presence of Lomon Billions in the North American chloride market today, the substantial barriers to entry, and China's internal TiO2 demand trends do not paint a picture of rapid entrants ready to replace the loss of Cristal as a source of competition.

The Defendants have identified several merger-specific, but ultimately unverifiable, synergies and efficiencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The Tronox-Cristal merger, they argue, will increase global production of TiO2 for three reasons. First, \"Tronox produces more TiO2 feedstock than its TiO2 pigment plants can consume, while Cristal's TiO2 production exceeds its feedstock production.\" Defs.' Unredacted Opp. to Prelim. Inj. 24. The merger would thus allow \"greater vertical integration\" leading to expanded TiO2 output.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4130667\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/833/36/#p53\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, Tronox believes that Cristal is not producing as much TiO2 as it could, in part because of the \"extremely subpar\" performance of its titanium dioxide plant in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. Kerr McGee, Tronox's predecessor firm, \"built Yanbu with its\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   technology,\" and Tronox believes it has a \"unique skill set\" and expertise that will allow it to boost production at the plant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original). Third, Tronox believes that it can \"repair and restart\" the \"Jazan slagger,\" a currently non-operational feedstock-producing facility in Saudi Arabia that is owned by Cristal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Such repairs would increase the available feedstock for TiO2, thereby increasing the pigment's production. And an increase in global TiO2 production will, all else equal, benefit consumers by lowering prices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Although the Court does not doubt their desire to operationalize these efficiency-improving plans, the Defendants have not shown that the merger will necessarily increase overall output. As discussed above, the titanium dioxide industry features significant incentives, depending on\n   prices, to withhold or manage output to maximize profits. The Defendants contend that the \"great opportunity costs\" associated with reducing TiO2 production mean that \"TiO2 manufacturers, when they have their facility, they run it flat out, they run it all out, they try to gain ... 100 percent realization.\" Hr'g Tr. 40:25-41:3. But this assertion is belied by the observable economic reality of the industry: to prevent falling prices, firms can and do find it profitable to reduce output.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Still more, the success of Tronox's planned improvements to the Yanbu plant and Jazan slagger cannot be reasonably verified before such improvements occur. TiO2 plants, Tronox CEO Jeffry Quinn explained, are \"like living organisms. You make mistakes. You do things, and sometimes it doesn't work.\" Hr'g Tr. 603:13-15. He added that the Jazan slagger has \"had several failed start-ups in the past.\" Hr'g Tr. 618:21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Reflecting this uncertainty, Tronox signed an Option Agreement with Cristal related to the slagger. The Option Agreement \"obligated [Tronox] to make financial investments to help fix the Jazan facility,\" and \"if certain performance metrics are met,\" Tronox is \"obligated to purchase [the slagger] in the future.\" Hr'g Tr. 619:8-19. But if these performance metrics are not met, then \"the $120 million that we are advancing, gets converted to a loan, either we get paid back or that we get it paid back in terms of a reduced price for buying feedstocks to come out of the furnace.\" Hr'g Tr. 620:5-12. Tronox, in other words, has taken understandable precautions in case the planned output-enhancing improvements cannot be actualized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The Defendants also suggest that the merger will result in \"sizeable cost savings synergies\" stemming from the \"reduction in personnel\" and \"supply chain synergies, including volume purchase discounts.\" Defs.' Unredacted Opp. to Prelim. Inj. 28-29. The Defendants hired KPMG, a professional services company, \"to verify the synergy estimates.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29. After \"performing [an] extensive review of the Tronox and Cristal transaction, with access to the 'entire data room' in this matter,\" KPMG submitted a report showing that they \"had assessed and validated\" the deal's cost savings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Again, while the Court credits the intent to achieve these cost savings, it is difficult to independently verify the scale or likely success of the deal's synergies. In measuring the general administrative cost savings of the deal, for instance, KPMG's \"synergy tracking model\" relied in part on revised estimates of operational synergies \"that the business had identified.\" PX7045-013. KPMG's conclusions on cost savings were thus partially based on estimates and assumptions made by the Defendants' internal business teams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Nor did Defendants hire KPMG to identify \"merger-specific\" cost savings for antitrust purposes, but to \"provide consulting support\" for the \"sign-to-close period\" of the deal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 012. It is thus difficult to evaluate and compare the deal's synergies to the dollar amount of cost savings that may have been achievable by either Tronox or Cristal absent a merger.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sysco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p22\">\n    113 F.Supp.3d at 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Sysco did not hire McKinsey to identify merger-specific savings for antitrust purposes ....

The Commission, they allege, used \"its regulatory processes to increase the costs and burdens of moving forward with the transaction instead of seeking a fair and expeditious resolution of the legal issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38. To keep the deal alive, Tronox has \"had to agree to more than $130 million in additional consideration that it would not have had to pay if the FTC had promptly sought injunctive relief months ago.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   To be sure, the posture of this case is unique as, typically, the FTC seeks injunctive relief before an administrative trial has occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Admin. Trial Hr'g Tr. 11:25-12:4, ECF No. 70-6 (ALJ noting that \"this is the first case I'm aware of, in a nonconsummated merger, where we're in this position, going to trial, where the Government has not moved for a preliminary injunction.

Thus, the Defendants have borne additional costs by presenting their arguments both here and before the Commission's ALJ, and they have devoted additional time and resources to the proposed transaction. This is unfortunate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The Court is not, however, persuaded by the Defendants' gloss on the FTC's motives. Preliminary injunctions are equitable remedies to be used sparingly and in exigent circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sysco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363473\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/1/#p22\">\n    113 F.Supp.3d at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The issuance of a preliminary injunction prior to a full trial on the merits is an extraordinary and drastic remedy.\") (cleaned up). Until foreign regulators approved the proposed merger, there was no imminent threat to competition, so a request for injunctive relief would have likely been unripe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

The Defendants went through a lengthy regulatory review process in the European Union. European regulators conditioned their approval of the merger upon a partial divestiture of assets from a Tronox facility in the Netherlands (the \"Botlek plant\"). Mr. Quinn claimed that Tronox \"could have any point just agreed to sell the Botlek plant and, you know, been assured of a resolution in Europe.\" Hr'g Tr. 609:2-4. Selling the plant would have removed this roadblock, forcing the FTC to file an injunction sooner. Indeed, the FTC filed this action because approval from European regulators was \"the only remaining hurdle preventing Defendants from consummating the Acquisition.\" Compl. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   But Tronox did not sell the Botlek plant to hasten resolution of the regulatory process, as the firm believed that \"a divestiture of a whole plant ... was completely disproportionate to any theories of harm that the EU was asserting.\" Hr'g Tr. 640:6-8. Thus, the Defendants had discussions with the European Commission \"for a number of months,\" presented evidence at a formal hearing process, and negotiated approval based on a narrower divestiture. Hr'g Tr. 609:11-610:15. While the Defendants had every right to press their case with the EC, they-not the FTC-painted themselves into this corner. The EC announced its approval of the merger on July 4, 2018,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the FTC filed its Motion for Preliminary Injunction less than a week later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Finally, the harm to the Defendants from putative delays caused by the FTC is at least somewhat mitigated by the fact that any injunctive relief imposed here would be brief compared with a typical Section 13(b) action. In the ordinary case, an injunction means a merger cannot be consummated until the Commission completes its investigative and adjudicative activities. Here, the FTC has already scrutinized the deal and held an administrative trial. The ALJ will likely issue his initial decision before the end of the year, allowing the parties to obtain a decision on the merits within a matter of months. Thus, the harm to the Defendants from a preliminary injunction is lower than in the typical case, in which the administrative process would not yet have begun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The equities weigh in favor of granting the Commission a preliminary injunction. There are strong public interests in ensuring the effective enforcement of antitrust laws and in equipping the FTC with the ability to order appropriate remedies. These interests cannot be overcome by the private equities proffered by the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
