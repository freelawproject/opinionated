P. 12(b)(1) (\" Rule 12(b)(1)\") filed by defendants Department of Veteran Affairs of the United States of America (\"the VA\") and the United States of America (\"the United States\") (collectively \"defendants\"). (Docket Entry # 17). Plaintiffs Christine Shanafelt (\"Shanafelt\") and United States Army Reserve Staff Sergeant Damon Shanafelt (\"Sgt. Shanafelt\") oppose the motion. (Docket Entry # 20). After conducting a hearing, this court took the motion (Docket Entry # 17) under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties' dispute arises out of a Servicemember's Group Life Insurance Policy (\"SGLI\") on the life of Shanafelt's husband, Sgt. Shanafelt, that named Shanafelt as the sole beneficiary. (Docket Entry # 1). The two-count complaint sets out a claim against defendants for negligence under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" section 1346\") (Count I); and a claim for breach of contract (Count II). (Docket Entry # 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants aptly point out (Docket Entry # 18, n.2) that the United States is the only proper party under the FTCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roman v.

Shanafelt, as opposed to the representative of his estate, is a proper\n   party. The complaint simply describes plaintiff as Sgt. Shanafelt's widow. In addition, neither party addresses or explains why Sgt. Shanafelt has a cause of action for negligence that allegedly took place after his death. \"A person who dies prior to filing suit is not a legal entity.\"\n   <em>\n    Adelsberger v.

(\"SGLIA\"). Prudential Insurance Company of America (\"Prudential\"), the administrator of Sgt. Shanafelt's policy, administers these SGLI policies through its Office of Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (\"OSGLI\"). (Docket Entry # 1-2). On July 31, 2015, six days after returning home from his annual Army Reserve Training, Sgt. Shanafelt committed suicide. (Docket Entry # 1). At the time of his death, Sgt. Shanafelt was married to Shanafelt, the named beneficiary under his $400,000 SGLI policy. (Docket Entry # 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 2, 2015, two Certified Casualty Officers (\"CCOs\") from Sgt. Shanafelt's unit, Sergeant Walker and Lieutenant Goslin, visited Shanafelt at her home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket Entry # 1). Sergeant Walker and Lieutenant Goslin presented Shanafelt with a file containing information concerning Sgt. Shanafelt's payable benefits, including information about the SGLI policy. (Docket Entry # 1). During their visit and without Shanafelt's consent, Sergeant Walker and Lieutenant Goslin \"divulged to a room full of people, sensitive benefit information,\" including Shanafelt's entitlement to the $400,000 of SGLI proceeds. (Docket Entry # 1). Shanafelt believes that it was from this exchange that Sgt. Shanafelt's ex-spouse, G. Fillipone (\"Fillipone\"), learned about Sgt. Shanafelt's death and the SGLI policy. (Docket Entry # 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 3, 2015, Fillipone submitted a formal claim to Prudential for $250,000 under the SGLI policy on the basis that \"her children were the rightful beneficiaries.\" (Docket Entry # 1). In a letter dated September 9, 2015, Prudential notified Shanafelt that she was unable to receive any SGLI benefits at that time due to an adverse claim on Sgt. Shanafelt's policy. (Docket Entry ## 1, 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After receiving Fillipone's claim, Prudential undertook a 36-day review and, at\n   the conclusion of the review, issued a decision granting Fillipone the right to bring a claim for the proceeds in court. (Docket Entry # 1). During the review process, the VA indicated to Shanafelt that the matter of the insurance proceeds was \"under investigation.\" (Docket Entry # 1). According to the complaint, it also \"became apparent\" during the 36-day investigative review that \"the VA\" was involved in the investigation and subsequent decision to allow Fillipone the right to sue in court. (Docket Entry # 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On the 30th day of the investigation, Shanafelt was served with a restraining order and thereafter a complaint filed by Fillipone in Middlesex County Probate and Family Court (\"the probate court\"). (Docket Entry # 1). Fillipone filed the probate court action against Prudential as well as Shanafelt. (Docket Entry # 1). Prudential thereafter removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fillipone v.

(Docket Entry # 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On or about May 31, 2016, Shanafelt, through her attorney, \"sent via certified mail\" a \"Notification of Incident and Claim for Damages under the Federal Tort[ ] Claim[s] Act &amp; Military Act\" (\"the notification\") to the VA. (Docket Entry ## 1, 1-2). By letter dated August 5, 2016, the VA advised Shanafelt that an investigator, staff attorney Lisa Wolfe, Esq. (\"Attorney Wolfe\"), was assigned to investigate the claims outlined in the notification. (Docket Entry # 1). Shanafelt's attorney attempted several times without success \"to obtain a status update\" concerning the claims in the notification. More than six months after sending the notification, Shanafelt filed the complaint in this action. (Docket Entry # 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In Count I, Shanafelt asserts that the actions of VA employees constitute negligence under both federal and Massachusetts law. (Docket Entry # 1). Specifically, she alleges that, \"Federal and Massachusetts state law imposes a duty of care upon the VA\" and that the VA breached this duty with respect to \"the handling, maintenance, and care of Sgt. Shanafelt's SGLI policy,\" its disbursement of benefits, and by allowing Fillipone to initiate a claim for the benefits in the probate court. (Docket Entry # 1). In Count II, Shanafelt contends that defendants breached the SGLI policy agreement by failing to disburse the $400,000 in payable benefits to Shanafelt. (Docket Entry # 1). She asserts both claims against both defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss the claims under Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6). More narrowly, defendants initially seek to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis of sovereign immunity. (Docket Entry # 18). While defendants argue that the SGLIA preserves sovereign immunity in this action, Shanafelt contends that section 1346(b)(1) of the FTCA waived defendants' sovereign immunity for both counts. Defendants maintain that to the extent that their sovereign immunity is waived, if at all, \"the discretionary function exception to the [FTCA]\" applies. (Docket Entry # 18). Defendants further argue that even if this court finds subject matter jurisdiction, both counts of the complaint are subject to\n   a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal.

Shanafelt's policy to Shanafelt, defendants argue that Shanafelt fails to identify a statute waiving sovereign immunity. (Docket Entry # 18, p. 16). Furthermore, for purposes of argument, defendants maintain that even if this court has subject matter jurisdiction, Shanafelt does \"not adequately allege a breach of contract or a breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\" (Docket Entry # 18, p. 16). Defendants do not dispute the validity of the contract with Prudential. Rather, they argue that Shanafelt fails to provide sufficient facts to support a breach of this contract because Prudential, not defendants, is responsible for paying benefits. (Docket Entry # 18, p. 16). Indeed, as stated in the complaint, \"Prudential paid the policy limits to Christine Shanafelt.\" (Docket Entry # 18, p. 16). In response, Shanafelt argues that despite prior indications by \"many courts\" that a plaintiff \"may not attempt to characterize a breach of contract action as a cause in tort under the [FTCA],\" she was \"being cautious and including all of [her] potential claims.\" (Docket Entry # 20, pp. 10-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Under the FTCA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202680\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) expressly states that section 1346(b) does not apply to \"[a]ny claim arising out of ... interference with contract rights.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202680\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h).
