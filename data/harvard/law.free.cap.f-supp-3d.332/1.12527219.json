Circuit, in 2017, certified to the D.C. Court of Appeals the question of whether, in an action \"arising from a terrorist attack that killed or injured a family member,\" a foreign national plaintiff asserting a claim under D.C. law for intentional infliction emotional distress must \"have been present at the scene of the attack in order to state a claim,\"\n    <em>\n     Owens\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/#p785\">\n     864 F.3d at 812\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , but this does not preclude recovery on such claim here. As noted above, the U.S. citizen plaintiffs in this action do not rely on D.C. law, but rather the private right of action established by \u00a7 1605A(c), for which courts \"may rely on well-established statements of common law, found in state reporters, the Restatement of Torts, and other respected treatises, in determining damages.\"\n    <em>\n     Fraenkel\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517228\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/348/#p356\">\n     892 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    353 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Heiser II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3777246\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/659/20/#p24\">\n     659 F.Supp.2d at 28\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (stating that claims for damages under \u00a7 1605A(c) are \"consider[ed] ... in light of traditional state-adopted principles of tort law and the construction given them by federal judges in similar cases, rather than-as was the practice under the old pass-through approach-simply the explicit requirements of the relevant state law\"). Indeed, the D.C. Circuit acknowledged in\n    <em>\n     Owens\n    </em>\n    that \u00a7 1605A(c)\"provided a uniform source of federal law through which plaintiffs could seek recovery against a foreign sovereign.\"\n    <em>\n     Owens\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/#p785\">\n     864 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    765 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/#p785\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/#p785\">\n     at 809\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[I]n most cases brought under the new terrorism exception, the plaintiff need not rely upon state tort law ....
