J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ata\">The defendant stands convicted by a County Court jury of Niagara County of grand larceny in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Following rendition of the jury\u2019s verdict, counsel for the defendant applied by motion in County Court for an order setting aside the verdict against him and for a new trial. Among grounds asserted in support of that motion was misconduct by jurors (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 465, subds. 2, 3), the defendant\u2019s claim being that his rights were prejudiced by the occurrence presently to be described. That motion was denied by the County Court. Thereafter, upon appeal by the defendant to the Appellate Division, that court by its order withheld its determination and granted <em>\u201c </em>leave to the defendant to renew the motion for a new trial solely on the ground of misconduct of jurors, so that the Niagara County Court may hold a hearing on that phase of the motion and render a decision thereon.\u201d (279 App. Div. 1129.) Upon the defendant\u2019s renewal in County Court of his motion for a new trial, thus limited in scope, and the subsequent denial of that motion, the Appellate Division, by the order now before us, after reviewing the original record of the trial and a supplemental record containing proceedings had and testimony taken in County Court at the hearing held upon defendant\u2019s renewal of his motion for a new trial, affirmed the judgment of conviction and denied defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">As to facts of record which relate themselves to the problem presented: At the outset of the trial the County Judge, in the exercise of the discretion vested in him by section 358-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, directed that an alternate juror be selected. In accord with that direction Kenneth Huntsman was chosen as an alternate juror and, being seated with the regular panel during the eight days of trial which followed, he was required by statute to <em>\u201c * * * </em>obey the orders of and be bound by the admonition of the court upon each adjournment * * (\u00a7 358-a, <em>id.) </em>It was not until the late afternoon of the last day of the trial \u2014 when the case was finally submitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>the jury \u2014 that alternate juror Huntsman was discharged by the court. The jury\u2019s verdict was not rendered until an early morning hour of the following day. Meantime, during their deliberation, there came a time when the members of the jury left the courthouse in the custody of court officers and proceeded to a local hotel for dinner. As they walked double file toward the hotel dining room they passed in front of and within a few feet from the former alternate juror Huntsman who was seated in the lobby. As the double line of jurors passed Huntsman they \u201c nodded to him \u201d and he <em>\u201c </em>answered their Hellos \u201d. None of the jurors conversed with him until Mrs. Bicker \u2014 one of two jurors at the rear of the line \u2014 was about to pass him. When she was in front of his chair Huntsman, by a <em>\u201c </em>backward motion \u201d of his head <em>\u201c </em>beckoned to \u201d her. Having paused momentarily in response to Huntsman\u2019s gesture, Mrs. Bicker bent over to hear what he had to say, his statement to her in a \u201c lowered voice \u201d being \u2014 <em>\u201c </em>I just heard Coceo [the defendant] runs a sporting house on West Avenue.\u201d To that statement Mrs. Bicker replied, <em>\u201c </em>I don\u2019t believe it \u201d and proceeded at once into the dining room.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">During the deliberations of the jury the County Judge and prosecutor learned of the Huntsman-Bicker incident above described, but defendant\u2019s counsel were not informed of it by Judge or prosecutor. It was not until much later, and after the verdict had come in, that one of defendant\u2019s attorneys learned about it from another source. Meanwhile, and after the jury\u2019s verdict had been received, the County Judge had taken from Mrs. Bicker, in the presence of the prosecutor, a statement about the occurrence, but defendant\u2019s counsel were not notified of this proceeding and were not present thereat.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The dire reflection upon the character of the defendant was made by Huntsman to one of six women jurors in the panel who were then sitting in judgment on the case; it was made by the erstwhile alternate juror who had sat for eight trial days throughout the taking of evidence and thus knew that the defendant had put his character in issue by being sworn as a witness in his own behalf and that he \u2014 as a defense measure \u2014 had called witnesses who had testified that his character was good; it was made in the course of a brief conversation between two members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>of the jury panel \u2014 one a regular juror, the other a discharged alternate \u2014 each of whom, on twenty-six occasions during the trial, had heard the court give the admonition required by section 415 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and had repeatedly heard from the court the further admonition \u2014 \u201cIf anybody should attempt to discuss the matter with you at all you should immediately communicate that fact to the Court and let me know if anyone does attempt to discuss it with you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Although Mrs. Bicker expressed to Huntsman her disbelief in the statement he had made to her and subsequently stated under oath that she had put out of her mind whatever he had said and that she had not mentioned to the jury or commented upon her conversation had with Huntsman, and although it appears from her affidavit that the statement made by him had no part whatever in the deliberations of the jury, we cannot say, in the circumstances disclosed by this record, that the furtive hearsay statement concededly made by Huntsman to a member of the jury, while that body was considering issues of fact submitted for its determination \u2014 including the defendant\u2019s character\u2014 did not prejudice defendant\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The judgments should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b331-7\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsH\">(dissenting). What Huntsman, the discharged alternate juror, did was, of course, wrong, but equally clear is it that the jurywoman, Mrs. Bicker, in no way acted improperly. However, even if we were to regard as misconduct her failure to report to the trial judge Huntsman\u2019s remark, the statute empowers the court to grant a new trial when the jury has been \u201c guilty of any misconduct \u201d, <em>only </em>where the defendant\u2019s \u201c substantial rights have been prejudiced,\u201d and <em>only </em>where such misconduct has \u201c prevented \u201d a \u201c fair and due consideration of the case \u201d (Code Grim. Pro., \u00a7 465, subd. 3). Study of the record before us is not only convincing, but truly conclusive, that no happening here prevented such an appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">It was established as clearly and definitively as was humanly possible that the juror did not believe what Huntsman told her, that his comment made no impression whatsoever upon her, that she dismissed it from mind, did not mention it to any other juror and was not in the slightest influenced by it. Moreover \u2014 and it is of particular significance \u2014 the trial judge and a</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>unanimous Appellate Division, denying the new trial application, found those to be the facts. That being the state of the record, I fail to see how this court may say, as a matter of law, that the facts are precisely the opposite and conclude that defendant was prejudiced. And, since Mrs. Ricker\u2019s vote was not induced or affected by Huntsman\u2019s comment, whether or not that incident should have been handled differently by district attorney or trial judge \u2014 and I do not believe that it should have been \u2014 is of no moment. As a matter of fact, to have questioned or admonished the jurors about the matter before rendition of the verdict would only have called attention to, and emphasized, something about which none except Mrs. Ricker knew anything at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">An accused has his rights, and they must not be relaxed, but the state has its rights too. It is for the courts \u201c to keep the balance true.\u201d <em>(Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>291 U. S. 97, 122.) Where, as in the case before us, guilt has been proved to the hilt and the asserted misconduct had not the slightest influence upon any juror, no right of the defendant was prejudiced and there is no warrant for the grant of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Conway, Desmond and Dye, JJ., concur with Lewis, Ch. J.; Fuld, J., dissents in opinion in which Froessel, J., concurs; Loughran, Ch. J., deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Judgments reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
