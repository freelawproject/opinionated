Harry Winston, Inc., a diamond merchant located in lew York City, claims ownership of the ring.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Brand and Winston had done business together for years. It vas the custom of Harold Brand, the owner and proprietor of Brand, Inc., to visit Winston\u2019s premises in New York several imes a month and select articles that were later sold at the 'allery in Atlantic City. In October of 1947, Brand chose the ing \u2014 later purchased by Miss Zendman \u2014 advising that he vished to show it to a customer, and, at his request, that one tern was mailed to the gallery in New Jersey. Accompanying t was a memorandum, reciting <em>that11 </em>the goods \u2019 \u2019 were only for Brand\u2019s examination and that no title was to pass <em>\u201c </em>until you xave made your selection, notified us of your agreement to pay ;he indicated price [$11,000] and we have indicated our acceptmce thereof by sending to you a bill of sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Upon the receipt of the ring, Brand placed it in one of its public show windows, such display being with the knowledge md acquiescence of the owner Winston. And there the ring remained on display until, more than a month later, it was put up at auction and, after some bidding, <em>\u201c </em>knocked down \u201d md sold to plaintiff for $12,500. She received a bill of sale from Brand and knew nothing about the written memorandum or the circumstances under which Brand had obtained possession. Sometime in January, 1948, Winston discovered that Brand had sold the ring to plaintiff and, on February 2d, lemanded its return. On the following day, an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against Brand.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The record established that delivery of merchandise <em>\u201c </em>on nemorandum \u201d similar to that here involved, had been the regular course of dealing between Winston and Brand for some years, and <em>\u201c </em>hundreds \u201d of such memoranda were found in Brand\u2019s files. Every week or so \u2014 evidence, admitted without objection, disclosed \u2014 one of Winston\u2019s salesmen and officers, Raticoff, would visit Brand\u2019s gallery, and, after checking items \u00a1hat had been sent to Brand, would settle Winston\u2019s account, collecting either cash or Brand\u2019s check or the checks of those customers who had bought Winston articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>The court at Special Term, in the exercise of . its discretion declined to grant a declaratory judgment (Buies Civ. Prac. rule 212), but rendered judgment in favor of plaintiff on defend ant Winston\u2019s counterclaim for replevin. Finding, that plaintif had purchased the ring for full value and in entire good faitb the court proceeded to hold \u2014 in reliance upon the sales ac provisions of New Jersey (N. J. Stat. Ann., \u00a7 46:30-29) \u2014 tho Winston had, by its conduct, <em>\u201c </em>precluded \u201d itself <em>\u201c </em>from deny ing the seller\u2019s authority to sell.\u201d Upon appeal, the Appellati Division, deciding that there was no basis for an \u201c estoppel,\u2019 reversed and directed judgment for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">It is the law of New Jersey \u2014 the place where the sale t&lt; plaintiff occurred and where the ring was then located \u2014 tho governs our decision (see <em>Hutchison </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>262 N. Y. 381 389-390; see, also, <em>Weissman </em>v. <em>Banque De Bruxelles, </em>254 N. Y. 488, 492; Goodrich on Conflict of Laws [3d ed.], p. 470), and t( the law of that state we turn.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">It is our judgment that, by reason of the pertinent New Jersey provision (N. J. Stat. Ann., \u00a7 46:30-29) \u2014identical in wording with section 23 of the Uniform Sales Act, as well as section 104 oi the New York Personal Property Law \u2014 defendant is precluded on the principle \u201c of estoppel or something akin to estoppel \u2019 (2 Williston on Sales [Bey. ed., 1948], \u00a7 311, p. 242), from claiming that Brand was not authorized to sell the ring to plaintiff <em>\u201c </em>Subject to the provision of this chapter,\u201d the statute recites \u201c where goods are sold by the person not the owner thereof and who does not sell them under the authority or with the consent of the owner, the buyer acquires no better title to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>goods than the seller had, <em>unless the owner of the goods is by his conduct precluded from denying the seller\u2019s authority to sell.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Only recently, the Supreme Court of New Jersey, in <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Wolf </em>(4 N. J. 76), for the first time had occasion to consider that provision, and, strangely enough, in a case also involving Brand. The defendant had consigned a diamond ring to Brand upon a memorandum similar to the one employed by Winston. Some time later, Brand borrowed $4,000 from plaintiff, delivering the ring and other pieces of jewelry as collateral security. Some time later, plaintiff purchased the ring from Brand in consideration of the cancellation of the loan, but, as the court explicitly pointed out,\u00a3 \u00a3 no bill of sale was ever given him for the ring nor was the transaction otherwise evidenced in writing \u201d (4 N. J., at p. 78). The plaintiff subsequently redelivered the ring to Brand, likewise upon memorandum. A few months later, Brand, upon defendant\u2019s demand, turned the ring over to him. In the action thereupon brought by plaintiff against defendant for conversion, the court held that plaintiff could not succeed, since Brand had neither title to the ring nor authority to sell it and defendant was not prevented from setting up his own title.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Observing that there were \u20186 no decisions in New Jersey construing this particular section of the Uniform Sales Act,\u201d the court remarked that \u00a3\u00a3 it has become well established in other jurisdictions that have adopted the Act that, although possession alone is not enough to create an estoppel, the owner may be estopped from setting up his own title and the lack of title in the vendor as against a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for value where the owner has clothed the vendor with possession and other indicia of title, 46 <em>Am. Jur., </em>Sales, \u00a7 463.\u201d (4 N. J., at pp. 79-80.) In holding that defendant in the case before it was not precluded from denying the seller\u2019s authority to sell, the New Jersey court explicitly noted (1) that Brand had \u00a3\u00a3 no apparent authority to sell <em>unless </em>it be to an innocent purchaser in. the regular course of business \u201d, and the \u00a3\u00a3 plaintiff in the instant case is clearly not such a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser in the regular course of business (2) that \u00a3\u00a3 plaintiff never received any bill of sale or other written evidence of the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>chase of the ring by him (3) that he <em>\u201c </em>was not the type of customer who came into the shop of Brand, Inc., in the ordinary course of business \u201d (4 N. J., at pp. 80-81); and (4) that plaintiff had had dealings with Brand that were \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>unsatisfactory * * * and accordingly he was put on notice that * * * [Brand\u2019s] title * * * might be questionable \u201d (4 N. J., at p. 81).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The factors stressed by the New Jersey court as decisive go far toward demonstrating that, in the case at hand, defendant Winston is precluded, under that state\u2019s law, from denying Brand\u2019s authority to sell. In sharp contrast with the facts of the <em>Nelson </em>case, plaintiff Zendman was an innocent purchaser at an auction sale conducted by Brand in the regular course of its business of auctioneering; she paid full value and received a written bill of sale acknowledging purchase of the ring; and there was nothing to put her on notice that Brand\u2019s title or authority to sell might be questionable. But, even more important than such differences, there are here operative facts \u2014 not present in <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Wolf </em>\u2014 beyond the mere entrusting of possession. And, since the New Jersey court indicated its adoption of the current of authority in other jurisdictions, these added facts, so established case law indicates, serve as cogent predicate for estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Generally, we seek a proper balance between the competing interests of an owner who has entrusted his property to another for purposes other than sale, and of an innocent purchaser who has in good faith bought that property from the latter without notice of the seller\u2019s lack of title or authority to sell. In resolving this conflict, the courts have evolved certain principles <em>\u201c </em>akin to estoppel \u201d (2 Williston, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 311, p. 242), based on the maxim that <em>\u201c </em>As between two innocent victims of the fraud, the one who made possible the fraud on the other should suffer.\u201d <em>(Island Trading Co. </em>v. <em>Berg Bros., </em>239 N. Y. 229, 233.)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Thus, on the one hand, it is settled that simply delivering possession of an article of property to another as depository, pledgee or agent \u201c is clearly insufficient to preclude the real owner from reclaiming his property, in case of an unauthorized disposition of it by the person so intrusted. <em>(Ballard </em>v. <em>Burgett, </em>40 N. Y. R., 314.) \u201d <em>(McNeil </em>v. <em>Tenth Nat. Bank, </em>46 N. Y. 325, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>330.) <em>\u201c </em>Neither is it sufficient, to work an estoppel, that the person to whose possession the owner intrusts chattels is a dealer in similar merchandise.\u201d <em>(Utica Trust &amp; Deposit Co. </em>v. <em>Decker, </em>244 N. Y. 340, 348; see, also, 2 Williston, <em>op cit., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 310-316.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nor, finally, is an estoppel created merely by the addition of the circumstance \u201c that the possessor of the chattel is authorized by the owner to exhibit the same for the purpose of obtaining offers of purchase.\u201d <em>(Utica Trust &amp; Deposit Co. </em>v. <em>Decker, supra, </em>244 N. Y. 340, 349; see, also, 2 Williston, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 315.)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">On the other hand, it is equally settled that \u2018 \u2018 but slight additional circumstances may turn the scale \u201d against the true owner (2 Williston, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 315, p. 249) and estop him from asserting title against one who has purchased the property in good faith. (See, e.g., <em>Calais Steamboat Co. </em>v. <em>Van Pelt\u2019s Admr., 2 </em>Black. [U. S.] 372; <em>Kirsch </em>v. <em>Provident Loan Soc. of N. Y., </em>189 Misc. 898, 914-915; <em>Heath </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>91 Me. 499; <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>170 Pa. 318.) As this court noted, some eighty years ago, in <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Tenth Nat. Bank (supra, </em>46 N. <em>Y. </em>325, 329), the rule that a vendor can convey no greater title to property than he possesses \u201c is a truism, predicable of a simple transfer from one party to another where n\u00f3 other element intervenes.\u201d However, continued the court, <em>\u201c </em>It does not interfere with the well-established principle, that where the true owner holds out another, or allows him to appear, as the owner of, or as having full power of disposition over the property, and innocent third parties are thus led into dealing with such apparent owner, they will be protected. Their rights in such cases do not depend upon the actual title or authority of the party with whom they deal directly, but are derived from the act of the real owner, which precludes him from disputing, as against them, the existence of the title or power which, through negligence or mistaken confidence he caused or allowed to appear to be vested in the party making the conveyance. <em>(Pickering </em>v. <em>Busk, </em>15 East, 38; <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>10 Adol. &amp; El., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>90; <em>Saltus </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>20 Wend., 268, 284; <em>Mowrey </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>8 Cow., 238; <em>Root </em>v. <em>French, </em>13 Wend., 570.) \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Adopting that principle, the courts have generally acknowledged that \u201c The rightful owner may be estopped by his own acts from asserting his title. If he has invested another with the usual evidence of title, <em>or an apparent authority to dispose of it, </em>he will not be allowed to make claim against an innocent purchaser dealing on the faith of such apparent ownership.\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Clews, </em>114 N. Y. 190,194; emphasis supplied. See, also, 46 Am. Jur., Sales, \u00a7 463, cited in <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Wolf, supra, </em>4 N. J. 76, 80.) And, as was observed in <em>Saltus </em>v. <em>Everett </em>(20 Wend. 267, 281), decided by the old Court for Correction of Errors, <em>\u2018</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the owner may lose the right of recovering his goods against purchasers, by exhibiting to the world a third person as having power to sell and dispose of them; and this, not only by giving a direct authority to him, but by conferring an implied authority. Such an authority may be implied by the assent to and ratification of prior similar dealings, so as to hold such person out to those with whom he is in the habit of trading, as authorized to buy or sell. It may be inferred from the nature of the business of the agent, with fit accompanying circumstances.\u201d Such \u201c fit accompanying circumstances \u201d are here present; the trial court was fully justified in holding that defendant was precluded from denying Brand\u2019s authority to sell. For more than a month, defendant acquiesced in Brand\u2019s public display of the ring unsegregated from other wares properly up for sale. Defendant\u2019s officer, Raticoff, knew of the ring\u2019s display, and yet no effort was made to inform the public that it was exhibited only to solicit offers and not for immediate sale. Moreover, as noted above, the evidence revealed a regular course of dealing between Brand and Winston regarding jewelry received \u2018 \u2018 on memorandum \u2019 \u2019, under which Winston appears to have accepted either Brand\u2019s check or money or customers\u2019 checks for sales made by Brand, without insisting on compliance with the limitations of the memoranda. Winston was thus responsible for the appearance of a general, unrestricted authority in Brand to sell items received on such memoranda. And, relying on Brand\u2019s apparent authority to sell the diamond, plaintiff bid at the auction sale and bought the ring.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Nor can there be any question that such reliance on plaintiff\u2019s part was reasonable, if not, indeed, inevitable. In the eyes of the public, auction galleries exist solely to sell merchandise, and the public thus regards the entrusting of goods to an auction house as tantamount to the entrusting of the power to sell such goods. In the words of Lord Ellenbobough, uttered more than a century ago, <em>\u201c </em>if one send goods to an auction-room, can it be supposed that he sent them thither merely for safe custody? \u201d <em>(Pickering </em>v. <em>Busk, </em>15 East 38, 43.) Accordingly, he concluded, <em>\u201c </em>Where the commodity is sent in such a way and to such a place as to exhibit an apparent purpose of sale, the principal will be bound, and the purchaser safe \u201d (15 East, at p. 43). Even if, as Williston observes <em>(op. cit., </em>\u00a7 314, pp. 245-246), there are implications in Lord Ellenbobough\u2019s remarks that<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2018 go beyond the law \u2019 \u2019, it is enough to note that the additional facts and circumstances here present furnish firm support for our conclusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Further confirmation, if needed, is found in analogous cases from other states. They involve the rights of a purchaser, from an automobile dealer, of a car, subject to a trust receipt or a contract of conditional sale or a chattel mortgage held by a bank or finance company. The operative document materially limited the dealer\u2019s authority to sell, usually by prohibiting a sale unless the written consent of the bank or finance company was first obtained. Despite that limitation, the latter was held estopped from asserting its title or lien as against a bona fide purchaser, if it had in past transactions acquiesced in the dealer\u2019s making sales, without complying with the prescribed restriction. The estoppel was largely predicated on the act of the owner or mortgagee which, the courts ruled, cloaked the dealer \u2014 so far as the public was concerned \u2014 with authority to sell the property. (See, e.g., <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commercial Investment Trust, </em>64 Utah 151; <em>Gramm-Bernstein Motor Truck Co. </em>v. <em>Todd, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>121 Wash. 145; <em>Denno </em>v. <em>Standard Acceptance Corp., </em>277 Mass. 251; <em>Daas </em>v. <em>Contract Purchase Corp., </em>318 Mich. 348; <em>Atlantic Discount Corp. </em>v. <em>Young, </em>224 N. C. 89; see, also, 2 Williston, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 316, pp. 251-252; cf. <em>Coffman </em>v. <em>Citizens\u2019 Loan &amp; Investment Co., </em>172 Ark. 889; <em>Finance Corp. of N. J. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>98 N. J. L. 165; <em>Commercial Motors Mtge. Corp. </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>280 Pa. 177.)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The Appellate Division in the present case regarded <em>Utica Trust &amp; Deposit Co. </em>v. <em>Decker (supra, </em>244 N. Y. 340) as decisive against plaintiff\u2019s claim of estoppel. That case, however, is distinguishable. Several automobile dealers gave a chattel mortgage to plaintiff bank as security for the financing of four cars which they had purchased. There had been similar prior transactions between the parties, and in each instance the mortgage prohibited the dealer from selling or transferring any car \u2014 though on exhibition in their premises \u2014 until it was released from the mortgage. The defendant Decker purchased one of the cars in the regular course of business and without knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s mortgage. We did no more than hold that plaintiff, having <em>duly recorded its mortgage, </em>could recover the car from Decker and was not estopped by allowing exhibition of the car for the purpose of obtaining offers of purchase. Apart from the fact that it dealt, not with a secret agreement as here, but with an instrument publicly recorded in accordance with statute, the case is further distinguishable upon the ground, there emphasized (p. 345), that \u201c It was not conceded or proven that any cars so covered by mortgages had been sold by O\u2019Donoghue and Wetzel [the dealers] without their first having obtained releases from the mortgagee, as provided in the mortgages.\u201d Quite evidently, therefore, our decision in <em>Decker </em>does not deny operative effect to evidence of prior dealings between the parties, clearly manifesting a past disregard for limitations contained in the pertinent instrument. (Cf., also, <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Clews, </em>105 N. Y. 283; <em>id., supra, </em>114 N. Y. 190,195-196.)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">We realize, of course, that <em>u </em>The law takes into account not simply the deception of the subsequent buyer by the appearance of title in the possessor of the goods, but also whether this appearance of title was created by the original owner for a pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>pose so essential and proper that the original title must be protected irrespective of the injury to the subsequent buyer \u201d (2 Williston, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 312, p. 243). The task in each case is, therefore, to balance the probability of deception with the necessity for adopting the particular mode of entrusting chosen. In this ease, we fail to see how defendant\u2019s mode of operation is <em>\u201c </em>so essential \u201d to the conduct of its business as to warrant placing upon an innocent purchaser the burden and consequences of the very fraud which defendant made possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">An owner must be fully aware of the potentialities for fraud created when, for purposes of sale, he entrusts merchandise to a retail dealer, regularly engaged in selling such goods, and the dangers are many times multiplied if that dealer happens to be an auctioneer. It ill behooves the owner to complain if he is not permitted to rely upon his private and secret agreement, when he himself has failed to require adherence to its terms and has thus become responsible for the dealer\u2019s apparent authority to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed and that of Special Term affirmed, with costs in this court and the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Loughran, Ch. J., Lewis, Conway, Desmond, Dye and Fboessel, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-8\">. The trial court also opined that, if the law of New York applied, plaintif was further protected by the New York Factor\u2019s Act (Personal Property Law \u00a7 43), which provides that an agent \u201cintrusted with the possession of an; merchandise for the purpose of sale * * * shall be deemed to be the true owner thereof, so far as to give validity to any contract made by such- ageni with any other person, for the sale or disposition of the whole or any part oi such merchandise\u201d. Since New Jersey has no comparable provision, it is unnecessary to determine whether the facts support the trial court\u2019s conclusior that, despite the language in the memorandum, Brand was, within the meaning of the Factor\u2019s Act, an agent of Winston \u201cintrusted with the possession\u201d oi the ring \u201c for the purpose of sale \u201d so as to give validity to Brand\u2019s subsequeni sale pf it to plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b231-6\">. As Williston has observed, \u201c It is enough to put the typical case of sending a watch for repair to a jeweler who habitually sells watches, to make it clear that such an intrusting will not, without more, prevent the owner from asserting his title against a purchaser\u201d.
