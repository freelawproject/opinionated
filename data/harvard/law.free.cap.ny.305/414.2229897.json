The New York City Transit Authority Act (L. 1953, ch. 200, as amd. by ch. 201) is a local act and not a V general \u201d law. <em>(Greene </em>v. <em>Dunscomb, </em>281 N. Y. 261; <em>Adler </em>v. <em>Deegan, </em>251 N. Y. 467; <em>Matter of Bronx Parkway Comm. </em>v. <em>Hylan, 119 </em>Misc. 785, 206 App. Div. 688, 236 N. Y. 593.) II. The act is an unconstitutional interference with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number><em>property, </em>affairs or government of the City of New York, without the city\u2019s antecedent prescribed consent. <em>(New Rochelle Trust Co. </em>v. <em>White, </em>258 App. Div. 400; <em>Matter of Rapid Tr.

All references in chapters 202 through 208 of the Laws of 1953 to the Authority set up in chapters 200 and 201 of the Laws of 1953 should be stricken as unconstitutional legislative <em>\u201c </em>duress \u201d and coercion and, therefore, inoperative. <em>(Denihan Enterprises </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dwyer, </em>302 N.

The transfer of the power to determine the necessity for, the routes of, and whether and to what extent the construction and extension of transit facilities should be undertaken at municipal expense, and the power to operate the transit system to a Transit Authority, the members of which are not appointed by city officers or authorities, violates the letter and spirit of section 8 of article IX of the State Constitution. <em>(People ex rel.

The act provides that the agreement must contain a provision committing the city to incur a total exceeding $574,000,000. In addition, there would be imposed upon the city an amount of indebtedness unascertainable in extent until the end of the term. Such full amount will cause the city\u2019s constitutional debt incurring limit to be greatly exceeded immediately upon the signing of the agreement in direct violation of section 4 and subdivision E of section 7 of article VIII of the State Constitution. <em>(Levy </em>v. <em>McClellan, </em>196 N. Y. 178; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Town of Quin, </em>155 So. 865 [Ala.]; <em>Beard </em>v. <em>City of Hopkinsville, </em>24 S. W. 872 [Ky.] ; <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>City of Mayfield, </em>186 S.

V. It is the manifest purpose of chapters 200 through 205 of the Laws of 1953 to empower the Transit Authority to control the taxing power to achieve an objective utterly unrelated to the taxing power. The power to tax can be granted or withheld only by the Legislature or by the elected officials of a municipality to which the Legislature grants the power. It cannot be placed within the discretion of appointed officers oi\u2018 the State to grant or withhold the taxing power. Such condition being invalid, the city has full power to exercise the taxing powers granted in chapter 199 of the Laws of 1953, and in such other laws. <em>(Asbury </em>v. <em>Town of Albermarle, </em>78 S. E. 146 [N. C.]; <em>Gautier </em>v. <em>Ditmar, </em>204 N. Y. 20; <em>Matter of Board of Educ., Town of Brookhaven </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>214 App. Div. 40; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>School Dist. of Phila., </em>195 A. 90 [Pa.] ; <em>Township of Bernards </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>39 A. 716 [N. J.]; <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>City of Cheyenne, </em>154 P. 2d 355 [Wyo.].) VI. The conditioning of the city\u2019s power to raise taxes on real estate upon the requirement that it transfer its transit system to the Transit Authority violates section 9 of article IX of the State Consitution and deprives the city of its property without due process of law in violation of section 6 of article I. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>New Orleans, </em>98 U. S 381; <em>Helena Con. Water Co. </em>v. <em>Stelle, </em>49 P. 382 [Mont.] ; <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>36 N. Y. 365; <em>Reiter </em>v. <em>Illinois Nat. Cas. Co., </em>65 N.

Y., </em>10 Barb. 223; <em>Litchfield Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>244 N. Y. 251.) VII. Chapters 206 and 207 of the Laws of 1953 relate to the property, affairs and government of the city but, in violation of section 11 of article IX, were not passed upon a home rule request or a two-thirds vote. Such acts further violate section 8 of article IX by transferring from municipal officials to the State Comptroller the power to determine the circumstances under which temporary indebtedness may be incurred for an unforeseeable public emergency. <em>(Wilmerding </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dwyer, </em>272 App. Div. 35, 297 N.

It will be only by a voluntary act upon the part of the city if the Transit Authority statute becomes effective and an agreement is made thereunder. The act imposes or compels nothing. <em>(New York Steam Corp. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>268 N. Y. 137; <em>Kittinger </em>v. <em>Buffalo Traction Co., </em>160 N. Y. 377; <em>People ex rel.

The method</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>of appointment of members of the Transit Authority provided in the act is valid under the State Constitution. <em>(People ex rel. Simon </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>207 N. Y. 592; <em>People ex rel. Metropolitan St. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Tax Comrs., </em>174 N. Y. 417; <em>Matter of Morgan </em>v. <em>Furey, </em>186 N.

The provision of the transit law requiring the city to continue to pay the capital costs on the transit lines does not violate article VIII or section 5 of article X of the Constitution. It does not require the city to give or loan its credit (art. VIII, \u00a7 1) nor to levy taxes or assessments upon real estate (art. VIII, \u00a7 3). No provision of the law involves the city\u2019s debt limit. <em>(Union Free School Dist. No. 3 </em>v. <em>Town of Rye, </em>280 N. Y. 469; <em>People ex rel. Board of Comrs. of Washington Park </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>67 N. Y. 568; <em>Bogart </em>v. <em>County of Westchester, </em>270 App. Div. 274, 296 N. Y. 701; <em>Sun Print. &amp; Pub.

There is no delegation of taxing power. <em>(Matter of Evans </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>262 N. Y. 61.) VII. Section 20 of article III can hav.e no bearing whatsoever; the transit law does not appropriate State moneys or property. <em>(Board of Supervisors of Co. of Seneca </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>99 N. Y. 532; <em>People ex rel. Eisman </em>v. <em>Ronner, </em>185 N. Y. 285; <em>People ex rel. Einsfeld </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>149 N.

Section 17 of article III cannot possibly be violated; the transit law requires the city\u2019s consent, by the agreement with it, to turn the lines over for operation. IX. As a municipality the city, as against the State, cannot sustain a charge of a deprivation of property without due process of law. <em>(Robertson </em>v. <em>Zimmermann, </em>268 N. Y. 52.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number><em>Per </em>Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AqK\">This is a taxpayer\u2019s action to enjoin the City of New York from entering into any kind of agreement with the New York City Transit Authority pursuant to chapters 200-208 of the Laws of 1953, and for a declaratory judgment determining that no transaction which those statutes purport to authorize can be executed due to their alleged unconstitutionality. The action was begun before any lease or other form of agreement had been made between the city and the Transit Authority respecting the subways; indeed, before the members of the Authority had been appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The statutes in question are permissive only, in a field in which the State is concerned. Under these circumstances, and assuming that any transfer will not be by absolute conveyance, but by a lease of limited term with reversion to the city, we cannot say that the legislation is on its face unconstitutional. Whether it would be constitutional without those concomitants need not now be decided. Arguments addressed to policy are not within our province. Whether the statutes will be constitutionally applied, or whether other constitutional questions, not now foreseeable, will arise, we cannot know in advance. Such problems, if any, must be dealt with when presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The judgment should be modified in accordance with this opinion and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b464-7\">Dye, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7Fq\">(dissenting). I agree that a justiciable controversy exists, which has not been rendered moot, by the execution of the lease between the city and the Transit Authority and that we may, accordingly, deal with the problem on its merits. A majority of this court is about to decide that the Transit Authority legislation (L. 1953, ohs. 200-208) <em>\u201c </em>on its face \u201d does not appear to be <em>\u201c </em>unconstitutional.\u201d With this I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The People, as every one knows, have vested the legislative power in the Senate and Assembly (N. Y. Const., art. Ill, \u00a7 1). Nonetheless under the home rule provisions the Legislature is prohibited from enacting any laws in relation to the \u2018 \u2018 property, affairs or government \u201d of any city except when requested by the city affected and then only upon <em>\u201c </em>the concurrent action of two-thirds of the members of each house of the legislature \u2019 \u2019 (N. Y. Const., art. IX, \u00a7 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Here, concededly, there was no compliance with this salutary condition precedent. The laws were passed without any request by the city and without a two-thirds vote of both houses of the Legislature. This fatal omission may not he excused for the Constitution in so many words requires it \u2014 nor may it be justified on any theory of an overriding State concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The statutes now under consideration, on their face, have reference only to New York City and, dealing as they do with the city-owned transit system, must meet the test of the Constitution if validity is to be accorded. Never before has the State intervened to require a city to turn over to an appointed authority the control, operation and management of a vast proprietary interest such as is involved here. Regulation of utilities, including transportation within the province of the Public Service Commission or the Rapid Transit Commission, is something quite different from the complete assumption and control authorized by the Transit Authority laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">It is no answer to our problem to say that the Transit Authority Act authorizes but does not compel the city to turn over its transit facilities by \u201c deed, lease, license or other arrangement, provided the term thereof shall not be less than ten years \u201d (L. 1953, ohs. 200-201). To he sure the language used connotes permission, but the permission is so intertwined with the fiscal aspects of the tax laws enacted as a part thereof (ohs. 202-208) as to make any choice wholly illusory. It may not he denied that if the city is to have the benefit of the tax laws, it must divest itself of the control of its transit system or, to state it simply, the city must either choose to comply with the Transit Authority provisions or else forfeit the additional taxes \u2014 a choice of a sort but nonetheless, for all practical purposes, without an alternative. Even though the laws he treated as permissive, we cannot escape the conclusion that they nonetheless d\";-1 solely with the <em>11 </em>property, affairs or government \u201d o\u00ed A-City of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The existing home rule provisions of the Constitu\u00ed ica adopted by the People, after many rears of struggle for local self-government are, as wo have heretofore .-.tided, intended to vest in the cities of the State increased cod roi of iheir own \u201c property, affairs and govei rmivui <em>(Malta- of II oil a ml </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>Bankson, </em>290 N. Y. 267, 270) and \u201c to extend the field in which a city might legislate and to exclude the Legislature from that field \u201d <em>(New Rochelle Trust Co. </em>v. <em>White, </em>283 N. Y. 223, 230). On the threshold of its being, the Transit Authority legislation was not given the benefit of legislative compliance with the antecedent requirements of the home rule provisions without which its validity may not be approved. Because we deem such lack to be fatal, other aspects contravening the State Constitution need not now be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The presumption attending the constitutionality of legislative enactments is not being overlooked. By the same token, we may not disregard the threat to constitutional government that lurks in a piecemeal whittling away of constitutional mandates. To accord these statutes validity because the act does not appear to be \u201c on its face unconstitutional \u201d is to create a pattern for future guidance the effect of which will eventually, if it has not already done so, vitiate constitutional home rule.
