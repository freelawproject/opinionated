Plaintiff\u2019s predecessor conferred upon defendants a clear and unambiguous grant to open \u201c Gluckstern \u201d restaurants after 1945 without any territorial restrictions whatever. <em>(California Packing Corp. </em>v. <em>Sun-Maid Raisin Growers, </em>81 F. 2d 674, 298 U.

The establishment by defendants of a \u201c Gluckstern \u201d restaurant at 83 Norfolk Street does not violate the \u201cregulation of competition convenant \u201d. III. Plaintiff cannot prevail under the general rules of the law of \u201cunfair competition \u201d because the 1940 contract expressly defined the types of conduct which, as between these parties, should be deemed \u201c fair \u201d or \u201c unfair \u201d. IV. No public policy prevents enforcement of the 1940 contract. The right to sue for unfair competition rests upon the violation of private rights, not upon the public interest. <em>(American Washboard Co. </em>v. <em>Saginaw Mfg.

V. Regardless of possible public confusion, the authorities unanimously uphold the validity of contracts, such as that at bar, regulating the methods and extent of competition as between two parties. <em>(Manhattan Shirt Co. </em>v. <em>Sarnoff-Irving Hat Stores, </em>19 Del.

Nulman </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoOz\">I. The agreement of June 1, 1940, which gives defendants the right to use the name \u201c Grluckstern\u2019s \u201d, by its express terms prohibits any use which suggests a connection between plaintiff\u2019s predecessor and defendants. The trial court found, on uncontradicted evidence, as did the court below, that defendants\u2019 use of the name <em>\u201c </em>Grluckstern\u2019s \u201d at 83 Norfolk Street, was fraudulently intended to, and did, violate this express condition of the contract. <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Cope, </em>28 N. Y. 180; <em>Lathers </em>v. <em>Keogh, </em>109 N. Y. 583; <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Zimmer, </em>110 N. Y. 43; <em>Woolsey </em>v. <em>Funke, </em>121 N.

Defendants acquired no right to engage in unfair and dishonest competition, steal plaintiff\u2019s good will and perpetrate a fraud upon the public by the agreement of June 1, 1940. The court below correctly found that defendants\u2019 selection of the disputed site fifty feet from plaintiff was designed to accomplish all of these things and constituted unfair competition as well as a violation of the contract. <em>(G &amp; G Wholesale Grocers </em>v. <em>Three G Wholesale Grocers, </em>256 App. Div. 950; <em>Forman Co. </em>v. <em>Forman Mfg. Co., </em>119 Misc. 87; <em>Mark Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Hirsch, </em>180 App. Div. 549.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Froessel, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A05\">In or about the year 1900, Simon Gluckstern opened a restaurant which presently has entrances on Delancey and Norfolk Streets in New York City. In due time it achieved a widespread reputation as a Rumanian kosher restaurant. In or about 1916 or 1917, Simon\u2019s twin brother, Louis, became associated with him in the business. In 1928 they formed a corporation known as \u201c Gluckstern\u2019s, Inc.\u201d, each owning half its stock, and to which they transferred this business. In 1940 differences arose between them resulting in litigation which was subsequently settled. With the advice and under guidance of counsel, the settlement was embodied in a written agreement executed by Simon and Louis, and their respective sons, Samuel and Philip, who were employees and directors of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The agreement provided, among other things, for the sale by Louis of his stock to Simon, and for the resignations by Louis and Philip of their positions in the corporation. The agreement also contained a covenant on the part of Louis and Philip that <em>\u201c </em>they will not at any time during the period of five years =::= # * directly or indirectly engage in or become interested * * * in the restaurant * * * business \u201d in an area bounded by 23rd Street, the Bast River, the Battery, the Bowery and Third Avenue. Louis and Philip also agreed that during said five-year period they would not give to any person the right to use the <em>\u201c </em>Gluckstern \u201d name. The agreement then continued: <em>\u201c </em>All of the above restrictions shall cease and terminate at the expiration of five years or prior thereto in the event of a default \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In the succeeding twelfth paragraph the agreement provides that, except as to the aforesaid area, Louis and Philip <em>\u201c </em>have the right at any and all times to engage in any business whatsoever including a restaurant * * * in their own names or otherwise, and that <em>\u2018 </em>Louis \u2019 and <em>\u2018 </em>Philip \u2019 have the right in connection with any business in which they chose to engage to use the name <em>\u2018 </em>Gluckstern \u2019 or <em>\u2018 </em>Gluckstern\u2019s \u2019 in the title of or in connection with the business. In the event that \u2018 Philip \u2019 or \u2018 Louis \u2019 or either of them shall engage in the restaurant business, and in connection therewith use the name 6 Gluckstern \u2019 or <em>\u2018 </em>Gluckstern\u2019s \u2019, the said \u2018 Louis \u2019 and <em>\u2018 </em>Philip \u2019 covenant and agree that they will not represent that their said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>business is a part of or that they are interested in the business of Gluckstern\u2019s, Inc. or that Gluckstern\u2019s, Inc. has removed its business from its present address, 135 Delancey Street, or that Gluckstern\u2019s, Inc. is no longer engaged in business at its present address, 135 Delancey Street.\u201d At or about the same time, the corporate directors adopted a resolution authorizing Louis and Philip \u00a3\u00a3 to use the name * Gluckstern \u2019 or \u00a3 Glucksterns \u2019 in conjunction with any other words * * * but said name must be one that will not conflict with the name Gluckstern\u2019s, Inc. in the opinion of the Secretary of State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Thereafter, Louis and Philip opened two kosher restaurants in midtown Manhattan, one at 157 West 49th Street in the name of the corporate defendant Gluckstern\u2019s Restaurant, Inc., and the other at 209 West 48th Street in the name of the corporate defendant Phil Gluckstern\u2019s Restaurant, Inc. No question whatever is raised as to the right of defendants to conduct such businesses in the names of these corporations, and they were in operation at the time of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">By an agreement dated December 21, 1951, and a bill of sale dated March 10, 1952, plaintiff purchased from Gluckstern\u2019s, Inc., the physical assets of its business and the \u00a3\u00a3 goodwill \u201d thereof, but, as \u20186 to the use of the name <em>\u2018 </em>Gluckstern\u2019s \u2019 \u201d, plaintiff was given only a \u201c non-exclusive license \u201d on certain specified terms and conditions, one of which was a \u00a3\u00a3 license to the use of said name only so long as the Buyer shall remain the owner of said restaurant business, as hereinafter provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">After the bill of sale had been delivered and preparations for renovation were under way, Philip, Louis\u2019 son, having-leased a site across the way from the Norfolk Street entrance of Gluckstern\u2019s, Inc., posted a sign outside his premises announcing: \u201c Opening for Passover \u201d, \u00a3\u00a3 The Original Gluckstern\u2019s Restaurant\u201d, and containing the following* legends: \u00a3\u00a3 Two Generations of Service \u201d, \u00a3\u00a3 Mid-Town Branch 157 W. 49th St., N.Y.\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Plaintiff thereupon instituted this action for injunctive relief. Defendants by way of counterclaim demanded that plaintiff be restrained from conducting a kosher restaurant in New York City under the name \u201c Gluckstern\u2019s \u201d, and for related relief. After a trial before a special referee, a sweeping injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>was granted to plaintiff prohibiting defendants, among other things, <em>\u201c </em>from continuing the use of the name * Gluckstern\u2019s,\u2019 or any derivative of such name, in connection with the restaurant business within twelve city blocks in every direction from plaintiff\u2019s present restaurant business Defendants\u2019 counterclaim was dismissed upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The Appellate Division modified the judgment to the extent of reducing the geographical limitation from twelve to <em>\u201c </em>three city blocks in every direction from plaintiff\u2019s present restaurant business \u201d and affirmed in all other respects. Defendants appeal from the judgment of modification and affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">We think the courts below were clearly right in dismissing defendants\u2019 counterclaim. As to the affirmative relief granted to plaintiff, defendants acquiesce in the restraint placed upon them as to the use of the words <em>\u201c </em>Original Gluckstern\u2019s \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>Two Generations of Service \u201d, Their primary contention here is that, by reason of their <em>\u201c </em>contract rights \u201d following the expiration of the five-year limitation period, the judgment should be modified by authorizing them to operate their Norfolk Street restaurant under the name \u201c Phil Gluckstern\u2019s \u201d, and they are willing to add thereto <em>\u201c </em>such legends as will preclude any possible claim that the regulation of competition covenant is breached \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">In the final analysis, then, the question presented is whether, in the light of the 1940 agreement and resolution, the Appellate Division had the right to impose the &lt;( three city blocks \u201d limitation. At the outset, it should be kept in mind that we are dealing with an express contract between parties, which by its terms defines what conduct is to be deemed fair or unfair, and such contract, rather than general principles relating to unfair competition in the absence of agreement, must govern. In this view, while the courts below were warranted in their determinations in other respects, they were not authorized to erect boundaries never agreed upon by the parties, whether at a distance of three or twelve city blocks from plaintiff\u2019s premises. Such total restraint in the area of plaintiff\u2019s business would be in conflict with the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Under the settlement agreement, Louis and Philip had the right after five years <em>\u201c </em>to engage in any business whatsoever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>including a restaurant * * * in their own names or otherwise, and * * * to use the name 6 Gluckstern \u2019 or 1 Gluckstern\u2019s \u2019 in the title of or in connection with the business \u201d, without any territorial restriction. The intention of the parties was clearly and unambiguously set forth, and, when so expressed, \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 effect must be given to the intent as indicated by the language employed \u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Western Union Tel. Co., </em>299 N. Y. 177, 184). We have no right, under the guise of construction, to excise from the settlement agreement the rights and obligations of the parties as defined by them, nor may we add thereto <em>(Friedman </em>v. <em>Handelman, </em>300 N. Y. 188, 194).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The only limitation on that right after the five-year period, so far as here pertinent, was that Louis and Philip \u201c will not represent that their said business is a part of or that they are interested in the business of Gluckstern\u2019s, Inc.\u201d The question remains, then, whether defendants made such representation with respect to their Norfolk Street premises. The evidence in that connection is the use of the words <em>\u201c </em>Original Gluclcstern\u2019s \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>Two Generations of Service \u201d, as to which they have been properly restrained. So long as defendants do not make the representations forbidden in paragraph twelfth, they have a contractual right to conduct a restaurant business anywhere in the city, for no territorial restrictions were imposed after the first five years, and no public policy was thereby violated. That was their contract, and the courts have no right to abrogate it. Consent does not give rise to liability (Restatement, Torts, \u00a7 754). It cannot therefore be said that merely locating across the way from plaintiff\u2019s business is a violation of the so-called regulation of competition covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The right to sue for unfair competition depends on the violation of private rights rather than the public interest <em>(Federal Trade Comm. </em>v. <em>Klesner, </em>280 U. S. 19, 27; <em>Borden Ice Cream Co. </em>v. <em>Borden\u2019s Condensed Milk Co., </em>201 F. 510, 513; <em>Weener </em>v. <em>Brayton, </em>152 Mass. 101,103; 2 Nims, Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks [4-th ed.], \u00a7 416, p. 1306). In any event, where the parties or their predecessors have regulated the methods and extent of competition between them by agreement, such agreement controls <em>(Manhattan Shirt Co. </em>v. <em>Sarnoff-Irving Hat Stores, </em>19 Del. Ch. 151, 163-165, affd. 20 Del. Ch. 455; <em>Jergens </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>Co. </em>v. <em>Woodbury, Inc., </em>273 F. 952, 966-967, affd. 279 F. 1016, certiorari denied 260 U. S. 728; <em>Tode </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>127 N. Y. 480; 52 Am. Jur., Trademarks, Tradenames, etc., \u00a7 38, p. 530).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">In view of defendants\u2019 use of the words which the courts below have properly restrained, they might reasonably have been required to employ some designation showing clearly that they did \u201c not represent that their said business is a part of or that they are interested in \u201d plaintiff\u2019s business, and this they are willing to do (see <em>Herring-Hall Marvin Safe Co. </em>v. <em>Hall\u2019s Safe Co., </em>208 U. S. 554). Inasmuch as Special Term has provided in its judgment that plaintiff may \u201c apply, on notice at any time at the foot of this judgment for such further or other injunctive relief against the defendants * * * as the exigency of the case may warrant or require \u201d, plaintiff may avail itself of such right if and when it be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The judgment entered upon the order of the Appellate Division and that of Special Term should be modified in accordance with the opinion herein, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Loitghran, Ch. J., Lewis, Conway, Desmond, Dye and Fuld, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
