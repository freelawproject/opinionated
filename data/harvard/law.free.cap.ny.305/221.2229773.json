All the petitioners had previous service (som for many years) prior to those examinations and appointment: in the same departments of the Lackawanna municipal goveri ment. The present proceedings are brought, under article 7 of the Civil Practice Act, for mandamus type orders reinstatin the petitioners in their positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The answer of the commission sets forth its reasons for pet tioners\u2019 removal. It tells us that, in conducting an investigatio (under Civil Service Law, \u00a7 11, subd. 6) of the Lackawann Municipal Civil Service Commission, it found (see same se&lt; tian, subd. 7) that the examinations which these petitionei had passed were not practical or sufficient tests of capacity an fitness for the several positions to which they were lat\u00ed appointed. Accordingly, says the commission, it exercised tl power given it by subdivision 7 of section 11 of the Civil Ser ice Law to <em>\u201c </em>rescind any examination or eligible list \u00ed cancel an appointment already made from a list so rescinded 5 Attached to the pleadings filed herein by the State commissic are the disputed examination questions, and the State commi sion\u2019s conclusions as to their inadequacies. From other exhib\u00ed' similarly attached, it appears that the commission, in so co] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>jluding, relied on the opinions of experts employed by the iommission. Attached to the petitions, on the other hand, are affidavits by five other experts, all of whom concur in the view ;hat the several examinations thrown out by the commission instituted fair tests of fitness for the public employments in piestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">No trial of these proceedings was held by Special Term. That iourt held that no triable issue of fact existed, since the comnission had decided that the tests were not fair and adequate, md since the affidavits of petitioners\u2019 experts established merely i basis for a difference of opinion as to that. Therefore, each Detition was dismissed. Thus, petitioners, with no showing of !ault on their parts, or fraud by anyone, are out of their jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">This truly extraordinary result is sought to be justified by section 11 (supra) which empowers the commission <em>\u201c </em>at any ime \u201d, by unanimous vote, to rescind any examination or eligi)le list and cancel any appointments made from a list so eseinded, the only limitation being that such action shall not &gt;e taken on any ground other than that \u201c the provisions or mrposes of this chapter [i.e., the Civil Service Law] are lot properly or sufficiently carried out \u201d, there being a urther requirement of written specifications showing in what larticulars <em>\u201c </em>the provisions or purposes \u201d have not been tarried out. So reads subdivision 7, and it has been authoritaively held in other proceedings growing out of this same jackawanna civil service investigation (see <em>Matter of Kaney </em>v. <em>New York State Civil Service Comm., </em>190 Misc. 944, affd. 173 App. Div. 1054, affd. 298 N. Y. 707), that the statute gives lersons appointed from lists later disputed no right to notice t hearing as to such dispute. The order which we are reviewag herein means, therefore, this: that any municipal employee, espite his good-faith passing of a competitive written civil ervice examination, and good-faith appointment from an approbate eligible list, may at any time thereafter lose his position f the commission, in an investigation in which the employee .as no part at all, decides that the examination he passed was ot a fair test of qualification for the particular employment. Ve do not deny that the Legislature could so enact, if it wished. 5ut, in view of the fundamental purposes of the Civil Service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Law, and the traditional legislative policy in this State of furnishing effective protection to civil service appointees, we cannot bring ourselves to the belief that the Legislature ever intended or foresaw an outcome like this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Subdivision 7 of section 11 of the law allows examination rescission and list rescission and appointment cancellation, on one ground only, that is, that \u201c the provisions or purposes \u201d of the Civil Service Law \u2018 \u2018 are not properly or sufficiently carried out \u201d. Bead literally, that language would license the commission to wipe out examinations, lists and appointments in municipalities for any violation of any one of dozens of \u201c provisions \u201d in the law, and so would leave no permanence at all in any appointment in the civil service of any municipality. But statutes are not so construed, if construction so harsh,, unreasonable and disastrous can be avoided (see <em>Kauffman &amp; Sons Saddlery Co. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>298 N. Y. 38, 44). We think a meaning more fair, and less destructive, can readily be found. We hold that <em>\u201c </em>the provisions or purposes \u201d referred to in subdivision 7 are the prime, fundamental purposes of the Civil Service Law only, and that it must have been the legislative intent, at least as to appointments already made, that there could be no cancellation thereof, unless the examination had been so-obviously inadequate, or so completely unrelated to the duties of the position, as to be on its face a nullity. Only by such a construction can the integrity and permanence of municipal civil service and the rights of good-faith examinees and appointees be safeguarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Our conclusion that the Legislature never intended to confer on the State commission so sweeping a power to overrule the fifty-six municipal commissions is confirmed by the general statutory scheme which makes those municipal commissions largely autonomous. Subdivision 18 of section 20 of the General City Law empowers every city to create a municipal civil service and <em>\u201c </em>to make rules for the classification of the offices and employments in the city\u2019s service, for appointments, promotions and examinations \u201d. Section 14 of the Civil Service Law, as to the competitive class, provides for examinations to be <em>\u201c </em>conducted by the state or municipal commission \u201d and requires that such examinations \u201c shall be practical in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>character and shall relate to those matters which will fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the persons examined \u201d, etc. (see, also, Rules for Classified Civil Service, rule X). Nowhere in any statute or rule (except in \u00a7 11, subd. 7, <em>supra) </em>do we find any permission or requirement for review by the State commission of a municipal commission\u2019s examinations and certifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The dissenting Justice in the Appellate Division, who thought, as we do, that the statute could not fairly be applied in all its stark literalness, concluded that the courts should read into it a requirement that rescission or cancellation must be had within a reasonable time. We agree that such an interpolation should be made, but it would not of itself afford sufficient protection to appointees. All but one of the appointments here in question were, apparently, promotional within the same municipal department, but the statutory construction applied by the commission and the courts below would, if upheld by us, be available as against any appointee. A new appointee in the civil service of a city, who had, by accepting an appointment, burned behind him the bridge to an old job in private industry, would be little comforted by a proviso that his removal, without notice or hearing, from his city job, would have to be ordered within a \u201c reasonable time Our thought is that, to make this statute jibe with the general purpose, apparent throughout the Civil Service Law, of protecting civil service employees (see \u00a7 22, for instance) it must be read as referring to those examinations only which are so faulty as to be no tests at all. We cannot ourselves take on the role of examination experts, but we have looked at the questions on these rescinded examinations, and are satisfied that they are not so patently unrelated to the positions involved, as to bring into play the commission\u2019s extraordinary subdivision 7 powers. This record, accordingly, shows that there is no more than a difference of opinion as to the quality and comprehensiveness of the respective tests. We hold that appointments made from lists resulting from competitive municipal civil service examinations cannot be nullified on such a mere balancing of expert opinions. On these papers, petitioners were entitled to the mandamus orders they prayed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number><em>Matter of Kaney </em>v. <em>New York State Civil Service Comm. (supra) </em>is not controlling on us here. That was a prohibition proceeding wherein certain persons, theretofore appointed to municipal service positions in Lackawanna, sought to halt the State commission\u2019s Lackawanna investigation, out of which these attempted rescissions and cancellations later arose. Prohibition was refused, since the statute (\u00a7 11, subd. 7, <em>supra) </em>was construed, in that case, as neither requiring notice to appointees of such an investigation, nor permitting any such investigation to produce a result which would be binding on the appointees. Indeed, the Special Term opinion in <em>Kaney </em>(no opinion was written in this court or in the Appellate Division) said that, if any examinations, lists or appointments should be stricken down by the commission, the holders of the affected positions could later have their day in court in mandamus proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The orders appealed from should be reversed, with costs in all courts, and the several proceedings remitted to Special Term with instructions to grant the relief prayed for.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b272-5\">Froessel, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY6\">(dissenting). Fifteen petitioners in five article 78 proceedings seek to annul a decision and order of the State Civil Service Commission rescinding City of Lackawanna civil service examinations and the eligible lists resulting therefrom, and canceling the appointments of petitioners from said lists. The examinations were for police matron, fire lieutenant, fire captain and police lieutenant, and were given between 1944 and 1946. Petitioners passed such examinations as were given them, and in due time were appointed, the last appointment having been made on September 27, 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">In 1946 the State Civil Service Commission commenced an investigation of the affairs of the Lackawanna Municipal Civil Service Commission, following which extended hearings were held under subdivision 7 of section 11 of the Civil Service Law, upon notice and charges as therein required, resulting in the determination sought to be annulled, which has thus far been sustained. The basis of the State commission\u2019s decision and order was that the examinations did not properly or sufficiently carry out the provisions or purposes of the Civil Service Law; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>in other words, did not adequately test the candidates\u2019 merit and fitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">It would serve no useful purpose to discuss in detail each of the examinations. A brief reference thereto, however, will be illuminating. The police matron examination \u2014 the subject matter of the first proceeding \u2014 consisted of five simple questions. The first four were on first aid: \u201c #1 \u2014 What is fainting ? #2 \u2014 What is the treatment for fainting? #3 \u2014 What is sunstroke? #4 \u2014 What is the treatment for sunstroke?\u201d These were evaluated at <em>60%. </em>The sole remaining question, evaluated at 40%, was: \u201c Write a composition of forty words or more pertaining to the duties and responsibilities of a police matron.\u201d The answer thereto was in the \u201c specification \u201d for this examination, as was indeed the case with the composition questions in all the other examinations. Petitioner was appointed within twenty-four hours after taking the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In the fire lieutenant examination, a <em>60% </em>credit was allowed for answers to three so-called <em>\u201c </em>service record \u201d questions, which asked for the commencement date of service, number of ilhiess absences in three years, and the number of charges against the candidate. Ten per cent was allowed for knowing where ten fire boxes were located; and 15% each for two compositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In the fire captain examination, the same first aid questions were asked as on the police matron examination, the same \u20186 service record \u2019 \u2019 questions as on the fire lieutenant examination, and a fifty-word composition was called for, rated together at 70%; fifteen general questions, rated at 30%, were also asked, the first of which was: <em>\u201c </em>Why is it so important that fire apparatus gets to the fire as soon as possible? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">In the police lieutenant examination, 10% was allowed for substantially the same \u201c service record \u201d questions as were asked on the fire lieutenant examination, 30% for the correct spelling of eight simple words, such as \u201c kriminal \u201d, 20% for four elementary questions in arithmetic, one of which was: <em>\u201c </em>What part of an hour is 30 minutes? \u201d and likewise as to 20, 45 and 55 minutes; and 30% for six so-called practical questions, such as: \u201c What is a Barrister? \u201d and \u201c What is burglary? \u201d The examinations given under subdivision 5 of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>246 of the Military Law were <em>identical </em>(not comparable, as required by that statute) with examinations given less than two years previously as to fire lieutenant, and less than a year previously as to fire captain.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Our State Constitution (art. V, \u00a7 6) provides<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that \u201c Appointments and promotions in the civil service of the state and all of the civil divisions thereof, including cities and villages, shall be made according to merit and fitness to be ascertained, as far as practicable, by examination which, as far as practicable, shall be competitive To this fundamental constitutional mandate, all legislative and judicial power must yield. As we said, through Lehman, J., in <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. </em>(276 N. Y. 222, 225, 226): <em>\u201c </em>By placing this provision in the Constitution the People of the State have declared in unmistakable terms that merit, ascertained as therein provided, shall govern appointments and promotions in the public service, and have thus formulated and announced the public policy of the State. No administrative officer may violate the provisions of the Constitution, and no court may sanction a violation. * * * An employment which in its inception violates the provisions of the Constitution is illegal and against public policy, regardless of the good faith of the parties.\u201d (See, also, <em>Matter of Carow </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>272 N. Y. 341, 344; <em>Matter of Scahill </em>v. <em>Drzewucki, </em>269 N. Y. 343, 346.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">To implement the constitutional mandate, the Legislature in 1944 (L. 1944, ch. 435) enacted subdivision 7 of section 11 of the Civil Service Law, which reads: <em>\u201c </em>Said state commission may at any time, by unanimous vote of the three commissioners, amend or rescind any rule, regulation or classification prescribed under the provisions of this section or <em>rescind any examination or eligible list or cancel an appointment already made from a list so rescinded, </em>provided that said state commission shall state the reasons for such action in writing and file the same and a certified transcript thereof as a public document as hereinbefore provided, and give an opportunity to the municipal civil service commissioners concerned to make a personal explanation and to file papers in opposition to such action. <em>The said state commission, however, shall not take such action upon any ground </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number><em>other than that the provisions or purposes of this chapter are not properly or sufficiently carried out, </em>nor without specifying in writing and detail in what particular such provisions or purposes are not carried out \u201d. (Emphasis supplied.) The constitutionality and the purpose of this statute have been passed upon by us in <em>Matter of Kaney </em>v. <em>New York State Civil Service Comm. </em>(190 Misc. 944, 949, affd. 273 App. Div. 1054, affd. 298 N. Y. 707), where it was said: \u201c Under the 1944 amendment, the State Civil Service Commission has the power to rescind an eligible list established by a municipal commission not only on the ground of fraud or material misstatement but also on the ground that <em>\u2018 </em>the provisions or purposes of this chapter [Civil Service Law] are not properly or sufficiently carried out. \u2019 This would seem to embrace the power to rescind the list and cancel appointments upon the ground that the examination given for the position was not sufficiently practical in character and did not fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the persons examined to discharge the duties of the position (Civil Service Law, \u00a7 14).\u201d It was also held in that case that the statute does not entitle petitioners to notice and hearing before the State commission. (See, also, <em>Matter of Connolly </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>277 App. Div. 945, motion for leave to appeal denied 301 N. Y. 814.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Pursuant to the clear and unambiguous power vested in it by subdivision 7 of section 11, the State commission, in its decision and order herein, made the determination here challenged on the ground that the examinations \u201c did not properly or sufficiently carry out the provisions or purposes of the Civil Service Law \u201d, and, more specifically, that they did not meet the requirements <em>\u201c </em>of Section 14 \u201d (now \u00a7 14, subd. 6) thereof \u201c and of Bules X and XXVII(6) \u201d of the Lackawanna Eules of Civil Service. Section 14 provided: \u201c The examinations shall be public and shall be <em>practical in their character and shall relate to those matters which will fairly test the relative capacity and fitness </em>of the persons examined to discharge the duties of that service into which they seek to be appointed.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Having predicated its action on the enforcement of section 14, the State commission was clearly acting in strict compliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>with the plain mandate of subdivision 7 of section 11. <em>(Matter of Kaney </em>v. <em>New York State Civil Service Comm., supra; Matter of Connolly </em>v. <em>Conway, supra.) </em>The statute must be read to mean what it says, and we may not read words into it that are at variance with its clear purpose. It expressly authorizes action by the commission in accordance with the \u201c provisions or purposes of this chapter \u201d, with appropriate safeguards against precipitate action, and with the requirement of unanimity. Section 14 is one of its provisions. And the purpose of the chapter \u2014 indeed its fundamental purpose \u2014 is mandated by the Constitution. The Legislature has endeavored to obey this direction; we have no right to disobey it nor to attribute to the Legislature such a design. The majority agree that the Legislature could enact such a statute as to achieve the result here attained, and the fact is that it has. The <em>\u201c </em>wisdom of the statute is for the Legislature, and not the courts, to decide \u201d <em>(Matter of Kaney </em>v. <em>New York State Civil Service Comm., supra, </em>p. 949). The purpose of the constitutional provision is to protect the civil service, so that appointments and promotions may be made only on \u201c merit and fitness \u201d, tested by valid competitive examinations. Failure to uphold this injunction will impair the integrity of and do incalculable harm to the whole civil service system, and result in withholding the very protection which the Constitution mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Nor should we overlook the fact that, the People of the State, who mandated the constitutional provision, have rights in the public policy which it announces. We are here dealing with fire captains and fire and police lieutenants, as well as police matrons \u2014 responsible officers charged by law with the duty of protecting the lives, the liberty and the property of our people. It is a grave matter when such officers may be admitted to their positions on the basis of examinations which utterly fail to test their <em>\u201c </em>relative capacity and fitness * * * to discharge the duties \u201d appertaining thereto. The preservation of the merit system is not only in the best interests of civil service, but also affords the public that protection to which it is entitled under our Constitution. The inconveniences to petitioners flowing from the determination challenged must yield to the constitutional and statutory requirements that a valid appointment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>can be based only upon merit and fitness as determined by a proper examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">We are told by the majority (p. 227) that \u201c Nowhere in any statute or rule (except in \u00a7 11, subd. 7, supra) do we find any permission or requirement for review by the State commission of a municipal commission\u2019s examinations and certifications.\u201d Is not one enactment sufficient? Must it be multiplied to be effective ?</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The fact that petitioners have already been appointed does not preclude the State commission from invalidating the appointments, for subdivision 7 of section 11 expressly provides that the commission may \u201c cancel an appointment <em>already made </em>\u201d, (Emphasis supplied.) <em>(Matter of Kaney </em>v. <em>New York State Civil Service Comm., supra.) </em>Petitioners are not being deprived of any vested right because if, as found by the State commission, these examinations failed to carry out the provisions of section 14, then each of the petitioners failed to pass a requisite examination. The effect is the same as if there had been no examinations; the appointments were therefore invalid and conferred no tenure on petitioners, irrespective of good faith. <em>(Palmer </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>276 N. Y. 222, supra; <em>People ex rel. Hannan </em>v. <em>Board of Health, </em>153 N. Y. 513, 519-520.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">It may not be said, as a matter of law and on the record before us, that the commission was not justified in finding that the provisions of section 14 were not being obeyed. The examination questions speak eloquently for their own inadequacy. A comparison of the duties listed in the specifications with the subject matter of the examinations likewise establishes their utter deficiency. Moreover, the testimony of the commission\u2019s two well-qualified experts in the field of preparation and grading of civil service examinations was comprehensive arid specific and clearly supported the commission\u2019s findings, even when considered in the light of the affidavits of petitioners \u2019 experts, which were general in nature. The commission\u2019s findings in each case were likewise clear and definite, and in accord with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">In addition to failing to meet the standards- enunciated in section 14, there is a further basis for rescinding the fire captain and fire lieutenant examinations taken respectively by peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>tioners Hughes and Kalamajka. They were in military service at the time the original examinations were given and upon discharge were examined for the respective positions pursuant to subdivision 5 of section 246 of the Military Law. The State commission rescinded their examinations, and properly so, because they were <em>identical </em>with the examinations originally given and not, as required by the Military Law, \u201c comparable \u201d examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">It is urged that the State commission has been guilty of <em>loches. </em>The short answer thereto is that subdivision 7 of section 11 specifically provides that the State commission may take the action authorized thereunder \u201c <em>at any time </em>\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.) Moreover, these examinations were given between 1944 and 1946. Appointments were made from 1945 until as late as September 27,1948. The commission\u2019s investigation was already under way in 1946, and notice of charges was served upon the Lackawanna commission in 1947. Between that time and the decision and order of the State commission on April 12, 1949, it was confronted with litigation arising out of examinations given by the Lackawanna Municipal Civil Service Commission, two of which reached the appellate courts <em>(Matter of Kaney </em>v. <em>New York State Civil Service Comm., </em>supra; <em>Matter of Conway </em>v. <em>Kaney, </em>274 App. Div. 849, appeal dismissed 298 N. Y. 709, motion for leave to appeal dismissed 298 N. Y. 752). Indeed, in the commission hearings, the president stated: \u201c nor is there any attitude or disposition on the part of any member of this Commission to engage in a race with the Courts to make a determination of the proceeding \u201d. Thus it may not be said that the commission did not proceed with reasonable dispatch, consistent with their onerous responsibilities, the numerous issues involved,, and the necessity of protracted hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The orders of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Dye and Fuld, JJ., concur with Desmond, J.; Conway, J., concurs in the result upon the dissenting memorandum of Piper, J., in the Appellate Di-vision; Froessel, J., dissents in opinion in which Loughran, Ch. J., and Lewis, J., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Orders reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\"><em> </em>Reflecting very slight, immaterial amendments made in 1950.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
