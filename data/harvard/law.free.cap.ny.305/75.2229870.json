The intermediate order of Special Term dismissing the first amended complaint is the law of the case because it was not brought up for review in the notice of appeal. <em>(Matter of O\u2019Connor Long Island Properties Corp. </em>v. <em>Bruckman, </em>288 N.

The words pleaded in the first and second amended complaints are not slanderous or libelous. <em>(Weidberg </em>v. <em>La Guardia, </em>170 Misc. 374; <em>Bordman </em>v. <em>Gazette Co., </em>225 Iowa 533; <em>Dillard </em>v. <em>Shattuck, </em>36 N.

Palmieri, respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b121-7\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFq\">We are here concerned solely with the legal sufficiency of a pleading, plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint. The first amended complaint, setting forth ten separately stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>causes of action, was previously held insufficient, by the court at Special Term and by the Appellate Division, as to all but one cause of action and dismissed, with leave to serve a further amended complaint. In his second amended complaint, plaintiff realleges substantially the same facts as were earlier set forth, although in the form of a single cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Plaintiff and defendant Palmieri are attorneys who represented the adversary parties in certain matrimonial litigation. Defendants McCloskey and Dickstein are, respectively, the sheriff and a deputy sheriff of the City of New York. The complaint charges defendants with a conspiracy maliciously to destroy plaintiff\u2019s professional practice and reputation and sets forth a number of allegedly false statements claimed to have been made by Palmieri concerning plaintiff, as well as allegedly false statements and other acts attributed to Dickstein in connection with the latter\u2019s attempts to serve certain process on plaintiff at the instance of Palmieri.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The second amended complaint, the one now before us, was dismissed, on motion, by Special Term \u2014 finally as to McCloskey and Dickstein and with leave to amend as to Palmieri \u2014 upon the ground that the prior order dismissing the first amended complaint was <em>res judicata </em>and conclusively established the complaint\u2019s insufficiency except for the allegations of the single cause of action previously sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Since the earlier order dismissing the first amended complaint granted plaintiff leave to serve a further amended pleading, it lacked the quality of finality and may not, following the service of the amended complaint, be treated as a conclusive adjudication precluding further consideration of the issues. (See <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Gerli, </em>257 App. Div. 249; see, also, <em>Bannon </em>v. <em>Bannon, </em>270 N. Y. 484, 490.) Nor may the doctrine of the law of the case here be invoked. That doctrine, as distinct from <em>res judicata, </em>is limited in application \u2014 at least insofar as intermediate or interlocutory determinations are concerned \u2014 to a tribunal of co-ordinate jurisdiction, and the prior ruling is, therefore, not binding upon this court. (See <em>Hornstein </em>v. <em>Podwitz, </em>254 N. Y. 443, 450; <em>Vogeler </em>v. <em>Alwyn Improvement Corp., </em>247 N. Y. 131, 134-135; <em>Ansorge </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>244 N. Y. 395, 397.)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Independent study persuades us that the complaint now under consideration does spell out a cause of action, not only against Palmieri \u2014 as the courts below previously held \u2014 but against the other two defendants as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The cause of action against Palmieri, one for slander, charges that that defendant, in a telephone conversation Avith one of plaintiff\u2019s employees, falsely accused plaintiff of having \u201c committed a fraud \u201d in obtaining a Nevada divorce decree for his client, and stated further that he could get plaintiff \u2018 \u2018 into quite a mess and even disbarred \u201d. The imputation unquestionably concerned plaintiff in his professional character as an attorney and was reasonably susceptible of such a construction as would tend to injure him in that capacity. (See <em>Kleeberg </em>v. <em>Sipser, </em>265 N. Y. 87; <em>White </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>288 N. Y. 37.) That being so, the statement is actionable as slander per se, without the necessity of pleading special damage. (See <em>Sanderson </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>45 N. Y. 398, 405.)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The cause of action against Dickstein and McCloskey, for trespass, charges that Dickstein entered plaintiff\u2019s law office, apparently for the purpose of serving process upon plaintiff, and that, not finding plaintiff there, he made \u2018 \u2018 violent efforts \u2019 \u2019 to open the doors into the inner offices, forcibly wrenched apart the glass partition into the typists\u2019 room, used abusive and profane language, and threatened plaintiff\u2019s employees Avith jail unless they produced plaintiff. It is additionally alleged that, although he was repeatedly told to leave, he remained until removed by a police officer. A trespass may consist, not only in making an unauthorized entry upon private property, but in refusing to leave after permission to remain has been withdraw. (See Restatement, Torts, \u00a7 158; Prosser on Torts, p. 89.) Consequently, while Dickstein\u2019s original entry may have been lawful \u2014 and quite apart from the effect of the other acts charged to him while on the premises \u2014 the allegations that he refused repeated requests to leave and persisted in remaining there for a not inconsiderable period suffice to charge a trespass by Dickstein. (See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rivers, </em>11 Barb. 390, 397; see, also, <em>People ex rel. Paul </em>v. <em>Warden of City Prison, </em>190 Misc. 528, 529.)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Although there is no showing that McCloskey directed or authorized his deputy Dickstein to go to the lengths alleged in the complaint to effect service, the facts stated are, nevertheless, also adequate for a cause of action in trespass against Dickstein\u2019s superior. By <em>\u201c </em>the common law,\u201d it has been said, \u201c a sheriff is liable in trespass for the acts of his deputy committed in the attempt to execute process, although without his direction or recognition.\u201d <em>(People ex rel. Kellogg </em>v. <em>Schuyler, </em>4 N. Y. 173, 181; see, also, <em>Pond </em>v. <em>Leman, </em>45 Barb. 152.)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Since, then, the complaint does state a cause of action against each of the defendants, it is immune from attack for insufficiency, even though it may contain additional allegations that are inadequate to charge any further cause of action. (See <em>Abrams </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>297 N. Y. 52, 54; <em>Advance Music Corp. </em>v. <em>American Tobacco Co., </em>296 N. Y. 79, 84; <em>Abbey </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>170 N. Y. 122, 127.) Accordingly, we postpone for possible future consideration the question whether other allegedly false statements \u2014 attributed to one or another of defendants \u2014 may be ruled defamatory and slanderous per se, as well as the further question whether the recitals of conspiracy are sufficient to charge each of the defendants with liability for the acts of the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">We might have stopped at this point were it not for plaintiff\u2019s strong and primary insistence upon the prima facie tort doctrine. The trial court, confronted with a voluminous complaint and faced with the task of appraising the impact of a doctrine still in the process of growth, is entitled to a brief expression of our views upon the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">It is plaintiff\u2019s argument that, even if the averments of his complaint do not fall within any one of the .traditional categories of tort, they may be upheld upon the theory that, \u20181 <em>prima facie, </em>the intentional infliction of temporal damage is a cause of action, which * * * requires a justification if the defendant is to escape.\u201d <em>(Aikens </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>195 U. S. 194, 204; see, also, <em>Rochette &amp; Parzini Corp </em>v. <em>Campo, </em>301 N. Y. 228, 232; <em>Advance Music Corp. </em>v. <em>American Tobacco Co., supra, </em>296 N. Y. 79, 84; <em>Opera on Tour, Inc., </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>285 N. Y. 348, 355; Note, 52 Col. L. Rev. 503.) However, whether reliance be placed on that doctrine or- on the related right of action for damage resulting from intentional falsehood (see <em>Al Raschid </em>v. <em>News </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>Syndicate Co., </em>265 N. Y. 1, 3-4; <em>Ratcliffe </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>[1892] 2 Q. B. 524, 527), the allegations of the complaint \u2014 apart from those relating to the particular torts already noted \u2014 are defective in failing to show any actual temporal damage resulting from the false statements or the acts complained of. The recital in the complaint that plaintiff suffered the loss of clients as the result thereof must be rejected as \u201c a mere conclusion or surmise \u201d and may not be regarded as the essential statement of facts giving rise to liability. (See <em>Al Raschid </em>v. <em>News Syndicate Co., supra, </em>265 N. Y. 1, 5.) None of the challenged statements \u2014 putting aside any which does, or may, constitute slander per se \u2014 was such as to be \u201c calculated in the ordinary course of events \u201d to produce the consequence averred. (Cf. <em>Mogul S. S. Co. </em>v. <em>McGregor, Gow &amp; Co., </em>23 Q. B. D. 598, 613, affd. [1892] A. C. 25; <em>Ratcliffe </em>v. <em>Evans, supra, </em>[1892] 2 Q. B. 524, 527.) Moreover, no facts are alleged to show that any clients were on the scene or within hearing when the asserted statements were made. In essence, plaintiff\u2019s plaint is that he has been injured in his reputation. But, except insofar as the facts pleaded amount to actionable defamation \u2014 in which event damage to plaintiff\u2019s reputation would be presumed \u2014 plaintiff has no right of action, unless the complaint makes a showing that actual damage has resulted. That the pleading before us fails to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">However, since the complaint does effectively charge Palmieri with a cause of action in slander and McCloskey and Dickstein with one sounding in trespass, it should not have been dismissed. The judgments dismissing the second amended complaint as against defendants McCloskey and Dickstein should be reversed, and the motion made by those defendants denied. The orders dismissing the second amended complaint as against defendant Palmieri should likewise be reversed, the question certified answered in the affirmative, and the matter remitted to Special Term for further proceedings upon the motion made by that defendant under rules 103, 107 and 90 of the Rules of Civil Practice. Plaintiff should be granted costs in all courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Loughban, Ch. J., Lewis, Conway, Desmond, Dye and Fboessel, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Judgment accordingly. [See 305 N. Y. 924.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
