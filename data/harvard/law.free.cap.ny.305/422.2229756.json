As a matter of law, the court should have dismissed the objections and admitted the will to probate. <em>(Matter of Martin, </em>151 Misc. 94, 243 App. Div. 513; <em>Matter of Hesdra, </em>119 N. Y. 615; <em>Matter of Roge </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>280 N. Y. 268; <em>Matter of Williams, </em>141 N.

The lower court improperly admitted into evidence testimony which was irrelevant and prejudicial. <em>(Waterman </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>11 N. Y. 157; <em>Marx </em>v. <em>McGlynn, </em>88 N. Y. 357; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Keller, </em>205 N. Y. 39; <em>Matter of Putnam, </em>257 N. Y. 140; <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>198 Misc. 645.) III. The lower court should have dismissed the objection as to fraud and directed the jury to disregard all testimony admitted as to fraud before submitting the case to the jury. IV. It was error for the lower court to deny proponent\u2019s motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. V. Due to a trial stenographer\u2019s error or inability, certain material testimony was withheld from the jury, which factor was prejudicial to proponent\u2019s trial. <em>(Metzger </em>v. <em>Cushman\u2019s Sons, </em>243 N. Y. 118; <em>Heibeck </em>v. <em>Hess, </em>228 App. Div. 194; <em>Burd </em>v. <em>Bleischer, </em>208 App. Div. 499; <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Ind. Co. </em>v. <em>Buchanan, </em>200 App. Div. 235.) VI. The court improperly permitted contestants\u2019 attorneys in their summations to make inflammatory per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>sonal remarks concerning proponent and statements which were not in accordance with the evidence; all of which prevented proponent from receiving a fair trial. <em>(Cattano </em>v. <em>Metropolitan St. Ry.

Y. 220; <em>Marden </em>v. <em>Dorthy, </em>160 N. Y. 39.) VIII. There is no credible evidence to refute the testimony of the three witnesses to the will, the signature on the will, the acknowledged signature on various deeds and a check, and the handwriting expert.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b468-5\"><em>Victor Levine, Norman M.

II. There is sufficient evidence from which it can be found that the signature on the disputed paper writing was not genuine or valid. <em>(Marden </em>v. <em>Dorthy, </em>160 N.

On the one hand, there is the testimony of the three attesting witnesses, and of a handwriting expert of thirty years\u2019 experience, supported by the fact that the will leaves testatrix\u2019 estate to her closest Mn, and that its provisions are not unnatural, and are substantially the same as those she had discussed previously with an attorney. On the other hand, there is testimony by two laymen that they were familiar with the handwriting of Mrs. Townsend and that, in their opinion, the signature on the propounded paper was not hers.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The jury tried the issues under a framed order, entered following the filing of contestants\u2019 objections. That order contained six questions relating to (1) execution; (2) publication; (3) whether there were two witnesses; (4) mental competency; (5) freedom from restraint; and (6) fraud, deceit or undue influence. Counsel for both contestants called them \u201c the usual shotgun \u201d objections. During the trial, contestants\u2019 attorneys conceded that there was no real claim of unsoundness of mind, undue influence, or duress, and that \u201c The objections are addressed solely to the execution of the will\u201d, to which the court responded, <em>\u201c </em>Very well.\u201d Thus, all other framed issues were out of the case. Nevertheless, the court thereafter permitted, on the stated ground that it had a bearing on the fraud question, testimony by two of contestants\u2019 witnesses that they would not believe another witness under oath. Nor did the court submit to the jury the issue with respect to execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>as framed, but substituted an issue as to whether the will was \u201c duly executed \u201d, without any instructions as to the meaning of that technical phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Not only does this record contain insufficient proof of fraud, but, by concession, fraud was out of the case. Nevertheless, counsel for the parties tell us that both sides summed up to the jury on a supposed issue of fraud, and we do not know whether the jury\u2019s finding was that Mrs. Townsend was defrauded into signing the will or that she did not sign it at all. A new trial is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The order of the Appellate Division and the decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court should be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Lewis, Ch. J., Conway, Desmond, Dye, Fuld and Froessel, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
