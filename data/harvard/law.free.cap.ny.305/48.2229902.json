Interviewed on September 26th, by Robert P. Johns, executive vice-president and general manager of the corporation, who had apprised him of the possible opening, Crabtree requested a three-year contract at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>$25,000 a year. Explaining that he would he giving up a secure well-paying job to take a position in an entirely new field of endeavor \u2014 which he believed would take him some years to master \u2014 he insisted upon an agreement for a definite term. And he repeated his desire for a contract for three years to Miss Elizabeth Arden, the corporation\u2019s president. When Miss Arden finally indicated that she was prepared to offer a two-year contract, based on an annual salary of $20,000 for the first six months, $25,000 for the second six months and $30,000 for the second year, plus expenses of $5,000 a year for each of those years, Crabtree replied that that offer was <em>11 </em>interesting \u201d. Miss Arden thereupon had her personal secretary make this memorandum on a telephone order blank that happened to be at hand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>Employment Agreement with</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAc\">Nate Cbabtbee Date Sept 26-1947</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">At 681 \u2014 5th Ave 6: PM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">* * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">Begin 20000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">6 months 25000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\">6 \u201c 30000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-12\">5000. \u2014 per year</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-13\">Expense money</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-14\">[ 2 years to make good]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-15\">Arrangement with Mr Crabtree</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFE\">By Miss Arden</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATn\">Present Miss Arden</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeV\">Mr John</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKj\">Mr Crabtree</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ani\">Miss OLeary \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-16\">A few days later, Crabtree \u2019phoned Mr. Johns and telegraphed Miss Arden; he accepted the <em>\u201c </em>invitation to join the Arden organization \u201d, and Miss Arden wired back her \u201c welcome \u201d. When he reported for work, a \u201c pay-roll change \u201d card was made up and initialed by Mr. Johns, and then forwarded to the payroll department. Reciting that it was prepared on September 30, 1947, and was to be effective as of October 22d, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>specified the names of the parties, Crabtree\u2019s \u201cJob Classification \u201d and, in addition, contained the notation that \u201c This employee is to be paid as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">\u201c First six months of employment $20,000. per annum</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHN\">Next six months of employment 25,000. \u201c \u201c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">After one year of employment 30,000. \u201c \u201c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">Approved by EPJ [initialed] \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">After six months of employment, Crabtree received the scheduled increase from $20,000 to $25,000, but the further specified increase at the end of the year was not paid. Both Mr. Johns and the comptroller of the corporation, Mr. Carstens, told Crab-tree that they would attempt to straighten out the matter with Miss Arden, and, with that in mind, the comptroller prepared another <em>11 </em>pay-roll change \u2019 \u2019 card, to which his signature is appended, noting that there was to be a \u201c Salary increase \u201d from $25,000 to $30,000 a year, <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2018 per contractual arrangements with Miss Arden The latter, however, refused to approve the increase and, after further fruitless discussion, plaintiff left defendant\u2019s employ and commenced this action for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">At the ensuing trial, defendant denied the existence of any agreement to employ plaintiff for two years, and further contended that, even if one had been made, the statute of frauds barred its enforcement. The trial court found against defendant on both issues and awarded plaintiff damages of about $14,000, and the Appellate Division, two justices dissenting, affirmed. Since the contract relied upon was not to be performed within a year, the primary question for decision is whether there was a memorandum of its terms, subscribed by defendant, to satisfy the statute of frauds (Personal Property Law, \u00a7 31).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Each of the two payroll cards \u2014 the one initialed by defendant\u2019s general manager, the other signed by its comptroller \u2014 unquestionably constitutes a memorandum under the statute. That they were not prepared or- signed with the intention of evidencing the contract, or that they came into existence subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>quent to its execution, is of no consequence (see <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Cowdin, </em>226 N. Y. 138,145; <em>Spiegel </em>v. <em>Lowenstein, </em>162 App. Div. 443, 448-449; see, also, Restatement, Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 209, 210,. 214); it is enough, to meet the statute\u2019s demands, that they were signed with intent to authenticate the information contained therein and that such information does evidence the terms of the contract. (See <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Cowdin, supra, </em>226 N. Y. 138; <em>Bayles </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>185 N. Y. 582, affg. 104 App. Div. 153; <em>Spiegel </em>v. <em>Lowenstein, supra, </em>162 App. Div. 443, 448; see, also, 2 Corbin on Contracts [1951], pp. 732-733, 763-764; 2 Williston on Contracts [Rev. ed., 1936], pp. 1682-1683.) Those two writings contain all of the essential terms of the contract \u2014 the parties to it, the position that plaintiff was to assume, the salary that he was to receive \u2014 except that relating to the duration of plaintiff\u2019s employment. Accordingly, we must consider whether that item, the length of the contract, may be supplied by reference to the earlier unsigned office memorandum, and, if so, whether its notation, <em>11 2 </em>years to make good \u201d, sufficiently designates a period of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The statute of frauds does not require the <em>\u201c </em>memorandum * * * to be in one document. It may be pieced together out of separate writings, connected with one another either expressly or by the internal evidence of subject matter and occasion \u201d. <em>(Marks </em>v. <em>Cowdin, supra, </em>226 N. Y. 138,145; see, also, 2 Williston, <em>op. cit., </em>p. 1671; Restatement, Contracts, \u00a7 208, subd. [a].) Where each of the separate writings has been subscribed by the party to be charged, little if any difficulty is encountered. (See, e.g., <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Cowdin, supra, </em>226 N. Y. 138, 144-145.) Where, however, some writings have been signed, and others have not \u2014 as in the case before us \u2014 there is basic disagreement as to what constitutes a sufficient connection permitting the unsigned papers to be considered as part of the statutory memorandum. The courts of some jurisdictions insist that there be a reference, of varying degrees of specificity, in the signed writing to that unsigned, and, if there is no such reference, they refuse to permit consideration of the latter in determining whether the memorandum satisfies the statute. (See, e.g., <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>19 Conn. 63; <em>Hewitt Grain &amp; Provision Co. </em>v. <em>Spear, </em>222 Mich. 608.) That conclusion is based upon a construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>tian of the statute which requires that the connection between the writings and defendant\u2019s acknowledgment of the one not subscribed, appear from examination of the papers alone, without the aid of paroi evidence. The other position \u2014 which has gained increasing support over the years \u2014 is that a sufficient connection between the papers is established simply by a reference in them to the same subject matter or transaction. (See, e.g., <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Alward, </em>176 Cal. 691; <em>Lerned </em>v. <em>Wannemacher, </em>91 Mass. 412.) The statute is not pressed \u201c to the extreme of a literal and rigid logic \u201d <em>(Marks </em>v. <em>Cowdin, supra, </em>226 N. Y. 138, 144), and oral testimony is admitted to show the connection between the documents and to establish the acquiescence, of the party to be charged, to the contents of the one unsigned. (See <em>Beckwith </em>v. <em>Talbot, 95 </em>U. S. 289; <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Hunting, </em>44 Ch. D. 205, 208-209; see, also, 2 Corbin, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 512-518; cf. Restatement, Contracts, \u00a7 208, subd. [b], par. [iii].)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The view last expressed impresses us as the more sound, and, indeed \u2014 although several of our cases appear to have gone the other way (see, e.g., <em>Newbery </em>v. <em>Wall, </em>65 N. Y. 484; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Lewiston Mill Co., </em>150 N. Y. 314) \u2014 this court has on a number of occasions approved the rule, and we now definitively adopt it, permitting the signed and unsigned writings \u201e to be read together, provided that they clearly refer to the same subject matter or transaction. (See, e.g., <em>Peabody </em>v. <em>Speyers, </em>56 N. Y. 230; <em>Raubitschek </em>v. <em>Blank, </em>80 N. Y. 478; <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Vandemark, 99 </em>N. Y. 29; <em>Coe </em>v. <em>Tough, </em>116 N. Y. 273; <em>Delaware Mills </em>v. <em>Carpenter Bros., </em>235 N. Y. 537, affg. 200 App. Div. 324.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The language of the statute \u2014 \u2018 \u2018 Every agreement * \u00ae * is void, unless =\": * * some note or memorandum thereof be in writing, and subscribed by the party to be charged (Personal Property Law, \u00a7 31) \u2014 does not impose the requirement that the signed acknowledgment of the contract must appear from the writings alone, unaided by oral testimony. The danger of fraud and perjury, generally attendant upon the admission of paroi evidence, is at a minimum in a case such as this. None of the terms of the contract are supplied by paroi. All of them must be set out in the vari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>pus writings presented to the court, and at least one writing, the one establishing a contractual relationship between the parties, must bear the signature of the party to be charged, while the unsigned document must on its face refer to the same transaction as that set forth in the one that was signed. Parol evidence \u2014 to portray the circumstances surrounding the making of the memorandum \u2014 serves only to connect the separate documents and to show that there was assent, by the party to be charged, to the contents of the one unsigned. If that testimony does not convincingly connect the papers, or does not show assent to the unsigned paper, it is within the province of the judge to conclude, as a matter of law, that the statute has not been satisfied. True, the possibility still remains that, by fraud or perjury, an agreement never in fact made may occasionally be enforced under the subject matter or transaction test. It is better to run that risk, though, than to deny enforcement to all agreements, merely because the signed document made no specific mention of the unsigned writing. As the United States Supreme Court declared, in sanctioning the admission of paroi evidence to establish the connection between the signed and unsigned writings. <em>\u201c </em>There may be cases in which it would be a violation of reason and common sense to ignore a reference which derives its significance from such [paroi] proof. If there is ground for any doubt in the matter, the general rule should be enforced. But where there is no ground for doubt, its enforcement would aid, instead of discouraging, fraud.\u201d <em>(Beckwith, </em>v. <em>Talbot, supra, </em>95 U. S. 289, 292; see, also, <em>Raubitschek </em>v. <em>Blank, supra, </em>80 N. Y. 478; <em>Freeland </em>v. <em>Rits, </em>154 Mass. 257, 259; <em>Gall </em>v. <em>Brashier, </em>169 F. 2d 704, 708-709; 2 Corbin, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 512, and cases there cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u2022 Turning to the writings in the case before us \u2014 the unsigned office memo, the payroll change form initialed by the general manager Johns, and the paper signed by the comptroller Carstens \u2014 it is apparent, and most patently, that all three refer on their face to the same transaction. The parties, the position to be filled by plaintiff, the salary to be paid him, are all identically set forth; it is hardly possible that such detailed information could refer to another or a different agreement. Even more, the card signed by Carstens notes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>that it was prepared for the purpose of a \u201c Salary increase per contractual arrangements with Miss Arden \u201d. That certainly constitutes a reference of sorts to a more comprehensive \u201c arrangement,\u201d and paroi is permissible to furnish the explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The corroborative evidence of defendant\u2019s assent to the contents of the unsigned office memorandum is also convincing. Prepared by defendant\u2019s agent, Miss Arden\u2019s personal secretary, there is little likelihood that that paper was fraudulently manufactured or that defendant had not assented to its contents. Furthermore, the evidence as to the conduct of the parties at the time it was prepared persuasively demonstrates defendant\u2019s assent to its terms. Under such circumstances, the courts below were fully justified in finding that the three papers constituted the <em>\u201c </em>memorandum \u201d of their agreement within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Nor can there be any doubt that the memorandum contains all of the essential terms of the contract. (See <em>N. E. D. Holding Co. </em>v. <em>McKinley, </em>246 N. Y. 40; <em>Friedman &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>255 N. Y. 340.) Only one term, the length of the employment, is in dispute. The September 26th office memorandum contains the notation, \u201c 2 years to make good What purpose, other than to denote the length of the contract term, such a notation could have, is hard to imagine. Without it, the employment would be at will (see <em>Martin </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>148 N. Y. 117, 121), and its inclusion may not be treated as meaningless or purposeless. Quite obviously, as the courts below decided, the phrase signifies that the parties agreed to a term, a certain and definite term, of two years, after which, if plaintiff did not \u201c make good \u201d, he would be subject to discharge. And examination of other parts of the memorandum supports that construction. Throughout the writings, a scale of wages, increasing plaintiff\u2019s salary periodically, is set out; that type of arrangement is hardly consistent with the hypothesis that the employment was meant to be at will. The most that may be argued from defendant\u2019s standpoint is that \u201c 2 years to make good \u201d, is a cryptic and ambiguous statement. But, in such a case, paroi evidence is admissible to explain its meaning. (See <em>Martocci </em>v. <em>Greater New York Brewery, </em>301 N. Y. 57, 63; <em>Marks </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>v. <em>Cowdin, supra, </em>226 N. Y. 138, 143-144; 2 Williston, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 576; 2 Corbin, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 527.) Having in mind the relations of the parties, the course of the negotiations and plaintiff\u2019s insistence upon security of employment, the purpose of the phrase \u2014 or so the trier of the facts was warranted in finding \u2014 was to. grant plaintiff the tenure he desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Loughran, Ch. J., Lewis, Conway, Desmond, Dye and Froessel, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-11\">.
