The chancellor being of opinion that the proofs satisfactorily sustain the allegations of the plaintiff, that the several deeds in the decree mentioned are fraudulent and void, as against the claim of the plaintiff, and that the said return to the said <em>fieri facias, </em>and the deeds from the said sheriff, are sufficiently certain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-6\">From this decree the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-7\">The cause was argued before Buchanan, C.

That the allegations of fraud in the bill are denied by the answers, and are not sustained by the proof taken in the cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-10\">2nd. That the deed from <em>Nathan Waters </em>to <em>Nathan J. Waters </em>and <em>Samuel Ratcliffe, </em>conveys a part of a tract of land called <em>\u201cParcel </em>Enlarged,\u201d and a parcel of land called <em>\"Beck\u2019s </em>Addition,\u201d which are not included either in the return to the writs of fieri facias, venditioni exponas, or deed from the sheriff to the appellee, and that the decree of the Chancellor is at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>least erroneous so far as it vacates said deed in reference to those parcels of land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-5\">3rd. That there is no allegation in the bill, or amended bill, that <em>Nathan Waters </em>had not sufficient property to pay his debts, independent of the land called \u201cFriendship\u201d conveyed by <em>Philip Snowden </em>to the appellant, <em>Nathan J. Waters, </em>in 1823, and that the Chancellor therefore erred in vacating that deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-6\">4th. That <em>Nathan Waters </em>never had title to the parcel of land called \u201cFriendship,\u201d and that he had other property more than sufficient to pay his debts. It will therefore be insisted, that the decree of the Chancellor must be reversed so far as it vacates the deed of said land from <em>Philip Snowden </em>to said <em>Nathan J. Waters.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-7\">5th. That the decree of the Chancellor (if it can bear that construction) must <em>be </em>reversed so far at least as it <em>vacates the </em>deed from <em>Nathan Waters </em>to <em>N. J. Waters </em>and <em>S. Ratcliffe, </em>in reference to any portion of property not purchased by the appellee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-8\">6th. It will be insisted, that the appellee derived no title under the sale made by the sheriff in this case, and consequently had no interest in the lands conveyed in the deeds mentioned in the Chancellor\u2019s decree, and that said decree is therefore erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-9\">7th. That the sheriff\u2019s return to the writ of fieri facias does not describe the property levied on with sufficient certainty <em>to </em>pass any title to the appellee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-10\">8th. That the writs of venditioni exponas, and the return of the sale to the appellee made by the sheriff to the last of said writs, does not sufficiently describe the property to pass any title to the appellee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-11\">9th. That the deed from the sheriff to the appellee, dated in 1835, is inoperative and inadmissible in evidence for any purpose, and does not cure the defects in the returns to the writs of fieri facias, and venditioni exponas.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-12\">10th. That although the sheriff may, by his return to a venditioni exponas, or by a deed executed in due time, <em>amend </em>his return to the fieri facias, that he will not be permitted ei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>iher by his return to the venditioni exponas or deed, to <em>contradict </em>his return to the fieri facias.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-5\">11th. That the sheriff in making a sale is to be considered as an officer of the law, or as the agent of the parties, and in either view, that his declarations can only be admissible when they are a part of the \u201cres <em>gestes\u201d </em>and that his deed of 1835, after he ceased to be sheriff, and after his agency in reference to the sale had terminated, cannot be received as admissible evidence in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-6\">12th. That the sale made in this case is invalid, because the property sold consisted of various distinct parcels of land \u2022distant from each other, and were at the instance of the purchaser and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, sold in mass, and for less than one-fifth their value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-7\">13th. The appellants will rely upon the objections in the record to the admissibility of the proof taken by appellee under the commissions returned in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-8\">14th. It will be insisted, that no admission made by the adult defendants in their answers, can affect the minor defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-9\">15th. That the appellee was not a creditor of <em>Nathan Wa</em>ters, and that it was not competent for him to file the bill in this case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b51-10\">By T. F. Bowie and R. Johnson for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGc\">who contended that the evidence in this cause proves\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-11\">1st. That the deed from <em>Nathan Waters, </em>to his son <em>Nathan J. Waters </em>and his son-in-law <em>Samuel Ratcliffe, </em>dated 17th February, 1824, was made without any valuable consideration. That said <em>Nathan Waters </em>was indebted at the time of its execution, and that said deed was made with the view to hinder and delay the creditors of the said grantor, or to evade the payment of his debts, and is therefore fraudulent and void as against his creditors, as well as those who were creditors at the time of its execution, as against his subsequent creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-12\">2nd. That the deeds of partition between <em>Nathan J. Waters </em>and <em>Samuel Ratcliffe </em>(grantees in the first deed) of the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>property among themselves in severalty, dated 24th August,\u00bb 1825, were executed in furtherance of said fraudulent intent,\u00bb and are therefore void as against the said creditors of <em>Nathan Waters, </em>the' original grantor..</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-5\">3rd. That the deed from <em>Philip Snowden/ </em>to <em>Nathan J. Waters, </em>dated 9th June 1823, for the tract of land called <em>\u201cFriend</em>ship,\u201d was executed without any valuable consideration being paid for the same by the grantee therein, <em>Nathan J. Waters/' </em>but was made by the said <em>Philip </em>at the instance and by the procurement of the said <em>Nathan Waters, </em>who had before that time purchased the said land from' the said <em>Philip, </em>and paid' the purchase money for the same; and that said <em>Nathan Waters' </em>procured its conveyance to his son <em>Nathan J. Waters, </em>the grantee therein, for the purpose and with <em>the view of </em>cheating and' defrauding his creditors, and that therefore said deed is void as against said creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-6\">4th. That the lands or a greater part of them, embraced in the foregoing fraudulent deeds, were levied on, and sold by the sheriff on the 30th- December, 1826, as the property of said <em>Nathan Waters, </em>under a judgment rendered at April term-, 1824, of <em>Prince George\u2019s </em>county court, at the suit of <em>Samuel Peach, </em>who was a creditor of the said <em>Nathan Waters </em>at the time of the execution and delivery of all of said deeds, and whose suit to recover his said debt was actually pending at the time of the execution- of the said deeds of the 17th February 1824, and 9th June, 1823. That the appellee became the purchaser at the said sheriff\u2019s sale, of a portion of the lands embraced in said deeds, and claims title thereto under and by virtue of said sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-7\">5th. The appellee relies on the judgment of <em>Peach, </em>and all the proceedings thereunder, including the fieri facias, venditioni exponas, and the sheriff\u2019s return thereto, and his two several deed's, the one bearing date the 11th October, 1827, and the-other on the 18th June, 1835, as sufficient evidence of said sale, and sufficiently descriptive of the lands sold, as to vest the title in him to the several tracts of land embraced in the-said deeds and sheriff\u2019s returns. That being so entitled, this-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>court will remove the obstructions in the way of his recovering possession of them at law, by affirming the Chancellor\u2019s decree cancelling the deeds fraudulently conveying said lands-to the appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-4\">6th. If the appellee is entitled to any of the lands embraced in said fraudulent deeds by virtue of the sale made by the sheriff, the decree ought to be affirmed, because if said deeds were void as against the appellee\u2019s title, they are equally so as against all other creditors of said <em>Nathan Waters, </em>whose rights should be protected by the decree,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b53-5\">Stephen, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AF\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Under the views which we have taken of this case, we do-not deem it necessary to decide many of the questions which were argued by the counsel for the respective parties before this court. Whether the proof establishes the fraudulent character of the deeds, so far as the rights of creditors were concerned, and whether they ought to have been declared void absolutely and totally by the court below, or only partially, so far as the rights of the appellee were concerned; whether the appellee as a purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale, was clothed with all the rights of the plaintiff as a creditor, and therefore entitled-to impeach the deeds on the ground of fraud \u2014 are questions not necessary to be decided, because, upon the best consideration we have been able to give the case, we do not think he has shown himself to have such a standing in court, as to be entitled to call for a decision upon such questions. His right to impeach the deeds as fraudulent, must be founded upon the fact, that he has obtained a valid title to the several tracts or parcels of land, or some one of them, contained in the deeds: as a purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and that the deeds, if not set aside, will operate to the prejudice of such title, and deprive him of the fruits of his purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The first question therefore which presents itself is, has he acquired such a title? and, after a careful examination of all the proofs in the cause, we have come to the conclusion that he has not. The second <em>fieri facias </em>was the effective writ., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>under which the <em>venditioni exponas </em>issued, by the command of which the sale was made. To that writ the sheriff made a return, that he had seized the following tracts, or parts of tracts of land, to wit; \u201cone tract of land called <em>Pasture Enlarged, </em>containing 200 acres; one tract of land called <em>Osbourn\u2019s Lot and part of Pleasant Grove, </em>containing 52 acres; <em>Part of Duvall\u2019s Pleasure, </em>containing 150 acres; part of <em>Tukesbury, </em>containing 50 acres; part of <em>Tukesbury </em>and <em>Walker\u2019s Delight; </em>and part of a tract of land called <em>Friendship, </em>containing 180 acres. The return to the venditioni exponas states the sale of the following tracts, or parts of tracts of land; that is to say\u2014 one tract of land called <em>Pasture Enlarged, containing 200 </em>acres; one tract of land called <em>Osbourn\u2019s Lot </em>and part of <em>Pleasant Grove, </em>containing 50 acres; one tract of land called <em>Duvall\u2019s Purchase, </em>or <em>Part of Duvall\u2019s Purchase, </em>containing 150 acres; one tract of land called <em>Tukesbury </em>and <em>Part of Tukesbury </em>and <em>Walker\u2019s Delight, </em>containing 150 acres; and one tract of land called <em>Friendship, </em>containing 180 acres. In the first deed of the sheriff, executed in 1827, the lands are described to be, one tract of land called <em>Pasture Enlarged, </em>containing 200 acres; one tract of land called <em>Osbourn\u2019s Lot </em>and part of <em>Pleasant Grove, </em>containing 52 acres; one tract of land called <em>Duvall\u2019s Pleasure </em>or <em>Part of Duvall\u2019s Pleasure, </em>containing 150 acres; one tract of land called <em>Tukesbury </em>and <em>Part of Tukesbury </em>and <em>Walker\u2019s Delight, </em>containing 150 acres, and a tract of land called <em>Friendship, </em>containing 108 acres. In the deed of 1835, executed by the sheriff, the lands conveyed are described to be, tracts of land called <em>Pasture Enlarged, Osbourn\u2019s Lot </em>and <em>Pleasant Grove, Duvall\u2019s Pleasure, Tukesbury </em>and <em>Walker\u2019s Delight, </em>and <em>Friendship. </em>The deed of the 17th of February 1824, from <em>Nathan Waters </em>to his son <em>Nathan J. Waters </em>and <em>Samuel Ratcliffe, </em>which is impeached as fraudulent, conveys to them the following tracts or parts of tracts of land, to wit; \u201cAll that part of a tract or parcel of land, lying and being in the county and state aforesaid, called the <em>Pleasant Grove, </em>whereon <em>William Beck </em>and <em>Richard Toogood </em>now live, containing 259 acres and f- of an acre, more or less; also, all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>that tract or parcel of land lying in the county and state aforesaid, called <em>Walker\u2019s </em>Delight, containing 100 acres of land, more or less; likewise all that part of a tract or parcel of land lying in the county aforesaid, called Friendship, containing 103 acres, more or less; also, parts of three other tracts of land, called <em>Osbourn\u2019s Lot, Beck\u2019s Addition, </em>and the <em>Parcel Enlarged, </em>containing 276 acres, more or less. The deed from <em>Snow-den </em>to <em>Nathan J. Waters, </em>made in 1823, is for the tract of land called <em>Friendship. </em>These are the deeds which the complainant charges in his bill to be fraudulent, and which he seeks to set aside upon that ground. To entitle himself to impeach those deeds, or either of them, upon the ground of fraud, it is incumbent upon him to show that he became the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and thereby acquired a valid title to the lands therein mentioned, or to some one tract or part of a tract, conveyed by them to the grantees therein named. This we think upon a careful examination of the deeds, and the executions and returns made by the sheriff, he has failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">It seems to be a principle well established, not only by the decisions of this State, but by those of our sister States, and by the laws of <em>England, </em>that, to enable the sheriff to sell, and vest in a purchaser at his sale a valid title, a seizure of the land sold is indispensable, and that without a valid seizure, no title can be acquired by a purchaser at his sale. Upon adverting to the return made to the second <em>fieri facias </em>it will be found, that the land called <em>Friendship, </em>is the only land embraced in the deeds alleged to be fraudulent, upon which the sherifflevied under that writ, and to sell which, the venditioni exponas issued, under which the sale was made. By that return it appears, that he levied upon only a part of that tract, without any description in the return of the part so levied upon; and that a sale made under such a seizure, without a specific description of the land sold, would be void, it is deemed unnecessary to cite authorities to prove. Had the sale therefore been made under the <em>fieri facias, </em>it would have been elearly void, and the purchaser would have acquired no title. But no sale having been made under the <em>fieri </em>facias, a <em>venditioni ex-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>ponas </em>was issued, commanding him to sell the land seized, under that writ, and under the <em>venditioni exponas </em>the sale in question was made. To the last mentioned-writ he returned, that he had sold not a part only of that tract stated to have been seized in his return to the <em>fieri facias, </em>but the whole of it; and the question is; whether such a return, made to the <em>venditioni exponas, </em>cures the defect of uncertainty in the seizure, and vests a valid title in the purchaser to the whole of that tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">It is true this court have decided, in 1 <em>Gill &amp; John. </em>443, that a purchaser at a sheriff\u2019s sale is entitled to the benefit of that officer\u2019s return, both to the <em>fieri facias </em>and <em>venditioni ex-ponas, </em>and when the description of the subject levied on, according to the schedule returned under the first writ, is defective, it may be amended and rendered certain, by the return of the sheriff\u2019s proceedings under the second writ; but in that case it will be found, that the return to the <em>venditioni exponas </em>describes the land sold by metes and bounds, thereby rendering certain the land which had been seized under the <em>fieri facias, </em>and states it to be the same land which had been seized under that writ; and this, it is believed, is the utmost extent to which this court has gone in giving validity and effect to such a defective seizure. But in this case, the sheriff states that he had sold the whole tract, and it not appearing by the return of the sale, what part of the entire tract sold, had been seized under the first writ, the whole sale was necessarily void for uncertainty; and this defect, it will be found, is not cured or remedied by any of the deeds executed by the sheriff to the purchaser, for they are obnoxious to the same objection as the return to the <em>venditioni exponas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">In 2 <em>Harr. &amp; Gill, </em>345, this court has said, a sheriff cannot sell what has not been levied upon; and in 2 <em>Bacon\u2019s Abr. Tit. Execution, letter </em>N., it is said, the sheriff must actually seize the property on a <em>fieri facias, </em>before he can sell; and that a valid seizure is essential to the title of the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale. See also 2 <em>Baley\u2019s Rep. </em>361, where the principle is stated to be, that a levy made after the <em>term </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>which an execution is returnable is void, and vests no title in the sheriff or his vendee. The same principle is stated as law in 2 <em>Tidd\u2019s Practice </em>1046, where it is said, the goods being once seized, and in custody of the law, they cannot be seized again by the same or another sheriff, and if they were seized under a second execution, and sold thereon, the bargain would be void. In support of this principle <em>Tidd </em>referred to a decision of <em>J. Holt, </em>to be found in <em>Shower\u2019s Reports, </em>174. The ground of the decision is, that the second seizure would be void, the goods being in the custody of the law, and being void, the sheriff would have no authority to sell, and of course the purchaser could acquire no title at his sale. These cases we think satisfactorily establish the doctrine laid down by this court, in 2 <em>Harr. 8r Gill </em>above referred to, that unless there be a valid seizure, a purchaser at a sheriff\u2019s sale can acquire no title. It was not the intention of this court to impugn or call in question this principle, in the case of <em>Estep and Hall\u2019s Lessee, vs. Weems, </em>6 <em>Gill and John. </em>303. In that case it was only intended to decide, that it was not incumbent upon the purchaser to prove a legal seizure to entitle him to recover in an action of ejectment; he had a good title <em>prama facie, </em>without such proof on his part, to enable him to support his action; and if the language of the opinion in that case, is broad and general enough to carry the principle to a greater extent, it must be understood to be limited to the proof, which it was incumbent upon the purchaser to make in the first instance, to entitle him to recover. With this necessary qualification, the terms used ought to be understood. The tract of land called <em>Friendship, </em>being the only land embraced in the deeds impeached as fraudulent in this case, corresponding in name with those levied on by the sheriff, and the seizure having been only of a part of that tract, without defining the part so seized, and there being nothing in the sheriff\u2019s deeds or return of the sale made of that land, under the <em>venditioni exponas, </em>to cure such defective seizure, it follows as a necessary consequence, that the complainant acquired no title at that sale, to any land which was affected or prejudiced by such deeds, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>that he had no standing in the court to impeach or call their validity in question. If we are correct on these views, it necessarily follows, that the decree below sitting them aside as fraudulent and void, so far as his interest was affected by them,, was erroneous, and that the same must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">DECREE REVERSED WITH COSTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
