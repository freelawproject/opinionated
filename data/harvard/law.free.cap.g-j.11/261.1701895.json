It is thereupon on motion of the plaintiff by <em>Daniel Weisel </em>and <em>William Schley </em>his attornies ruled, that the defendants shew cause by the first day of the next term, at the opening of the court, why the said plaintiff shall not be permitted to amend the <em>scire facias </em>aforesaid, byreciting said original judgment, according to the fact, so as to make the same conform to said record, in reciting the same as obtained against <em>James Prather </em>and <em>Elie </em>Prather.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-5\">At November term 1836, the defendants showed cause against said rule, and insisted, that the <em>sci.fac. </em>was-not amendable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-6\">1st. Because the directions given by the attorney for the plaintiff to the deputy clerk, as set forth in the suggestion on which said rule was founded, were to issue a <em>scire facias </em>on-the judgment as No 112 trials at November term 1822, against the <em>terre tenants </em>of <em>James Prather </em>generally, without naming, or giving any directions as to the <em>terre tenants </em>of <em>Elie </em>Prather, were erroneous directions by said attorney, the judgment on which the said <em>scire facias </em>was issued, being a <em>joint </em>judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>and the direciion being to issue a <em>several scire facias </em>on said judgment, and the error was that of the party by his attorney, and was not the mere inadvertence, misapprehension of the law, nor mere mistake of the deputy clerk named in the said suggestion, as set forth in the said suggestion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-5\">2nd. Because a <em>scire facias </em>is an original proceeding, the bringing of a new suit or action, and there is no <em>titling, </em>nor any writing filed with the clerk at the suing out of the said <em>scire facias, </em>by which the same may be amended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-6\">3rd. Because the said <em>scire facias </em>if amended, as suggested by the plaintiff, would show error in this, that the proper <em>scire facias </em>had not been issued, as the said amended <em>scire facias; </em>would recite a joint judgment againt <em>James Prather </em>and <em>Elie Prather, </em>on which the same issued, when the said <em>scire facias </em>does not require the same to be made known, to the <em>terre tenants </em>of <em>James Prather </em>and <em>Elie Prather, </em>but to the <em>terre tenants </em>of <em>James Prather </em>alone, which said error is an error at law, and not amendable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-7\">4th. Because the <em>scire facias </em>aforesaid, did not require it to be, and it was not made known to the defendants, that there was a joint judgment against James <em>Prather </em>and <em>Elie Prather.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-8\">5th. Because the attornies for the said defendants, offered to enter the plea of <em>mil tiel record, </em>to the said <em>scire facias, </em>before the motion was made for the said rule, by the plaintiff, by his attornies, as appears by the suggestion aforesaid, and which said plea was rejected by court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-9\">6th. Because the said judgment, if not revived by means of the said <em>scire facias, </em>against the said defendant, would not be good and pleadable, nor admitted in evidence, against these defendants, the said judgment being of more than twelve years standing, if these defendants availed themselves of a certain act of Assembly of the then province, now State of <em>Maryland, </em>made at a session of Assembly held at the city of <em>Annapolis, </em>the 26th day of April, in the year 1715, entitled, an act for limitation of certain actions for avoiding suits at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-10\">Upon consideration of the rule aforesaid, and the objections thereto, the county court authorised the plaintiff to amend his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>\u00a1scire facias, </em>so as to recite a judgment against <em>J. 8f E. Prather, </em>and a command to serve it upon the <em>terre tenants </em>of both defendants. A new writ was inserted at length, and the record amended as prayed \u2014 tested the 23rd November 1836, and marked, issued as of that day, which dates however were corrected by consent of counsel in this court, to correspond with the dates of original writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-5\">To this amended writ, the defendants, <em>terre tenants </em>of <em>James Prather, </em>demurred generally, and the plaintiff joined in the demurrer. The county court awarded <em>a fiat </em>in conformity to the return to the original writ, and the <em>terre tenants </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-6\">The cause was argued before Archer, Dorsey, and Chambers, J.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b273-7\">By Tidball for the appellants, who cited</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APd\">2 <em>Sellon\u2019s Prac. </em>456, 457. 2 <em>D. </em>&amp; <em>E. </em>45. 2 <em>Lord Rayd. </em>1057. 2 <em>Tidd. </em>1008. <em>Hawkins vs. Bowie, 9 G. &amp; J. </em>428. 1 <em>Salk. </em>52. 2 <em>Tidd. </em>1158. 2 <em>Saund. </em>72, <em>page p.

It states, that a judgment had been recovered by the plaintiff, against two defendants, and that it remained unexecuted, and on the authority of this state of facts, proceeds against the <em>terre tenants </em>of one of those defendants, as the proper persons, against whom alone, to- enforce the execution of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">No suggestion is made of the -death of the original defendants, or either of them; and they must be presumed therefore to be in full life, and if alive, were necessary parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The principle upon which an original party to the judgment if living, or his representative after his death, is to be made a party to a <em>scire </em>facias, is not that of contribution, as amongst different <em>terre tenants. </em>Neither the original defendant- or his heir, could claim contribution from <em>terre tenants; </em>but they are regarded as the persons most competent to know, and to prove the satisfaction of the judgment. We think the appellants might well demur to this <em>scire facias, </em>as manifestly insufficient on its face, to authorise the plaintiff to enforce his execution against them alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">It is altogether unlike the case of a <em>terre tenant, </em>who is charged without naming other <em>terre tenants, </em>who ought to be made co-defendants. In such a case, the proceedings on their face, disclose-the fact, that the defendant proceeded against is liaable; but they do not show, that other persons are also liable, and the facts and circumstances upon- which- the obligation to share the liability is- supposed to depend, must necessarily be brought to the notice-of the court by plea; and this plea, must be in abatement, because it is not to discharge the defendant entirely, but only to lessen the amount of his responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">No additional amendment could now be made to give to the writ a legal form; and in no event, could the appellee be enabled to recover in this oase, if it were returned to the court-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>mi Washington </em>county, therefore we deem it unnecessary to .order a procedendo.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, AND JUDGMENT EOR APPELLANTS WITH COSTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
