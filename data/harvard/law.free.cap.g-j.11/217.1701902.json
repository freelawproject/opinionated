They gave him a bond of conveyance in 1813, agreeing to put him in possession in 1814, <em>and upon payment of the whole purchase money to mu,he him a conveyance,. </em>Possession was accordingly delivered to M. who immediately assigned tho bond of conveyance to his two daughters E. and G. for the payment of .*\u00a153000, and then to his endorsers on the notes given for the purchase money of tho land, for their indemnity. In 1820, M. became insolvent and petitioned for relief, in bis schedule he referred to bis debt duo the executors of P., and tho land bought from them, <em>as subject to alien, </em>and conveyed all his estate to a trustee appointed for the benefit of his creditors. In 1821 the executors obtained judgment at law against M. alone, for the purchase money; this not being paid, an ejectment was brought for tho land, by the heirs at law of P., to compel payment, which was ultimately abandoned. And after this, tho trustee of M., the insolvent debtor, who had held the land from 1823 to 1831, <em>acting in that char, acter, </em>sold and conveyed it to C. tho defendant. In 1836, the surviving ox. ecutor filed his bill against C. and tho trustee of M., for a re-sale and pay. ment of the balance of the purchase money. <em>Held-.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>1.

J.,) on bond being filed, awarded an injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-10\">At March 1838, the complainant amended his bill, and dismissed it, as to the heirs of <em>David Peter, </em>alleging they were not necessary and proper parties. And also, as to <em>Lloyd Magruder, </em>alleging that he had no participation in the sale by <em>G. B. M. </em>to <em>J. A. Carter; </em>that <em>G. B. M. </em>resides out of the jurisdiction of this court, and prayed publication against him as a non-resident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-11\"><em>J. A. Carter </em>answered the bill, admitting the will of <em>D. P., </em>the death of two of his executors, the bond of conveyance to <em>G. M. </em>\u2014 no knowledge \u201cof any, if any lien, which the complainant ever had on said land.\u201d That a suit at law for said land, by the heirs and widow of <em>D. P. </em>was brought and abandoned, or <em>non-prossed </em>by the plaintiffs; that this suit terminated in 1834, and before the land was purchased by this defendant; that he bought, supposing the title of <em>G. M. </em>no longer doubtful; that possession had been in <em>G. M. </em>and his trustee, since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>1813, and more than twenty years receiving rents and profits, before the filing of this bill of complaint; which gives defendant a legal title, whether the said <em>G. M. </em>or his trustee ever obtained a title or not, and he pleads and relies on said long continued possession, and to have the full benefit thereof; that he purchased the said land from the trustee, who was then in possession. The answer admitted the insolvency of G.M.; that <em>G. M. </em>gave his notes for the purchase money; that those notes are barred by limitations before filing of the bill, on which he also relies; that the defendant purchased the land at public sale from <em>G. B. M., </em>after public notice of such sale on the 20th December 1834; that he was the highest bidder, and bid $1,980, which was more than any other person offered; and as much as this defendant believes it to be worth; that he has paid the purchase money, and received a deed, herewith filed, without notice of the pretended claim of the complainant; that complainant had notice of the sale under which defendant bought, and gave no notice of his lien. And cannot therefore, now in equity disturb defendant; that letters of administration were granted on estate of <em>G. M.; </em>that damages paid by the canal company, were paid to <em>G. B. M., </em>and not to this defendant; that he is advised that the will of D. P., did not authorize a sale by his executors, and that their pretended sale is not valid, and could give no right to the purchase money. Sale of wood and timber, denied since the filing of the bill; had sold some previously, not anticipating his title would be questioned by any one; he kept no account of it, and is therefore unable to say how much he sold or received; that none has been cut since the injunction was issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-5\">With this answer was filed the conveyance from <em>G. B. M. </em>to <em>J. A. </em>C., of 23rd March 1835, recting and referring to the conveyance.of 5th August 1820 from <em>G. M. </em>to <em>G. B. M., </em>and that it was in trust for the benefit of creditors; also the notice of sale by <em>G. B. M. </em>as \u201cby virtue of a deed of trust\u201d\u2014 and letters to <em>G. B. Magruder </em>as administrator of <em>G. M., </em>dated 18th November 1823.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-6\"><em>G, B. M. </em>also answered the bill substantially as his co-de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>fendant had answered, and that the sale made to him was fairly and <em>bona fide </em>made, and that <em>G. M. </em>was solvent for a long period after his purchase of the executors, and could have paid if required.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-5\">A commission was executed and various proofs taken, which are sufficiently stated in the opinion of the county court and of this court, and at December term 1839, the county court (Dorsey, C. J. and Brewer, A. J.,) passed the following decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-6\">\u201cThe object of the bill is, to enforce an equitable lien for the balance of the purchase money of a tract of land, sold by the executors of <em>David Peter, </em>under a supposed power in his will, to a certain <em>George Magruder. David Peter </em>died in 1812, having made a will, which his executors, <em>Sarah Peter, George Peter </em>the complainant, and <em>Leonard H. Johns, </em>construed as giving them the power sell a certain tract of land, called in will, the land on which <em>Dulin </em>lives, for the payment of his debts, and they accordingly advertised the said land, containing about 2,043\u00a7 acres, for public sale, on the 7th June 1813, and at that sale <em>George Magruder </em>became the purchaser, for the sum of $20,687.90, it being $10.50 per acre, payable as stated in the bond of conveyance, and possession of the land was delivered to him. On 10th July 1820, the notes for the two-thirds of the purchase money, not being paid, <em>George Magruder </em>petitioned the circuit court in the <em>District of Columbia, </em>for the benefit of the insolvent laws, andin pursuance thereof,, on the 5th August 1820, and by deed recorded also in <em>Montgomery </em>county, conveyed all his property to the defendant, <em>George B. Magruder, </em>who was appointed his trustee, and took possession among the rest of the land in dispute. In his schedule he returns this land (called <em>Cardirock) </em>valued at $40,880, on which he states there is a lien of about $16,000, and returns <em>David Peter's </em>executors, as his creditors, for $14,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-7\">All the residue of his property returned, (not mortgaged for more than its value,) amounts to little upwards of $4,000, which appears to be more than quadrupled by claims not appearing to be otherwise secured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>When suits were brought on these notes given for the purchase money does not appear, but judgments were obtained at March term 1821 of <em>Montgomery </em>county court, against G, <em>Mi </em>Subject of course to his discharge under the insolvent law, upon which <em>fieri facias </em>were issued, and returned <em>nulla bona.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-5\">An <em>ejectment </em>was subsequently instituted by the devisees of* <em>David Peter </em>against the trustee, <em>George B. Magruder, </em>probably at the instance of the executors, as it may be inferred from the testimony, to compel a paj ment of the residue of the purchase money, in which suit the plaintiff recovered in the county court; but the Court of Appeals in 1832, reversed the judgment, and remanded the cause by procedendo, but by the neglect of the parties, or their counsel, to appear, the suit was <em>non-prossed.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-6\">Shortly afterwards the land was re-sold at public sale by the trustee, for the sum of \u00a71,980, and conveyed to <em>John Jl. Carter, </em>ono of the defendants, who claims to be a purchaser for valuable consideration, and pleads want of notice of the lien or claim of the complainant, at the time of his purchase, the payment of the purchase money, or the taking of the deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-7\">The defences made by the answer of <em>J.

S. </em>By the latter it is expressly decided, 10 <em>Peters </em>563, that the executors had the power to sell, and although it was argued by the counsel in v that case, and seems to have been admitted by the court, that the <em>Court of Appeals of Maryland, in </em>4 <em>Gill </em>\u00a7\u2022 <em>John. </em>323, had decided the reverse, we have carefully examined that case, and do not think, that they have made such a decision; on the contrary, it may be more fairly inferred, from the decision of the court in that case, that it was their opinion, that the executors had the power both to sell, and to convey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-7\">The decision of the court in that case is, that the <em>legal </em>estate after the death of <em>David Peter, </em>vested in his heirs at law, liable to be divested upon a legal sale of the land under the <em>second </em>clause of the will, <em>a compliance with the terms of sale, </em>and <em>payment of the purchase money, </em>leaving undecided the question, whether a legal sale had been made; for although a legal sale might have been made, yet the legal title remained in the heirs at law, because the terms of sale had not been complied with, nor the purchase money paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-8\">The court say in their opinion, that the will gave to whomsoever it authorised to sell, a mere <em>naked power </em>to sell; that is to say, that it did not give a power coupled with an interest, to wit, the legal estate, 10 <em>Peters </em>564; but they do not say in whom that power was vested. They quote however, certainly without disapprobation, the doctrine in <em>Sugd. on Pow. </em>167, \u201cthat when a testator directs his estate to be sold, without declaring by whom the sale shall be made, if the fund be dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>tributable by the executors, either for the payment of debts or legacies, he will take a power of sale by implication,\u201d and merely say on the other hand, that in <em>Maryland </em>a different course has generally been pursued, founded perhaps on the act of 1785, ch. 72. As therefore this question has been decided by the <em>Supreme Court of the U. S. </em>to be the law of <em>Maryland, </em>and there is at least no conflicting <em>decision </em>of the <em>Court of Appeals, </em>we consider ourselves bound by the decision of the <em>Supreme Court, </em>with which, we also concur in principle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">But if the executors had not originally the power to sell, it \u25a0would not avail the defendants in the present suit. The land was purchased by <em>Geoi'ge Magruder, </em>under whom the defendants claim in 1814, twenty-two years before the filing of the bill, knowing that the executors claimed the power to sell under the will of <em>David Peter; </em>he never, during the continuance of his interest, objected to the title which they could give; on the contrary he paid one instalment, continued in possession until 1820, six years afterwards; when he returned it in his schedule as his property, and during the next year, confessed a judgment for the residue of the purchase money. In 1820, his trustee, the defendant, <em>Geoi'ge B. Magruder, </em>took possession of the land, and continued in possession until a short time after the termination of the ejectment suit, of said <em>David Peter\u2019s </em>heirs in 1834, w-hen he sold to the defendant <em>Carter. </em>During this time he received a large amount of damages from the <em>Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, </em>as owner of the land; cut a considerable quantity of wood off of it, and received the rents and profits without making any objection to the title; on the contrary, when the <em>ejectment </em>was brought, he rested his defence on the title derived from the executors; <em>and now, </em>when possession under this title has been held for twenty years, and that suit being <em>non-prossed, </em>no longer threatens to disturb it, and there appears to be no probability of any future disturbance, inasmuch as it has been decided, that the heirs of <em>David Peter </em>have no really beneficial interest in the land, only the bare legal title; the beneficial interest being in the creditors, to the payment of whose debts the purchase money is to he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>applied. The defendant, <em>Magruder, </em>and <em>Carter, </em>who claims under him, come too late with their objection. <em>Sug. </em>Vend, 212; and the case in note <em>h.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-5\"><em>It is </em>contended in the <em>second </em>place, that <em>the </em>complainant might have had ample redress at law against <em>George Magruder, </em>and his sureties, and that it is <em>laches </em>in him, that he did not seek that redress.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-6\">Admitting that he was bound to pursue his remedy at law, po transfer of the legal title having been made, what would if Jiave availed him? <em>George Magruder </em>became insolvent ip 1820, and transferred all his property to a trustee. There is no evidence that he acquired any property afterwards, if such would have been liable; on the contrary the complainant issued a <em>fieri facias, </em>which was returned <em>nulla bona. </em>The only evidence, that he ever had any property, is in his schedule, and of the property contained in that, the greater part appears to be mortgaged or incumbered with other liens to its full value; and the residue is greatly insufficient for the payment of his other creditors, who would have been entitled, to throw him back upon his lien. <em>Sug. on Ven. </em>551, 2, 3, 4.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-7\">As to his sureties, there is sufficient evidence of the insolvency of one, at all times subsequently to the purchase; and of the other during the greater part of his life, embracing nearly the whole period of the existence of the complainant\u2019s claim. But why should the complainant be required to pursue his remedies against the sureties; if he had recovered his debt from them, they would have been entitled by substitution to have asserted his lien against the land. <em>Fergusson vs. Ghieslin, </em>4 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>John. </em>522. A court of equity abhors circuity of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-8\">It would seem a novelty indeed, to permit <em>Magruder </em>or his trustee, to turn over his creditors to his sureties, and even if the defendant, <em>Carter, </em>should establish his claim to the character of a purchaser for valuable consideration, without notice, for which he contends, it is not perceived that his equity is superior to that of the sureties. <em>Carter's </em>title moreover is of a very recent date, and certainly he cannot object it, as <em>laches </em>jn the complainant, that he did not pursue his remedy against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the sureties, rather than the property of the principal debtor, before he had assumed his character of purchaser..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-5\">The defendants also plead the statute of limitations; adverse possession ; and the staleness of the complainant\u2019s claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-6\">If the lapse of three years were to bar the complainant\u2019s claim, then in the case of a mortgage, the mortgagee who took a promissory note, or obligation for the amount of his mortgaged debt, or had a covenant in the mortgage for its payment, would also be barred by the lapse of three or twelve years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-7\"><em>A </em>lien for the payment of purchase money, when the land is <em>not </em>conveyed, is fully equivalent to a mortgage. In the one case the creditor takes <em>a conveyance </em>of the legal title in land, to secure the payment of his debt. In the other, he <em>retains </em>the legal title which he already has, and the vendee has no', more right to call upon him to part with it, before the payment of the purchase money, than the mortgagor has to require the mortgagee to release before the payment of the mortgage debt, When the vendor conveys the land, retaining only the title papers, his lien is considered equivalent to an equitable mortgage, Sugden, 554. It is surely something more, when he retains the legal title. In this case the vendor expressly stipulated to convey, only upon the payment of the purchase money. \u00c1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-8\">The statute of limitations has never been considered as applying to a mortgage. A mortgagor generally takes a bond, or note for his mortgage debt; sometimes, especially when the debt accrues for the purchase of the mortgaged land itself, he takes additional personal security on the note. There where he fails to pursue his legal remedy on the legal instrument, within the period prescribed by the statute of limitations, he loses the benefit of his additional security; so if he omit to sue on the covenant in the mortgage within that period, he loses what the covenant is intended to give him, a remedy against the person and the other properly of the debtor. 1 <em>Pow. on Mort. </em>398. 2 <em>Con. Rep. </em>163; but his mortgage stands upon different ground. He may bring an ejectment for the land to pay himself from the rents and profits, which would not be barred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>three or twelve- years, or he may file his bill for a sale, relying <em>not </em>upon the covenant, or the note, or the obligation, but upon the pledge, the conveyance of the land to him to secure the payment of the debt. 1 <em>Pow. on Mor\u00ed. </em>393, 4, 5. The possession of the mortgagor is the possession of the mortgagee; he is considered the tenant at will of the mortgagee, and therefore his possession can never in strictness be adverse, 1 <em>Pow. </em>398. It is true, that after many conflicting decisions, it seems to be now settled in England, that after a period of twenty years, adopted in analogy to the statute of limitations, the mortgage debt will be presumed to be paid, unless there has been within that time, some payment of interest, or some acknowledgment of the existence of the debt, or other circumstances accounting for the delay. 1 <em>Pow. on Mott. </em>393, 399. <em>Coote, </em>543.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-5\">It may be supposed, that a different rule at law, has been adopted in this State, in the case of <em>Morgan\u2019s lessee vs. Davis, 2 Harr. 8f McHenry, </em>16, decided in the <em>General Court. </em>One of the directions of the court w'ould seem to go to that extent, but the facts of the case did not require it, and the rule is repudiated by the Court of Appeals in the case of <em>Lamar vs. Jones, </em>3 <em>Harr. </em>&lt;\u00a7\u2022 <em>McHenry, </em>331. The court deciding in the latter case, no more than had before been decided in the <em>English </em>court, that a presumption would arise, after twenty years in analogy to the statute of limitations, unless there be circumstances to account for the neglect, enumerating some of the circumstances referred to in the <em>English </em>cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-6\">Admitting the analogy between mortgages and liens, where the conveyance is withheld, what are the circumstances in this case, to repel the presumption of payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-7\"><em>First. </em>-There is the insolvency of <em>George Magruder </em>in 1820, and his admission in his schedule returned, both of the debt and the lien.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-8\"><em>Secondly. </em>A judgment rendered against him in 1821, for the amount of the two instalments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-9\"><em>Thirdly. </em>The ejectment brought at the instance of the executors, to regain the possession of the land, for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>a re-sale; and the application of <em>Mr. Key, </em>the complainant\u2019s counsel, both pending, and subsequently to the decision of the <em>ejectment </em>case in the <em>Court of Appeals, </em>to permit him to resell the land for the payment of the purchase money, which was not denied, but rather admitted to be due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-5\">All these circumstances sufficiently account for the delay in filing the present bill, and repel the presumption of payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-6\">The only remaining question is, whether the defendant, <em>Carter, </em>can be considered a purchaser for valuable consideration, without notice of the complainant\u2019s claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-7\">It is unnecessary to consider, whether having only an equitable title, he can be protected against a person having the legal title, for we are of opinion, that he cannot be considered a purchaser for valuable consideration at all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-8\">The consideration which he has paid, is so totally inadequate, as not to entitle him to that character. There seems to be no fixed rule by which the requisite degree of inadequacy can be in all cases ascertained. By the <em>civil law, </em>half the value is so considered. <em>Sag. Vend. </em>249, which in one instance, is said to have been adopted in <em>England; </em>but here the inadequacy is so gross, that it is unnecessary to seek for a sure general rule. The land sold in 1813 or 1814 for $20,000, valued by <em>George Magruder </em>in his schedule in 1820 at $40,000, was purchased by <em>Carter </em>in 1834 for not quite $2,000 \u2014 less than one-tenth of the amount of former sale, without any evidence to show a depreciation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-9\">It is clear also, that he had sufficient notice of the non-payment of the purchase money. We know that he purchased from <em>G. B. M., </em>the trustee of an insolvent debtor, who had no conveyance of the legal title, and he was bound to have examined the trust deed, and the insolvent record, the last of which would have informed him, that this land was incumbered with a lien. But it appears moreover, from his written admission, that before he purchased, he had read the decision of the <em>Court of Appeals, </em>in the case of <em>Magruder vs. Peter's devisees, </em>from 4 <em>Gill, fy John. </em>323, and that record, even the opinion of the court, would have informed him explicitly, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>part of the purchase money was yet due. Having already notice to that extent, the complainant could not be required to attend the sale by the trustee, for the purpose of giving him notice, even if he knew that it was about to take place, (which is not sufficiently proved,) and could have supposed that a sale unincumbered with the lien, would have been attempted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-5\">The complainant is entitled to a decree for the sale of the land; and against <em>G. B. M. </em>the trustee, for an account and payment of the compensation or damages received from the' <em>Canal </em>Company, for its passage through the land; but is not entitled to an account for the rents and profits. The vendor' is entitled to interest, the vendee to profits; and there is no-lien upon them. The complainant is also entitled to an account against the trustee of the general trust fund; and to the payment of his proportion of it, if the proceeds of the sale of the' land, and the damages received from the <em>Canal </em>Company, should prove to be insufficient for the payment of his claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-6\">It is therefore' this 1st day of February 1839, by <em>M.

The plaintiff <em>Carter, </em>being a purchaser for a valuable consideration, without notice, having paid the purchase money, and having obtained a deed of the possession from the trustee who had the possession, was entitled to the protection of a court of equity, and his plea, founded on those circumstances, ought to have been sustained. The court had no right to assume that the price paid by <em>Carter </em>was much less than the value of the land, and therefore, not a valuable, consideration,</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>6th.

According to the bill of complaint, the balance of the purchase money was secured by notes, and upon the notes, the bill does not charge that suits were brought; the plaintiff in error relies on the plea of limitations, and insists, that if the remedy at law, for the recovery of the purchase money is gone, the vendor can have no remedy in equity on any supposed lien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-7\">8th.

Johns </em>the executors of said will. The testator died in 1812; and in the following year the executors advertised the land for sale; at which sale, a certain <em>George Magruder </em>became the purchaser for the sum of $20,687.90, it being at the rale of $10.50 per acre; one-third of the purchase money, which was by the terms of sale to be paid on the 1st of January .1814, was paid by the purchaser; and for the other two thirds, be gave his two several promissory notes, payable, one on the 1st of January 1815, and the other on the 1st of January 1816. <em>The first </em>endorsed by <em>Patrick </em>Magruder, and the <em>second </em>endorsed by <em>Lloyd Magruder, </em>when possession of the land was delivered to him, as the purchaser thereof. In July 1820, and before the payment of either of the above notes, <em>George Magruder </em>petitioned in <em>the District of Columbia </em>for the benefit of the insolvent laws; <em>Geo. B. Magruder, </em>one of the defendants, was appointed in the same year, his trustee, to whom he conveyed all his property,includingtheland purchased by the insol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>vent, his principal, from the executors of the said <em>David Peter. </em>This land was afterwards sold at public sale by the trustee of <em>George Magruder, </em>and purchased by <em>John A. Carter, </em>one of the defendants, for the sum of $1,980, to whom it was conveyed by the said trustee, and who resists the sale of the said land, for the payment of the balance of the purchase money due to the estate of the said <em>David Peter, </em>deceased, upon several grounds, the validity of which it is necessary for this court now to examine, and decide upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The defendant contends in the <em>first </em>place, that it was without warrant or authority, that the sale was made by the executors of <em>David Peter, </em>and that the making of such sale being the exercise of a power not delegated to them by the will, no title passed to the purchaser at such sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">He also contends, that he was a purchaser for valuable consideration, without notice of the complainant\u2019s lien or claim, for the balance of the purchase money, and that the same might have been obtained by due diligence, and taking the necessary steps for that purpose, from <em>George Magruder, </em>the principal, or his sureties, <em>Patrick </em>and <em>Lloyd Magruder.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">He further relies upon the staleness of the demand, and the omission of the surviving executors to notify him of his lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">He pleads limitations as a bar to any claim upon the notes for the purchase money; and limitations by adverse possession of twenty years, and lapse of time, during which the executors suffered their claim to lie dormant, and omitted to prosecute for the same, either against the defendant, or those under whom he claims, they being in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">The objection raised to the power of the executors to sell, and which is relied upon as matter of defence in this case, is an important one; and has received all the attention and consideration, which it has been in our power t,o bestow upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">The same question it appears, has also engaged the attention of the <em>Supreme Court of the United States, </em>and has been judicially decided by them in favour of the right or power to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">We do not however agree in opinion with that learned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>court, that this court in the case reported m 4 <em>Gill </em>&amp; <em>John. </em>323, have expressed any decided opinion upon this question. In that case the Court of Appeals, say it is said in <em>Sugd. on Pow. </em>167, where a testator directs his estate to be sold, without declaring by whom the sale shall be made, if the fund be distributable by the executor, either for the payment of debts or legacies, he will take a power of sale by implication. In <em>Maryland </em>a different course has been generally pursued, founded perhaps on an act of Assembly, passed in 1785, ch. 72, by the 4th section of wririch it is enacted, \u201cif any person hath \u201c died or shall die, leaving real or personal estate to be sold \u201cfor the payment of debts, or other purposes, and shall not \u201cby will or other instrument of writing, appoint a person or \u201cpersons, to sell or convey the said property, &amp;c.,upon every \u201csuch case, the Chancellor shall have full power and authority \u201cupon application or petition, from any person or persons inter- \u201c ested in the sale of such property, to appoint such trustee or \u201ctrustees, for the purpose of selling and conveying such property, and applying the money arising from the sale, tothepur- \u201c pose intended, as the Chancellor shall in his discretion think \u201cproper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We shall certainly look here in vain, for any thing like the expression or intimation of an opinion, that the doctrine quoted from <em>Sngden </em>was untenable, or unsustainable upon principle. It amounts to nothing more than a declaration or statement, that in this <em>State </em>a different practice in such cases had been generally pursued, which probably had its origin in the provisions of the act of 1785, ch. 72. It cannot therefore we think be properly considered as a decision of the question involved in this case, wdiich must be decided upon principle and authority, uncontrolled by any thing which fell from the court in that opinion. If then, no binding judicial decision of the question has ever been made by thehribunals of this State, or if the act of Assembly has never been judicially construed to cover and extend to such a case, it becomes necessary to ascertain what is the doctrine of the <em>English </em>law upon such a subject, as settled and established by the courts of justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>in that country, and to be governed in our decision of the question, conformably to such rules and principles as we shall find to be there established.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In <em>Sugd. on Pow. </em>72, it is said, \u201cit sometimes happens, that a testator directs his estates to be sold for certain purposes, without declaring by whom the sale shall be made. In the absence of such a declaration, if the fund be distributable by the executor, he will have the power by implication.\u201d In the same page of the same book, an eld case referred to in 16 <em>Eliz. </em>where a man devised his lands, \u201cto his wife for life, and because he was in doubt, whether he should have issue or not, he further willed by his will, that if he should not have any issue by his wife, that then, after the death of his wife, the lands should be sold, and the money thereof coming, distributed to three of his blood, and made his wife and another his executors, and died. The executors proved the will. The other executors died, and the wife sold the lands; and it was the opinion of <em>Wray </em>and <em>Southgate, </em>justices, that the sale was good, although it be not expressed in the will, by whom the land should be sold, for the monies coming of the sale, are to be distributed by his executors to persons certain as legatees, and it appertains to executors to pay the legacies, and therefore they shall sell, &amp;c., as if a man willeth that his lands shall be sold, and that the monies'coming thereof, shall be disposed of for the payment of his debts, now the executors shall sell the lands, for to them it belongs to pay debts; also they hold that the lands should be sold, in the life of the wife, otherwise they could never be sold, and also the surviving executor shall sell the lands because the authority doth survive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Such appears to have been the well settled doctrine of the ancient law of that country, from whence we have derived most of the principles of our jurisprudence, and the modern decisions and elementary writers, recognise the continuance of its existence down to the present period. The same principle has been sanctioned and established, not only by the <em>Supreme Court of the United States, </em>but by the decisions of several of our sister States. See 2 John. <em>Ch. Rep. </em>252, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>Chancellor Kent </em>says, in a case where the real estate was directed to be sold, but \u2018no person was named in the will to make the sale. \u201cThe object of the power to sell, was to raise money for the legacies, which it is of course the duty of the executor to discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">We are therefore of opinion in this case, that the executors of <em>Peter, </em>whose duty it was to.pay the debts of the testator, with the proceeds of sale, had the right to make the sale, and competent power to pass the legal title under the will to the purchaser, upon payment of the purchase money. See 7 <em>John. C. Rep. </em>48, where <em>Chancellor Kent </em>says, it is a well founded principle, that where a person takes by execution of a power, he takes under the authority of the power, equally as if the power, and the instrument executing the power, had been incorporated in one instrument. The title rests upon the act creating the power, and takes effect, as if created by the original deed. Assuming the principle then to be correct, that a power to sell in this case, was given to the executors by implication, it is clear, that the trust imposed upon them to apply the proceeds to the payment of the testator\u2019s debts, would continue the power in the surviving executor. In the case of <em>Osgood vs. Franklin, </em>reported in 2 <em>John\u2019s. C. Rep., Chancellor Kent </em>holds the doctrine to be, that where a trust is imposed upon executors, the execution of which depends upon the sale, the power will survive to the surviving executor. In that case he refers to a case reported in <em>Sir Wm. Jones, </em>352, and <em>Cro. Car. </em>382, where lands were devised to the wife for life, and then to be sold by the executors for payment of debts and legacies, or as one of the reports of the case says, to be divided among the nephew's, one of the executors died, and it was held, on a case sent from Chancery for the opinion of the judges at law, that the survivor could sell, though the executors had an authority and no interest. It is also a matter worthy of consideration, that by affirming the power of executors to sell, in such cases, the titles of purchasers might be protected in many instances, which a contrary construction would totally annihilate: because in many cases, sales may have been made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>executors, without the aid of Chancery, under the belief of a power derived from the will, which would be totally void, and inoperative, if it should be decided, that it was an assumption of power unwarranted by law, and that an application to Chancery for the appointment of a trustee was necessary; on the contrary, purchasers from trustees appointed by Chancery in such cases, would have nothing,to fear; because the exercise of such a power would be within the general jurisdiction of that court, and therefore the titles of purchasers under such a sanction, could not be impeached. Upon the principle, that a sale made under the authority of a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction is good and valid, it is well settled that a sale made by a sheriff by force of a <em>fi. fa. </em>shall stand, although the judgment should be afterwards reversed; for, say the books, the sheriff who made the sale had lawful authority to sell; <em>Manning\u2019s </em>case, 8 <em>Coke, </em>746. The purchaser under the decree in this case, would acquire a good and sufficient title from the trustee, upon the payment of the purchase money, and taking a deed of conveyance from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">To obviate any misapprehension which may arise from the principles contained in this opinion, we wish it to be distinctly understood, that we do not mean to say, that we deem the act of 1785, ch. 72, unnecessary and inoperative; because there may be cases where the jurisdiction of a Court of Chancery, might be properly invoked under that act, as in the case of a will directing the sale of real or personal estate, for the payment of debts or other purposes, and where no trustee was appointed to make the said sale, and no executor was appointed, to whom the power could be considered as given by implication. In such a case, and perhaps in many others, the aid of a court of equity might be necessary, to execute the provisions of the will, by appointing a trustee to make the sale.. But in the case now before this court, we think that a resort to that jurisdiction was not necessary, as the executor named in the will had the power by implication\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">We do not think, that the length of possession of the defendant <em>Carter, </em>and those under whom he claims, can be avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>able as a defence against the complainant\u2019s claim in this case; such possession cannot be considered adversary, because the principle is well established, that the vendee, and those claiming under him with notice, are to be considered as trustees, for the whole or any part of the purchase money, which may remain unpaid. 1 <em>John. C. Rep. </em>308.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">To obviate the objection of the defendant Carter, as to a want of power in the executors to sell and transfer the title, other reasons might be assigned, such as the exercise of acts of ownership, acquiescence, and long possession; but it is deemed unnecessary to say more upon that part of his defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">That he was a purchaser of the land in question for a valuable consideration, and without notice of the complainant\u2019s lien, is another ground of defence assumed by him, to show that it cannot be sold to pay the balance of the purchase money. The general rule of Chancery is, that whatever is sufficient to put the party upon enquiry, is good notice in equity. See <em>Fonblanque\u2019s </em>Equity, 447, and the cases there referred to in the note. See also <em>Sug. on Vend. </em>542, where he says, \u201cwhat is sufficient to put a purchaser upon an enquiry is good notice; that is, where a man has sufficient information to lead him to a fact, he shall be deemed conusant of it. Therefore, if a man knows that the legal estate is in a third person, at the time he purchases, he is bound to take notice, what the trust is. Were there not strong and pregnant circumstances in this case, sufficient to put the defendant Carter, upon such an enquiry as would have led to a knowledge of the complainant\u2019s lien, and which ought to charge him with a knowledge of its existence? He purchased from the trustee of the insolvent debtor, who purchased from <em>Peter\u2019s </em>executors. The land mentioned in the bond of conveyance to Magruder, the purchaser, from the executors, is the same land purchased by him from the trustee of Magruder, and he, in his insolvent schedule, returns the land, by a name somewhat variant, though sufficient to put him on enquiry, as subject to a lien of about, $16,000, and in his list of debts, he returns himself a debtor to <em>Peter\u2019s </em>executors, in the sum of $14,000: no legal title had been obtained by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>purchaser or his trustee, for the land purchased, which the bond of conveyance shews, was not to be made, until the whole purchase money was paid; Carter, the defendant, admits, that before he purchased, he had read the decision of the Court of Appeals, reported in 4 <em>Gill &amp; John. </em>of <em>Magruder </em>against <em>Peter's </em>devisees, in which it appeared, that the whole of the purchase money had not been paid; the knowledge of this fact, also, at the time of his purchase, was sufficient to have put him on enquiry; and to charge him with notice; that the purchase money then remained unpaid. Having therefore in legal construction sufficient notice to destroy the effect of his plea of a purchase without notice, we shall forbear to express any opinion upon the inadequacy of the price, for which the purchase was made, and how far the same would operate to effect his plea, as a purchaser for valuable consideration; the purchase having been made at public auction, and no proof of fraud appearing to effect the purchase. The notice of the lien being sufficient, with which he was chargeable in equity, we think the complainant was under no obligation to give him any additional information upon that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We do not think, that it can be contended with any semblance of propriety, that the lien for the purchase money has Nbeen waived in this case, by the taking of promissory notes, with endorsers, as security for their payment. <em>Prima </em>facie, the purchase money is a lien on the land sold, and it lies on the vendee to shew the contrary. 1 <em>John. C. Rep. </em>308, <em>Chancellor Kent, </em>in that case says, it is a well settled rule (for which he refers to several authorities,) \u201cthat the vendor has a lien on the estate for the purchase money, while the estate is in the hands of the vendee, and when there is no contract, that the lien by implication was not intended to be reserved.\u201d So far from there being any evidence of an intention to relinguish the lien, in this case, the proof is very strong and clear to the contrary. The legal title was not transferred to the purchaser; and by the express terms of the contract, as proved by the bond of conveyance, no deed was to be executed by the vendors to the vendee, until the full and complete payment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>whole purchase money.\u201d This reservation of the legal title until the full payment of the whole purchase money, is a clear and conclusive manifestation of the vendor\u2019s intention, not to abandon their lien for the purchase money, and to take as a substitute therefor, the promissory note of the purchaser, with* endorsers. This position is we think too self-evident, upon principle, to require the aid of authorities to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">As the evidence in the record shews the inability of both principle and sureties to pay the debt, at and from the period the second payment became due in January 1815, a resort to law could not in any event be available; moreover, if compulsory measures had been adopted against sureties for the attainment of that object, it would have availed nothing to the defendant, Carter, as a purchaser with notice, because the sureties, upon paying the balance of the purchase money, would have had a right by substitution to the benefit of the vendor\u2019s lien, for the purpose of re-imbursement and indemnity. See the case of <em>Ghiselin vs. </em>Fergusson, 4 <em>Harr. &amp; John. </em>522, where the rights of the sureties paying the debt of the principal, in such a case are fully recognised.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">As to the plea of limitations, and the lapse of time upon which the defendant Carter, relies, we think they are unavailable to him as a defence against the complainant\u2019s claim, under the circumstances of this case. Although the plea of limitations would bar a recovery on the note, yet the loss of the remedy on this note, it is clear, would not bar the complainant\u2019s remedy in equity, upon the ground of his equitable lien. In the case of a mortgage, the law seems to be so understood. See 1 <em>Powell on </em>mortgage, 393, where it is said, \u201cif the collateral security had been a note of hand, instead of a bond, the statute of limitations would run against the note, and leave that mortgage as it was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">As to the lapse of time which intervened between the period when the debt became due, and the. filing of the complainant\u2019s bill, we are of opinion, that the presumption of payment, which might have arisen from that circumstance, when unexplained, is sufficiently rebutted by the insolvency, or em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>barrassed condition of tbe purchaser and his sureties; and the efforts which were made to recover it, being sufficiently apparent from the proof in the case, that one of the objects, if not the primary one, of the <em>ejectment </em>suit, was to subject the land by a sale to the payment of the balance of the purchase money. In the <em>law compendium, </em>page 361, it is said, \u201clapse of time is permitted in equity to defeat an acknowledged right on the ground, only, of its affording evidence of a presumption that such right has been abandoned; it therefore never prevails, when such presumption is out-weighed by opposite facts, or circumstances,\u201d for which principle the author refers to the case of <em>Wilson vs. Carrington, </em>4 <em>Munf. </em>332.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">But for as much as it appears to this court, that the assignees of the bond of conveyance, the two daughters of <em>George Magruder, </em>and <em>Patrick Magruder, </em>and <em>Lloyd Magruder, </em>also assignees of the said bond, by reason of their eventual responsibility, if the fund should prove insufficient, are material and necessary parties to this suit, we are of opinion, that the cause should be remanded to <em>Montgomery </em>county court, sitting as a court of equity, in order that they, or their legal representatives, if they be dead, may be made parties to the same. As to the creditors of the said <em>George Magruder, </em>mentioned in the said assignment, their interests, are, we think, sufficiently protected, by the trustee of the said <em>George, </em>who is already a party to this suit. This cause is remanded accordingly, in order that the proper parties may be made to the same; the appellees are to pay the costs of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">CAUSE REMANDED TO MAKE PARTIES WITH COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">TO THE APPELLANTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
