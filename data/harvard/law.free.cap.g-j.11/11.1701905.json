It is further admitted that, said notes not being paid, the plaintiff still being ignorant of the fact of a partnership as aforesaid, instituted suit against said <em>Robert S. Hollins </em>upon said notes, in <em>Baltimore </em>county court, on the 2nd April, in the year 1834, and recovered judgment thereon against said Robert, on the 2nd December 1834, subject to the release of said <em>Robert </em>under the insolvent laws of <em>Maryland, </em>for the benefit of which said <em>Robert </em>had, after the institution of suit aforesaid, applied, and that said judgment remains unsatisfied. It is agreed that, if the court shall be of opinion that on the above facts the plaintiff is entitled to recover, judgment shall be rendered in his favor for the damages in the declaration, to be released on payment of, &amp;c.;' and if the court shall be of opinion that the plaintiff is- not entitled to recover, then judgment shall be rendered for the defendant.

In truth there are but two questions which this court are called on to decide; the one, a matter of fact, to be disposed of by an inspection of the case stated; the other a question of law, as to the extinguishment of the original contract,, by the rendition of the judgment against the ostensible partner, should the court find the facts to be as asserted by the appellee.The fact in dispute in this case is, whether the promissory notes-given by <em>Robert S. Hollins, </em>and on which the judgment was rendered, were given by him as the notes of the firm, under the partnership signature, or were given as his individual notes, by way of collateral security for the payment of a partnership liability. A determination of this controversy, can only be made by an examination of the facts in the case stated. It states, that <em>Robert S. Hollins </em>and <em>John S. Hollins </em>the defendant, were partners in the business of manufacturers of cotton goods, and that they carried on their said business in the name solely of <em>Robert S. Hollins; </em>that while said <em>John </em>and <em>Robert, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>were partners as aforesaid, \u201cthe said <em>Robert </em>purchased for the business purposes and uses in fact of said partnership,\u201d a quantity of cotton for the sum of three thousand one hundred and sixty-one dollars and ninety-seven cents, which cotton was delivered to said <em>Robert, </em>and used in the business aforesaid, and that said cotton was sold on a credit of six months, and the said <em>Robert </em>accordingly made and delivered to said plaintiff for said purchase, his (said Robert\u2019s) three promissory notes amounting to the said sum of $3,161.97 payable six months after this date. The legal construction of these facts is, that the notes were given in the partnership name for a partnership debt. There is not a fact in the statement which could suggest for a moment, a different interpretation to the acts of the contracting parties. If in a suit on these notes against both partners, the facts in the case stated had been in evidence before the jury, it would have been competent for the court, if applied to for the purpose, to have directed the jury, that if they believed those facts, the plaintiff was entitled to recover. Thus determining, that there was no inference of any other fact left open for the finding of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">Upon this assumption of the facts in the case, does the judgment recovered against the ostensible partner, interpose any obstacle to a recovery against the present defendant, is the question of law we are called on to consider? That the substitution of a debtor\u2019s obligation of a higher nature, for a debt due by him of inferior degree, works an extinguishment of his original liability, has not been, and upon authority could not be controverted. And that the same extinguishment takes place when the substituted obligation of a higher nature, is executed by one of two partners, or other persons jointly bound, is now well settled. See the cases of <em>Williams vs. Hodgson, 2 Harr. </em>&amp; <em>John. </em>474. <em>U. S. vs. Astley &amp; </em>others, 3 <em>Wash. C. C. Rep. </em>518, and <em>Tom vs. Goodrich, 2 Johns. </em>213. If the reduction of a simple contract debt to a specialty in such cases, works its extinction, it is difficult to conceive a reason why a judgment obtained thereon, (a security of a still higher nature) should not produce the same result. Tis true the doctrine of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>extinguishment or merger, when applied to matters of this sort, is purely technical, and may on some occasions be productive of inconvenience and injustice. But we sit here not to make or amend, but to expound, the law. Such as we find it we must declare it. We regard the case before us, therefore, not-only as falling within the principle established in the cases above referred to; but as fully settled by decisions on the very point now at issue. See the cases of <em>Smith </em>&amp; <em>al. vs. Black, </em>9 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>142. <em>Robertson vs. Smith, </em>18 <em>Johns. </em>459, <em>and Willings </em>&amp; <em>Francis et al. vs. Consequa, </em>1 <em>Peters\u2019 C. C. Rep. </em>301. Concurring with the county court we affirm their judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
