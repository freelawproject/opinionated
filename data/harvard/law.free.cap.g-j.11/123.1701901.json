F. Bowie and P. W. Csai-n, filed the following argument\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-9\"><em>Philip J. Ford, </em>by his will, dated the 6th March 1836, after making several pecuniary bequests, disposes of the residue of his estate, in the following terms:</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-10\">\u201cThe residue of my estate, real and personal, to <em>be equally divided </em>between the children of my sister <em>Ann Latimer, </em>and-their heirs forever, and the children of my sister <em>Penelope Beall,- </em>and their heirs forever.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-11\">After the death of the testator, and the payment of his debts by his executor, an application was made to the court for the distribution of his personal estate among the residuary legatees, and it became a question, whether it should be divided <em>per stirpes or per capita. </em>This question is an important one to the parties, as <em>Ann Latimer </em>had <em>seven </em>children, and Pene-\u25a0 <em>lope Beall </em>but <em>four.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-12\">The orphan\u2019s court decided that the legatees took per stirpes3 and that the seven children of <em>Ann Latimer </em>took one-half of the personal estate, and the four children of <em>Penelope Beall </em>the other half, and from this decision the appeal was taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-13\">It appears by the answer of the appellee to the petition filed by the appellants in the Orphan\u2019s Court for the distribution, that <em>Penelope Beall, </em>one of the sisters of the testator, is alive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-14\">The counsel for the appellant would feel much more confidence in their ability to shew the error of the Orphan\u2019s Court, but for the circumstance of this case having been once before under the consideration of this court, and a judgment in accordance with that opinion having been pronounced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b135-15\">They nevertheless proceed briefly to assign the reasons, and refer to the authorities upon which they rely for a reversal of the judgment.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>1. The court will perceive, that the legatees in this case all stand in <em>equal degree </em>of relationship to the testator. They are all his nephews and nieces. If then he had died intestate, and they had been his next of kin, they would have taken <em>per capita, </em>under the English Statute of Distributions, which has been closely, not to say literally, followed by the act of 1798, ch. 10,sub-ch. 11. That they would so havetaken, and that each of the eleven children would have taken an equal share of the estate, the court is referred to 2 <em>Williams\u2019 Ex\u2019rs, </em>916, 917, 930; <em>Durant vs. Prestwood, </em>1 <em>Atk. </em>454; <em>Lloyd vs. Trench, </em>2 <em>Ves. Sr. </em>215.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-5\">2. And in the case of bequest to \u201crelations\u201d or \u201cfamily\u201d generally, even without mentioning the proportions in which the fund is to be divided, if his next of kin be related to him in equal degree, they will take in <em>equal shares, </em>i. e. <em>per capita, </em>each being entitled in his own right to an equal share. 1 <em>Roper on Legacies, </em>126; 2 <em>Williams, Ex\u2019rs, </em>930, <em>note </em>(o). The taking <em>per stirpes, </em>always presupposes an inequality of relationship. 1 <em>Roper, </em>128, 129. If then there had not been (as there is) in this case, any words indicating the clear intention of the testator, that these legatees should take in equal shares, still as they all stand in equal degree of relationship to him, they would be so entitled, and each would take an equal \u2018share of the testator\u2019s property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-6\">3. But independently of these considerations, sucha distribution is the proper one, for reasons founded upon the obvious intention of the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-7\">His language is, that of the residue of his real and personal estate shall <em>he equally </em>divided between the children of two of his sisters, and their heirs forever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-8\">Is that an equal division, which gives to some of these children more than to others ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b136-9\">According to the distribution directed by the Orphan\u2019s Court, the children of <em>Mrs. Latimer, </em>of whom there is seven, get but one-fourteenth of the estate, while those of <em>Mrs. Beall, </em>of whom there are but four, get one-eighth. If the testator had intended this, would he have used the words <em>\u201cequally </em>divided\u201d?</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>But how stands the matter upon authority. And in bringing to the notice of the court the cases which the appellants\u2019 counsel consider as settling the question in their favour, they respectfully suggest that the stream of authority runs all one way, and that not a single opposing decision can be found. The principle which the appellants counsel suppose to be established beyond controversy is this, that whether the legatees are related to the testator in equal degree or not, if the testator has shown an intention that they shall take in equal shares, by the use of the terms, \u201cto be equally divided,\u201d (as here) or by expressions of similar import, the distribution will be <em>per capita.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-5\">In <em>Thomas vs. Hole, </em>a leading Case upon the subject, which will be found reported sufficiently in 1 <em>Roper, </em>92, <em>Lord King </em>decided, that a bequest of j6500 to the relations of <em>Elizabeth Hole, \u201cto be be </em>equally divided between them,\u201d when <em>Elizabeth </em>had at the period of the testator\u2019s death two brothers, and several nephews and nieces, the children of a deceased brother, should be distributed <em>per capita, </em>so that each nephew and niece was entitled to the same share as each brother;</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-6\">In the same book, 126, 127, the same principle is asserted, and numerous cases cited in support of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-7\">The court is referred particularly to the following, as clear, decisive, and convincing. <em>Barnes vs. Patch, </em>8 <em>Ves. </em>607, 608; <em>Dyer vs. Dyer, </em>1 <em>Merrivall, </em>414. <em>Butler vs. Stratton, </em>3 <em>Bro. Ch. C. </em>367. <em>Lady Lincoln vs. Pelham, </em>10 <em>Ves. </em>167, 174, 175. <em>McMeilledge vs. Galbraith, </em>8 <em>Serg. &amp; Raule, </em>43. 3 <em>Brown Ch. C. </em>68, 69. <em>Thomas vs. Hole, Cases Temp. Talb. </em>251, and <em>Maddox vs. State, </em>4 <em>Harr. &amp; John. </em>539.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-9\">This latter case, it is apprehended, is not so strong iii favour of a <em>per capita </em>distribution, as the case under consideration; because, in the case of 4 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>John. </em>the legatees did not stand in equal degree of relationship to the testator, and if he had died intestate, the division would have been <em>per stirpes. </em>The giving the children of the deceased brother, therefore, in that case, an equal share with the living brother, must have been by force of the words, \u201ctobe equally divided;\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>The court is also referred upon this point to 2 <em>Williams, </em>931, <em>note </em>(o); and 731, <em>note </em>(1). And to <em>McMeilledge </em>vs. <em>Barcklay, </em>11 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Raule, </em>103, to show, that the same rule prevails with reference to real estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-5\">In 3 <em>Bro. Ch. C. </em>68, 69, the court say, that the words \u201cequally to be divided,\u201d are the same as <em>\u201cshare and share alike. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-6\">There is another view of this subject, which is supposed to be conclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-7\">It has already been stated, that it appears by the answer of <em>Penelope Beall, </em>one of the testator\u2019s sisters, and whose childred are some of the legatees, is alive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-8\">Now she being alive, how is it possible that her children can take <em>as her </em>representatives? Could the testator have intended that the enjoyment of his bounty to her children should be postponed until her death? (when he gives her nothing,) and yet this must be the case, if they are made to claim <em>jure representations.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-9\">It is clear, therefore, that if they take at all, they must take-in their own right, and <em>per capita.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-10\">The court will find the force which is given to a similar, circumstance' in the case of <em>Blacker vs. Webb, </em>2 <em>Pr. Wms. </em>383, 386, and <em>McMeilledge vs. Galbraith, 8 Serg. &amp; Raule, </em>43.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-11\">But neither of these families of children take by representation. They take in their own right, and <em>as purchasers.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-12\">No estate or interest in the property whatever was given to either of the parents, whose names were used merely to identify the persons who were the objects of the testator\u2019s bounty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-13\">In tracing title to the real estate which passed under this devise,- would it be necessary to mount up to the mothers, or would not the inheritable blood flow from the children?</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-14\">If they take <em>as purchasers, </em>as we think there can be no doubt, then, all who answer the description take per <em>capita. </em>2 <em>Williams, </em>931, <em>note </em>(o); 1 <em>Roper, </em>69, 70. This would be the case, even if the words \u201cissue\u201d or \u201cdescendants\u201d had been used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>In the note (o) to 931 <em>2nd Williams, </em>it is said, if a bequest is made to \u201cissue,\u201d as purchasers, or to \u201cdescendants,\u201d all those who answer the description will take <em>per capita.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-5\">The same principle will be found to be asserted in the same book, 729, and in <em>Crossly vs. Clare, Ambler, </em>397; 3 <em>Swanston </em>320, <em>note to Brandon and Brandon; and Butler vs. Stratton, </em>3 <em>Bro. Ch. C. </em>367. These cases show-, that if the testator in the will under consideration, instead of the word \u201cchildren\u201d \u2022of his two sisters, had used the word \u201cissue\u201d or \u201cdescendants,\u201d as descriptive of the persons to take, that all those who answer the description will take <em>per capita.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-6\">Ours however, is a much stronger case. Here the term used \u2022is \u201cchildren,\u201d which is naturally a -word of <em>purchase, </em>and never converted into a word of limitation, unless absolutely necessary to effectuate the intention of the testator. 1 <em>Roper, 69, </em>70.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-7\">In <em>Buffar vs. Bradford, </em>2 <em>Atk. </em>221, <em>Lord Hardwicke </em>decided, that a bequest to the testator\u2019s \u201cniece, <em>Bujj'ar, </em>and her children born of her body, did not lapse in consequence of the death of the niece in the testator\u2019s lifetime; upon the principle that the legatees took as <em>purchasers; </em>a judgment which <em>Roper, </em>very properly, says, could not have been pronounced, if the child had taken by representation through its mother.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-8\">In the case just referred to, the court will perceive, the mother took as a joint tenant with the children; but in our case, the mothers have no interest of any kind. They take nothing under the will, which passes them by, and bestows the property directly upon their children. How then can it be said, that the children take in right of the mothers, when the mothers have no rights to represent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-9\">The latter clause of the wdll may lead to some confusion, if the relation of the parties is not understood. The testator says in the clause referred to, that the children of <em>Dr. Latimer </em>shall have the same share in case of his death, that he would be entitled to if living.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-10\">This <em>Dr. Latimer, </em>it appears from the petition, is himself one of the children of <em>Ann Latimer, </em>the testator\u2019s sister, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the only object of that clause of the will was, to transmit his share to his children, in case of his death before the testator,</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-5\">Upon the whole it is submitted, that the decree of the or-* phans\u2019 court should be reversed, and a decree passed, direct-* jng the personal estate of the testator to be distributed am.ong the legatees in equal shares.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-6\">J. M. S. Causin in reply\u2014</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\">This case was argued and decided by the court at the June term 1840, and it was not, as the counsel for the appellee is. informed, until the present term that the motion for re-argu-. ment was made by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">After the decision, the counsel for the appellee instructed his client to file in the Orphans Court of <em>Charles </em>county, a copy of the judgment of affirmance, and demand his share of' the property bequeathed; this the counsel is informed has been done, and that the <em>Bealls </em>have received their portions of property graduated by the decision of this court at the June term, and have given their several receipts for the same. Steps have also been taken founded upon this decision by the trustee of one of the Latimers, (heirs under the will) to distribute his property, as an insolvent debtor, with a reference to that decision. Whether the <em>Latimer\u2019s </em>property has been actually so distributed, the counsel for the appellee has not <em>been distinctly </em>informed \u2014 it is probable that such distribution has not been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">The counsel for the appellee regards the motion for a re-argument as somewhat in the nature of an application for a new trial; but he is not apprised that any new arguments have been advanced, or new authorities quoted, to prove an error in the former decision of the Court of Appeals. Under this impression he considers the privilege of re-argument extended by the court to the appellants, as resulting <em>ex gratia, </em>rather than evincing any intervening doubt of the propriety of their decision. In this view he is compelled to repeat to the court the course of argument originally pursued by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">The first point of the appellant\u2019s argument is erroneous. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>It supposes that if <em>Ford </em>had died intestate, the division of his property, as regards the legatees in the will, would have been <em>per capita. </em>It is admitted that <em>Penelope Beall </em>is alive, and that <em>Mrs. Jinn Latimer </em>was dead at the time of the death of the testator. In such case had he died intestate, it is evident that <em>Mrs. Latimer\u2019s </em>children would have only received the mother\u2019s share of the property,- \u2014 -taking <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The second point rests upon a case not presented by the record, of a bequest to \u201crelations\u201d and \u201cfamily\u201d generally, and even admitting the law as therein stated, it affords no rule of construction to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">It is argued by the appellant\u2019s counsel that the \u201clanguage of the testator\u201d is that the residue of his real and personal estate shall be \u201cequally divided between the children of two of his sisters and their heirs forever,\u201d and from such language the intention assumed by the appellants is inferred. No such language can be found in the will \u2014 and the quotation destroys distinctions and divisions in the phraseology of the bequest, which the appellee deems essential to its proper construction. But without particular reference to the appellants\u2019 arguments, the appellee begs leave to state to the court upon what grounds they claim the continued sanction of the opinion delivered at the June term.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Starting with the acknowledged position, that the rule of construction of wills is \u201cthe intention of the testator,\u201d (that intention violating no moral or established legal principle) and that the \u201cnature of the estate passed by the will shall be determined from the face of the will alone,\u201d it is evident that each will almost necessarily presents an original case, \u2014 since the <em>intention, </em>which is the rule, being only deducible from that will, no other will can in the nature of things supply that rule, and consequently other cases of authority can only be brought to bear in establishing the proper construction, in so much as such cases have given a legal solemnity and technicality of meaning to similar terms or expressions used, in the will which happens to be the subject of adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>In this view of the case, the authorities cited by the appellants\u2019 counsel, are only formidable when they arise from cases similar to that now presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The counsel for the appellee respectfully contends, that none of the cases cited are characterized by terms of material import, such as occur in the will before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The bequest in question is in the following words: \u2014 \u201cThe residue of my estate, <em>real </em>and personal, to be equally divided between the children of my sister <em>Ann Latimer </em>and their heirs forever, and the children of my sister <em>Penelope Beall </em>and their heirs forever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The court will perceive, that both <em>real </em>and personal property are the subjects of this claim. Most of the cases cited are confined to bequests of personal property, overlooking the fact, which we deem important, that real estate was devised by this will.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">We do not mean to contend, that the rule of construction is affected by the fact of real estate being devised in the same clause with a bequest of personal property, but that in the present case it forms a material circumstance from which to deduce the intention of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">t The word heirs, in a will, was formerly necessary to give effect to a fee-simple devise of real property; without them or equivalent terms, the devise was only for life, and although by Statute of Maryland this necessity is removed, yet when the word is used in a will, it must be taken with reference to the sense in which it is generally applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">It is evident, from the terms as here used, that the intention of the testator was to give to the children of <em>Ann Latimer, </em>in the first division of the clause, a fee simple estate in the land devised, and it is further apparent, that if the latter clause of devise to the children of <em>Penelope Beall </em>was erased from the will, the intent would still be complete and perfect. In no case could they take more than a moiety, and the clause of devise to <em>Penelope </em>Beall\u2019s[heirs is not necessary, to designate either what share <em>Ann Latimer\u2019s </em>children take, or what quantity of estate,. The interests are <em>distinct </em>and <em>independent, </em>not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>mingled or in common. If the testator did not intend to separate the interests, why disjoin the clauses under which they take; why not give it generally to the two classes of children and their heirs in common.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">There is no reason either in law or the customary usage of phrase, thus to divide the interests, unless it was attended, that in fact they should be so distinct and separate.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">We contend, then, that deducing the intention from the face of the will, it is evident that the testator did not contemplate the two clases of children \u201cand their heirs forever,\u201d common participators in his bounty, but as far as language could convey his meaning, he proposed to divide them into two distinct classes of heirs, to each of which was assigned its proportionate part, entirely independent of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The order of the words used is an important rule of construction in arriving at the intention of the testator, and no words are to be rejected which would aid the court in asserting that intention. 19 <em>Vesey, </em>654.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Too much stress, it seems to us, is laid upon the general current of authorities quoted by the appellants\u2019 counsel, establishing the principle as a general rule, that the words <em>\u201cchildren\u201d </em>\u201cdescendants,\u201d <em>\u201cissue,\u201d </em>designate a <em>per capita </em>distribution. The rule is general \u2014 but it only applies to cases where its general description is not negatived by other terms of bequest indicating a different intention. <em>Davenport vs. Hamburg, </em>3 Vesey, 258. <em>Ward on Leg. </em>123, <em>18th Law Library. Wythe vs. Thurlston, Amb. </em>555.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">We contend in this case, that the separation of interests made by the phraseology of the bequest, the moiety of estate or rnterest first conveyed to one class of legatees, before the other is named, \u2014 the two classes being perfectly independent of aid from each other to ascartain their respective interests\u2014 all go to control the general meaning attached to the word children, as used in the authorities quoted by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">It is argued by the appellants, that the <em>Bealls </em>cannot take by-representation, as their mother is alive. We do not contend for it. We claim that the word children, as here used, is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>word of purchase, \u2014 a designation of a class, not as establishing relationship, \u2014 a term used by the testator as distinguishing those whom he meant to partake of his <em>bounty, </em>\u2014 &lt; that they do take in their own right under the will, and that this term may be used in the distinct limited, sense that we attach to it. <em>Ward on </em>Legacies, 18 <em>Law Library, </em>123. <em>Pow. on Devises, </em>22 <em>Law Library, </em>175.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The court will perceive, that in nearly every case cited by the appellants, a joint property is in terms given, before the division or degrees of interests is specified. Thus in 1st <em>Merival, Dyer vs. Dyer, </em>414, cited by the appellants, the bequest is \u201cto <em>Edward North\u2019s </em>children and <em>Ann Price\u2019s </em>children,\u201d \u201cto be equally divided between them.\u201d The interest first conveyed is joint,- and the words subsequently used dcr - not sever it.-</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Such will be generally found the terms of bequest in the' other cases cited \u2014 =all clearly conveying a joint interest to the parties to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">In the case at bar no joint estate is given, but each class of children takes its share entire and independent of the other* No terms of joint interest are used, either to characterise the estate conveyed in the bequest, or in the interests conferred \u2022 by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">In case of <em>Maddox vs. The State, </em>4 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>John, </em>539, is-much relied on by the appellants. The appellee conceives it is equally liable to the objections urged to the applicability of the other authorities cited by the appellant,- to the case before the court. The clause of bequest in that case, was not distinguished by the distinct separation of classes which occurs here. The terms are,- \u201cto be equally divided between my brothers <em>Justinian </em>and my brother <em>George\u2019s </em>children;\u201d the parties to take are there connected by the copulative conjunction, and no such distinction is drawn, between the interests'of the parties there, as in this case; and if the term \u201cheirs\u201d' had been used, it would have been the common heirs of both* Here the distinct fee-simple interest in half the property is given to- the heirs of <em>Ann Latimer, </em>and there an equally dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>tinct fee-simple interest in the other half of the heirs of <em>Penelope Beall.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The question here involved does not appear to have been argued in <em>Maddox vs. The State. Stone </em>for the appellant only urged two points: 1st. That the bond upon which the action was brought was about twelve years standing. 2nd. That the parties for whom the action i\u00e1 brought, claiming under different rights, could not be joined in the same action.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Although the court concur in the several opinions of the court below, the point which the court seems to have decided was, that limitations to be availed of, must be pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">So that if the court should deem this to he in some measure a precedent decision, it does not seem to the appellee to have been of that deliberate character as distinctly to settle the sole issue here made.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">The court refused to open the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED\u00bb</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
