After adverting to the facts, said the question for the court is, -whether the appellee can recover in this action? It is true that the decisions have reached a great length in extending remedies to sureties for money paid by them as such. They are justly much favored by the law. They may be styled the peculiar favorites of the courts. The case of <em>Parsons and another vs. Braddock, </em>2 <em>Vernon, p. </em>608, has gone so far as to make bail against wdiom judgment had been had, before payment by the surety, liable to the surety. This case, it has been said in <em>Creager vs. Brengle, </em>5 <em>Harris and Johnson, p. </em>234, has pushed the doctrine of substitution to its utmost verge. But I think it has gone beyond the doctrine itself. The case, however, is put on the ground, that at the time of the payment by the surety, the judgment of the creditor against the bail had been obtained, and in this differs from this case. There the liability of the bail had become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>fixed and passed in <em>rem judicatam, </em>and the bail as a debtor, was held liable and to stand in the place of the principal in reference to both the creditor and surety. Here the bail was not fixed at the time of the payment by the surety. The case of <em>Creager vs. Brengle </em>decides, that independent of the act of 1763, if a surety pay the debt of his principal against whom judgment had been obtained, and who had given special bail, he, the surety, could not make the bail responsible to him for the debt. This case, but for the act of 1763, is decisive of the question. <em>Creager, Sen. </em>as principal, and <em>Brengle </em>as surety, executed a joint and several bond to <em>Burke </em>for $1000. The bond, by an equitable assignment, came to the hands of <em>Gebhart, </em>who instituted suit against each of the obligors in <em>Burke\u2019s </em>name, for his use, and obtained judgments. <em>Cronice </em>was the special bail of <em>Creager, Sen. </em>in the suit against him. <em>Brengle, </em>the surety, paid the money to <em>Creager, Jr., </em>the assignee of the judgment against <em>Creager, Sen., </em>and demanded an assignment of the judgment, which <em>Creager, Jr. </em>refused, except upon condition that <em>Brengle </em>would not proceed against <em>Cronice, </em>the bail. This conditional assignment <em>Brengle </em>refused to accept, and filed his bill in Chancery to compel an unqualified assignment or a return of the money paid. The Court of Appeals decided that <em>Brengle </em>was not entitled <em>to the </em>relief asked, and reversed the decision of the Chancellor, who had decreed a repayment of the money. The appellate court in their opinion, say \u201cthat as the bail of <em>Creager, Sen. </em>could not have been m\u00e1de liable, if an unqualified assignment had been made by <em>Creager, Jr. </em>to the complainant, we think the latter ought to have received the assignment which the former was willing to give;\u201d that is, an assignment upon condition not to proceed against the bail. And the court further say\u2014 \u201cBut if we should admit that the bail of the principal could not at law avail himself, by way of defence, of a payment by the surety, and in virtue of which the Court of Chancery had decreed an assignment of the judgment against the principal, still we think that the Chancellor would enjoin all proceedings against the bail.\u201d . In this case the court have decided, .that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>apart from the act of 1763, the surety who pays the debt before judgment against the bail, has no claim upon the bail, and that the bail cannot be made liable to him. For otherwise, <em>Brengle, </em>the surety who had paid the debt,wouldhavebeen entitled to an unqualified assignment of the judgment. Does the act of 1763, then make the bail responsible? This act does not extend or enlarge the obligation of the contract of the bail in the slightest degree. It merely enlarged the remedies of the surety, and nothing more. It affords to the surety the right to an assignment of the judgment against the principal at law, and authorises him to issue process of execution against the principal. The act merely adds this right of issuing execution to the rights previously had by the surety. It leaves the right of the surety, except as above, and the obligation and liability of the bail untouched, and merely affords the surety a new and cumulative remedy to enforce his rights. The right of the surety to be subrogated to the rights of the creditor is not founded in contract, but upon the principle of natural justice. <em>Ch. Kent. 2 John. C. C. </em>130. <em>2 </em>Vesey, 622. And with what justice can the surety call upon the bail of the principal for indemnity ? The surety did not contemplate any such right at the time of his contract. He did not look to such quarter for relief. How then can it be said that it is natural justice that the bail should indemnify the surety? May not the bail have been induced to become bail for the debtor because he regarded the debt safe, the surety being good, and that his risk on this account would be small? The case of <em>Hollingsworth\u2019s Adm\u2019r. vs. Floyd, et. al. 2 Harris </em>&amp; <em>Gill, page </em>87, presented to the Court of Appeals a question similar in principal to the question in this case. There A and B executed a joint and several obligation to C, A as principal andB as surety; C instituted separate suits and obtained separate judgments; each judgment was superseded by D and E; B the surety afterwards paid nearly the whole debt, and by an arrangement with plaintiff\u2019s counsel, issued a <em>ji.fa. </em>for his use on the supercedeas judgment of A, D and E. One question made in the case was, whether the superseders were liable to B the surety? The court in delivering judgment, page 91, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>say \u2014 \u201cThe process was moreover issued upon the supersedeas judgment against A, and his superseders D and E, on whom B in justice could have no claim. If he had satisfied the whole debt, we should have said he was entitled equitably to an assignment of the judgment against his principal, and all liens which the principal had given to the creditor, but beyond this we should have been indisposed to have gone. We could not have rendered others liable to B, whose responsibility was in no sort contemplated when he entered surety for his principal.\u201d The very point was here decided. The cases are analogous at least in principle. It is true the court might have decided as they did, without determining this point, yet they have declared their judgment upon the point. If the superceder, then, of his principal be not liable to the surety, can the bail of the principal be? Is the obligation of the superseder less extensive than that of the bail? I insist that, that of the bail is less extensive, and not of so high a character as that of the superseder. If the surety have no claim in justice on the superseder of the principal, what justice is there in a claim of a surety against the bail of the principal? I can perceive none. Suppose that the bail in this case had also been the special bail of the surety in the suit against him, would it not be strange to say that the bail of the principal was liable to the surety? and yet this fact would not affect or alter the <em>question. </em>Suppose judgment had been obtained against the bail, and he had paid the debt, would he not have as much claim against the surety as the surety has against him? The bail is to all intents and purposes a surety. 10 <em>John. Rep. </em>595.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-5\">2d Point. The judgment below is erroneous, because it does not appear that a <em>ca. sa. </em>against the principal was issued in this case and returned <em>non est. </em>It is clear that you cannot proceed against the bail before a <em>ca. sa. </em>has been issued against the principal and returned <em>non est. </em>See <em>Saunders Rep. </em>2 <em>vol. part </em>1, 71 <em>and </em>72, <em>on notes, </em>and cases there cited. See 1 <em>Harris &amp; Gill, p. </em>154. <em>Cappeau\u2019s Bail vs. Middleton </em>&amp; <em>Baker. </em>For these reasons and upon these authorities, it is insisted that the judgment below is erroneous, and ought to be reversed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Worthington for the appellee</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATS\">contended\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-5\">1st.

The want of it here, is a mere formal defect, and matter of special demurrer. The plea was payment. No question made about a <em>ca. sa., </em>and the demurrer was general, hence that defect cannot be urged. 10 <em>Law Lib. </em>203,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b129-10\">Archer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Afs\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">As there has been an assignment to the surety who paid the judgment, by the creditor, under the act of 1763, chapter 23, the rights of the surety to pursue the bail of the principal, must depend on that assignment. It is unnecessary, therefore, for us to determine, what would be the rights of the surety, as against such bail, where the surety had discharged the debt, either before or after the bail should have been fixed, and where there was no assignment to the surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">The act of 1763, chapter 23, enacts that, where any person or persons shall recover judgment against the principal debtor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>and surety, and such judgment shall be satisfied by the surety, that the creditor shall be obliged to assign such judgment to the surety satisfying the same, and that the assignee shall be' entitled unto, and have in his own name, as assignee, the same-execution against the principal debtor, in virtue of such assignment and this act, as the creditor might or ought to have had-, the* said assignment being first recorded in the said court wherein the judgment shall have been rendered or obtained.-</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The-design of the Legislature by this provision, was-to place-the surety paying the debt, in the same situation with regard to the principal, as the creditor who had obtained the-judgment;- and to invest him with all the rights and powers-which the - creditor possessed, to enforce the payment of the judgment against the principal or, if necessary, against the' bail; or in other words, it was the design, that the assignment\u2019 thus made should carry tire full fruits of the judgment, and the' means of reaping such fruits. Unless such power was imparted, the act would in many cases furnish no indemnity to-the surety. That the act provides for an execution against the-principal, and is silent as to any remedy against the bail, does-not militate against this construction of the\u2019act. It was not intended by this, to restrict the rights of the surety under the assignment; but merely to point out a mode of enforcing an: execution against the defendant: that is, it gave him the pow-er of issuing an execution in his <em>own </em>name. Without this\u2019 provision, as a legal assignee of the judgment, he could have used the name of the creditor in issuing an. execution, and in. proceedings against the bail. - It therefore, in fact, enlarged the power of the assignee, by giving him final process in his own name, and as execution was thus expressly given him, every incidental and consequential right, followed and passed with- it-</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">It is objected' that the proceedings do not show the issuing and return of a <em>ca. sa. </em>against the principal- The pleadings of the defendant do not appear to call-for such an averment on the part of the plaintiff; and we think it was wholly unnecessary in this case. The plea of payment enabled the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>ant to plead non-payment, without any such necessity, most clearly; and if he could do so, he could with equal reason show by his replication, the facts upon which he relied to establish non-payment. The <em>sci.fa. </em>itself, which stands in this action in lieu of a declaration, according to the precedents, contains no such averment, and if the defendant pleads to the <em>sci.fac. </em>such a plea as calls in question the right of the plaintiff to issue his <em>scire </em>facias, upon other grounds than the failure to issue a <em>ca. sa., </em>and to have a return of <em>non est, </em>the omission in the replication to set out such <em>ca. sa. </em>and return, ought not to be considered a substantial defect; nor ought the plaintiff\u00fcn replying to a defective plea to such a <em>sci. fa. </em>be compelled to precede \u2022his demurrer with such an averment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
