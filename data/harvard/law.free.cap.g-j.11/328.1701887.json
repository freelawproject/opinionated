The acts of 1810, ch. 34, see. 4, and of 1832, ch. 295, were the foundation of the appellants claim. The act of 1810, ch.-34, sec. 4, provides, \u201cthat from and after the passage of this act, no devise, legacy or bequest, shall lapse or fail of taking effect by reason of the death of any devisee or legatee named in any last will or testament, or any codicil thereto, in the lifetime of the testator, but every such devise, legacy or bequest,, shall have the same effect and operation in law to transfer the-right, estate and interest, in the property mentioned in such, devise or bequest, as if such devisee or legatee had survived the testator.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-7\">' The act of 1832, ch.. 295, is as- follows: A supplement to. the act passed at December session, of the year 1810, ch. 34,, relating to devises and legacies.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-8\">Whereas, doubts are entertained as to the proper construction of the fourth section of the act to which this is a supplement, and whether the devisees or legatees whose death is provided for by the said section, must be devisees or legatees actually and specially named in the last will and testament or codicil \u2014 therefore, Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland, That all devisees or legatees shall be deemed- and taken to be within the provisions and true intent and meaning, of said fourth section of said act, who are or' shall be, either actually and specially named as devisees or legatees, or who are or shall be mentioned, described, or in any manner referred to, or designated, or identified as devisees or legatees in-and by- any last will and testament or codicil.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-9\">Price for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-10\">\u201cChildren\u201d and \u201csurviving children\u201d stand in the same category in this connexion,, and mean the same thing. The case-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>is one therefore of a devise \u201cto the children of my brothers, <em>John and William Young,\u201d </em>and the question is, whether the children in existence <em>at the date of the will, </em>or those who were living <em>at the death of the testator, </em>are to take under this will? And this is the only question in the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-5\">The rule in <em>England, </em>it is freely admitted, would give the whole of this property to such of the legatees as might happen to survive the testator, in exclusion of the descendants of those who died during his life time. But it was to change this rule, and to convey the bounty of the testator to the children of such of his legatees as might die before himself, that the acts of 1810 and 1832, were passed. And if the Legislature of <em>Maryland </em>have not in point of fact effected that change, it is because the <em>English </em>language did not afford the means of doing so, for they have brought into requisition every term which could well be applied to the subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-6\">By the rule in <em>England, </em>if a father make a will and give his property to his children, either by name or in general terms, all such as die during his life, and their descendants, are shut out entirely, while those who survive him, get the whole. And such is the law of <em>Maryland </em>at this day, if the acts alluded to have not changed it. It is worthy of remark, that the rule thus established in <em>England </em>does not profess to have reference to the intention of the testator, but is founded upon those notions of convenience, in the distribution of property, which prevail in that country. It is placed upon this ground expressly in the <em>English </em>books. The intention, were that permitted to prevail, would, it is believed, in every case be the other way. For when a man sits down to write his will, especially if the condition of his bodily health be such as to place the prospect of death immediately before him, he has reference to persons and things as they then exist around him, and not to their possible condition at any future time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-7\">The rule however which has been deemed wise and convenient in <em>England, </em>has not met with acceptance on this side of the Atlantic. In <em>Pennsylvania </em>no devise or bequest to \u201ca child or other lineal descendant of the testator,\u201d shall be de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>feated by the death of the devisee in the testator\u2019s life time. Purd. <em>Dig. </em>410. 8 <em>Serg. and Rawle, </em>71. In <em>South Carolina </em>the same change has been made in relation to a bequest to \u201cany child of the testator.\u201d <em>Brev. Dig. </em>336. In <em>Virginia </em>to \u201cany child or other descendant of the testator.\u201d 1 <em>Rev. Co. </em>376. In <em>Massachusetts </em>to \u201cany child or other relative of the testator.\u201d <em>Rev. Stat. </em>419, <em>pl. </em>24. And it is not doubted that similar provisions would be found in the laws of most of the States, if we had time and opportunity to examine them. Now would a devise by a father, in any of the States whose laws have been cited, to all of his children, without naming them, fail of taking effect as to any one of them, by the accident of its death in his own life time? If so, every man is prepared to say at once, that in every such case the plain purposes of the legislature would be thwarted by the courts. But <em>Maryland </em>has not limited her abrogation of the <em>English </em>rule, to the mere case of children or kindred \u2014 she has made the change complete, by applying it to all cases. And the doctrine of <em>Maryland </em>is the sensible doctrine, for that which may be deemed a wise construction in relation to a man\u2019s own family, ought to be deemed a wise construction of the same words, in reference to the family of any other man.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0z\">The act of 1810, ch. 34, sec. 4, provides, that no devise or bequest shall lapse or fail of taking effect, by reason of the of the death of any legatee <em>named in the will, </em>in the life time of the testator. The explanatory act of 1832, ch. 295, after reciting, that doubts had been entertained, whether the original law was intended to embrace those bequests, merely in which the legatees were \u201cactually and specially named,\u201d declares, that all devisees or legatees shall be deemed to be within the provisions of the first law, who are either actually named, or who are mentioned, described or referred to, in any last will or testament. The two laws when blended together, as to be correctly understood, they must be, would read thus. That no devise, legacy or bequest, shall lapse or fail of taking effect, by reason of the death of any devisee or legatee, either actually and specially named or mentioned, described, or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>any manner referred to, or designated, or identified, in any last \u2022will or codicil, in the life time of the testator, but every such devise or bequest shall have the same effect and operation in law, as if such devisee or legatee had survived the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-5\">The way to arrive at the meaning of a law, is to ascertain its object. When that is known with certainty, the construction of the law and the effect to be given to it, cannot be doubtful, whatever the words maybe. The act of 1810, comprehends in terms, such bequests only as named the legatee. The act of 1832, was passed expressly to comprehend all such bequests as merely described in general terms, but did not name the legatee, and to subject both classes of cases to the same rale of construction. The preamble declares such to be the sole object of that law. The construction therefore is to be the same in all respects, as if the children of <em>John and William </em>Young, in existence at the time of the will was made, were \u201cactually and specially named\u201d in it. It was the sole purpose of this law to place them in that precise position before this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-6\">What then is the argument by which this view of the question is met? It is, that this being a bequest to \u201cchildren,\u201d those only can take, who according to the rule in England, maybe found to answer that description at the time of the testator\u2019s death. But it is submitted with great confidence, that the very rule by which the legatees are thus attempted to be ascertained, has been repudiated by the Legislature. Such a construction can only be reached by resorting to the condemned rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-7\">The term \u201cchildren\u201d comprehends a plurality of persons, without identifying any individual, and it is no doubt true, that the children who are existing at the date of the will, and those who survive the testator, equally answer that description. But what says the act of 1832? It declares, that all legatees answering such description, shall be within the provisions of the act of 1810, precisely as if they were actually and specially named in the bequest \u2014 and the act of 1810 declares, that no such bequest shall lapse or fail of taking effect by reason of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>the death of any such legatee in the life time of the testator; but shall be as effectual to pass the thing bequeathed as if the legatee had survived the testator. It cannot be perceived therefore, how the construction contended for, can be given. It comes to this, that the act of 1832 does not comprehend the present case, because the legatees are not specially named. The argument is built upon that foundation, and asserts in effect, that the act of Assembly does not comprehend the very evil it was made to cure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-5\">It is said, that there are persons here to take under the terms of the bequest \u2014 that though part of the legatees may have died, yet as the survivors are still the \u201cchildren of <em>John </em>and <em>William Young,\u201d </em>the words of the will may be gratified by giving it to them. But may the words of the act of Assembly be gratified by such a disposition of this property? The meaning of the Legislature is not left to conjecture \u2014 it is plain and palpable. The children are placed by the law upon the same footing, as if they were actually named. The legacy is distributive at the time of its creation, each child being a separate and independent legatee. If <em>Matthew </em>and <em>John </em>have died, their legacies by the positive words of the law, shall take effect in the same manner as if they had survived the testator. And how is this to be done? By cutting them off entirely, and giving the whole to the survivors \u2014 and this, because the survivors are still the children of <em>John </em>and <em>William Young.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-6\">It is again said, that these acts of Assembly have nothing <em>to </em>do with this case, because it is not a case in which the legacies would lapse according to the English law. The answer is, that the act of 1810, standing alone, comprehends every instance of lapsed legacy, for such is the declared purpose of that law upon its face. To be satisfied that this is so, it is only necessary to read the act. And then it may be asked, why was the act of 1832 ever passed ? If it has not enlarged the original law, nor added one syllable to its provisions, what could have been its object? The simple purpose of the Legislature in passing the explanatory act, was to provide, that all cases within the same reason, should be within the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>rule, for it cannot be conceived, why one measure of justice should be meted out to him who is named, and a different measure to him who is plainly comprehended though not named in a will. If the legislature have not placed both upon the same fooling, then any future legislature may despair of doing so, for all the terms applicable to the subject have been already exhausted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-5\">It seems to be supposed, that this court will exert its ingenuity to devise some possible mode, by which some possible operation, can be given to the act of 1832, which shall pass by the case at bar, and if such were the business of this tribunal, and it were no part of its duty to give a fair and sensible exposition to the legislative will, it might still be asked, what manner of case could be imagined as coming within its provisions, with which this case would not naturally associate itself, as one of the same class? There are but two classes of bequests to which these statutes <em>can </em>apply \u2014 those in which the legatees are named, and those in which they are described. The act of 1810 comprehends the first class in terms, and lest it might not by construction include the second, the act of 1832 was passed, having no other object than to take care, that the second class of cases should not be omitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-6\">The whole argument for the appellees, lies in the distinction between a legacy in which individuals are designated, and one in which a class of persons, as a class, is supposed to be intended. <em>For example, </em>if the bequest be \u201cto the ten children\u201d of a brother, or of the testator himself, it is held to be a designation of individuals, and the case is within the operation of these acts of Assembly, and then, whether the legatees die or not, the legacies all take effect. But if the bequest be to \u201cthe children,\u201d leaving out the number, the case is then not within the acts, and such only are permitted to take as answer that description at the death of the testator. Now it must not be overlooked, that in <em>England, </em>if a testator with a family of ten children, gives his whole estate to them by his will, the legacies of all such as die within his life time fail of taking effect, whether the legatees be designated as itidivi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>duals, or merely referred to as a class \u2014 in the one case it is a technical lapse of the legacy. <em>Ward on Leg. </em>163. In <em>the </em>other, the bequest is supposed to be made upon condition, that the legatee shall survive the testator. <em>Ward on Leg. </em>123. It comes then simply to this, did the Legislature of Maryland, in passing these laws, intend to declare, that when a testator shall designate his ten children as the objects of his bounty, none of them- shall be deemed to forfeit that bounty, by the accident of being called off during his life* time, but when he shall not designate them, it shall be deemed a different case entirely, and be perfectly just and proper, that the same persons in the same contingency, shall forfeit the same bounty ? In England, as it has been shown, this distinction has no influence whatever, upon the survivable quality of the bequest; there, legacies of both descriptions fail equally of taking effect; how then, can that distinction be made the means here, of separating these cases in which the bequest shall, from those in which it shall not, survive? Did the makers of those laws intend to preserve what is at best, a senseless distinction, and did they moreover intend to apply that distinction, to a case to which in <em>England,, </em>it could have no application at all?</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-5\">It is supposed, that the legislature did not intend to change-the established rules of law; but for what other purpose was the act passed? Can it be imagined, that they would enact a remedial statute, and still intend to- leave the law as they found it?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-6\">Weisel for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-7\">At the date of the will 1823, there were ten children living,, before the date of the will, some brothers had died leaving children. The petitioners are grand-children, of children who-died between the date of the will and death- of testator, and these appellants cannot claim under the acts of 1810 or 1832, The will applies to the classes of children, as' they existed at' the time of the testator\u2019s death. <em>Roper on Leg. </em>69, 72. The-word children does not embrace grand-children; There is-nothing to identify the survivors; and the words, surviving children, naturally refer to the death of the testator. The term' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>children or surviving children relate to children in <em>esse </em>at death of the testator. 2 <em>Bro. C. C. </em>658. 2 <em>Cox C. </em>190. 4 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>John. </em>539. <em>Pres. on Leg. </em>190.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-6\">The objects of the testator\u2019s bounty are to be ascertained at his death. This is the general rule. If a different construction is adopted, it is by force of the express terms of the will. 4 <em>Paige, C. R. </em>47. 3 <em>Swan. </em>339. 4 <em>Russ. </em>573. 4 <em>Mer. </em>199. 3 <em>B. C.

A bequest <em>nominatim </em>lapses, but the exception in 1 <em>Rop. on Leg. </em>333, covers the case at bar. There is this distinction between a legacy to a class, and to a particular person, in the latter, death occasions a lapse; but not so in the former. To come at the point of this case, the word children cannot mean grand-children. 3 <em>Ves. </em>&amp; <em>Bea. </em>69. <em>Vernon </em>106. 1 <em>Edw. Rep. </em>354. To make the word children include grand-children, the testator must show such to be his intent by express language ; construction will not so enlarge that term.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-8\">The devise is, to the surviving children share and share alike. Will the acts of 1810 and 1832 enlarge that devise? Will they make a lapse legacy, when it did not lapse before, and alter rights. The object of those acts is to prevent lapsing. The act of 1810 applies to specific legacies, and covers devises to particular persons \u2014 individuals only after 1810 and and before 1832, a legacy to one not named would lapse. That is the construction of 1810. The act of 1832, enlarges the act of 1810: affords further but not full remedy. Suppose one not named, but identified, as a devise to his nephew not named or referred to in any manner. The act of 1832, will not aid the case, for it does not mean a general reference. The party intended, must be so named, identified or described in the will, that the court cannot err; that will prevent a lapse in cases when it would have lapsed before. The act of 1832 does not apply here. The legacy being to persons living at the death of the testator, some one must be then alive of the class mentioned to take. The words of the will are not descriptive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>so neither act can help the petitioners. 7 <em>Gill &amp; John. </em>63, and the decree should be affirmed. The act of 1832 is a supplement. It is not retroactive. <em>Dwarris on Stat. </em>680, 681, 730. The.will is to be construed according to the legal course of distribution, and by its whole context. The testator meant* that those only should take who survived him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-6\">W. Schley for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-7\">The words surviving children, as a rule of construction, import those who answer the description at the time of the distribution of the estate, or at all events, at the time of the testator\u2019s death. If this be so, the meaning of the testator is clear. The event gives the rule. It is a voice from the grave. When he gives to A, the intent is clear. When he gives to a class, the general rule applies, that he does not mean to give but to those who survive him. The <em>English </em>law is clear. It is said the act of 1810 controls the will. Then these petitioners claim under the acts, and not under the will. We say he can claim under neither the act of 1810 nor 1832. Those acts are not rules of construction, they are rules regulating the effect of a will. A grant to a dead man by a will is ineffective, if dead at date of the will, but if he dies after the date, then the act applies to him. Here we are upon the construction of the acts; if no lapsed legacy, the acts do not apply. The object of the law was to prevent lapse. 7 <em>Gill &amp; John. </em>63, 9 <em>Gill &amp; John. </em>195. The testator must be presumed to have known the law. Then he knew he need not exclude the children then dead. There is no representation among collaterals beyond brothers and sisters children. The living children of brothers and sisters, are alone entitled to distribution. 1 <em>Harr. &amp; Gill </em>474. The testator did not provide for the children of the deceased children of his brother; where a class is described, the word <em>surviving </em>refers to the death of the testator, and not to the date of the will. 8 <em>Barn. &amp; Cres. 231. </em>15 <em>E. C. L. Rep. </em>206. 13 <em>East. </em>534, 35. 4 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>John. </em>539.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b348-8\">Archer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Acx\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">It has been conceded, that anterior to our acts of <em>Assem</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>bly of 1810 and 1832, the devise in this case would pass the residuum of the estate, to the children of <em>John </em>and <em>William, </em>who survived at the death of the testator, in exclusion of the descendants of such of the children of <em>John </em>and <em>William, </em>as may have died during the life time of the testator. It is presumed, that those persons of the described class, who survived the testator, were the only objects of his bounty, so that if an individual, answering the description of the bequest, who, if living at the death of the testator, would have been entitled to participate m the bequest, happen to die before him, that event, from the above presumption, -will not occasion a lapse of any part of the fund. 1 <em>Rop. </em>333. The case therefore presented, is not the case of a lapsed legacy; or the failure of a legacy to take effect by the death of the legatee; there being persons at the death of the testator, answering the description, who by the established rules by law, are the objects of <em>the </em>testator\u2019s bounty.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">It is said however, that the acts of 1810, ch. 34, and 1832, ch. 295, operate upon this case, and will enable the descendants of the children of <em>John </em>and <em>William, </em>-who died before the testator, to come in for the share their fathers would have been entitled to, had they lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The act of 1810, ch. 34 sec. 4, applied solely to the cases where legacies would have lapsed, or failed to take effect by the death of the legatee, where such legatee was named in any last will or testament. The recital of the supplement of 1832, shows that doubts were entertained whether the act extended to any case of legatees, unless they were specially named, and to remove the doubts, it enacted that all devisees and legatees shall be within the meaning of the act of 1810, -who are, or shall be either actually and specially named as legatees or devisees, or, who are, or shall be <em>mentioned, </em>described, or in any manner referred to, or designated, or identified, as devisees or legatees, in and by any last will and testament.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">It is supposed, that this latter act makes the case before the court, as there are legatees described in the will, who died before the testator. But we apprehend it was not the design <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>of the Legislature to change or alter any of the existing fules in the construction of wills, but simply, to provide for such cases of legacies and devisees, as by the rules of law lapsed, or failed to take effect, by the death of the devisee or legatee in the life time of the testator. Such a construction by no means renders the act of 1832 ch, 295 inoperative, but leaves a class of cases for it to operate upon; as where the legatee is not named, but only described or referred to, as was the case of <em>Castledon </em>&amp; <em>Turner, </em>3 <em>Atkins </em>257, referred to in <em>Ward on Legacies, </em>90.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The case before the court, it is true, is one in which the legatees are not named, but described; but still the legacies are not of that class, intended' to be provided for by the acts. They are not lapsed, legacies which fail to take effect, and are merged in the estate, but which pass to the persons answering the description in the will,, at the death of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
