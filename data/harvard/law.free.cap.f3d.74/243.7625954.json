Sherrod from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his claim for disability insurance benefits. Since we agree with the district court that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to review Sher-rod\u2019s claim, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-22\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b332-23\">On July 18, 1988, Sherrod applied to the Department of Health and Human Services for various disability and social security benefits under Title II and Title XVI of the Social Security Act <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, but the Secretary<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> denied his petition. With the assistance of legal counsel, Sherrod requested and received a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) which was conducted on September 7, 1989. By decision dated January 18, 1990, the ALJ concluded that Sherrod was disabled as of July 1988, thus entitling him to receive supplemental security income under Title XVI. Nevertheless, Sherrod\u2019s insured status under Title II had expired in 1987, thereby making him ineligible for dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>ability insurance benefits. Sherrod did not appeal the denial of his Title II insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">In April 1992, Sherrod filed a second application for disability benefits. The Secretary denied the application initially on the grounds that it covered the same issues which had been decided when the 1990 claim was denied, and the new evidence which Sherrod submitted was not sufficient to cause a change in the earlier decision. On reconsideration, the application was denied on the basis that Sherrod\u2019s insured status had expired. Sherrod continued to pursue his claim by filing a request for a hearing before the ALJ along with a petition to reopen the ALJ\u2019s 1990 decision. In response, the ALJ wrote a letter dated December 8, 1992, to Sherrod stating that his request to reopen had no merit since it was filed thirty months after the prior final decision. Sher-rod filed a request for review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, but the Appeals Council took no action after it found that the ALJ\u2019s decision was not subject to review according to agency regulations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.903.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Undeterred by his previous setbacks, Sherrod continued his quest for disability benefits by filing a complaint in the district court on April 7,1993, seeking judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s refusal to reopen his case. The district court referred the matter to a magistrate who issued a report and recommendation stating that the district court had no jurisdiction to review the denial of a request to reopen a prior, final decision. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation over Sherrod\u2019s objection and dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The decision of the district court as to its subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law which we review <em>de novo. Mutual </em>As<em>surance, Inc. v. United States, </em>56 F.3d 1353, 1355 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The district court\u2019s jurisdiction in this case is limited by the Social Security Act, and judicial review only exists over \u201cfinal decisions of the Secretary.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). As a general matter, district courts do not have jurisdiction over the Secretary\u2019s refusal to reopen a claim since such a refusal is not a \u201cfinal decision\u201d within the meaning of section 405(g). <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 107-08, 97 S.Ct. 980, 985-86, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977); <em>Stone v. Heckler, </em>778 F.2d 645, 646-47 (11th Cir.1985). Nevertheless, subject matter jurisdiction will exist in those cases where \u201ca social security claim is in fact reopened and reconsidered on the merits to any extent on the administrative level.\u201d <em>Macon v. Sullivan, </em>929 F.2d 1524, 1529 (11th Cir.1991); <em>see also Passopulos v. Sullivan, </em>976 F.2d 642, 645-46 (11th Cir.1992). Also, judicial review may be had where the claimant raises a colorable constitutional issue, <em>Callis v. Department of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>877 F.2d 890, 891 (11th Cir.1989), because \u201c[cjonstitutional questions obviously are unsuited to resolution in administrative hearing procedures and, therefore, access to the courts is essential to the decision of such questions.\u201d <em>Sanders, </em>430 U.S. at 109, 97 S.Ct. at 986. On this appeal, Sherrod contends that the district court has subject matter jurisdiction because the ALJ in fact reopened his claim on the merits and because he has raised a colorable constitutional claim. Sherrod also claims that the district court erred by not remanding his claim to the Secretary for further consideration in light of new evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">\n<em>A. Reconsideration of the merits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">In 1992, Sherrod made a request to the ALJ to reopen his 1990 application for benefits. The ALJ responded by letter stating that Sherrod\u2019s request had \u201cno merit\u201d since it had been filed thirty months after the original decision. On appeal, Sherrod argues that this response by the ALJ demonstrates that his case was reopened and the merits reconsidered. We do not agree. The use of the word \u201cmerit\u201d in the ALJ\u2019s letter is a reference to the merits of Sherrod\u2019s request to reopen his claim. It is not, as Sherrod contends, a reference to the merits of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>claim itself. This statement clearly does not touch upon the merits of the prior administrative decision, and there is absolutely no evidence showing that the ALJ conducted a review of the record of Sherrod\u2019s 1990 claim. As such, Sherrod\u2019s argument on this point has, for lack of a better phrase, no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\n<em>B. Constitutional claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Sherrod next argues that the Secretary\u2019s refusal to reopen the 1990 decision constitutes a denial of constitutional due process. In making this argument, he relies upon our decision in <em>Elchediak v. Heckler, </em>750 F.2d 892 (11th Cir.1985). In that case, we held that a claimant raises a colorable constitutional claim if the following criteria are present: (1) he suffers from a medically-documented mental illness which serves as the basis for his disability claim; (2) on his first application he was without the assistance of counsel or other suitable representation; and (3) he cannot assert a new claim for benefits because he now lacks insured status. <em>Id. </em>at 894-95. It is undisputed that the first and third of the <em>Elchediak </em>criteria are met in this case, but Sherrod blithely dismisses as unimportant the element regarding the lack of counsel. We believe he misses the point. Our overriding concern in <em>Elchediak </em>was that the claimant\u2019s mental illness, coupled with his <em>pro se </em>status, prevented him from proceeding from one administrative level to another in a timely fashion. <em>Id. </em>at 894; <em>see Young v. Bowen, </em>858 F.2d 951, 955 (4th Cir.1988) (\u201cIt offends fundamental fairness, however, to bind a claimant to an adverse ruling who lacks both the mental competency and the legal assistance necessary to contest the initial determination.\u201d); <em>Shrader v. Harris, </em>631 F.2d 297, 302 (4th Cir.1980) (\u201cOur opinion applies solely to claimants afflicted by mental illness whose claims, presented pro se, were denied ex parte.\u201d); <em>see also Canales v. Sullivan, </em>936 F.2d 755 (2d Cir.1991); <em>Parker v. Califano, </em>644 F.2d 1199 (6th Cir.1981). This concern is alleviated where, as here, the claimant is assisted by legal counsel who understands the administrative process. Thus, we conclude that Sherrod\u2019s argument of a constitutional claim based on <em>Elchediak </em>fails.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">\n<em>C. Remand for new evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Finally, Sherrod argues on appeal that the district court should have remanded his case to the Secretary for further consideration in view of new evidence. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In so doing, he relies on our decision in <em>Caulder v. Bowen, </em>791 F.2d 872 (11th Cir.1986). Once again, however, Sherrod has misinterpreted ease law. In <em>Caulder, </em>we were faced with a situation where a claimant had come across new medical evidence regarding his disability while his claim was still on direct review. <em>Id. </em>at 875. In other words, the evidence that the claimant had at the time the case was before the district court was <em>not </em>available when his claim was before the Secretary. Such is not the situation in Sherrod\u2019s case. Sherrod\u2019s \u201cnew evidence\u201d is medical testimony that was not introduced in his 1990 application for benefits. He used this \u201cnew evidence\u201d to launch a collateral attack on the 1990 claim by filing a new claim in 1992. Unlike the situation in <em>Caulder, </em>this evidence was before the Secretary and the ALJ when the decision was made not to reopen Sherrod\u2019s 1990 claim. Thus, this information is not \u201cnew evidence\u201d within the meaning of section 405(g) or <em>Caulder </em>that would require a remand for further consideration at the administrative level.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Conolusion</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">The district court correctly concluded that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to review the Secretary\u2019s refusal to reopen Sherrod\u2019s 1990 claim for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-13\">. At the time he filed for these benefits, Sherrod had not worked for six years due to mental problems which gradually were becoming worse. He was unable to attend to personal matters or cariy on a regular routine, and he was withdrawn, depressed, and engaged in no social activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b332-14\">. In Sherrod's district court action, Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, is identified as the defendant. Since Sherrod\u2019s appeal, however, Shirley S. Chater, Commissioner of Social Security, has been substituted as the defendant. Nevertheless, for the sake of convenience, we simply refer to \"the Secretary\u201d when identifying the party acting on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b333-12\">. Sherrod makes the additional argument that the district court erred by failing to rule on his motion for summary judgment. Our conclusion that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, however, makes it unnecessary for the district court to rule on that motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b334-6\">. Sherrod attempts to downplay the importance of the fact he had legal assistance during his 1990 application for benefits by relying on the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Stoner v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., </em>837 F.2d 759 (6th Cir.1988). In <em>Stoner, </em>the court concluded that a claimant\u2019s due process rights were violated even though he was represented by counsel at a hearing before an ALJ. The <em>Stoner </em>court\u2019s decision, however, turned on the fact that the claimant himself was unable to be at the hearing due to medical complications. <em>Id. </em>at 761. Such is not the case here as both Sherrod and his legal counsel were present during the 1990 application for benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b334-11\">. This provision provides in part that a district court \"may at any time order additional evidence to be taken before the Secretary, but only upon a showing that there is new evidence which is material.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
