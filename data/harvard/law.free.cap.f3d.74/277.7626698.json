Walsh.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Haskell seeks attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $8,736 for representation from April 5 to July 8, 1987, and expenses of $159.80. After considering Haskell\u2019s petition, we find that the request is for the most part reasonable and that he is entitled to reimbursement in the amount of $8,676.68.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-22\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b366-23\">Consideration of this petition does not require repetition of the details of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Iran/Contra investigation, the facts of which are generally collected in cases cited in <em>In re North (Shultz Fee Application), </em>8 F.3d 847, 849 (D.C.Cir.1993) (per curiam). Haskell was a friend of Oliver North who helped in various minor capacities with North\u2019s efforts to supply the Contras during the time aid to them was limited by the Boland Amendments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, Haskell helped purchase land in Costa Rica, on which was built an airstrip for use by planes that would provide supplies to the Contras; acted as courier for North and Richard V. Secord, delivering letters and funds to various people; and traveled throughout the world in connection with various transactions involving military supplies. Additionally, Haskell, who worked as a tax preparer, prepared North\u2019s tax returns for 1983, 1984, and 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">As directed by section 593(f) of the Act, we have submitted Haskell\u2019s fee application to the Attorney General and to IC Walsh for evaluation. The Attorney General and IC Walsh have submitted written evaluations of Haskell\u2019s fee request that will be considered in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Haskell is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees under the Act if he satisfies section 593(f)(1), which allows the \u201csubject of an investigation conducted by an independent counsel\u201d to request reimbursement for \u201cthose reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by that individual during that investigation which would not have been incurred but for the requirements of [the Act] ... if no indictment is brought against such individual pursuant to that investigation....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1). As this court has previously held, a successful petitioner must thus demonstrate that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">(1) he is a \u201csubject\u201d of such investigation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">(2) the fees were incurred \u201cduring\u201d the investigation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-11\">(3) the fees would not have been incurred \u201cbut for\u201d the requirements of the Act; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-13\">(4) the fees are \u201creasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-17\"><em>See In re North (Cave Fee Application), </em>57 F.3d 1117, 1119 (D.C.Cir.1995) (per curiam). We will address each of these requirements in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-18\">A. Haskell\u2019s \u201cSubject\u201d Status</p>\n<p id=\"b367-19\">Haskell states that IC Walsh\u2019s office specifically notified his attorney that he was a subject of the investigation. Haskell explains that he played a significant role in several of the transactions that were of great interest to the IC, that the IC required him to provide handwriting exemplars to determine whether he signed various documents in connection with the purchase of the land for the landing strip in Costa Rica, and that the IC also sought to determine whether he profited from his activities. Relying on our prior decisions in <em>In re North (Gadd Fee Application), </em>12 F.3d 252, 255-56 (D.C.Cir.1994) (per curiam); <em>In re North (Dutton Fee Application), </em>11 F.3d 1075, 1077-79 (D.C.Cir.1993) (per curiam); and <em>Shultz, 8 </em>F.3d at 850-51, Haskell asserts that he easily meets the subject requirement since he was told that he was a subject and he believed that IC Walsh might reasonably have pointed the finger of accusation at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-20\">The Attorney General, who consistent with the statutory scheme is not familiar with all details of the investigation and takes no position on whether Haskell was a subject, raises three points about Haskell\u2019s subject status. First, she notes that Haskell only received oral representations that he was in the subject category. Second, she argues that the Final Report does not provide support for the contention that Haskell was a subject since the report mentions Haskell only briefly and does not discuss his potential exposure to criminal liability. Third, the Attorney General maintains that it might be pertinent that Haskell was involved not only in the Contra resupply activities but also prepared North\u2019s tax returns, thus raising the possibility that he was a subject only \"with regard to the Contra activities and not to the tax preparation activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>In his evaluation of Haskell\u2019s fee application, IC Walsh states that Haskell aided North without compensation in the belief that he was carrying out a program for the President and that Haskell accurately recounted his contacts with the IC staff. Based on the holdings in <em>Dutton </em>and <em>Gadd, </em>Walsh asserts that it would be ill-advised and unfair of the government to oppose Haskell\u2019s fee application.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The court has defined the term \u201csubject\u201d for the purposes of the Act\u2019s fee reimbursement provision as a person whose conduct is within the scope of the independent counsel\u2019s investigation and who knew at the time of incurring the fees that \u201chis conduct was within that scope in such a fashion that \u2018the independent counsel might reasonably be expected to point the finger of accusation\u2019 at him.\u201d <em>Shultz, </em>8 F.3d at 850 (quoting <em>Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1078). In the Final Report, <em>Final Report of the Independent Counsel for Iran/Contra Matters, </em>August 4, 1993, IC Walsh mentions Haskell briefly in connection with the purchase of the land in Costa Rica, <em>id. </em>at 59,285; courier activities, <em>id. </em>at 174, 195-96; a proposed transaction to purchase a ship to transport arms, <em>id. </em>at 164; and an attempt to hire a lawyer to represent Eugene Hasenfus, a pilot of a Contra resupply plane who was shot down and captured in Nicaragua. <em>Id. </em>at 166-67. Haskell is not mentioned in connection with North\u2019s tax returns. Though Haskell was a minor figure, his activities were within the scope of IC Walsh\u2019s investigation, as IC Walsh indicated in his evaluation. Further, the fact that the IC\u2019s office told Haskell that he was a subject makes it clear that he meets the subject requirement. <em>See Shultz, </em>8 F.3d at 850 (holding that under any definition of the term, the criterion for subject is squarely met when the independent counsel tells a party that he is a subject). The fact that Haskell was informed of his subject status orally, rather than in writing, is of little importance. Also, based on the Final Report, it appears that IC Walsh was interested in Haskell in connection with Haskell\u2019s own activities and not for his preparation of North\u2019s taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">B. Fees Incurred \u201cDuring the Investigation\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The court has identified the maximum period for which fees can be awarded as spanning from the time when the IC starts an investigation of the individual as a subject until the deadline for filing comments to the final report. <em>See, e.g., In re Olson, </em>884 F.2d 1415, 1421-22 (D.C.Cir.1989) (per curiam). The relevant time period in this case is from April, 1987, when Haskell received a subpoena from the IC\u2019s office, to July, 1987, when his immunity was confirmed. Haskell did not file comments to the Final Report. Accordingly, Haskell\u2019s request for fees from April to July, 1987, satisfies this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">C. The \u201cBut For\u201d Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Haskell maintains that he meets the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement on the ground that his attorneys\u2019 fees were incurred because \u201chis position as a \u2018subject\u2019 was created principally by the decision of the Independent Counsel to treat as a criminal conspiracy efforts to circumvent the <em>Boland </em>Amendments.\u201d <em>Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1080. In assessing the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement of the Act, we have previously noted that a politically appointed Attorney General would not have subjected attempts to circumvent the Boland Amendments to criminal prosecution and thus \u201cthe [Iran/Contra] investigation would never have occurred ... \u2018but for\u2019 the appointment of the Independent Counsel under the Act.\u201d <em>Id.; see also In re North (Bush Fee Application), </em>59 F.3d 184, 188 (D.C.Cir.1995) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">In his evaluation, IC Walsh takes issue with one of the premises underlying the holding in <em>Dutton; </em>namely, the view that his investigation treated efforts to circumvent the Boland Amendments as a criminal conspiracy. IC Walsh argues that he made a conscious decision not to treat as criminal a mere effort to circumvent the Boland Amendments and only did so if the effort involved another crime such as a conspiracy to defraud the United States, perjury, false statements to Congress, obstruction of a congressional inquiry, or acceptance of gratuities by a public employee. While evasion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Boland Amendments may have motivated these crimes, IC Walsh asserts that the mere circumvention of the Amendments was not the focus of his investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">In <em>Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1079-81, we examined in depth the aspects of the \u201cbut for\u201d requirement in connection with the Iran/Contra investigation and accepted Dutton\u2019s argument that his subject status was created \u201cprincipally by the decision of the Independent Counsel to treat as a criminal conspiracy efforts to circumvent the <em>Boland </em>Amendments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1080. IC Walsh charged a conspiracy based, in part, on \u201csupporting military operations in Nicaragua in defiance of congressional controls,\u201d <em>Final Report </em>at xii, and he stated in the Final Report that \u201cthe governmental problems presented by Iran/contra are not those of rogue operations, but rather those of Executive Branch efforts to evade congressional oversight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at xvii. Nothing in IC Walsh\u2019s new arguments compels a departure from the holding in <em>Dutton </em>and we reaffirm its vitality.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">D. Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">As we have often observed, the fee petitioner bears the burden of establishing all elements of his entitlement. <em>See, e.g., Shultz, 8 </em>F.3d at 852; <em>Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1081. To demonstrate the reasonableness of his fee petition, Haskell submits his attorney\u2019s memoranda describing the IC\u2019s investigation of Haskell, attorney time records compiled during his representation, a summary of costs, and an affidavit by his attorney describing his qualifications and his hourly rate. While Haskell has for the most part met the burden of demonstrating the reasonableness of his request, a few items require adjustment for reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">First, the Attorney General questions whether HaskeD\u2019s attorney\u2019s descriptions given of his time expenditures are detailed enough to allow reimbursement under the Act. <em>See In re Meese, </em>907 F.2d 1192, 1203-04 (D.C.Cir.1990) (per curiam) (holding that it was difficult for the court to verify reasonableness of billing where time records did not detail subject matter of work performed and reducing award by 10 percent to adjust for it). Although the descriptions provided by Haskell\u2019s attorney are terse, they are sufficient to show how his time was expended in representing Haskell in the investigation by IC Walsh. For example, the conferences with Haskell are described as concerning \u201cthe facts,\u201d or \u201cimmunity,\u201d or to \u201creview documents.\u201d His attorney also lists meetings and phone calls with IC Walsh\u2019s prosecutors, which do not specify the subject but are obviously related to the investigation. Moreover, Haskell\u2019s attorney provides extremely detailed memoranda recording his conversations with attorneys from IC Walsh\u2019s office. We therefore conclude that the billing records were sufficiently detailed to permit reimbursement under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Noting that Haskell was granted use immunity on July 2, 1987, but is seeking reimbursement for 21.7 hours of attorney time for July 6, 7, and 8, the Attorney General contests these fees on the basis that, absent a special explanation to the contrary, fees incurred after a grant of immunity are not reimbursable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f). <em>See In re North (Carr Fee Application), </em>56 F.3d 261, 263-64 (D.C.Cir.1995) (per curiam); <em>Gadd, </em>12 F.3d at 256; <em>Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1078-79. Haskell states that while he was granted use immunity by a court order dated July 2,1987, he was interviewed at length by the Independent Counsel on July 6 and 7 and his attorney spent six hours on July 8 preparing a forty-two page memo describing the debriefing. He maintains that he was not free from the risk of prosecution until the IC\u2019s attorneys satisfied themselves that the information he provided at the initial interview was accurate and that he had truthfully answered their questions. Thus, Haskell argues that the fees incurred after July 2 are reimbursable since he still was at serious risk of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">Although the Attorney General raises this issue in the context of reasonableness, it actually goes to whether Haskell retained his subject status past the July 2 grant of use immunity. In <em>Dutton, </em>11 F.3d at 1078-79, we concluded that \u201can individual who would otherwise qualify as a \u2018subject\u2019 of an independent counsel investigation does not automatically lose that status (and his right to reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees) merely because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>the independent counsel exercises his discretion to obtain use immunity for that individual in order to secure his testimony against others.\u201d However, immunity does \u201cchange the reasonable perception\u201d of whether the recipient is still a subject of the independent counsel\u2019s investigation, <em>id. </em>at 1079, and the court has denied fees incurred after grants of immunity in several cases. <em>Id.; Gadd, </em>12 F.3d at 256. In <em>Corr, </em>56 F.3d at 263-64, however, we held that Corr retained his subject status until the third grant of use immunity because until then he remained under a reasonable apprehension of prosecution for his alleged involvement with the circumvention of the Boland Amendments. In <em>Cave, </em>57 F.3d at 1120, the court stated that the proper test to determine whether an individual remained a subject after a grant of use immunity is whether the grand jury was examining his conduct in a way that a reasonably counseled person would believe that there was a realistic possibility he would become a defendant. The court concluded that Cave retained his subject status after a grant of use immunity because the government had sources other than Cave upon which it could have based charges against Cave so that use immunity did not protect him from the possibility of prosecution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">It appears that Haskell was still under a threat of prosecution until the IC\u2019s office determined that the information he provided was truthful, and he therefore retained his subject status until the IC\u2019s office was satisfied. Furthermore, it was reasonable for his attorney to attend Haskell\u2019s debriefing by the IC\u2019s attorneys and to prepare a detailed memorandum of the debriefing. Accordingly, Haskell may recover his attorneys\u2019 fees incurred on July 6, 7, and 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Additionally, the Attorney General notes that Haskell\u2019s attorney\u2019s billing entries for April 15,17, and 18,1987, refer to reviewing a Senate subpoena, reviewing Senate select committee rules, meeting with Senate staff, and reviewing rules of procedure for the Senate Select Committee. These entries are mixed in with other items that relate solely to IC Walsh\u2019s investigation and the time is not broken down by task. The billing for these days totals 13.7 hours and Haskell\u2019s attorney has subtracted 3.5 hours for the time he estimates was spent on Senate matters, since fees incurred in connection with congressional matters are not reimbursable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f). <em>See In re North (Shields/Gruner Fee Application), </em>53 F.3d 1305, 1308 (D.C.Cir.1995) (per curiam); <em>Gadd, </em>12 F.3d at 256-57. The Attorney General asserts that Haskell did not adequately explain the claim that only 3.5 hours related to congressional matters and she states that, absent further explanation, a greater deduction is warranted. We agree that Haskell\u2019s explanation is incomplete and we will consider that approximately one-third of the 13.7 hours spent during that period, 4.6 hours, was spent in connection with congressional matters. Because Haskell has already deducted 3.5 hours, we will deduct an additional 1.1 hours or $154 in attorneys\u2019 fees. We will likewise deduct the $9 claimed for carfare and delivery to the Senate.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Lastly, we agree with the Attorney General\u2019s objection to Haskell being reimbursed for attorneys\u2019 fees for a telephone conference with reporters and for the cost of lunch with his lawyer on June 8, 1987. Media-related activity is not reasonably related to defending against an independent counsel\u2019s investigation and is therefore not reimbursable under the Act. <em>See In re North (Gardner Fee Application), </em>30 F.3d 143, 147 (D.C.Cir.1994) (per curiam); <em>In re Donovan, </em>877 F.2d 982, 994 (D.C.Cir.1989) (per curiam). We will therefore deduct the $42 claimed for the telephone conference with reporters. Likewise, we will deduct the $14.12 lunch expense claimed because the cost of meals is not reimbursable under the Act. <em>Gardner, </em>30 F.3d at 147 n. 4; <em>Gadd, </em>12 F.3d at <em>257-58.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">E. Final Calculations</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">In his petition, Haskell requested reimbursement for 62.4 hours of attorney time billed at $140 per hour for a total of $8,736 and $159.80 in expenses. In accordance with the above analysis, we will make the following deductions from Haskell\u2019s request:</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Attorneys\u2019 fees requested $8,736</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Deduction for Senate work $164</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Deduction for media work $42</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Attorneys\u2019 fees awarded $8,540</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Expenses requested $159.80</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Deduction for Senate expense $9</p>\n<p id=\"Anp\">Deduction for lunch expense $14.12</p>\n<p id=\"A5j\">Expenses awarded $136.68</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Accordingly, Haskell is entitled to reimbursement of $8,676.68 for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Based on the foregoing analysis, we will grant Haskell's petition in part and award $8,540 for attorneys\u2019 fees and $136.68 for expenses, making a total award of $8,676.68.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-13\">.
