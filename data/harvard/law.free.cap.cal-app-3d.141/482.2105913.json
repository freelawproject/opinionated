He was charged in Sonoma County with having feloniously taken and driven the automobile and with receiving stolen property. In proceedings to be described, he moved to suppress certain evidence pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5. The motion was denied, and a jury found him guilty of receiving stolen property. The trial court sentenced him to state prison for a term prescribed by law. He appeals from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">I. <em>Procedural Sequence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The principal contention on appeal requires that this sequence be summarized in chronological detail. A police officer arrested defendant in Fort Bragg on June 1, 1981.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was then in possession of a 1980 AMC Concord automobile which had been stolen in Sonoma County on May 28. A two-count complaint was consequently filed against him in the Sonoma County Municipal Court on June 2. He was charged in count I with having taken and driven the automobile on May 28, without the consent of its owner, in violation of Vehicle Code section 10851; in count H, with a violation of Penal Code section 496 in that on May 28 he had received or concealed \u201cproperty, to wit [the] 1980 AMC Concord . . ., knowing that said property had been stolen . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">A preliminary examination on the complaint was conducted in the Sonoma County Municipal Court on June 22. In the course of the proceeding, defendant moved the magistrate for an order suppressing evidence of certain statements he had made to the police officer who had arrested him in Fort Bragg. The motion was made pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5, subdivisions (a) and (f),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the ground that the evidence was inadmissible because it was the product of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>an \u201cunreasonable search and seizure\u201d which allegedly occurred when the officer unlawfully detained him without a warrant and without probable cause for his arrest. The magistrate granted the motion and made an order suppressing evidence of the statements. He nevertheless ordered defendant held to answer in the superior court on both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The charges were restated in a two-count information filed against defendant in the superior court on July 2. He was arraigned on that day, and entered pleas of not guilty to both counts. On the same day, the People filed a \u201cNotice of Motion for Relitigation of Suppression Motion\u201d pursuant to section 1538.5, subdivision (j). It was stated in the notice that the People thereby requested \u201ca special hearing in the Superior Court to relitigate the validity of the detention of the defendant\u201d and \u201cthe suppression of the defendant\u2019s admissions\u201d by the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">A hearing was consequently conducted in the superior court on July 20. Judge Eymann presided. At the commencement of the hearing, the prosecutor requested that \u201cdefendant state for the record the grounds for the motion to suppress.\u201d Defense counsel did not respond in those terms, but he stated that he had \u201cmoved to suppress everything\u201d in the municipal court and that he was \u201cmoving to suppress everything.\u201d Judge Eymann thereupon heard testimony by Fort Bragg Police Officer Amalia Borja, who had arrested defendant in that city on June 1. Fort Bragg Police Officer Robert Wade also testified. At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Eymann ordered the \u201cmatter submitted\u201d and continued it for a ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">At a hearing called on August 13, Judge Eymann orally announced that \u201cthe motion to suppress\u201d was \u201cdenied.\u201d Defense counsel thereupon stated that he had not \u201cfiled a [section] 1538.5 [motion] in [the] superior court\u201d and that he \u201cstill would be entitled to do this which would, in effect, mean that we would have a third hearing which . . . would properly be in front of a third judge . . . .\u201d Judge Eymann did not rule on whether defendant could make another motion to suppress in the superior court; he was not asked to rule; and the prosecutor neither objected nor commented.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">On August 17, defendant noticed a motion, pursuant to section 1538.5, for an order suppressing evidence allegedly obtained as the result of an \u201cunreasonable search and seizure\u201d in Fort Bragg <em>on </em>June 1. An evidentiary hearing on this \u201cmotion\u201d was conducted before Judge Jamar on August 31. After hearing testimony from Officer Borja and defendant, Judge Jamar denied the motion from the bench.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Defendant\u2019s jury trial commenced on September 1. In a verdict returned on September 3, the jury found him not guilty of the violation of Vehicle Code section 10851 charged in count I and guilty of receiving stolen property as charged in count n.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">On October 8, the trial court arraigned defendant for judgment and sentence; denied probation; sentenced him to state prison for the upper term of three years on count II; and awarded him presentence custody credits. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">II. <em>The Rulings Challenged on the Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Claiming error in the suppression proceedings conducted in the superior court, defendant in effect contends that he is entitled to contest the rulings made against him by both Judge Eymann and Judge Jamar. The People have not challenged this contention, but we are required to limit it to Judge Eymann\u2019s ruling because the proceedings conducted before Judge Jamar were in excess of the superior court\u2019s jurisdiction and of no effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">After the magistrate had granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of his statements to the arresting officer, and held him to answer in the superior court, the People requested \u201ca special hearing in the superior court to relitigate\u201d the issues raised on the motion. The request was made pursuant to section 1538.5, subdivision (j). That statute provides that where a defendant charged with a felony moves at his preliminary examination for an order suppressing evidence claimed to have been obtained as the result of an \u201cunreasonable search or seizure\u201d (see \u00a7 1538.5, subds. (a) and (f), quoted in fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>and the magistrate grants the motion, the magistrate\u2019s ruling shall stand unless the People make a timely request in the superior court for \u201ca special hearing, in which case the validity of the search or seizure shall be relitigated de novo on the basis of the evidence presented at the special hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Section 1538.5, subdivision (j), thus describes only the <em>issue </em>which \u201cshall be relitigated de novo,\u201d but it provides that this shall occur on \u201crequest\u201d by the People and not on \u201cmotion. \u201d It thus becomes apparent that the request operates to revive the original motion to suppress which the accused had successfully made at his preliminary examination, and that it is the original motion which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>actually \u201crelitigated de novo\u201d at the \u201cspecial hearing\u201d conducted in the superior court at the People\u2019s \u201crequest.\u201d In the context of the present case, the matter \u201crelitigated de novo\u201d at the hearing conducted before Judge Eymann, on and after July 20, was defendant\u2019s motion to suppress which the magistrate had granted at his preliminary examination on June 22. This was accurately indicated at the hearing by counsel\u2019s references to defendant\u2019s \u201cmotion to suppress,\u201d and by Judge Eymann\u2019s subsequent ruling that the \u201cmotion to suppress\u201d was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">These circumstances invoke the rule, pronounced in a variety of parallel contexts, that \u201cdetermination of a 1538.5 motion at a special hearing in the superior court\u2014whether in the defendant\u2019s or in the People\u2019s favor\u2014deprives that court of jurisdiction to reconsider the matter . . . .\u201d <em>(Madril </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 73, 77 [123 Cal.Rptr. 465, 539 P.2d 33]; see also \u00a7 1538.5, subd. (m); <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Edmonds) </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 605, 610-611 [94 Cal.Rptr. 250, 483 P.2d 1202]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dubose </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 43, 47 [94 Cal.Rptr. 376]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Green) </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 477, 479-482 [89 Cal.Rptr. 223].) Judge Eymann made a \u201cdetermination of a 1538.5 motion ... in the superior court,\u201d and \u201cin the People\u2019s favor,\u201d when he denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress after it had been \u201crelitigated\u201d at the People\u2019s request pursuant to section 1538.5, subdivision (j).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">After Judge Eymann had made this determination, defendant\u2019s sole remedy was to seek pretrial review by petitioning this court for extraordinary relief pursuant to section 1538.5, subdivision (i). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brooks </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 471, 476-478 [162 Cal.Rptr. 177, 605 P.2d 1306].) He did not exercise that remedy. Judge Eymann\u2019s determination otherwise deprived the superior court of \u201cjurisdiction to reconsider the matter,\u201d which means that the hearing conducted before Judge Jamar, on defendant\u2019s purportedly renewed motion, was in excess of the court\u2019s jurisdiction and of no effect. <em>(Madril </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 73 at p. 77.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">It is immaterial that the People in effect consented to the hearing before Judge Jamar (see fn. 3, <em>ante) </em>because subject matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred on a court by consent. (See <em>In re Marriage of Ben-Yehoshua </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 259, 263 [154 Cal.Rptr. 80]; 1 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1970) Jurisdiction, \u00a7 10, <em>p. </em>534.) The evidence received by Judge Jamar, and his ruling, are accordingly to be disregarded by this court. Our review of defendant\u2019s claim of error is limited to Judge Eymann\u2019s ruling on the basis of the evidence presented at the special hearing conducted by him alone. (See \u00a7 1538.5, subd. (j), quoted in fn. 4, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>m.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">rv.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">v.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">We find no error in the denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.
