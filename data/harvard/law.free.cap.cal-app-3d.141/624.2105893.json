The members of its Oakland chapter No. 1 (chapter) include classified employees of respondent Oakland Unified School District (District) who work as security officers. Acting on their behalf, and joined by one of them, CSEA and the chapter petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate and related relief based on the District\u2019s alleged failure to comply with provisions of the Education Code which require certain classified employees of public school districts to be paid \u201ccompensation\u201d in lieu of \u201cholidays\u201d which they \u201close\u201d when the holidays fall outside their workweek. The issue joined on the pleadings in the action reflected opposing interpretations of the statutory provisions as they apply to undisputed facts. The superior court adopted the District\u2019s interpretation and entered a judgment denying relief. The petitioners appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\n<em>The Pleadings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Appellants commenced the action by filing a \u201c. . . Petition For Writ of Mandate (CCP \u00a7 1085)\u201d in which they were named as CSEA, the chapter, and Ralph T. Seal. The respondents named in the petition were the District, its governing board, and the individual members of the board \u201cin their representative capacities as members . . . .\u201d Appellants alleged in a single cause of action as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">CSEA is a nonprofit corporation which represents more than 130,000 \u201cCalifornia classified school employees.\u201d CSEA and the chapter were \u201ccurrently the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit of security officers\u201d who were employed by the District and were \u201caffected by the actions complained of herein. ...\u201d CSEA and the chapter brought the action \u201cas the exclusive representative of said affected employees . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Appellant Ralph T. Seal is a security officer employed by the District. He is also \u201crepresentative\u201d of 16 named individuals who \u201care or have been security officers . . . and are personally and adversely affected by the illegal actions herein complained of.\u201d The District required the named security officers (described as \u201cpetitioner employees\u201d) to work \u201cfour-consecutive-day workweeks in accordance with Education Code Section 45132.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>been required to work 9.375 hours per day, four days per week, from 1971 until November 30, 1978, and ten hours per day, four days per week, since December 1, 1978, \u201cwithout regard to the occurrence of holidays or substitute holidays. \u201d Throughout these periods, the District had \u201cviolated the . . . Education Code by incorrectly computing and underpaying [the] petitioner employees for work performed during weeks which include one or more work holidays.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The allegations of the petition which developed the alleged \u201cviolations\u201d are not readily intelligible because they are made in a chronological context of \u201cgrievance\u201d and related proceedings in which the \u201cpetitioner employees\u201d had allegedly pursued their administrative remedies between 1971 and 1978. We therefore describe the issue of statutory interpretation as the parties argued it to the trial court from undisputed facts, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Section 45203 provides that classified employees of a school district are entitled to designated \u201cpaid holidays,\u201d and that an employee who is required to work on any such holiday shall be paid two and one-half times his or her regular daily pay (i.e., straight time plus so-called \u201choliday premium pay\u201d of time and one-half) for that day.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 45206 provides in effect that a classified employee who works an irregular workweek established according to law, and who consequently \u201closes a holiday to which he or she would otherwise be entitled\u201d (i.e., where a holiday falls outside the actual workweek), shall receive either (1) \u201ca substitute holiday\u201d or (2) \u201ccompensation in the amount to which the employee would have been entitled\u201d if the holiday had fallen within the workweek.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>The parties agree that each of the \u201cpetitioner employees\u201d is reached by section 45206 because of the four-day workweek the District exacts pursuant to section 45132 (see the text at fh. 1, <em>ante), </em>and that each is accordingly entitled to a \u201csubstitute holiday\u201d or to the alternative \u201ccompensation\u201d when a holiday falls outside that workweek. The District has in fact elected not to give any such employee a \u201csubstitute holiday,\u201d but to pay him or her the alternative \u201ccompensation\u201d in money. Pursuant to the District\u2019s interpretation of section 45206, it fixes the amount of the alternative \u201ccompensation\u201d at one day\u2019s regular pay (i.e., straight time) and pays that amount to the affected employee. Appellants contend that section 45206 requires the payment of alternative \u201ccompensation\u201d in one and one-half times that amount (i.e., holiday premium pay of time and one-half).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">After reciting the substance of the foregoing, appellants alleged that they had exhausted their administrative remedies; that the \u201c [petitioner employees have been denied compensation to which they are entitled by statute in amounts to be proven at . . . trial\u201d; and that appellants had \u201cno adequate plain or speedy remedy at law other than . . . mandate.\u201d In the prayer of th\u00e9 petition, they requested a peremptory writ of mandate commanding respondents \u201cto take all action necessary to comply with . . . Section 45206 . . .\u201d; that the \u201cpetitioner employees be awarded damages in the amount of statutory backpay entitlements since April of 1971 as proved at the time of trial,\u201d plus interest; and for their costs of suit and general relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The petition was accompanied by a noticed \u201cMotion For Peremptory Writ Of Mandate\u201d in which appellants in effect requested the trial court to issue a peremptory writ in the first instance. Respondents filed a return in which they admitted the material operative facts alleged in the petition but denied the violations of law charged to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The cause was orally argued at a hearing conducted on appellants\u2019 motion for the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate. No evidence was received, and the matter was submitted on the undisputed facts alleged in the petition. Upon the submission, the trial court ordered from the bench that the petition was denied and that respondents were to recover their costs of suit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court subsequently entered a formal judgment in which it ordered the petition \u201cdenied and dismissed\u201d and awarded respondents their costs. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>\n<em>Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In a case which involved the language of present section 45203 (see fn. 2, ante) when it appeared in a predecessor statute (former \u00a7 13656), a Court of Appeal held that a classified employee who was required to work on one of the specified holidays was entitled to compensation in time off or in money, and that the employing school district was entitled to choose between the two alternatives. <em>(California School Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>New Haven Unified School Dist. </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 919, 921-922, 924 [154 Cal.Rptr. 479].) The court also held that the rate of compensation in either event was \u201ctime and one-half\u201d (i.e., one and one-half days off with pay or the payment of a day\u2019s wage plus one-half) because this was provided by the \u201cclear language of the statute.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 922.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The parties here agree that section 45206 similarly entitles a classified employee to be compensated in time or money when he or she \u201closes\u201d one of the same holidays due to his or her irregular workweek established pursuant to section 45132; that section 45206 similarly permits the employing district to make the choice; and that respondent District has consequently made a valid election to compensate its security officers for \u201clost\u201d holidays by paying them in money rather than granting them the \u201csubstitute holiday\u201d mentioned in the statute. (See fh. 3, <em>ante.) </em>The parties otherwise debate the same issue of statutory interpretation which was joined below on the undisputed facts: i.e., the amount of money payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Appellants stand on the language of section 45206 in arguing that the required payment is time and one-half (i.e., one and one-half times a day\u2019s pay). Respondents continue to assert that the amount payable is one day\u2019s straight pay, arguing that section 45203 requires the payment of time and one-half to a classified employee who is required to <em>work </em>on a statutory holiday; that the security officers involved here are <em>not </em>required to work on a holiday which they \u201close\u201d when\u2014and because\u2014it falls outside their four-day workweek; and that the compensation to which they are entitled pursuant to section 45206 is accordingly one day\u2019s pay (straight time) and no more. Respondents rationalize this interpretation as follows: \u201cLogically, the employee faced with the burden of working on a day when everyone else has a holiday receives time and one-half in addition to the regular rate of pay for the holiday. The employee who enjoys the holiday and who is not required to work it receives either a substitute holiday or the straight daily rate of pay. The legislative intent is that those who work the holiday make a greater sacrifice and should be compensated accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The rationalization is not implausible in theory, but the legislative intent underlying a statute is to be ascertained by reading it in such manner as will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>give effect to the ordinary import of its language <em>(Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224]) and harmonize it with other parts of the statutory scheme in which it appears. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 230-231; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shirokow </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 301, 307 [162 Cal.Rptr. 300, 605 P.2d 859].) Section 45206 is to be read with section 45203 because they are parts of a single statutory scheme which pertains to the subject of \u201ccompensation\u201d payable to classified school employees in connection with the \u201cpaid holidays\u201d designated in section 45203.  We interpret the language of both statutes, and harmonize them, by applying them to a hypothetical security officer who works a four-day workweek for the District in the undisputed factual pattern of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">If the security officer\u2019s four-day workweek runs from Tuesday through Friday of the calendar week, and a statutory holiday falls on a Wednesday, he will work on the holiday. As in the case of any day he works, he will be entitled to receive a day\u2019s pay for that day at the regular rate. Because it is a holiday, section 45203 will entitle him to receive <em>additional </em>\u201ccompensation\u201d for it \u201cat the rate of time and one-half\u201d his regular rate. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">If a statutory holiday falls on a Monday, the security officer \u201closes\u201d it, within the meaning of section 45206, because it falls outside his regular workweek: i.e., outside his \u201cnormal work schedule.\u201d (See fh. 3, <em>ante.) </em>He does not \u201close\u201d the regular day\u2019s pay he would have received for working on that day, because he does <em>not </em>work on it. What he actually \u201closes\u201d is the additional \u201ccompensation\u201d of time and one-half (holiday premium pay) to which he would have been entitled if the holiday had fallen within his workweek. Where this occurs, the District does not give him a \u201csubstitute holiday\u201d as section 45206 permits. Section 45206 alternatively requires that he be paid \u201ccompensation in the amount to which . . . [he]. . . would have been entitled had the holiday fallen within his . . . normal work schedule.\u201d As we have just seen, this \u201camount\u201d is the time and one-half he actually \u201closes\u201d because the holiday does not fall within the workweek. Section 45206 consequently requires that he be paid time and one-half (premium holiday pay) where he \u201closes\u201d a holiday within its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">It thus appears from the statutory language that the Legislature enacted section 45206 to protect the classified school employee on a four-day workweek against the \u201closs\u201d he or she would experience where a holiday designated in section 45203 falls outside the workweek. This interpretation is supported by the apparent reasons for the special treatment of the employee mentioned. The reasons are indicated by the schedule of the regular annual holidays designated in section 45203, of which there are eight. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em>Four of them fall on fixed calendar dates each year, and one falls on a Thursday, but three of them fall on designated Mondays only. (See <em>ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>A classified school employee who has a conventional five-day workweek (Monday through Friday) will receive the benefit of each of these holidays as it falls within the workweek. If it falls outside the workweek, on a Saturday or Sunday, this employee will similarly receive its benefit because section 45203 provides that it will be observed on the preceding Friday or on the following Monday. In either event, the five-day-workweek employee will receive the particular day off, with pay, or time plus time and one-half if he or she is required to work on the day, pursuant to the fifth sentence of section 45203.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The schedule of holidays fixed in section 45203 produces different consequences in the case of a classified school employee who is on a four-day workweek which does not include Monday (such as our hypothetical security officer who works on Tuesday through Friday). This employee will not have the benefit of any of the three Monday holidays in any year (Washington Day, Memorial Day, and Labor Day), nor of any fixed-date holiday which happens to fall on a Sunday (and is observed on the following Monday) in any particular year. The statutory calendaring of holidays thus places him or her at a distinct disadvantage because he or she will regularly \u201close\u201d holidays, each year, where fellow employees with conventional five-day workweeks will not.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The distinction fairly demonstrates that the Legislature decided to hold the disadvantaged employees harmless, from the accidental consequences of their four-day workweeks, by providing in section 45206 that an employee who \u201closes a holiday\u201d by reason of a \u201cworkweek other than Monday through Friday\u201d shall receive either a \u201csubstitute holiday\u201d or \u201ccompensation\u201d in money tor the money \u201clost.\u201d (See fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>There is no reason to believe that the alternative \u201ccompensation\u201d in money was intended to include straight time for a day on which the employee did not work and could not have worked. It follows that the alternative \u201ccompensation\u201d was intended to be the time and one-half holiday premium pay he or she actually \u201clost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">For the foregoing reasons, appellants\u2019 interpretation of the pertinent statutes is correct. They are accordingly entitled to a writ of mandate requiring the District to pay each of the affected employees at the rate of time and one-half for any statutory holiday designated in section 45203 which falls outside his or her four-day workweek. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085; 5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7\u00a7 61, 71, pp. 3838, 3848-3849.) The judgment denying relief in this respect must therefore be reversed. On the remand ordered below, and subject to the trial court\u2019s consideration of matters of detail, a judgment directing the issuance of a writ of mandate will be entered and the writ will issue. This disposition will revive the yet-unresolved issue of \u201cdamages\u201d in the form of the \u201cstatutory backpay entitlements\u201d which appellants have claimed in the action. (See fn. 4, <em>ante.) </em>The trial court will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>resolve this issue, and any problems of pleading associated with it (see <em>ibid.), </em>in appropriate proceedings to be conducted on the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">The judgment is reversed. The cause is remanded to the trial court with directions to enter a judgment granting relief, and to conduct further proceedings, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Caldecott, P.
