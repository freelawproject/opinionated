Miller to all 17 causes of action alleged in the complaint, the parties, by admission and briefing have limited the appeal to the 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th causes of action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stripped to the essentials, these causes of action allege that a fraudulent conveyance, void as to plaintiff creditors, occurred when defendant Miller\u2019s now deceased husband changed the beneficiary on certain insurance policies on his life from his partner in their real estate business to his wife, defendant herein, a few months prior to his death. Plaintiffs, creditors of the partnership, seek to satisfy their claims from such insurance proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">A demurrer admits all material and issuable facts properly pleaded. <em>(Daar </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713 [63 Cal.Rptr. 724, 433 P.2d 732].) The facts, as alleged in the complaint, are that Ben Miller and Tom Oden were partners in a real estate venture known as Pioneer Realty Company (Pioneer). The plaintiff Wongs loaned Miller as an agent of Pioneer $180,700 and the Headens assigned him as an agent of Pioneer a promissory note to be used for land development and investment purposes. Miller and Oden maintained life insurance policies<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on each other\u2019s lives with the premiums paid by Pioneer. Such policies are alleged to be assets of the partnership. The policy on Miller\u2019s life named Oden as beneficiary. Approximately three months prior to his death Miller changed the beneficiary on his policy from Oden to his wife, defendant Ethel Miller. At the time of this change of beneficiary, both Miller and Pioneer were in debt to the point of insolvency. The monies obtained from plaintiffs were not used for real estate investment but to pay the business and personal obligations of Pioneer, Miller and Oden.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">In the fall of 1979, Miller and Pioneer defaulted on the obligations to all plaintiffs and on November 28, 1979, Miller died in an automobile accident. Prior to his death, Miller had sold the Headens\u2019 note without their consent. Plaintiffs submitted claims to decedent Miller\u2019s estate. These were denied except for $44,489.24 allowed the Headens.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>The causes of action against defendant Miller were premised upon her receipt of the life insurance proceeds as fraudulent transfers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court in sustaining the demurrers without leave to amend for failure to state a cause of action cited, without comment, <em>Bryson </em>v. <em>Manhart </em>(1936) 11 Cal.App.2d 691 [54 P.2d 778], and <em>Union Central Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Flicker </em>(9th Cir. 1939) 101 F.2d 857. By such citation, inferentially the court held the transfer was not in fraud of creditors as the beneficiary before the transfer was not the estate of deceased policy holder <em>(Bryson </em>v. <em>Manhart, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.2d 691) and, in any event, the transfer was fraudulent only as to the cash surrender value of the insurance policy at the time of transfer. <em>(Union Central Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Flicker, supra, </em>101 F.2d 857.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">We do not perceive the problem to be so simple of solution. There is a paucity of case law, both in California and other jurisdictions on the issue of whether a change of beneficiary on a life insurance policy is properly the basis of a fraudulent conveyance action, and, if so, the measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">For reasons set forth we conclude the trial court erred in determining plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The general rule in California and other jurisdictions which have adopted the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act is that a conveyance by an insolvent person or partnership of an asset to another without a fair consideration is in fraud of creditors, without regard to the debtor\u2019s actual intent. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3439.04 and 3439.08.) A conveyance made with actual intent to defraud is, of course, also in fraud of creditors. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3439.07.) The creditor\u2019s remedies depend upon whether the claim has matured and include: setting the conveyance aside to the extent necessary to satisfy the claim or disregarding the conveyance and attaching or levying upon the property conveyed (where claim has matured); restraining defendant from disposing of the property; appointing a receiver to take charge of the property; setting the conveyance aside; or making any order which the circumstances of the case may require. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3439.09, 3439.10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>In applying this general rule to an alleged fraudulent conveyance of a life insurance policy the initial problem is determining the nature of the \u201casset\u201d conveyed. When an insolvent debtor transfers a piece of nonexempt real or personal property to a third person without consideration there is a tangible asset of <em>fixed </em>value from which the creditor\u2019s claim can be satisfied. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3439.09; see, e.g., <em>Ahmanson Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tepper </em>(1969) 269 Cal. App.2d 333 [74 Cal.Rptr. 774].) An insurance policy, however, is not a thing of fixed value but is an agreement whereby one party for a consideration promises to pay money or perform some act of value to another on the destruction, death, loss, or injury of someone or something by specified perils. <em>(California Physicians\u2019 Service </em>v. <em>Garrison </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 790, 803-804 [172 P.2d 4, 167 A.L.R. 306], see also Ins. Code, \u00a7 22.) Since the policy is a promise to pay (on the happening of a specified event, such as death), what is the value of the asset transferred in fraud of creditors? Courts have variously determined this to be the cash surrender value of the policy at time of transfer, the premiums paid post transfer or the entire proceeds of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">At common law the creditors of the insured.were allowed to recover the entire <em>proceeds </em>of the policy. (See, e.g., <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Coenen </em>(1876) 1 Ch. D. 636, 641; Cohen, <em>The Fraudulent Transfer of Life Insurance Policies </em>(1940) 88 U.Pa.L.Rev. 771, 775.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The rationale for this rule was that by the payment of premiums the debtor had reduced his assets and the creditors were entitled to the property resulting from such payment, the insurance proceeds. (Cohen, at pp. 775-776.) The harsh treatment this rule accorded the debtor\u2019s widow apparently underlay subsequent decisions of some American courts that the creditors were entitled to reach only the cash surrender value of the policy or the amount of premiums paid subsequent to the transfer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The cash surrender value approach is premised on the concept that the insurance policy is a contingent asset and when the policy is transferred, the creditors are injured only to the extent of the policy\u2019s cash surrender value or the value of the premiums paid. Had the debtor lived, they would of course be unable to levy on the proceeds of the policy. (See, e.g., <em>Union Central Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Flicker, supra, </em>101 F.2d at p. 862.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In states which retain the common law rule<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the ameliorative effect of the cash value approach was attained by the enactment of insurance protective statutes patterned on the original New York Verplanck Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Cohen, <em>supra, </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>p. 779.) The effect of these statutes was to declare at least some portion of the life insurance proceeds <em>exempt </em>from attachment by the insured\u2019s creditors. With this background, we review the relevant California authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In <em>Bryson </em>v. <em>Manhart, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.2d 691, the insolvent insured changed the beneficiary of his insurance policy from his estate to his sister; approximately four months later he committed suicide. The sole creditor of his estate was an aunt from whom he had embezzled substantial sums of money entrusted to him for investment purposes. Inferentially the embezzled funds were used to pay premiums on the insurance policies as the decedent had only $4,000 in insurance prior to receipt of his aunt\u2019s money but acquired some additional $200,000 thereafter. The court ordered the transfers set aside as fraudulent. Citing to <em>Navassa Guano Co. </em>v. <em>Cockfield </em>(4th Cir. 1918) 253 Fed. 883 [6 A.L.R. 1168], the court reasoned the insured changed the beneficiary with knowledge that death was near and for the purpose of removing the insurance proceeds from his estate and the reach of creditors. The knowledge of impending death removed the element of contingency and gave the policy at the time of its transfer \u201can actual pecuniary value closely approximating its face amount.\u201d <em>(Bryson </em>v. <em>Manhart, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.2d at p. 698.) It was this amount that was transferred in fraud of creditors, who were therefore entitled to reach the full proceeds to satisfy their claims.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In <em>Union Central Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Flicker, supra, </em>101 F.2d 857, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit undertook to determine if California law allowed creditors to reach the entire proceeds of a fraudulently transferred policy or merely the cash surrender value. In deciding the creditors were not entitled to reach the entire proceeds of the policy the court distinguished <em>Bryson </em>v. <em>Manhart </em>as a transfer made in contemplation of death and assumed California courts would hold only the cash surrender value of the policy subject to execution. (At pp. 861-862.) The policy in that case had no cash surrender value and nothing of value was transferred, so the policy was a mere expectancy. The creditors were without a remedy as they were not injured by the transfer. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">In <em>The Prudential Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Beck </em>(1940) 39 Cal.App.2d 355 [103 P.2d 241], the court applied the insurance exemption statute to a situation wherein an insolvent insured, whose estate was the named beneficiary, assigned the insurance policies to two individuals. When the debtor\u2019s estate sought to set aside the transfers as fraudulent the court construed the exemption statute to cover <em>all </em>moneys, benefits, privileges or immunities, accruing or in any manner growing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>out of any life insurance, if the annual premiums did not exceed $500. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 360.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court reasoned the plain meaning of the statute was to exempt such proceeds in the hands of the beneficiary from the debts of the insured. (Ibid.) And since any monies from the insurance policy would have been exempt in the debtor\u2019s hands, the creditors could not complain of the transfer of an asset which they could not have reached had the debtor retained it. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court distinguished <em>Bryson </em>v. <em>Manhart </em>on the ground the exemption question was not an issue therein or ever discussed<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>(id., </em>at p. 362), holding that \u201cno transfer of property made entirely exempt by statute, can be held to be fraudulent as to creditors.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 359.)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In our view the trial court erroneously construed <em>Bryson </em>v. <em>Manhart, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.2d 691, to limit fraudulent conveyances of insurance policies to those situations in which the debtor changes the beneficiary of the policy from his estate to a third person. This appears to be the most conventional fact pattern, but there is no reason to make it a prerequisite. In actions to set aside a fraudulent conveyance, the relevant inquiry is whether the debtor has put some asset beyond the reach of creditors which would have been available to them but for the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">In this action, the original beneficiary was Miller\u2019s partner Oden and the insurance premiums were paid from partnership assets. This of itself evidences that the policy was a partnership asset. (See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1944) 65 Cal. App.2d 200, 207 [150 P.2d 287].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Significantly, in this summary proceeding, the complaint alleged the insurance policy was a partnership asset, which for purposes of the demurrer is admitted.  If any insurance proceeds are an asset of the partnership, such funds are subject to claims of plaintiffs as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>creditors of the partnership. (See generally, Annot., Insurance on Life of Partner as Partnership Asset (1974) 56 A.L.R.3d 892.) Moreover, as Miller\u2019s partner, Oden, was the original beneficiary, the policy proceeds, if not a partnership asset, would have been an asset of Oden.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The debts incurred by Miller were on behalf of the partnership (see, Corp. Code, \u00a7 15009, subd. (1)), and were the joint obligations of Miller and Oden. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 15015, subd. (b).) Oden was as fully liable for the debts of the partnership as Miller. <em>(Masoni </em>v. <em>Board of Trade of S. F. </em>(1953) 119 Cal. App.2d 738, 743 [260 P.2d 205].) The partnership itself was allegedly insolvent during this period and the insurance proceeds in Oden\u2019s hands would have been subject to plaintiffs\u2019 claims as partnership creditors. <em>(Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Harbor Ins. Co. </em>(1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 207, 216 [66 Cal.Rptr. 340].) Defendant asserts Oden could have spent the proceeds of the policy the day after receiving them and plaintiffs would be without remedy. As Miller, Oden and Pioneer were insolvent Oden could <em>only </em>have transferred those funds for a fair consideration, then available for plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Had Oden transferred the proceeds without a fair consideration, this too would have been a conveyance in fraud of creditors. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3439.04, 3439.08.)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Assuming that plaintiffs by the presentation of evidence could establish the policy proceeds were subject to the creditors\u2019 claims but for the transfer, what <em>amount </em>of the policy was available to plaintiffs?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Respondent agrees and offers to stipulate that appellants may recover the amount of premiums paid subsequent to the change of beneficiary or the cash surrender value of the policy at such time whichever sum is greater. Since neither value is before us, the generosity of this offer cannot be ascertained. However, measured against appellants\u2019 concession at oral argument that any insurance proceeds attributable to an annual premium of $500 would be exempt under <em>The Prudential Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Beck, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.2d 355, it is more probable than speculative that either value is minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Defendants rely on <em>Union Central Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Flicker, supra, </em>101 F.2d 857, as authority for the cash surrender value rule. The Ninth Circuit did not, of course, <em>decide </em>California law on this issue, but determined only what rule it felt California courts would apply in this situation. (At p. 862.) As noted, the cash surrender value rule arose as a method of alleviating the harsh effect of the common law rule on the widow of the debtor. This same relief, however, is provided by the exemption statute, which was discussed in neither <em>Union Central Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Flicker, </em>nor <em>Bryson </em>v. <em>Manhart. The Prudential Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Beck, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.2d 355, established the applicability of the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>emption statute to alleged fraudulent conveyance actions. There can be no fraudulent conveyance of an asset which is made exempt from creditors\u2019 claims by statute. Code of Civil Procedure section 690.9 would apply in the instant case to exempt the insurance policy cash value or proceeds to the extent provided by statute from execution or levy by plaintiffs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (39 Cal.App.2d 355, 360.)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Assuming the proceeds were in excess of the statutory exemption, may plaintiffs reach the excess? The concern for the debtor\u2019s widow which the cash surrender value rule was developed to address has been supplanted by the statutory exemption. The rationale supporting this rule, that the debtor has transferred nothing of value beyond the cash value or premiums, cannot withstand analysis without this social policy to bolster it. With the debtor\u2019s widow protected, the court must also think of creditors and their widows. (Cohen, <em>supra, </em>at p. 783.)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Clearly a life insurance policy has a present value beyond its cash surrender value. The policy may be likened to a promissory note, payable in the future. The date of payment may be uncertain, but its approach is inevitable.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Cases such as <em>Bryson </em>v. <em>Manhart, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.2d 691, and <em>Navassa Guano Co. </em>v. <em>Cockfield, supra, </em>253 Fed. 883, merely recognize the fact the impending death of the insured increases the present value of the policy to something approaching its face value. It can hardly be said the deathbed transfer of a life insurance policy from a debtor\u2019s estate to another does not \u201cinjure\u201d creditors. <em>(Navassa Guano Co. </em>v. <em>Cockfield, supra, </em>253 Fed. at pp. 885-886.) The insurance contract is a valuable asset of which creditors are deprived when such a change of beneficiary is made by an insolvent insured. We do not perceive that a transfer made in contemplation of death significantly alters the value of the policy at the time of the transfer. If the insolvent debtor abandons his suicide plans or recovers from his illness does the policy suddenly lose the value it had when fraudulently transferred? The fact of the insolvent insured\u2019s death, the contingency which triggers payment, is the critical factor. Were the transferred asset a piece of personal or real property the creditors would be entitled to levy on the present appraised value of the property above any exemption to the extent of their claims, regardless of whether the property appreciated in value from the date of the fraudulent transfer. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3439.09; <em>Vest </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>Superior Court </em>(1956) 140 Cal.App.2d 91, 95 [294 P.2d 988].) Where the property is a contingent asset, the creditors should be allowed to reach the increased value should the contingency occur. We therefore conclude the creditors should be allowed to reach the proceeds of a fraudulently transferred life insurance policy even though the transfer was <em>not </em>made in contemplation of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Appellants assert further error by the trial court in refusing to allow them leave to amend to allege the transfer was made in contemplation of death. The record before us does not disclose such a request but the absence thereof does not preclude appellate review of the issue. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 472c; <em>Faulkner </em>v. <em>Cal. Toll Bridges Authority </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 317, 331 [253 P.2d 659].)  Though the complaint may have appeared defective in this respect, \u201c \u2018great liberality should be exercised in permitting a plaintiff to amend his complaint, and it ordinarily constitutes an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Scott </em>v. <em>City of Indian Wells </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 541, 549 [99 Cal.Rptr. 745, 492 P.2d 1137].) The denial of leave to amend was an abuse of discretion even though the defect appeared to be one of substance. <em>(MacLeod </em>v. <em>Tribune Publishing Co. </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 536, 542 [343 P.2d 36].) By amending to allege the transfer was in contemplation of death, plaintiffs would have stated a cause of action within the strictures of <em>Bryson </em>v. <em>Manhart, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.2d 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">By so holding, however, we do not retreat from our view that if the transfer of the insurance policy was made in fraud of creditors, they were deprived of a valuable asset at the time of the transfer and they are entitled to the proceeds of the policy in excess of the statutory exemption, irrespective of whether Miller intended to take his own life.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court with directions to vacate the dismissal and the order sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend and to enter an order overruling said demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Puglia, P.
