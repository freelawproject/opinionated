J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOz\">Plaintiff appeals from the trial court\u2019s refusal to issue a peremptory writ of mandate, sought to compel the Los Angeles County Coroner to change the cause-of-death provision on a death certificate. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>On June 17, 1980, plaintiff\u2019s husband was killed during a struggle with officers of the Los Angeles Police Department. An autopsy was performed by the Los Angeles County Coroner on June 20, and on August 12, 1980, an autopsy report was issued by the coroner which concluded that the cause of decedent\u2019s death was \u201cCardiac arrest during physical altercation due to or as a consequence of arteriosclerotic heart disease and blunt force injuries to the neck and soft tissues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">From October 21 to October 23, 1980, a jury inquest was held at the request of the Los Angeles County Coroner. At the conclusion of the inquest, the jury found that death was caused by \u201cStrangulation ... at the hands of another person, other than by accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">On November 7, 1980, the county coroner signed decedent\u2019s death certificate, showing that death was caused by \u201cCardiac arrest...\u201d etc., pursuant to the coroner\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Decedent\u2019s widow filed a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court, seeking an order compelling the county coroner to issue a death certificate with findings as to the cause of death which were consistent with the results of the jury inquest.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">We have concluded that plaintiff is not entitled to the relief sought. The law does not compel a county coroner to accept findings of an inquest jury in making a final determination as to cause of death. Nor does reason persuade us that the coroner should be inexorably bound by the conclusions of an inquest jury. On the one hand, it follows logically that if a coroner\u2019s jury is needed to assist in determining the cause of death, then that jury finding should be reflected on the death certificate; but the argument that the coroner\u2019s medical opinion, following an autopsy, should not be inferior to the findings of lay members of a jury is at least of equal weight. Government Code section 27491.5 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cThe cause of death appearing on a certificate of death signed by the coroner shall be in conformity with facts ascertained from inquiry, autopsy and other scientific findings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Plaintiff relies on the language of Government Code section 27504.1, which provides, in pertinent part: \u201cThe findings and conclusions provided for in this article [findings of a coroner\u2019s jury inquest] shall be sufficient to satisfy the cause of death information required in death certificates . . . .\u201d This statute, however, does not state that the jury\u2019s findings are conclusive on the issue of cause of death, nor can it be so interpreted. It merely authorizes the coroner to accept the jury\u2019s conclusion; it does not compel him to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number> Therefore, plaintiff cannot compel the action sought. The trial court herein properly refused to issue a writ of mandate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n                   \u201c \u2018The act which will be compelled by <em>mandamus </em>must be one to the performance of which the complaining party is entitled at the institution of his proceeding. It is the refusal or neglect to perform an act which is enjoined by the law as a present duty that serves as the very foundation for the proceeding.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Palmer </em>v. <em>Fox </em>(1953) 118 Cal.App.2d 453, 456 [258 P.2d 30].)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Amerian, J., and Wisot, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\"> Although the record does not explain the basis for plaintiff\u2019s concern, we assume civil litigation is pending or anticipated in connection with decedent\u2019s death. A death certificate, properly executed, is admissible in evidence. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1281; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 10577.) However, a death certificate constitutes only \u201c \u2018prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated\u2019 [citation], [and is] subject to rebuttal and to explanation. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Pacific Freight Lines </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1945) 26 Cal.2d 234, 238-239 [157 P.2d 634].) Thus, although a coroner\u2019s inquest verdict is not admissible in evidence <em>(Mar Shee </em>v. <em>Maryland Assurance Corp. </em>(1922) 190 Cal. 1, 4-5 [210 P. 269]), evidence may be introduced to contradict the opinion as to cause of death contained on a death certificate <em>(Estate of Scott </em>(1942) 55 Cal.App.2d 780, 782-783 [131 P.2d 613]; <em>Romero </em>v. <em>Volunteer State Life Ins. Co. </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 571, 580 [88 Cal.Rptr. 820]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-8\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
