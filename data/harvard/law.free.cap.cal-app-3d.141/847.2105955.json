Neither a motion for new trial nor notice of appeal was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">It developed that the decedent\u2019s liability insurance carrier was required to pay only $100,000 (actually paid $99,900) and plaintiff filed a partial satisfaction of judgment and then on June 9, 1981, on motion, obtained an order indicating that the partial satisfaction satisfied all liability of the <em>insurance company. </em>This motion was made after the court had issued a similar order (on Mar. 6, 1981) which in addition to satisfying the insurance company\u2019s liability found that defendant and the estate had no liability to plaintiff since no claim had been filed against the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>Thereafter, on February 19, 1982, upon motion of the defendant, the court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> signed an \u201cAmended Judgment on Special Verdict,\u201d in form the same as the judgment entered on May 6, 1980, but substituting in place of \u201c$175,000,\u201d \u201c$99,900.\u201d The amended judgment further indicated that said $99,900 was the entire amount of insurance proceeds available to the estate for the injury and that plaintiff was limited to that amount by Probate Code section 721. The court thereupon signed a \u201cFull Satisfaction of Judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">It is from the orders amending the judgment and ordering full satisfaction that the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Plaintiff contends that the amended judgment and the satisfaction should be vacated and annulled, for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">(1) Defendant cannot raise plaintiff\u2019s failure to file a creditor\u2019s claim in the estate as defect or defense to plaintiff\u2019s case after the action has been tried to judgment, judgment entered and the time to appeal has expired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">(2) Since the complaint was filed within the claims filing period and a timely claim could have been filed had the defendant not remained silent about plaintiff\u2019s alleged failure to file, defendant may not complain now of that defect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">(3) The doctrines of finality of judgment and res judicata bar the trial court from purporting to amend a judgment duly entered when the time to move to vacate or appeal has expired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">(4) The plaintiff was not required to file a creditor\u2019s claim in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">Once a judgment is entered, there can be no summary amendment by the court itself no matter how wrong <em>in law </em>the decision may be. <em>(Barry </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1891) 91 Cal. 486, 488 [27 P. 763]; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1936) 7 Cal.2d 110, 112 [59 P.2d 988]; see 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Judgment, \u00a7 64 p. 3225 (and cases cited therein).)</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">The court has power after final judgment to correct clerical errors in its records and to <em>\u201cset aside </em>any void judgment or order.\u201d (Italics added.) (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 473; 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Judgments \u00a7 66 p. 3228; 5 Witkin, <em>op. cit., </em>Attack and Judgment in Trial Court, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 166, pp. 3585 and 3739 (and cases cited in those sections).)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>In this case the court did not correct any clerical error nor did it <em>\u201cset aside </em>any void judgment,\u201d but rather attempted to amend a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Defendant has not presented and we have been unable to find any legislative or judicial authority to empower the court so to act. We therefore must reverse the order amending the judgment. While this is dispositive of this order on appeal, it leaves unanswered questions raised by the appeal which if left unanswered, would create uncertainty as to what further action, if any, the trial court may take.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The most critical question is whether or not the judgment on special verdict entered in this case is a <em>void </em>judgment which may be set aside in whole or in part by the court that entered it or by other collateral attack long after it has become final.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Defendant contends this is a void judgment in that the court <em>lacked </em>jurisdiction to enter a judgment against the estate if a creditor\u2019s claim was not filed in the estate by the plaintiff as required by Probate Code section 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Plaintiff contends the court did not lack jurisdiction but its act was an excess of jurisdiction and defendant cannot assert this jurisdictional claim after the judgment is final and time for appeal has run.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">\u201c \u2018The word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d <em>(jus dicere) </em>is a term of large and comprehensive import, and embraces every kind of judicial action, and hence every movement by a court is necessarily the exercise of jurisdiction. In the sense, however, in which the term ordinarily is used jurisdiction may be concisely stated to be the right to adjudicate concerning the subject matter in a given case.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Harrington </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1924) 194 Cal. 185, 188 [228 P. 15].)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">\u201cThe jurisdiction sufficient to sustain a record is jurisdiction over the cause, over the parties, and over the thing, when a specific thing is the subject of the judgment.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1917.)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">In this case it is not questioned but that the court had jurisdiction over the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">It is clear that the court had subject matter jurisdiction, and was empowered to hear and determine the cause. <em>(Satterfield </em>v. <em>Garmire </em>(1967) 65 Cal.2d 638 [56 Cal.Rptr. 102, 422 P.2d 990]; <em>Radar </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 243 [317 P.2d 17]; <em>Katz </em>v. <em>A. J. Ruhlman &amp; Co. </em>(1945) 69 Cal.App.2d 541 [159 P.2d 426].)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">Any jurisdictional concept that may be involved in the cases holding the court is without power to grant a judgment against an estate when a creditor\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>has not been filed is not lack of jurisdiction of the cause but excess of jurisdiction. (See <em>Estate of Hincheon </em>(1911) 159 Cal. 755, 760 [166 P. 47]; <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Norton </em>(1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 1, 16 [40 Cal.Rptr. 634].)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">When, as here, the court has jurisdiction of the subject, a party who by his conduct consents to or permits action which may be in excess of the court\u2019s power may be estopped to complain of the ensuing action in excess of jurisdiction. (<em>In re Griffin </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 343, 347 [62 Cal.Rptr. 1,431 P.2d 625]; <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Cole </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 509, 515 [170 P.2d 928]; see <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>194 Cal. 185, 188.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Whether a party shall be estopped from claiming an excess of jurisdiction depends on the importance of the irregularity not only to the parties but to the functioning of the courts and in some instances on other considerations of public policy. <em>(In re Griffin, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d 343, 348; <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Cole, supra, </em>28 Cal.2d 509, 515.)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">In the present case, plaintiff filed his action before the expiration of the period within which a creditor\u2019s claim could have been filed. In his answer, also filed before the expiration of the time for filing creditor\u2019s claims, defendant denied all material allegations of the complaint, alleged affirmative defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of risk, but did not mention the failure to file a creditor\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The case proceeded its normal course through trial and verdict and at no time did defendant raise the issue of failure by plaintiff to file a creditor\u2019s claim. The trial was fairly conducted and the jury, properly instructed, returned a verdict for $175,000. Even after entry of the judgment the defendant did not, by motion for new trial or by appeal, challenge the judgment as being in excess of the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Had the issue of the failure to fije the creditor\u2019s claim been raised by demurrer or by the answer, the plaintiff would still have had time to file a claim before the period to do so had expired. Further, defendant tacitly consented (there is nothing in the record to indicate anything else) to the entry of the judgment and its becoming final. These factors should estop defendant from attacking any excess of jurisdiction that may have resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">An additional consideration is the importance of not disturbing the action, purportedly in excess of jurisdiction, to the proper functioning of the courts. <em>(In re Griffin, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d 343, 348; <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Cole, supra, </em>28 Cal.2d 509, 515.) The defendant permitted the case to consume the time and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>expense involved through a jury trial to final judgment, he should be estopped to now question the efficacy of such proceedings. \u201cTo hold otherwise would permit the parties to trifle with the courts. The law should not and in our opinion does not countenance such action.\u201d <em>(City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Cole, supra, </em>at p. 515.)</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The important public policy that there must be an end to litigation which underlies the doctrine of finality of judgments <em>(Jorgensen </em>v. <em>Jorgensen </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 13, 18 [193 P.2d 728]; <em>Kachig </em>v. <em>Boothe </em>(1971) 22 Cal.App.3d 626, 632 [99 Cal.Rptr. 393]) is an additional consideration indicating defendant should be estopped from attacking the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">We conclude the judgment was not rendered by a court that lacked jurisdiction. At most the court acted in excess of jurisdiction in awarding judgment greater than the insurance coverage. However, for all the reasons stated defendant is estopped to assert any such excess of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The orders amending and satisfying the judgment as amended are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Kaufman, Acting P. J., and Rickies, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied June 22, 1983.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b617-12\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-14\"> Judge Robert J. Timlin who heard the motion and signed the amended judgment was not the judge who tried the case and signed the original judgment and the subsequent orders. However, counsel stipulated that he could hear and rule on the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-10\"><em> City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Cole, supra, </em>28 Cal.2d 509, was overruled on an unrelated issue in <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Faus </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 672, 680 [312 P.2d 680],</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
