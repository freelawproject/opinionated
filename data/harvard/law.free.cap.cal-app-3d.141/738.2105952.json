Petitioner argues that there is not substantial evidence to support the findings of industrial injury and temporary disability. As we shall explain, petitioner is entitled to relief. In annulling the Board\u2019s decisions for lack of sufficient findings on the issue of injury, we do not reach the issue of temporary disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">Applicant/respondent Kevin Conway alleged an injury to his psyche due to stress and strain in the course of his employment from September 1977 to December 11, 1977, as a studio transportation driver and accountant for petitioner Twentieth Century-Fox. Petitioner denied industrial injury, claiming applicant\u2019s nervous breakdown was the result of applicant\u2019s screenplay having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>been rejected by Twentieth Century-Fox, which was unrelated to his employment duties for petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The applicant testified that the stress at Fox was due to his having to work for \u201ca very dangerous alcoholic\u201d who was often inebriated at work and drove erratically. The applicant had to do the other man\u2019s work as well as his own. The applicant became aware of irregularities in purchase orders, billings and receipts in the transportation department, finding that he was expected to sign purchase orders for materials eventually put to private use. The demands of his work increased as his supervisor\u2019s condition deteriorated in December 1977. The applicant was then involved in a minor traffic accident, and on the same day his screenplay was rejected by the story department.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Dr. Alfred Bloch, a psychiatrist reporting on behalf of the applicant, diagnosed the applicant\u2019s psychiatric condition as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">\u201c1. Anxiety neurosis in a passive aggressive personality with obsessional features.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Rule out schizophrenia, paranoid type.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Dr. Bloch explained the onset of applicant\u2019s disability as follows: \u201cMr. Conway provides an extremely complex history of events in the course of his employment at 20th Century Fox Studios. His recollection of these events is confused at best, but he appears to have faced stresses in his dealings with his immediate supervisor, in maintaining various invoices and receipts and in the submission of a screenplay for production considerations. This last situation did not develop as the result of his duties as a Driver, but it is inextricably involved in the other stresses from a psychological viewpoint. Apparently, Mr. Conway\u2019s primary motivation in obtaining work as a Studio Driver was to further his career as a Screenwriter. Thus, his sense of success or failure at work and his psychological adjustment to employment was largely predicated on his ability to further his hoped-for career.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">\u201cUnfortunately, my commentary on this case is limited by inadequate information, the presence could confirm the patient\u2019s allegations regarding his work situation. The situations he described of alcoholism and embezzlement that he attributes to coworkers, are certainly not unheard of in industry, but it is possi-, ble that, to some degree, his recollections of the situation have been infused with a fertile (and distorted) imaginative process. Although it is difficult to separate the facts from fiction, information presented in the patient\u2019s deposition tends to substantiate the validity of some of the events he has described.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>\u201cApparently, Mr. Conway worked fairly consistently for Ralphs Supermarkets prior to employment in the film industry. He also seems to have worked satisfactorily as a Studio Driver for about one year before his assignment to 20th Century Fox Studios. There is, therefore, no evidence of disability prior to December 1977, although the psychological events which occurred at that time are likely to have some basis in the patient\u2019s previous adjustment. Based on his report, I believe Mr. Conway underwent a psychotic decompensation, marked by delusional thinking and withdrawal, and this led to a breakdown in his ability to function at work and more than a year of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">\u201cMr. Conway became over-involved in his work at the studio, unconsciously placing much of the hope for personal success in the acceptance of his screenplay. Anxiety over this situation became generalized to his employment duties in the transportation section. He became obsessively concerned with the demands of \u2018covering up\u2019 both the behavior of his immediate supervisor and what he believed was evidence of ongoing embezzlement. He gradually became overwhelmed. With the initial rejection of the screenplay, his efforts at binding anxiety collapsed, as did his ability to maintain impulse control.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">\u201cIt seems that, a few days later, he misinterpreted what might have been a minor crisis in his department and aggressive impulses, arising in defense of the ego in face of a perceived personal rejection, became unleashed. His reality perception was blurred and confused. Probably, the degree of agitation contributed to the automobile accident December 11, 1977; certainly, it precipitated his leaving work. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Based on Dr. Bloch\u2019s report and applicant\u2019s testimony, the workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) found that applicant\u2019s psychiatric disease arose out of and occurred in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Contention</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">\n<em>Whether the Finding of Industrial Injury Is Supported by Substantial Evidence.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">The determination of an industrial injury is governed by Labor Code section 3600, which requires that an injury arise out of employment, occur in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>the course of employment, and be proximately caused by the employment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The conditions for a compensable injury are met where \u201c \u2018the employment [isj one of the contributing causes without which the injury would not have occurred. \u2019 \u201d <em>(Albertson\u2019s Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(Bradley) (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 308, 316 [182 Cal.Rptr. 304], quoting from <em>Madin </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 90 [292 P.2d 892].) To be a \u201ccontributing cause\u201d of the injury, the employment itself must be a \u201c \u2018positive factor influencing the course of disease\u2019 [citation]\u201d <em>(Bingham </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 842, 848 [68 Cal.Rptr. 410]), or must play an \u201cactive role\u201d in the development of the condition. <em>(Albertson\u2019s, supra, </em>at p. 317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In evaluating injuries caused by stress, a subjective test is appropriate based on the concept that \u201c[ijndustry takes the employee as it finds him\u201d <em>(Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1946) 73 Cal.App.2d 555, 559 [166 P.2d 908]). \u201cThe proper focus of inquiry, then, is not on how much stress <em>should </em>be felt by an employee based on a \u2018normal\u2019 reaction to it, but how much stress <em>is </em>felt by an individual worker reacting uniquely to the work environment.\u201d <em>(Albertson\u2019s Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>131 Cal.App.3d at p. 314.) However, it is not sufficient for purposes of finding industrial causation if the nature of the employee\u2019s duties \u201cmerely provided a stage\u201d for the injury (Tr<em>ansactron Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 233, 238 [137 Cal.Rptr. 142]), if the employment were an \u201cafter-the-fact rationalization\u201d <em>{Albertson\u2019s, supra, </em>131 Cal.App.3d at p. 315), or if the evidence established that the \u201c \u2018employment was a mere passive element that a nonindustrial condition happened to have focused on.\u2019\u201d <em>(Albertson\u2019s, supra, </em>at p. 315.) A finding of industrial injury is proper only where the employment plays an \u201cactive\u201d or \u201cpositive\u201d role in the development of the psychological condition. <em>(Albertson\u2019s, supra, </em>at p. 317; <em>Bingham </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>at 261 Cal.App.2d 848.)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Initially, we find that a determination as to whether substantial evidence supports the finding of industrial injury is seriously impeded because the WCJ and Board have failed to make the appropriate findings pursuant to Labor Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>sections 5313 and 5908.5,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which require that the WCJ and Board specify in detail the reasoning for their decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The statutory requirements that the WCJ and Board state the evidence relied on and the reasons for their decisions were established to avoid careless and arbitrary action and to assist the reviewing court in meaningful judicial review by providing the court with the principles relied on by the Board. <em>(Goytia </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 889, 893 [83 Cal.Rptr. 591, 464 P.2d 47]; <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 916, 924 [126 Cal.Rptr. 182].)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">In the instant case, the WCJ has not specifically discussed his conclusion as to the relationship between the employment and the psychiatric condition. The WCJ has merely quoted from Dr. Bloch\u2019s opinions and applicant\u2019s testimony as to the basis for the finding, instead of providing the reasoning for the decision. In denying reconsideration the Board merely incorporated by reference the report of the WCJ on the petition for reconsideration. Neither the WCJ nor the Board specifically determined if the employment in fact played an \u201cactive\u201d or \u201cpositive\u201d role in the development of the psychological condition, or whether the employment was a \u201cmere passive element\u201d that the applicant happened to have focused on. On this ground alone we must necessarily remand this matter for the proper findings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Further, even if we were to construe the Board\u2019s findings as intending to determine that the applicant\u2019s employment played an \u201cactive\u201d or \u201cpositive\u201d role in the development of the applicant\u2019s psychological injury, we could not hold that the medical evidence relied on herein provides substantial evidence to support a finding of industrial injury.  A finding of industrial injury must be supported by substantial evidence, which includes both competent lay and medical evidence. <em>(Insurance Co. of North America </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(Kemp) (1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 905 [176 Cal.Rptr. 365].) \u201c[N]ot all expert medical opinion constitutes substantial evidence upon which the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>may rest its decision. Medical reports and opinions are not substantial evidence if they are known to be erroneous, or if they are based on facts no longer germane, on inadequate medical histories and examinations, or on incorrect legal theories. Medical opinion also fails to support the Board\u2019s findings if it is based on surmise, speculation, conjecture or guess.\u201d <em>(Hegglin </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 162, 169 [93 Cal.Rptr. 15, 480 P.2d 967].)</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Dr. Bloch admits that his \u201ccommentary on this case is limited by inadequate information,\u201d which suggests that Dr. Bloch\u2019s conclusions are speculative, and therefore, do not provide substantial evidence. The opinion of Dr. Bloch does not adequately distinguish whether the applicant\u2019s employment, the nonindustrial incident involving the rejection of his screenplay, or a combination of the two was the cause of the applicant\u2019s psychiatric disease. Dr. Bloch\u2019s explanation of the cause of applicant\u2019s breakdown implies that applicant\u2019s anxiety was due to his hope that Fox would accept his screenplay, a totally nonindustrial matter. Then, Dr. Bloch opines, \u201cWith the initial rejection of the screenplay, his efforts at binding anxiety collapsed, as did his efforts to maintain impulse control.\u201d Dr. Bloch concludes that the applicant then \u201cmisinterpreted what might have been a minor crisis in his department\u201d and applicant\u2019s \u201creality perception was blurred,\u201d resulting in applicant\u2019s leaving work.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Based only on the evidence contained in Dr. Bloch\u2019s report, we do not believe that the Board on remand could make the necessary findings on the issue of whether the applicant\u2019s employment was a positive factor, or played an active role in the development of the psychological disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the Board denying reconsideration and the findings and award herein are annulled. The matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Feinerman, P.
