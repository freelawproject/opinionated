However, both plaintiff\u2019s counsel and defendants\u2019 counsel mistakenly believed that the complaint had not been filed until November 10, 1977.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Neither counsel discovered the mistake until December 22, 1981, when the true filing date was pointed out to counsel by the court. Defendants then promptly moved for dismissal under section 583, subdivision (b). The trial court thereafter dismissed the action and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">We conclude the action was erroneously dismissed. Trial was originally set for a date within the five-year period, and all the subsequent delays in bringing the matter to trial fell within well-established tolling periods or exceptions to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Trial was originally set for September 21, 1981, which was prior to expiration of the five-year period. Trial was then continued to October 26, 1981, by the written stipulation of the parties. Section 583, subdivision (b), expressly provides that the time may be extended by the written stipulation of the parties. (4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Proceedings Without Trial, \u00a7 95, pp. 2756-2757.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">On October 26 the parties were placed on \u201cbeeper\u201d call due to the court\u2019s congested trial calendar.  Where a plaintiff has obtained a trial date and is prevented from going to trial because no courtroom is open, the delay for court congestion is not counted in calculating the five-year period. <em>(Goers </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 72, 74-75 [129 Cal.Rptr. 29]; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Bennett Cement Contractors, Inc. </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 673, 677-678 [178 Cal.Rptr. 633]; see <em>Hartman </em>v. <em>Santamarina </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 762, 766 [180 Cal.Rptr. 337, 639 P.2d 979].)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">On November 10, 1981, the cause was assigned to a trial judge, but defendants disqualified the judge under Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6. On November 13 it was assigned to another judge, who was disqualified by plaintiff under the same section. The cause was not assigned to a third judge until December 18, 1981.  The period a trial is held in abeyance pending assignment of another judge pursuant to section 170.6 is to be disregarded in considering a subsequent motion to dismiss under section 583, subdivision (b). <em>(Nail </em>v. <em>Osterholm </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 682, 686 [91 Cal.Rptr. 908]; <em>Hartman </em>v. <em>Santamarina, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 768.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>The reasons why this case did not go to trial on December 18 are set forth in the uncontradicted affidavit of plaintiffs counsel in opposition to the motion to dismiss. On December 10 defendants\u2019 counsel had phoned plaintiffs counsel and stated that defendants wanted to go off beeper call during the Christmas/ New Year holiday period. Plaintiffs counsel told him that plaintiff would not consent. On December 14 defendants\u2019 counsel phoned plaintiff\u2019s counsel and stated he would appear in department one the next morning to request the court to place the case off beeper call during the holiday season over plaintiffs objection. Later that day plaintiffs counsel discussed the matter with his client, who then authorized counsel to agree to go off beeper call during the holiday period until January 4, 1982. On December 15 both counsel appeared in department one at which time the court took the case off beeper call until January 4. On December 18 counsel were informed that the case had been assigned to the third judge for trial commencing after January 4. The judge requested counsel to meet with him on December 22 to discuss a date for commencement of trial. During the December 22 conference the judge pointed out, and counsel learned for the first time, that the complaint had been filed on October 1,1976. Defense counsel immediately informed the court he would move to dismiss under section 583, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Thus, the reason this case did not go to trial within the statutory period as extended by the above exceptions was that defendants did not want to be on beeper call during the Christmas/New Year\u2019s holidays. The delay was sought by defense counsel, who informed plaintiffs counsel he would request the delay from the court over plaintiffs objection if necessary. Under these circumstances, defendants should be estopped to seek dismissal under section 583, subdivision (b). (See <em>Woley </em>v. <em>Turkus </em>(1958) 51 Cal.2d 402, 407-409 [334 P.2d 12]; <em>Tresway Aero, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 431, 438 [96 Cal.Rptr. 571, 487 P.2d 1211]; <em>Borglund </em>v. <em>Bombardier, Ltd. </em>(1981) 121 Cal. App.3d 276, 279-280 [175 Cal.Rptr. 150]; <em>Holder </em>v. <em>Sheet Metal Worker\u2019s Internat. Assn. </em>(1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 321, 325-327 [175 Cal.Rptr. 313].) In <em>Holder </em>v. <em>Sheet Metal Worker\u2019s Internat. Assn., supra,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, prior to the expiration of the statutory period, told the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel that he would request a continuance from the court. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did not object to the motion, which was granted to a date beyond the statutory period. However, defense counsel thereafter successfully moved for a dismissal. The appellate court reversed, stating that the defendant had selected a trial date beyond the statutory period, which indicated defendant\u2019s willingness to excuse delay and his apparent satisfaction with his state of preparedness for trial. \u201cHere, [defense counsel] represented to opposing counsel he wished to continue the case for trial. In his motion for continuance he made that same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>representation to the court. Having made that bargain, he is bound by it. To permit him to do otherwise is unseemly. \u201d <em>(Holder </em>v. <em>Sheet Metal Worker\u2019s Internat. Assn., supra, </em>121 Cal.App.3d at p. 327.)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The instant case is practically on all fours with <em>Holder, </em>but even more compellingly requires reversal. Here, at the time of defendants\u2019 request for delay, the parties were on beeper call, ready to go to trial, awaiting only the availability of a courtroom and a third judge. The holiday delay was at the initiative and insistence of defendants. As in <em>Holder, </em>it would be most unseemly to hold that after requesting and obtaining such a delay defendants may, a few days later upon learning the true filing date of the complaint, repudiate their own conduct and instead take advantage of it to secure a windfall dismissal on the eve of trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">We therefore conclude the order of dismissal should be reversed and the cause placed back in the status it occupied before defendants requested the delay, that is, on beeper call pending the availability of a court for trial. (See <em>Diverco Constructors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wilstein </em>(1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 6,14 [85 Cal.Rptr. 851].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although there are no more days remaining in the statutory period, the statute will continue to be tolled while the case is on beeper call due to the congestion of the court\u2019s calendar. <em>(Goers </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>57 Cal.App. 3d at p. 75.) The parties and the court can use the time between the filing of this opinion and the filing of the remittitur to prepare for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The order of dismissal is reversed with directions to the trial court to restore the cause to beeper call status effective immediately upon the finality of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Feinerman, P. J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 19, 1983, and respondents\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 18, 1983.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-9\"> Plaintiff\u2019s counsel looked at the summons attached to his office copy of the complaint, which showed that summons issued on November 10, 1977. He assumed that the summons had been issued on the same date the complaint was filed. In the fall of 1980, an associate in the office of defendants\u2019 counsel telephoned the civil registrar\u2019s office, asked for the filing date in the action, and was also given the date of November 10, 1977. ,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b112-5\"><em> Holder </em>arose under Code of Civil Procedure section 583, subdivision (c), an analogous provision requiring that a case be brought to trial within three years from the filing of the remittitur after reversal on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b113-10\"> Neither party was aware of the five-year problem when the holiday delay was requested. It is of course plaintiff\u2019s duty, not defendants\u2019, to be aware of the pertinent date and to see that the case is brought to trial within five years. But this is not a case of a defendant\u2019s mere participation in a pretrial conference, which has been held not to estop a defendant\u2019s reliance upon section 583, subdivision (b). <em>(Lane </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1964) 227 Cal.App. 60, 63 [38 Cal.Rptr. 425]; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Groom Trucking Co. </em>(1962) 206 Cal.App.2d 485, 493 [24 Cal.Rptr. 80]; <em>Singelyn </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 972, 974 [133 Cal.Rptr. 486]; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>78 Cal.App.3d 192, 196.) Here the parties were on beeper call ready for trial, and the delay was requested by defendants. It appears that in <em>Holder </em>also, both counsel were ignorant of the statutory deadline. Although the defendant\u2019s conduct was not fraudulent, the court still held the defendant could not take advantage of its own deliberate request for delay. (See <em>Holder </em>v. <em>Sheet Metal Worker\u2019s Internat. Assn., supra, </em>121 Cal.App.3d at pp. 323, 324.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b113-11\"> The trial judge who ordered the dismissal has since retired.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
