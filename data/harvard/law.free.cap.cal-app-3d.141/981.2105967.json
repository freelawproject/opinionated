To investigate this claim, on two separate occasions the Department sent a different male investigator to Chippendale\u2019s in November 1980. They each were denied entry to the show which featured male <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>performers<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because they (the investigators) were men. They were told the performance was for \u201cladies only.\u201d The owner of Chippendale\u2019s also informed a third investigator that men were not permitted to attend shows featuring the male dancers.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Two advertisements placed by Chippendale\u2019s in the Los Angeles Times were received in evidence at the hearing. One half of the first ad is a photograph of a man\u2019s head. At its top in large bold print is the phrase \u201cLadies Only\u201d; the rest of the ad recites the time of performance, method of making reservations, and location of the premises. In the other ad, a photograph of a man\u2019s upper torso is prominently featured. It then states that on various evenings the show times are 6:45, 8:30 and 9:00 and concludes, \u201cGentlemen Welcome after 10:15.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">It was further established that Chippendale\u2019s possessed a license permitting on premises sale and consumption of liquor and that liquor was sold during the performances of the male dancers.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The thrust of the testimony offered by Chippendale\u2019s was that it did not engage in discriminatory admittance practices. Chippendale\u2019s personnel testified that they did not categorically deny admission to men. Rather, they claimed, if men sought entrance, they were told that the show was designed specifically for women, that the presence of male customers would inhibit the male performers and the female audience, and that the show as presented was not the type of entertainment men would be expected to enjoy. Following such explanation, the prospective admittee would be informed he might enter the. premises after the show was completed, thereby availing himself of an opportunity to mingle with the female customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Chippendale\u2019s also offered testimony designed to prove that if men were present, the \u201cvibrant and alive\u201d interaction between the male performers and the female audience would be inhibited. The director of the show explained the necessity for excluding men by analogizing to a children\u2019s show he had created, in which he had discouraged die children\u2019s parents from attending. He asserted that just as a lack of parental attendance encouraged the children to be creative, the lack of male presence permitted the women to engage in \u201call of that screaming and jumping up and down . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Following a three-day hearing, the administrative law judge found the allegations of gender-based discrimination to be true in that on two occasions Chippendale\u2019s had refused entrance to a male inspector of the Department. Such conduct was held to violate Civil Code section 51 and Business and Professions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>Code section 125.6.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The penalty recommended was revocation of Chippendale\u2019s liquor license. This revocation, however, would be stayed if Chippendale\u2019s agreed to file a corporate declaration stating that in the future it would not discriminate \u201cagainst persons solely because of their male sex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Thereafter, the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control adopted the decision and recommendation of the administrative law judge. In turn, Chippendale\u2019s appealed to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board to contest the Department\u2019s decision. After the submission of written briefs and consideration of oral argument, the appeals board filed a unanimous 18-page opinion in which it explained its affirmance of the Department\u2019s decision. Chippendale\u2019s then sought further review in this court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When we summarily denied the request, it petitioned the Supreme Court for a hearing. That court granted hearing but retransferred the cause to us with directions to issue a writ of review. We have done so and now set forth our analysis of the salient points.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The determination of whether good cause exists to revoke a license is a matter within the discretion of the Department and not the courts. <em>(Department of Alcoholic Bev. Control </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 720, 726 [173 Cal.Rptr. 582].) Our inquiry is limited to determining whether there is substantial evidence to support the decision of the Department. (K<em>irby </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 433, 436 [102 Cal.Rptr. 857, 498 P.2d 1105]; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 23090.2.) Therefore, to the extent that Chippendale\u2019s present claim of error is based on the argument that there was no evidence of gender-based discrimination, it necessarily fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Conflicting evidence on the issue was presented at the administrative hearing and its was resolved adversely to Chippendale\u2019s. Quite apart from the testimony of Chippendale\u2019s own personnel which chronicled their conceded attempts to dissuade potential male customers, the testimony of the Department investigators and the Chippendale\u2019s advertisements placed in the Los Angeles Times, clearly constituted substantial evidence upon which to base a finding of a sexually discriminatory admittance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Such discrimination having been established, the Department\u2019s authority to revoke the liquor license is clear. Article XX, section 22, of the California Constitution vests in the Department the power to revoke \u201cany specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>alcoholic beverages license if it shall determine for good cause that the . . . continuance of such license would be contrary to public welfare . . . .\u201d The apposite public policy is set forth in Civil Code section 51 (the Unruh Civil Rights Act). In pertinent part it provides: \u201cAll persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no matter what their sex . . . are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Chippendale\u2019s is undisputedly a business establishment within the meaning of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. <em>(In re Cox </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 205 [90 Cal.Rptr. 24, 474 P.2d 992]; see also <em>Stoumen </em>v. <em>Reilly </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 713 [234 P.2d 969]; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Fong Poy </em>(1941) 42 Cal.App.2d 320 [108 P.2d 942].) It has been granted a license which permits it to sell and serve \u201calcoholic beverages to the public for consumption on the premises.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 23039, subd. (a)(1).)  Its acceptance of this license imposes upon it the corollary duty to refrain from any sex discrimination in performing the licensed activity. A failure to honor this obligation provides a basis for revocation of the license (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 125.6.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Chippendale\u2019s violated its responsibilities by refusing admittance to customers solely because they were men.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">To avoid the force of this conclusion, Chippendale\u2019s argues that its male dancers engage in a form of communication protected by the First Amendment so that the revocation of its license acts as an impermissible restriction on constitutionally protected speech. This argument is quite unpersuasive since in so far as these proceedings are concerned, its factual predicate is false. Nothing in the Department\u2019s decision will, per se, preclude Chippendale\u2019s from continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>to \u201cspeak out\u201d through this form of entertainment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> All that will be withdrawn is its privilege to sell alcoholic beverages while it is so engaged. In addition, no citizen has a constitutional right to demand the use of a <em>public </em>platform when he wishes to expose his views only to that segment of the populace he believes will regard them with favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\">Of course, Chippendale\u2019s also has the alternative of practicing a nondiscriminatory admittance policy and thereby retaining its liquor license. It may be true as it asserts, that if it is forced to admit men under the Unruh Act, the ultimate result will be the commercial demise of the program since women would no longer wish to attend. However, such fact, if it be a fact, is not determinative. An entrepreneur\u2019s discriminatory practice based upon ostensible rational economic self-interest still violates public policy as codified in Civil Code section 51. <em>(Marina Point, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Wolfson, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 721, 740-741, fn. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">We must also reject Chippendale\u2019s contention that its exclusion of men is not the type of \u201carbitrary\u201d discrimination prohibited by the Unruh Act. (See fn. 4, <em>supra; Hales </em>v. <em>Ojai Valley Inn &amp; Country Club </em>(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 25, 28-29 [140 Cal.Rptr. 555, 89 A.L.R.3d 1].) Essentially, it is urged that changing social perspectives recognize that in some situations a policy founded on gender-based discrimination is consistent with everyday realities and in fact inures to the benefit of those who have been the victims of past societal and legal discrimination. It is true that under this concept, certain governmental practices have successfully withstood claims of impermissible sex discrimination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, were we the triers of fact, or were we writing on an entirely clear slate, we might find such theory persuasive here. However, we do not regard it to be within the purview of an intermediate appellate court, at this late date, to substitute its perspective for that of the Department and to hold that Chippendale\u2019s challenged practices constitute an exception to the Unruh Act <em>as a matter of law </em>because they are \u201cbenignly inspired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>The decision of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is affirmed, and the petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Compton, Acting P.
