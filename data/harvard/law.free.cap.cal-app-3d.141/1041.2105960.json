(Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6627-6629; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.) The judgment had the effect of affirming a decision against appellant by the Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board (hereafter, Board). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-13\">On April 12, 1976, appellant\u2019s construction site in San Francisco was cited for single violations of title 8, section 1644, subdivision (a)(6), and section 1768, of the California Administrative Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Hereafter, respectively, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>scaffold regulation and the powerline regulation.) Appellant contested the citations at a hearing before an administrative law judge, who found that the violations were established. The Board upheld this decision on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The evidence showed that on the date in question appellant\u2019s employees \\Vorked on a scaffold platform about 25 feet above ground level. The scaffold had no railings. An engineer, Wilbrecht, from the Division of Industrial Safety, testified that the platform was two and one-half feet horizontally from the vertical line of a high-voltage wire, and approximately seven and one-half feet vertically below the horizontal line of the wire. (Based on this evidence, the diagonal line from the platform to the wire was less than eight feet.)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Wilbrecht stated that the power pole from which the wire ran bore \u201cthe normal yellow type plaque that says \u2018High Voltage.\u2019\u201d There also was a transformer of the type that steps down voltage to the low-voltage level used by residences. He stated that he recognized the insulators as being the kind \u201cthat are usually installed on high voltage lines,\u201d and that his eight to ten experiences with such situations in San Francisco led him to believe that all transmission lines in the city carry a force of 4,000 or more volts. He also stated that in his discussion of the problem on the scene with an engineer from Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E), the engineer referred to the wire as a \u201chigh-voltage\u201d wire.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Appellant offered only the testimony of co-owner Martin Gaehwiler. He stated that he was vacationing on the day in question; that he instructed his foreman to use a painter\u2019s scaffold; that the foreman, whom he knew was reluctant to use such scaffolding, disobeyed the order. The other co-owner, John Gaehwiler, was in San Francisco but \u201crefuses to have anything to do with\u201d construction of the kind involved here. Apparently, this refusal extended to cases where Martin Gaehwiler could not be present to supervise the company\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Appellant contends that it should not be held liable for the conceded violation of the scaffold regulation, because the violation was committed by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>employee, in violation of instructions, while one co-owner was absent. The argument relies on a four-prong defense described in <em>Newbery Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>Occupational Safety &amp; Health Appeals Bd. </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 641, 649 [176 Cal.Rptr. 734].</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">As we read that case, it states that the violation is deemed unforeseeable, therefore not punishable, if none of the following four criteria exist: (1) that the employer knew or should have known of the potential danger to employees; (2) that the employer failed to exercise supervision adequate to assure safety; (3) that the employer failed to ensure employee compliance with its safety rules; and (4) that the violation was foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\"> Aside from the question of which party bore the burden of proof of such issues, here the evidence was sufficient<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to support findings against appellant on all four criteria,  The testimony of Martin Gaehwiler showed that (1) he had reason to doubt whether the employee would use a painter\u2019s scaffold as instructed, (2) John Gaehwiler was available to supervise, but chose not to, (3) appellant did not act to force its employees to wear hard hats, or to keep safety information posted, and (4) a violation of the scaffold regulation was foreseeable, if only because the scaffold in question included an equivalent, though uncharged, violation at a lower height, which was a product of appellant\u2019s judgment, not the employee\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Obviously, the <em>Newbery </em>defense is of no assistance to this appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Appellant makes two arguments concerning the powerline violation: first, that the <em>Newbery </em>defense was established here; second, that there was insufficient evidence of the violation itself. Neither has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">First, Martin Gaehwiler\u2019s own testimony established his employee would have violated the powerline regulation even had he followed instructions and used the painter\u2019s scaffold.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">The second argument is two-fold. Appellant challenges Wilbrecht\u2019s lay testimony that the line carried more than 750 volts as unimportant, hearsay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>evidence. Assuming arguendo that Evidence Code provisions governing expert testimony apply (cf. Gov. Code, \u00a7 11513, subd. (c); Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 8, \u00a7 376.2), appellant waived any claim of error by failing to object to the testimony (Evid. Code, \u00a7 353). Moreover, we believe this was proper opinion testimony. (Cf. Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 800-803.) Additionally Wilbrecht\u2019s testimony concerning the \u201chigh voltage\u201d warning marking was no more hearsay than testimony that a stop sign is a traffic control device intended to make motorists stop at an intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Appellant argues further that there was no evidence that the line was \u201cenergized.\u201d In doing so, it overlooks the requirement of the substantial evidence rule (fh. 2, <em>ante) </em>that the court indulges all reasonable and legitimate inferences favoring support of the judgment. Both Wilbrecht and Martin Gaehwiler testified to conversations with a PG&amp;E engineer at about the time of this violation. From the engineer\u2019s apparently clear understanding of Wilbrecht\u2019s description of the problem and expressed disapproval of Gaehwiler\u2019s plans, it was entirely legitimate to infer that the line was energized. Moreover, the mere fact that the line was marked \u201chigh voltage\u201d is sufficient to prove that it was energized where, as here, there is absolutely no contrary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The judgment denying the peremptory writ of mandate is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b729-14\"> Before Racanelli, P.
