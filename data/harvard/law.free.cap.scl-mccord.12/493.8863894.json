From that verdict there was an appeal to the constitutional court on a motion for a new <em>trial; </em>and'ia the conclusion of the opinion delivered by Judge <em>Cheve~ </em>therein, it is stated that \u201c the ground of the motion for a new trial, is without even the semblance of plausibility.\u201d He concludes that the appeal was in the full sense of the word <em>frivolous. </em>On the decision thus had in the court ol appeals, the negroes were delivered up by <em>Vance </em>the defendant, to the plaintiff, who accepted them; but execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>tion was taken cmt for tbe <em>interest accruing an the </em>\u00a183,000, <em>from the time of the recovery had, </em>to tbe dismissal of the appeal; and it was urged on the motion now made, to quash or suspend that execution, that the verdict was not such as would by the law of the state, convey interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-3\">On the argument of the case at Chambers, and from the authority of the case -of <em>Norris </em>and <em>others </em>vs. Berkley, (2 <em>Const. Rep, </em>228,) Judge <em>Gantt, </em>before whom the motion was made, was inclined to think that the view taken by the defendants counsel was a correct one <em>; </em>but on a more minute examination of tire case of <em>Beckly, </em>and the purport of the act of Assembly of 1815, for the prevention of frivolous appeals, he was inclined' to take a different view of what he then deemed the law of the case. \u201c He said the act of 1815, in <em>every case ofappeal </em>where the decision was against the appellant, allowed interest on the <em>amount recovered, </em>at the rate of 7 per cent, from the day <em>the verdict </em>was given, to the <em>time when the appeal should he dismissed. </em>Then the amount recovered in this case was <em>% </em>3,000. On the dismissal of the appeal, the plaintiff accepted the ne-groes as an equivolent to that amount. Now whether the payment of the amount recovered, was in money or any thing else, was immaterial. , The interest for the delay in, paying it follows'from the terms of the act, like the shadow the substance. It cannot with reason be supposed that the negroes were more valuable when delivered, than when the recovery was had, unless like wine they are bettered by age ; consequently their acceptance cannot be urged as a reason why the plaintiff should not avail himself of the indemnification expressly given by the act of 1816^ for the delay in coming at his right occasioned by the act of the defendant, and as Judge <em>Cheves </em>in writing the opinion, declared without a shadow of pretence for so doing. The right to 7 per cent..is secured to the plaintiff by the act of 1815, as before stated, and the law must have its effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-4\">\u201c The motion to quash <em>ox </em>suspend the execution issued \u25a0in this case must therefore fail.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>From this decision made at Chambers,- an appeal was-claimed to this court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-3\">1st.
