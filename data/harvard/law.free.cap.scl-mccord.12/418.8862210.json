That the said decision of the court bad neither law nor authority to sanction it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-3\">dnd.

That question will arise necessarily in the case of replevin. For the case before us, it is enough to say, that the presiding judge having deemed it competent to issue the writ in such case, does, at least, shew, that the sheriff might well have so thought; the officer is therefore shielded from the charge of contempt of the process of this court. The writ and the execution, both issued under the seal of this court, which to obey was at least matter of great consideration. If the officer erred, there is still no ground for attachment where the point is not clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The motion is therefore unanimously dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b429-7\">Justices <em>Rott, Johnson </em>and Colcock, concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
