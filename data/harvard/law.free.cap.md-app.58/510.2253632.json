Elliott was, for many years, a member of the Town of Aberdeen police force. He eventually became the chief of the town police. At some point, the Town Commissioners (appellees) decided to remove Elliott from the police force. At first, on August 24, 1981, they tried to dismiss him outright, but because the dismissal was not in conformance with the procedural requirements of the Law-Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights (LEOBR, Md.Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 727-734D), the Circuit Court for Harford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>County, upon Elliott\u2019s complaint, immediately required that he be reinstated. His termination on that occasion lasted but one day. On August 26,1981, appellees placed Elliott on administrative leave (with pay) and filed charges against him under LEOBR. Before those charges were heard by an LEOBR hearing board, however, Elliott\u2019s two-year term as police chief expired, and he was not reappointed. That effectively terminated his status and employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Elliott and his wife sued appellees in the Circuit Court for Harford County. After some earlier pleading battles, the case ultimately was. decided upon their second amended declaration which comprises seven counts, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Count I purports to allege an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Elliott avers therein that by virtue of the procedural safeguards embodied in LEOBR he had a \u201cproperty interest in his continued employment with the Aberdeen Police Department, said property interest being secured and guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States and the due process and equal protection requirements therein.\u201d He alleges that appellees, under color of State law, transgressed upon that property interest by:</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">(1) conducting an investigation, \u201cthe purpose of which was to gather information critical of [Elliott] in an attempt to initiate disciplinary action against [him] or to secure his demotion o'r dismissal from the Aberdeen Police Department\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">(2) failing to meet \u201ccertain procedural safeguards,\u201d under LEOBR, specifically: (a) failing to inform Elliott of the name, rank, and command of the officer in charge of the investigation, as required by art. 27, \u00a7 728(b)(3); (b) failing to inform him in writing \u201cof the nature of the investigation prior to his interrogation,\u201d as required by art. 27, \u00a7 728(b)(4); and (c) terminating him on August 24, 1981 without giving notice of his entitlement to a hearing, in violation of art. 27, \u00a7 730(a);</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">(3) thereafter filing charges against Elliott, including accusations of the commission of a criminal offense, \u201csaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>charges being motivated purely by political considerations\u201d; and</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">(4) failing to provide a trial board before which Elliott could defend these charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">All of this, he claimed, caused serious injury to his self-esteem, professional reputation, and marital tranquility. As recompense, he asked $500,000 compensatory and $2,000,000 punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Count II is for abuse of process, although it does not indicate precisely the type of process that was allegedly abused. Elliott claims that appellees \u201ccaused to be issued process\u201d against him \u201cfor the sole purpose of harassing, embarrassing, and humiliating [him] in hopes of forcing his resignation from his position as Chief of the Aberdeen Police Department,\u201d that their acts \u201cwere malicious and done without just cause, illegal, oppressive and done with a wanton disregard for [Elliott\u2019s] rights... . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Count III asserts an action for defamation. Excess verbiage aside, Elliott alleges that appellees \u201cdid maliciously cause to be prepared and composed certain interdepartmental charges of misconduct,\u201d including one that involved a criminal offense, that \u201cthese defamatory matters were known to the Defendants to be untrue or should have been known to be untrue,\u201d and that they nevertheless with malice \u201cknowingly, wantonly, and recklessly caused these defamatory allegations to be published and communicated to the community at large.\u201d He avers that he had previously enjoyed an excellent reputation for integrity, moral conduct, and proper activities as a police officer, and that the appellees\u2019 actions \u201cwere meant and intended to hold [Elliott] up to public scorn and ridicule and were made with actual malice and wilful intent to injure [him].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Count IV, brought by Elliott and his wife, realleges by reference everything in Counts I through III. It asserts that appellees\u2019 failure \u201cto prosecute allegations of misconduct on the part of [Elliott]\u201d caused him emotional pain and suffering which affected his physical health and well-being, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>and that, in turn, caused the plaintiffs to suffer a loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Counts V, VI, and VII also incorporate and reallege \u201call facts and matters\u201d contained in the earlier counts. The theory of Count V is not entirely clear; we are told it was intended to charge malicious prosecution. Elliott claims therein that appellees \u201ccaused to be filed certain interdepartmental charges with the Aberdeen Police Department against [him],\u201d that they \u201cwere solely responsible for the investigation and prosecution of said charges,\u201d that those charges \u201cwere initiated without jest [sic] cause, maliciously, and for private and improper motives,\u201d that \u201cupon the filing of said interdepartmental charges. .. [Elliott] was notified to appear before an administrative trial board as provided in [LEOBR],\u201d that the charges filed against him were then dropped and no hearing was held thereon, as appellees \u201cknew them to be without merit and baseless.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Count VI charges an invasion of privacy. Elliott avers that appellees caused to be published and circulated \u201ccertain allegations concerning the private and off duty activities\u201d of Elliott that were of no legitimate concern to the public but were \u201cof the type that would be highly offensive to a reasonable person\u201d and were so to him. Finally, in Count VII, Elliott charges appellees with negligence in failing to \u201cthoroughly investigate the truthfulness of the complaints against [him]\u201d and in filing disciplinary proceedings \u201cbefore determining whether there was in fact any basis therefore [sic].\u201d Had appellees exercised reasonable care and thoroughly investigated the charges, he avers, \u201cthey would or should have known the complaints to be baseless and without merit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Appellees responded to this pleading with a demurrer to all seven counts and with what we take as the renewal of a motion raising preliminary objection that had been filed in June, 1982, in response to the initial declaration. On May 27, 1983, the court disposed of the second amended declaration by granting the demurrer as to Count I and the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>raising preliminary objection as to Counts II through VII. The court concluded that to the extent Count I sought to state an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, it was insufficient in that \u201cno facts were shown to describe the nature and extent of [the] alleged property interest.\u201d The remaining six county were dismissed on the basis of Md.Code Ann. art. 23A, \u00a7 lB(a), <em>i.e., </em>governmental immunity. The court concluded that \u201c[r]unning the police department is a discretionary function within the scope of [appellees\u2019] employment,\u201d and that, aside from bald allegations, appellants had failed to \u201cset forth any facts amounting to malice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">In this appeal appellants do not challenge the <em>procedural </em>correctness of those rulings, <em>i.e., </em>whether the demurrer as to Count I was in proper form and whether the issue and underlying facts concerning appellees\u2019 immunity were properly before the court, and we shall therefore not address the procedural aspects of the court\u2019s rulings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, we shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>confine ourselves to the substantive issues presented by appellants: does Count I state a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and are appellees immune from the liability asserted under Counts II through VII?</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">(1) <em>Count I </em>\u2014 \u00a7 <em>198S</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">As we indicated earlier, from all of the information given to us in the various pleadings, answers to interrogatories, briefs, and argument, it appears that appellees proceeded against Elliott in three stages: (1) on August 24, 1981, they dismissed him outright, but as the result of a proceeding filed by him in court, he was reinstated the next day; (2) he was then immediately placed on administrative leave (with pay) and at some undefined point \u2014 alleged in an answer to an interrogatory to be more than six months later \u2014 charges were filed against him under LEOBR; and (3) at some later undefined time, his term of office expired and he was not reappointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Unfortunately, this sequence of events is not clearly set forth in Count I, or indeed in any of the counts, of the second amended declaration. Count I, in particular, says nothing at all about a term of office or about an appointment not being renewed. Insofar as Count I is concerned, Elliott was an untenured \u201cat will\u201d employee. For purposes of the demurrer, we are, of course, precluded from considering anything outside of the second amended declaration itself, except to the extent that statements made to us in argument may suffice as concessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Section 1983 provides, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">\u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law. .. . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">It is a very broad statute, remedial in purpose. Its principal object is to provide a mechanism for enforcing the rights guaranteed by and under the Fourteenth Amendment, most notably the protection against deprivation of liberty or property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">As the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), a citizen\u2019s <em>liberty </em>interest and his <em>property </em>interest are not the same. In the context of dismissals from employment, one\u2019s <em>liberty </em>interest may be implicated where the employee has no cognizable right to the continued employment, but the dismissal serves to fetter some other Constitutional right that he does have. Thus, a dismissal may be found to violate a liberty interest when it is the result of unlawful discrimination, <em>Poolaw v. City of Anadarko, </em>660 F.2d 459 (10th Cir.1981), or when it is in retribution for the exercise of First Amendment or other Constitutional rights, <em>Perry v. Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972), <em>DiGrazia v. County Exec. for Mont. Co., </em>288 Md. 437, 418 A.2d 1191 (1980), <em>but see Trotman </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Lincoln University, </em>635 F.2d 216 (3d Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied </em>451 U.S. 986, 101 S.Ct. 2320, 68 L.Ed.2d 844 (1981), and <em>Wood v. Town of Frederica, </em>529 F.Supp. 403 (D.Del.), <em>aff'd </em>688 F.2d 828 (3d Cir.1982), or when it is accompanied by charges that might damage the employee\u2019s reputation in the community and he is given no opportunity to respond, <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, supra, </em>408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548, <em>Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976), <em>Duggan v. Town of Ocean City, </em>516 F.Supp. 1081 (D.Md.1981), or where it imposes upon him some stigma or disability that forecloses other employment opportunities (such as barring him from other public employment), <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, supra, Kiekow v. Village of Chenequa, </em>342 F.Supp. 494 (E.D.Wis.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>For a dismissal or termination to implicate a <em>property </em>interest, the employee must have some entitlement to the employment itself. But, as noted in <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. at 2709, \u201c[t]o have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Elliott has made clear to us in argument, notwithstanding some ambiguity in his pleading, that Count I is based solely on an alleged deprivation of his <em>property </em>interest in continued employment as a police officer. He does not contend that appellees\u2019 actions have transgressed upon any <em>liberty </em>interest. We therefore shall confine ourselves to the question of whether, based on the allegations in Count I, appellees have deprived him of a property interest without due process of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">As a general rule, a non-tenured State or local government employee who serves \u201cat will\u201d is <em>not </em>regarded as having a property right in continued public employment. <em>Taylor v. Beckham, </em>178 U.S. 548, 20 S.Ct. 890, 44 L.Ed. 1187 (1900); <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, supra, </em>408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548; <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Wood, supra, </em>426 U.S. 341, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 48 L.Ed.2d 684; <em>Hodgin v. Noland, </em>435 F.2d 859 (4th Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied </em>408 U.S. 942, 92 S.Ct. 2846, 33 L.Ed.2d 766 (1972); <em>Brown v. Hirst, </em>443 F.2d 899 (4th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied </em>404 U.S. 1040, 92 S.Ct. 720, 30 L.Ed.2d 732 (1972). This includes a police officer. Absent some special tenure provision, a police officer does not have a federally protected right to continued employment as a police officer. <em>Boulware v. Battaglia, </em>327 F.Supp. 368 (D.Del.1971); <em>Monroe v. St. Louis Metropolitan Police Dept., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>524 F.Supp. 1009 (E.D.Mo.1981); <em>Fielder v. City of Richmond, </em>468 F.Supp. 1119 (E.D.Va.1979); <em>DeBono v. Vizas, </em>427 F.Supp. 905 (D.Col.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">As both the <em>Roth </em>and <em>Bishop </em>Courts made clear, however, property interests are not created by the Constitution. \u201cRather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law \u2014 rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.\u201d <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. at 2709. Thus, \u201c[a] property interest in employment can, of course, be created by ordinance, or by an implied contract.\u201d <em>Bishop, </em>426 U.S. at 344, 96 S.Ct. at 2077. In either case, the <em>Bishop </em>Court continued, \u201cthe sufficiency of the claim of entitlement must be decided by reference to state law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Count I does not allege any direct statutory or contractual entitlement to continued employment, as would be the case, for example, if Elliott had been employed for a specific term of years or could be discharged <em>only </em>for specific cause. <em>See, for example, Thompson v. Bass, </em>616 F.2d 1259 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>449 U.S. 983, 101 S.Ct. 399, 66 L.Ed.2d 245 (1980); <em>Poolaw v. City of Anadarko, supra, </em>660 F.2d 459, <em>but compare Bishop v. Wood, supra, </em>426 U.S. 341, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 48 L.Ed.2d 684. Nor does LEOBR itself purport to afford such an entitlement; it neither creates a term of office for policemen nor specifies or limits the causes for which they may be dismissed. It does not, in short, provide tenure to police officers. <em>Allgood </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>43 Md.App. 187, 403 A.2d 837 (1979). Elliott\u2019s claimed entitlement, then, is an implicit one. LEOBR, he says, sets procedural conditions on the Town\u2019s ability to dismiss him; absent compliance with those conditions, there is no right to dismiss; <em>ergo, </em>absent compliance with those conditions, he has a protected property interest in continued employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">LEOBR affords protection to police officers in two respects: (1) it seeks to protect certain \u201cliberty\u201d interests, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>such as the right to engage in political activity (\u00a7 728(a)), the right of privacy (\u00a7 729), and the right to be free from retributive actions (\u00a7 733), and (2) it sets forth certain procedural requirements in connection with investigations and other proceedings that may lead to disciplinary action. We are concerned here only with the latter. In that connection, the statute envisions and speaks to three phases of such proceedings: (1) the initial investigation that may lead to the filing of charges; (2) the filing of charges and the officer\u2019s right to a hearing thereon; and (3) the employer\u2019s right to accept, modify, or reject the findings and recommendations of the hearing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">We summarized the procedural aspects of LEOBR in <em>Abbott v. Administrative Hearing Bd., </em>33 Md.App. 681, 682, 366 A.2d 756 (1976), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\u201cThe purpose of these enactments was to guarantee that certain procedural safeguards be offered to police officers during any investigation and subsequent hearing which could lead to disciplinary action, demotion, or dismissal.... The law sets forth specific standards for the investigation of alleged misconduct, including the place and time of any interrogation of the officer, and requires that a written record be kept of the interrogation. ... If the investigation results in the recommendation of some disciplinary action such as demotion, a full hearing must be held, affording the police officer the right to counsel, the right to present evidence, and the right to cross-examine witnesses. .. . The hearing is held before a \u2018hearing board,\u2019 chosen by the chief of police and comprised of other law-enforcement officers. ... The written decision of the hearing board, accompanied by findings of fact, must be sent to the officer.... An appeal from the decision of the hearing board may be taken to the circuit court.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">We find nothing in either the plain language of these provisions or in any other relevant material that would suggest an intent on the part of the General Assembly to confer upon police officers any property right in their con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>tinued employment that they did not otherwise enjoy. Indeed, as we noted in <em>Abbott, supra, </em>33 Md.App. at 688, 366 A.2d 756, to some extent, by supplanting local merit system laws to which a number of police officers formerly were subject, LEOBR may in fact have lessened their procedural rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The establishment of basic procedures for interrogations, investigations, and hearings is <em>not </em>the same as limiting the causes for which an officer may be dismissed. When an officer is told by the State that he may only be dismissed for certain specific reasons, he has a legitimate expectation that he will not be dismissed for any other reason. It is a simple application of the principle <em>inclusio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>and from that the \u201centitlement\u201d spoken of in <em>Roth </em>arises. When the officer serves at will, however, and may be terminated for any reason not infringing upon some liberty interest, there is no such entitlement, notwithstanding that the process leading to his termination must comport with certain basic procedural requirements. <em>Compare Bell </em>v. <em>Gayle, </em>384 F.Supp. 1022 (N.D.Tex.1974). Accordingly, we conclude as a matter of State law that the procedural requirements embodied in LEOBR do not suffice to give Elliott a property right in his continued employment as a police officer for the Town of Aberdeen.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Even if we were to assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that such a property right does exist, it is clear to us that the averments in Count I are wholly insufficient to show a deprivation of that right without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Elliott makes essentially six complaints in Count I. First, he contends that appellees conducted an investigation to gather critical information in an attempt to initiate disciplinary action and secure his dismissal or demotion. Assuming that is true, we see nothing improper about it. As noted, \u00a7 728 envisions that such an investigation would and should precede the filing of charges. Next, he complains that appellees failed to tell him the name, rank, and command of the officer in charge of the investigation, as required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>\u00a7 728(b)(3). Assuming that this is also true, we fail to see how such an omission could possibly rise to Constitutional dimension. There is no claim that appellees deliberately concealed the information, or even that there <em>was </em>\u201can officer\u201d in charge of the investigation. At worst, Elliott has alleged a passive omission that could have been entirely inadvertent and corrected by a simple request on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Third, he complains that he was not informed of the \u201cnature of the investigation prior to his interrogation,\u201d as required by \u00a7 728(b)(4). Aside from the fact that the right to such information is found in \u00a7 728(b)(5), not (b)(4), here again, he has alleged no more than a passive omission, not a deliberate concealment. Indeed, it is not even clear from his pleading that he was ever actually interrogated. Elliott\u2019s fourth claim under Count I is that he was terminated on August 24,1981, without being notified of his entitlement to a hearing as required by \u00a7 730(a) of art. 27. He does not allege here that he was in fact denied a hearing, that the failure to notify him of his right to a hearing was deliberate, or that he was unaware of his right to a hearing. Indeed, we know from his argument that he was well aware of his rights under LEOBR, that he immediately filed an action in court, and that he was promptly reinstated. Under these circumstances, the mere failure of appellees to give the notice required by \u00a7 730(a) would not constitute a denial of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Penultimately, Elliott avers that charges were eventually filed against him, and that they were \u201cmotivated purely by political considerations.\u201d He does not tell us in Count I the precise nature of the charges;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> nor does he allege that they were unfounded or that appellees knew they were unfounded. He apparently hopes that we will ascribe some <em>per se </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>pejorative connotation to the word \u201cpolitical\u201d and infer that when elected town commissions act for \u201cpolitical considerations\u201d they <em>ipso facto </em>act unconstitutionally. We decline to draw such an inference. <em>Compare Elrod v. Burns, </em>427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976); <em>Branti v. Finkel, </em>445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980); <em>Moorhead v. Government of Virgin Islands, </em>542 F.Supp. 213 (D.V.I.1982); <em>Aufiero v. Clarke, </em>489 F.Supp. 650 (D.Mass. 1980), <em>aff\u2019d </em>639 F.2d 49 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>452 U.S. 917, 101 S.Ct. 3052, 69 L.Ed.2d 421 (1981), where the discharge or termination of certain types of employees by reason of their political affiliation was regarded as impinging upon First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Finally, Elliott charges that, having brought these charges, appellees \u201cfailed to provide a trial board before which [he] could defend these charges.\u201d Again, he gives no substance to the complaint: over what period of time did they fail to constitute a trial board, was it a passive omission or one designed to circumvent his right to a hearing on the charges, did he request a trial board? The bald allegation that appellees failed to provide a trial board simply does not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">This is the sum and substance of Count I. It does not suffice to show the deprivation of a property interest without due process of law, and therefore does not suffice to state a claim under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">(2) <em>Counts II </em>\u2014 VII</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">As we noted, unlike Count I, Counts II through VII were not disposed of in response to the demurrer, but pursuant to the motion raising preliminary objection. The issue before us, then, is not the general sufficiency of the allegations in those counts, but whether the court erred in finding that appellees enjoyed the protection of governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">To the extent that Counts II through VII allege causes of action, they are clearly in tort. Art. 23A, \u00a7 lB(a) provides: \u201cOfficials of a municipal corporation, while acting in a discretionary capacity, without malice, and within the scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>of their employment or authority shall be immune as officials or individuals from any civil liability for the performance of such actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">To fall within the protective ambit of this statute, four elements must be shown: (1) the defendants are officials of a municipal corporation; (2) they acted in a discretionary capacity; (3) they acted within the scope of their authority; and (4) their actions were not malicious. <em>See James v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>288 Md. 315, 418 A.2d 1173 (1980), applying essentially the same four factors as a matter of common law. Elliott concedes (1) and (3). Although he acknowledges that ordinarily the dismissal of a police chief is a discretionary act, he argues that appellees were under a ministerial duty to comply with LEOBR and that element (2) is therefore lacking. We find no merit to that argument. The acts complained of in Counts II through VII relate to the filing of charges by appellees, the motivation for their being filed, the nature of the charges, and the manner in which the charges were filed and prosecuted. Although Count I mentions a number of alleged derelictions in terms of LEOBR, the clear thrust of Counts II through VII is directed at the decision to terminate Elliott and the manner in which that decision was implemented. That, clearly, is a discretionary function.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The real issue with respect to these six counts is whether Elliott made a sufficient showing of malice on the part of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Malice, in this context, consists of the intentional doing of a wrongful act without legal justification or excuse. An act is malicious if it is done knowingly and deliberately, for an improper motive and without legal justification. <em>Prince George\u2019s Co. v. Blumberg, </em>44 Md.App. 79, 106-07, 407 A.2d 1151 (1979), <em>aff\u2019d and rev\u2019d in part, </em>288 Md. 275, 418 A.2d 1155 (1980), <em>cert. denied </em>449 U.S. 1083, 101 S.Ct. 869, 66 L.Ed.2d 808 (1981); <em>Davis v. Muse, </em>51 Md.App. 93, 99-100, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>441 A.2d 1089 (1982). That is the standard. We look now to see if it was sufficiently alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Count II alleges that appellees caused process to issue for the sole purpose of harassing Elliott in order to force his resignation, that such acts \u201cwere malicious and done without just cause,\u201d and that they were \u201cillegal, oppressive and done with a wanton disregard\u201d for his rights. In Count III, Elliott avers that the charges filed against him \u201cwere known to the Defendants to be untrue or should have been known to be untrue\u201d and that appellees \u201cknowingly, wantonly, and recklessly caused these defamatory allegations to be published and communicated to the community at large.\u201d Count IV merely seeks damages for loss of consortium; it alleges no additional tortious conduct. Count V alleges that the charges brought by appellees \u201cwere initiated without jest [sic] cause, maliciously, and for private and improper motives.\u201d Count VI has fewer adverbs; it charges that appellees caused to be published \u201ccertain allegations concerning the private and off duty activities\u201d of Elliott that were of no legitimate concern to the public. Count VII charges simple negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">From the pleading alone, it is clear that no liability would arise under Counts VI and VII. No attempt even has been made to allege malice under those counts. In Counts II, III, and V, Elliott has at least made conclusory allegations of malice. But, as was said in <em>Greenbelt v. Pr. George's Co., </em>248 Md. 350, 360, 237 A.2d 18 (1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">\u201cCharacterizations of acts or conduct, no matter how often or how strongly adjectively asserted, are, without supporting statements of fact (not evidence), conclusions of law or expressions of opinion.... Allegations of fraud or characterizations of acts, conduct or transactions as fraudulent, arbitrary, capricious or as constituting a breach of duty, without alleging facts which make them such, are conclusions of law insufficient to state a cause of action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>The same is true with respect to malice. Merely asserting that an act was done maliciously, or without just cause, or illegally, or with wanton disregard, or recklessly, or for improper motive does not suffice. To overcome a motion raising governmental immunity, the plaintiff must allege with some clarity and precision those facts which make the act malicious. <em>See Carder v. </em>Steiner, 225 Md. 271, 170 A.2d 220 (1961), <em>overruled on other grounds, James v. Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>288 Md. at 323, n. 9, 418 A.2d 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Elliott was given an opportunity in connection with his amended complaint to explain how the various acts charged to appellees were malicious. Interrogatory No. 8, filed November 12,1982, asked him to state the factual basis for his contention that any act committed by appellees was malicious or was performed with wanton disregard for his rights; his answer, filed February 10, 1983, was a mere recasting of conclusory allegations, adding nothing of substance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Upon this state of the record, we do not believe that the court erred in concluding that appellees were protected by governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANTS TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-5\">. The demurrer to Count I was a classic example of a \u201cspeaking\u201d demurrer \u2014 the averment of facts <em>dehors </em>the pleading to which it responded. The heart of it was this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201cThe Defendants aver that notwithstanding allegations of a property right in continued employment, then Chief Arthur B. Elliott served at the pleasure of the Town Commissioners and, contrary to the various implications in the pleadings, at the expiration of his contract, his contract simply was not renewed by the Town.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiY\">It is not the function of a demurrer to controvert the factual allegations in a complaint or to present new ones. <em>Gallant v. Bd. of School Comm\u2019rs, </em>28 Md.App. 324, 345 A.2d 448 (1975); <em>Beach v. Mueller, </em>32 Md.App. 219, 359 A.2d 232 (1976). The court\u2019s ruling, as noted, was premised upon its belief that Count I was legally insufficient in that \u201cno facts were shown to describe the nature and extent of this alleged property interest.\u201d To what extent, if any, the court considered this extraneous averment in reaching that conclusion is unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The motion raising preliminary objection had been filed in June, 1982, in response to appellants\u2019 initial declaration. It had not been refiled in response to either the amended declaration or the second amended declaration. <em>See, </em>however, Md.Rule 320d8(b). The motion rested upon appellees\u2019 assertion that appellants had failed to show that appellees\u2019 actions were either ministerial or malicious, and in support of that contention appellees relied upon appellants\u2019 answers to interrogatories filed in response to the amended declaration. The court, in effect, concluded that by virtue of answers to interrogate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>ries rendered in connection with the <em>amended </em>declaration, appellees were immune from liability under the <em>second amended </em>declaration, pursuant to a motion filed in response to the <em>initial </em>declaration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b544-7\">. Elliott has made no claim of abusive discharge under the principles laid down in <em>Adler v. American Standard Corp., </em>291 Md. 31, 432 A.2d 464 (1981), and we therefore do not address whether those principles are applicable to public employees or, if so, whether they would give any greater protection to a public employee than is afforded by \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\">. In his brief, Elliott tells us that they included allegations that he had \u201cengaged in preferential treatment of officers under his command, violations of state law, questionable conduct with an unidentified female during his off duty hours, and the condonation of the use of or carrying of alcoholic beverages in police vehicles by members of the department.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b552-7\">. Answer No. 8 was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\u201cThe action of all Defendants, on Monday, August 24, 1981, in attempting to remove the Plaintiff from his position as Chief of the Aberdeen Police Department without just cause or reason and without complying with the legislative mandates of the Law Enforcement Officer\u2019s Bill of Rights was malicious and done with a wanton disregard for the rights of Plaintiff. Additionally, the Defendants attempted to discharge the Plaintiff for mismanagement of the Aberdeen Police Department, although they had no justification for the allegation. Further, although the Plaintiff was placed on administrative leave in August of 1981, no interdepartmental charges were placed against him for a period in excess of six (6) months. Plaintiff is unable to determine which of the individual Defendants may or may not have taken part in these activities, but avers and believes that these actions were taken by the individual Defendants acting in concert with one another and on behalf of the municipal corporation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
