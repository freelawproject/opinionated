Brannon, after a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Appellant filed in that Court a petition to acquire about one-third of an acre from the appellee\u2019s 6% acre residential property. The State needed the property to construct part of a dual lane controlled access highway (relocated Maryland Route 193). When it filed its condemnation petition on July 13,1981, appellant deposited with the Court $3,114.00, which it deemed the fair market value of the property, including damage, if any, to the remainder. The case was certified to the Board of Property Review of Prince George\u2019s County, which, after taking evidence and viewing the property, awarded appellee $3,180.00 for the land taken, plus $10,-000.00 for resulting damage to the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Dissatisfied with the award, appellant filed a \u201cquick take\u201d condemnation petition on May 5, 1982, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Md. Const., Art. Ill, \u00a7 40B; Md. Transp. Code Ann., \u00a7 8-318, et seq. When it filed that petition, appellant deposited $3,114.00 (the same amount set out in the acquisition petition of July 13, 1981, which had been heard before the Board of Property Review) with the Clerk of the Circuit Court. Appellee landowners filed an answer to the petition. A jury returned an inquisition in appellees\u2019 favor in the amount set out above. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The State Roads Commission makes four assignments of error, which we will consider in the following sequence:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">1. The lower court erred in permitting Mrs. Brannon to base her claim for damages on a change in the neighborhood and in failing to instruct the jury to disregard such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">2. The lower court erred in failing to instruct the jury to disregard appellees\u2019 claim that noise or dust from the road damaged their remaining land.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">3. The lower court erred in refusing to permit the rebuttal evidence proffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>4. The lower court erred in precluding final argument as to the inference to be drawn from the failure of the property owner to call her appraisers.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">I. and II.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\n<em>Just Compensation for Resulting Damage to Remaining Land</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Appellant State Roads Commission suggests that the trial court should have prohibited the jury from considering certain elements in measuring just compensation for damage the road caused to appellees\u2019 remaining land.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">At a pretrial hearing on its motion in limine, appellant moved to exclude as a basis for damages to the remainder of appellees\u2019 property all evidence or argument about change in the character of the neighborhood \u2014 rural to suburban or suburban to urban \u2014 resulting from construction and use of the road. In order to clarify what it was appellant was attempting to exclude, the hearing judge (Femia, J.) phrased it in a hypothetical jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, moving from rural to suburbia is not compensable; if it\u2019s been proven to you that that roadway is causing noise, pollution or whatever, you may compensate for that. You may not compensate merely because it gives the character of the neighborhood a more suburban and urban look than a rural look.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Later, in the hearing, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVR\">\u201cTHE COURT: . . . What [appellant\u2019s counsel] is concerned with is one or another witness is going to be called by the defendant to the witness stand and the question is going to be posited to the witness, \u2018Now that you are no longer living in bucolic America how do you feel?\u2019 That\u2019s what he\u2019s scared of, that general question coming off. Because he says legally how they feel is not compensable and I tend to agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>MR. LEHMANN: [Appellees\u2019 Counsel] Your Honor, I agree with that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The court then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">\u201c.. . I don\u2019t think I need to rule at this point in limine then based upon Mr. Lehmann\u2019s (appellee\u2019s counsel) representations to the Court. I will deny the motion in limine. But, I am going to have to stay wide awake during this trial. I can see that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The motions judge, however, did not preside at trial. The trial court (Ahalt, J.) permitted Linda Brannon, one of the appellees, to testify that her claim for damages to her property was based, in part, on a change in the neighborhood caused by the construction of the road. Her counsel asked for the reasons that she assigned for the diminished value of her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">After the Court overruled appellant\u2019s objection, she responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">\u201cIn 1976 when Mr. Brannon and I sought out a home of this caliber, it took us a long time to do so. Yes, the house was the main attraction. We had to use a lot of imagination because of the work that was involved. But it was the house and the property, the combination of the two, that sold us on this place. We appreciated the country atmosphere, that it had to offer us. At the time our children were very small. The quietness, the environment, the feeling that my children had their freedom in this country atmosphere, and in 1977 when I first learned that this highway was coming through, I was very distraught because of what it was going to do to us. My first reaction was that the quietness would be gone. We would have the noise from the traffic on the road. We would have the litter, the pollution. Just the idea of the closeness of the highway to us, what it was doing to this piece of property was altering it . . . from a country atmosphere.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">After further objection Mrs. Brannon continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>\u201cThe highway was altering this piece of property entirely and we were both very saddened about it. There\u2019s nothing we can do about the highway, but I do feel that Mr. Brannon and I should be compensated for the damages that it\u2019s causing to our property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">The Court then permitted a bench conference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">\u201cMR. LEONNIG: [Appellant\u2019s Attorney]. We argued the question of the change in the setting of the property or so-called \u2014 her claim of lack of country or losing country atmosphere before Judge Femia as a preliminary matter and it was my understanding from Judge Femia\u2019s ruling as well as Mr. Lehmann\u2019s understanding that that would not be proffered in the case, it was not to be proffered in the case. That is not a proper item of damage in a condemnation case. If the property goes from rural to suburban or suburban to rural.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">THE COURT: If that is an objection, it is overruled. If it\u2019s a motion to strike, it is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">MR. LEONNIG: It\u2019s a motion to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">THE COURT: It is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Appellant later excepted to the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that \u201ca change in the neighborhood is not a compensible [sic] item of damage.\u201d The court also refused to deliver appellant\u2019s proffered instruction that \u201cunder the law of Maryland, no damages are allowable with regard to the normal dust and noise incidental to the construction of a highway or its use.\u201d The court explained its refusal to appellant\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any evidence to support the giving of that. There\u2019s no testimony that\u2019s been brought up as to that or even been brought up by any of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">MR. LEONNIG: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying and I think it ought to be taken out of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-12\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the case. So, I didn\u2019t give it for that reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-13\">MR. LEONNIG: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the case either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">MR. LEONNIG: But we think it ought to be given because we think there will be an argument to that effect. And the other is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019ll prohibit any argument because there\u2019s no evidence, in the case concerning construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">MR. LEONNIG: Or its use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">THE COURT: Or its use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">MR. LEONNIG: I have on the tag end of it or its use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">THE COURT: Well, I think it\u2019s [sic] use is relevant to the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">MR. LEONNIG: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any evidence what the noise will be from the highway or what the dust will be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in permitting the jury to consider, as elements of damage to the appellees\u2019 remaining land, the elements of noise, dust, and possible change in the character of the neighborhood resulting from the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">When, as here, the State takes a portion of a landowner\u2019s property, it is obligated to provide him just compensation not only for the part taken, but for consequent depreciation to the remaining land. <em>E.g., Andrews v. City of Greenbelt, </em>293 Md. 69, 76-77, 441 A.2d 1064 (1982); <em>Dodson </em>v. <em>Anne Arundel County, </em>294 Md. 490, 494-95, 451 A.2d 317 (1982); <em>Mont. Co. v. Old Farm Swim Club, </em>270 Md. 708, 711-12, 313 A.2d 458 (1974); <em>Pumphrey v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>175 Md. 498, 505, 2 A.2d 668 (1938). U.S. Const, amend. 5; Md. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 40, 40B. <em>See generally 4A Nichols on Eminent Domain, </em>\u00a7 14.03 at 14-62 (Rev. 3d ed. 1981); 27 Am.Jur.2d <em>Eminent Domain </em>\u00a7 310 at 124 (1966). Compensation is required for damage to the untaken portion because it would be unjust to permit the State to carve out a segment of an owner\u2019s land without paying for detriment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>the remainder. 1 L. Orgel, <em>Valuation Under Eminent Domain </em>226 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">This requirement is statutorily enunciated in section 12-104(b) of the Real Property article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">\u201c <em>Where part of tract taken. </em>\u2014 The damages to be awarded where land, or any part of it, is taken is the fair market value of the part taken, but not less than the actual value of the part taken plus any severance or resulting damages to the remaining land by reason of the taking and of future use by the plaintiff of the part taken. The severance or resulting damages shall be diminished to the extent of the value of the special (particular) benefits to the remainder arising from the plaintiff\u2019s future use of the part taken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-6\"><em>Quoted in Griffith </em>v. <em>Montgomery County, </em>57 Md.App. 472 at 479, 470 A.2d 840 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\"><em>Oxon Hill Rec. Club v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>281 Md. 105, 107, 375 A.2d 564 (1977). The quoted section rephrased and supplanted former article 33A, section 5(b), which essentially restated the case law as it existed for many years. <em>State Roads Comm. v. Adams, </em>238 Md. 371, 376-77, 209 A.2d 247 (1965); <em>Duvall </em>v. <em>Potomac Electric, </em>234 Md. 42, 45, 197 A.2d 893 (1964); Baker &amp; Altfield, \u201cMaryland\u2019s New Condemnation Code,\u201d 23 Md.L.Rev. 309, 316 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The statute should be construed to effectuate the constitutional purpose of providing just compensation for damage to the remainder. <em>Ridgely v. Baltimore City, </em>119 Md. 567, 581, 87 A. 909 (1913). To be just, the total compensation should \u201cput the landowner in as good a pecuniary position as if no taking had occurred.\u201d <em>Dodson </em>v. <em>Anne Arundel County, supra, </em>294 Md. at 494, 451 A.2d 317. The measure of damages used to achieve this goal in a partial taking is the difference between fair market value of the whole property immediately before the taking and what is left immediately after the taking. <em>E.g., Oxon Hill Rec. Club </em>v. <em>Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>281 Md. at 107-08, 375 A.2d 564; <em>Perkins v. State Roads Comm\u2019n. </em>55 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>639, 645, 465 A.2d 1175 (1983). <em>Colonial Pipe Line Co. v. Gimbel, </em>54 Md.App. 32, 38, 456 A.2d 946 (1983); 5 <em>Nichols on Eminent Domain, </em>\u00a7 16.101 at 16-5. As the statutory language suggests, the fair market value of the owner\u2019s remaining land may depreciate due to future public use of the taken portion \u2014 termed \u201cconsequential\u201d or \u201cresulting\u201d damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">We are called upon to decide what elements a jury may consider in measuring damage to the fair market value of a remainder resulting from public use of the condemned portion. The remainder\u2019s fair market value would be (with some qualifications) the price at which a buyer and seller would willingly and voluntarily agree to convey the land. <em>Potomac Elec. Power Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>37 Md.App. 640, 650-51, 378 A.2d 715 (1977) <em>quoting </em>Md.Real Property Code Ann. \u00a7 12-105(b) (1981 repl. vol.). Thus, generally speaking, all factors caused by the taking that would render the remaining area less valuable to a buyer should be considered. 4A <em>Nichols on Eminent Domain, </em>\u00a7 14.07 at 14-179, \u00a7 14.08 at 14-187, \u00a7 14.03 at 14-63. This presumptively includes all consequential damage from highway use. 5 <em>Nichols on Eminent Domain, </em>\u00a7 16.101 at 16-10, \u00a7 16.101[1].</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Appellant State Roads Commission suggests though that this measure of damages should be further qualified to exclude consequential damages that are a normal incident of the public project experienced by the public <em>generally </em>\u2014 e.g., aesthetic detriment. This suggested qualification, sometimes termed the \u201ccommon injury rule\u201d in those jurisdictions that apply it, is described in 4A <em>Nichols on Eminent Domain, </em>section 14.08 at 14-225 to -226:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">\u201c[Although it has been said that all factors which would motivate a willing buyer or a willing seller must be considered, this rule has been qualified in actual practice. Thus, it has been held that where the damage complained of is not peculiar to the land of the condemnee, but is, the fact, an injury which he suffers in common with other local landowners, there can be no recovery therefor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Specifically with respect to partial taking for highway construction, <em>Nichols </em>reiterates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\">\u201cCertain types of damage caused by the laying out of a highway have been rejected as compensable elements bearing upon the depreciation in value of the remainder area. Thus, where the injury complained of is not peculiar to the tract out of which the land taken was carved, but is, in fact, an injury common to all land in the neighborhood and to the public in general it may not be considered. Increased traffic and the influx of undesirable persons have been rejected on this account.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-5\"><em>Id. </em>Vol. 5, \u00a7 16.101[2] at 16-13. <em>See, e.g., State v. McMurtrey, </em>300 S.W.2d 521, 527 (Mo.1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The evident purpose of this rule is to compensate the landowner only for those damages uniquely caused by the public use of his land. In this manner, it seeks to achieve some measure of parity between treatment of those whose lands are partially taken and those whose lands are not. This is explained in 1 L. Orgel <em>Valuation under Eminent Domain </em>254 (1953):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">\u201cThe attempt of the courts to draw this distinction is due to the fact that, with certain exceptions, an owner of property is not entitled to recover for any diminution in value which it may suffer by virtue of the construction and operation of adjacent public works where no part of his property is deemed to have been \u2018taken\u2019.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] It would seem, therefore, to be unfair discrimination to reimburse a property owner for all similar damages done to his property simply because a portion of it, however, small, may have been condemned. Bearing this point in mind, the courts have attempted, some of them more vigorously than others, to distinguish between damages which a particular owner has suffered because a part of his prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>erty has been taken, and damages which this same owner may have suffered along with adjacent property owners because public works, detrimental to the remainder of his property, have been located in the neighborhood. Needless to say, there are great difficulties, both practical and theoretical, in making a distinction between these two types of damages, and courts have differed not only in the manner, but also in the zeal, with which they have attempted to draw it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">To illustrate: In <em>Dennison v. State, </em>22 N.Y.2d 409, 293 N.Y.S.2d 68, 239 N.E.2d 708 (1968), the Dennisons\u2019 land before the taking was in a remote wooded area, entirely secluded, quiet and peaceful. This sylvan beauty and privacy were destroyed by construction of a state highway, which cut across their property within about 200 feet of their home. In measuring consequential damage to the remainder, the lower court considered the Dennisons\u2019 loss of privacy and seclusion, the loss of view, and traffic noise, lights and odors from the highway. Before the Court of Appeals of New York, the State argued that since an owner whose land adjoins a highway would not be entitled to damages for depreciation from nearby traffic, the Dennison\u2019s award for consequential damage should only consist of elements peculiar to their remainder, not traffic noise suffered by the public generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The Court affirmed the lower court\u2019s inclusion of such \u25a0aesthetic detriment in the measure of damages, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtS5\">\u201cThe courts below did not make a separate award for damages due to noise but rather merely considered it as one factor in determining the decrease in value to the remaining property. As we view the case, it would have been practically impossible for the court to separate the noise element from the other elements which, it is conceded, were properly considered \u2014 the loss of privacy, seclusion and view. Any reduction which would be made on remand would be purely arbitrary and at best speculative. How could it be determined which portion of the diminution in value was due to loss of privacy and view and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>which portion was due to noise? The State does not suggest an answer but argues steadfastly that such a determination must be made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">This does not answer the question and is clearly contrary to cases in this and other jurisdictions which have recognized that, where there has been a partial taking of property of the kind present here, the noise element may be considered as one of several factors in determining consequential damages <em>(South Buffalo Ry. Co. v. Kirkover </em>[176 N.Y. 301, 68 N.E. 366], <em>supra; Shano v. Fifth </em>Ave. <em>&amp; H St. Bridge Co., </em>189 Pa. 245, 42 A. 128; <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Central Nebraska Public Power &amp; Irrigation Dist., </em>154 Neb. 832, 49 N.W.2d 682).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In conclusion, we would note that we are not unmindful of the State\u2019s argument that there are certain inconveniences which property owners must endure without monetary compensation if we are to have the advantages of modern means of transportation <em>(see e.g., Bopp </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>19 N.Y.2d 368, 373, 280 N.Y.S.2d 135, 139, 227 N.E.2d 37, 40). In the instant case and cases of like kind, however, we believe that the practical difficulties attendant upon accepting the State\u2019s theory of evaluating damages outweighs any benefit likely to be derived from applying it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>293 N.Y.S.2d at 71-72, 239 N.E.2d at 711-712.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The dissent pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201cBut traffic noise is heard by everyone within the range of sound; and since it is a consequence that one takes by choosing to live in a country which builds modern highways, with resulting economic and transportation advantages to everyone, damage ought not, as a matter of policy, be allowed in general and unlimited scale for this kind of consequence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">It is not easy to support the justice of a distinction between a man from whom a small slice of land is taken for a road who may get damages for future traffic noise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>and a man who is just as near the road and suffers every bit as much damage but from whom no land is taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">The nature of traffic noise destroys the essential element of particular unity of interrelationships between taking and consequence which until now has been a characteristic of this type of damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">The idyllic beauty of claimants\u2019 house, wooded and landscaped property, its exotic shrubs, trees and garden will not be affected more adversely by future traffic noise than many hundreds of people owning property near the Northway from whom there has been no physical taking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73-74, 239 N.E.2d at 713-714.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Another example of the debate over the elements included in consequential damage is <em>State Department of Highways v. Garrick, </em>242 So.2d 278 (1970) <em>rev\u2019d. </em>260 La. 340, 256 So.2d 111 (1971). In that case, the landowners\u2019 rental property was located in a relatively quiet residential area beside a two-lane street that carried light local traffic. The State carved out about 550 square feet of the owner\u2019s property to be part of a new four-lane highway, 22V2 feet from the owner\u2019s dwelling. Defendant\u2019s expert testified that the nature of the property had changed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u201cIt had been suitable for family living, including small children, but due to the heavily increased traffic, noise, dust and hazard at all hours of the day and night, and the proximity of the dwelling, it was no longer suitable for such purposes.... In fact, he testified, T think the whole neighborhood has been destroyed.\u2019 \u201d 242 So.2d at 279.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHN\">The intermediate court of appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">\u201cThe general rule that loss of market value due to the taking is recoverable is subject to the limitation that such damage must be peculiar to the subject property and not such as are suffered generally by other landowners in the area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">Inasmuch as Mr. Garrick has not shown how his property in this case has been peculiarly damaged by the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>creased traffic, noise and dust in ways which have not affected other property along the by-pass right-of-way, we find that the trial judge erred in concluding that the damages complained of are compensable as severance damages.\u201d 242 So.2d at 280.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">In so ruling, the intermediate court relied upon case law involving State projects beside, not on, private land.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The Louisiana Supreme Court reversed in favor of Garrick, the landowner, emphasizing that when part of a private landowner\u2019s tract is taken, he is entitled to recompense for use of that part, even if the damage suffered is not peculiar to his tract. It ruled that there was sufficient evidence of damage to Garrick\u2019s remainder, as proven by his witness\u2019 observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">\u201c[T]hey saw and counted traffic, heard the noise, felt the vibrations of the heavy trucks and noted the effect on the tenants; they described the change in the character of the neighborhood.\u201d 256 So.2d at 115.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The dissenting justice pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">\u201cThe majority has made a distinction in the damages that will be paid when there is no taking, and the damages to be paid when there is the slightest partial taking, even though in fact the damages suffered in both instances may be the same in kind and in degree. No attempt has been made to justify the difference in the two situations as a matter of law or of public policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">* * * * <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">For the first time in our jurisprudence, the majority here has summarily included future traffic noises as an item of severance damages. The overwhelming majority view in this country is that this is a non-compensable damage. <em>Sackman, supra. </em>The dissent in <em>Dennison </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>which represents the majority view elsewhere \u2014 and probably the continuing majority view in New York because of the divisions and concurrences in that opinion \u2014 shows the inherent dangers under the contrary view.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>As these cases demonstrate, there is no consensus on what elements should be included in the measure of consequential damages. The common injury rule, which attempts to limit includable elements of damage to the remainder to those uniquely caused by public use of the taken land, admits of three interpretations. One method would include all elements of damage to the remainder resulting from public use of the taken portion of an owner\u2019s land, but would exclude all elements of consequential damage from use of abutting lands. 1 L. Orgel, <em>Valuation Under Eminent Domain </em>\u00a7 56 (1953). A second method termed the \u201cMassachusetts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> increased proximity rule,\u201d would compensate the landowner for all consequential damages that the public use does to his remaining land <em>in excess of </em>the damage suffered if the public work had abutted his property. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 55. In this case, for example, the appellees would be compensated for incremental aesthetic damage to their remainder caused by its increased proximity of the highway, which ran across the land taken, instead of beside it. A third method, advocated by appellant, would include only those damages that are different in kind, not degree, from those suffered by abutting landowners. Citing out-of-state decisions as persuasive authority, appellant argues that such factors as noise and dust, which are a normal incident of a highway, experienced by the general public, should be categorically excluded from consideration. <em>See State v. Blobeck Inv. Co., </em>233 Mo.App. 858, 110 S.W.2d 860 (1937); <em>State v. Stoddard Gin Co., </em>62 S.W.2d 940 (Mo.App.1933); <em>Dept. of Public Works &amp; Bldgs. v. Bloomer, </em>28 Ill.2d 267, 191 N.E.2d 245, 249 (1963). It argues that since section 12-104(b) of the Real Property article provides that \u201cresulting damages shall be diminished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>to the extent of the value of the <em>special </em>(particular) benefits to the remainder arising from the plaintiff\u2019s future use of the part taken,\u201d the landowner\u2019s entitlement to compensation should be symmetrically limited to special or particular damages resulting from such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">As our statutory language suggests, however, Maryland does not use this third measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Section 12-104(b) of the Real Property article mandates recompense for <em>\u201cany </em>severance or resulting damage to the remaining land by reason of the taking and of future use by the plaintiff of the part taken.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Definition of the term \u201cany\u201d varies depending on the context in which it is used. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>86 (5th ed. 1979). Here, the Legislature\u2019s use of the broad, inclusive term \u201cany,\u201d for assessment of consequential damages, as contrasted with the narrow, exclusive terms \u201cspecial (particular)\u201d for assessment of setoffs, does not evince a legislative intent to restrict compensation to particular categories of damage to the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Appellant\u2019s suggested method for excluding entire categories of damage would fall short of the measure of just compensation, <em>i.e., </em>to put the landowner in as good a pecuniary position as if no taking had occurred. <em>Dodson v. Anne Arundel County, supra, </em>294 Md. at 494, 451 A.2d 317. Triers of fact wishing to avoid this unjust prospect of excluding entire categories of damage would be forced to adopt strained distinctions between damage to the remainder and to the general public. <em>See State ex rel. State H. Comm\u2019n v. Franchise R. Int., </em>577 S.W.2d 925 (Mo.App.1979). In either case, this rule of exclusion would impose an additional, unwarranted obstruction to attainment of just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\"><em>Garrick </em>and <em>Dennison, </em>both <em>supra, </em>demonstrate that aesthetic damage from highways \u2014 such as noise, pollution, and dust \u2014 need not be categorically excluded from consequential damages simply because they are a sort of detri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>ment suffered by the public generally. <em>Accord, e.g., City of Yonkers v. State, </em>40 N.Y.2d 408, 386 N.Y.S.2d 865, 353 N.E.2d 829 (1976); <em>State v. Board of Education of City of Elizabeth, </em>116 N.J.Super. 305, 282 A.2d 71 (1971); <em>State Road Commission v.

(1973). 5 <em>Nichols on Eminent Domain </em>16-11 to 16-12 (1981). <em>Nichols </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">\u201c[Wjhere part of a tract is physically appropriated, . . . it matters not that the injury is suffered in common with the general public. The sole test in such case is whether the damage complained of is directly attributable to the taking.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Vol. 4A, \u00a7 14.01 at 14-3 to 14-4. <em>Accord State v. Board of Education of City of Elizabeth, supra, </em>116 N.J.Super. at 313-15, 282 A.2d at 76 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">As we have noted,- one way to effect this test is to limit recovery to damages from use of the taken portion, only. Another way is to use the \u201cincreased proximity\u201d rule. Our statute, Real Prop, section 12-104(b), adopts the first method, modifying the word \u201cany\u201d with the phrase <em>\u201cby reason of . . </em>. future use by the plaintiff of the part taken.\u201d (Emphasis added.) An example of this method can be found in <em>Johnson v. Gas &amp; Electric Co., </em>187 Md. 454, 50 A.2d 918, 170 A.L.R. 709 (1947). In that case the power company, exercising condemnation authority granted by the State, took a right of way across part of Johnson\u2019s land for construction of an electrical line. The line was to be placed on transmission towers, three of which were to be placed on Johnson\u2019s land. The trial court admitted evidence of consequential damage from the three towers, but excluded evidence of damage resulting from seven other towers, visible from his remaining land, that carried the transmission line across neighboring property. Johnson contended on appeal that the damage from the transmission line was not limited to consideration of those portions placed on his land, since the entire transmission line was a single unit, and that he was entitled to damages from the construction of the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>transmission line across the property of others because his property would be damaged by the sight of the transmission line on the neighboring property. The Court of Appeals declared that it had never been presented with this precise contention before, but noted that existing legislation and case law referred only to consequential damages from use of the taken portion of a condemnee\u2019s land. <em>Id. </em>at 468-70, citing <em>Realty Improvement Co. v. Consolidated Gas, Elec. Light &amp; Power Co. of Baltimore, </em>156 Md. 581, 144 A. 710 (1929); <em>Pumphrey v. State Roads Commission, </em>175 Md. 498, 2 A.2d 668 (1938). The Court relied heavily on <em>Campbell v. United States, </em>266 U.S. 368, 45 S.Ct. 115, 69 L.Ed. 328 (1924). In that case, the government took 1.81 acres of Campbell\u2019s land to be part of a 1,300 acre plant site for the production of nitrates. When Campbell sued for compensation, the district court found that the land taken was worth $750.00, and that the taking damaged the remainder $2,250. It also found that the use of lands acquired from others for the same project would damage his remainder $5,000.00. The Supreme Court allowed the first two items, but disallowed the last, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\">\u201cThe damages resulting to the remainder from the taking of a part were separable from those caused by the use to be made of the lands acquired from others. The proposed use of the lands taken from others did not constitute a taking of his property. <em>Richards v. Washington Terminal Co., </em>233 U.S. 546, 554, 34 S.Ct. 654, 58 L.Ed. 1088, L.R.A. 1915A, 887. Plaintiff had no right to prevent the taking and use of the lands of others; and the exertion by the United States of the power of eminent domain did not deprive him of any right to respect of such lands. And, if the land taken from plaintiff had belonged to another, or if it had not been deemed part and parcel of his estate, he would not have been entitled to anything on account of the diminution in value of his estate. It is only because of the taking of a part of his land that he became entitled to any damages resulting to the rest. In the absence of a taking the provision of the Fifth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>giving just compensation does not apply; and there is no statute applicable in this case that enlarges the constitutional right. If the former private owners had devoted their lands to the identical uses for which they were acquired by the United States or to which they probably will be put, as found by the court, they would not have become liable for the resulting diminution in value of plaintiffs property. The liability of the United States is not greater than would be that of the private users. Plaintiff cites and relies upon <em>Blesch v. Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway Co., </em>43 Wis. 183, <em>C.K. &amp; N. Ry. Co. v. VanCleave, 52 </em>Kan. 665, 33 P. 472, and <em>Haggard v. Independent School District, </em>113 Iowa 486, 85 N.W. 777, to support his contention that to be entitled to have the damages found to have resulted to the remainder of his estate by the uses made and to be made of the lands acquired from others. In each of these cases, it was impossible separately to ascertain the damages caused to the remainder of the owner\u2019s tract by the taking and proposed use of a part of it. In this case, such damages were separately found, and plaintiff does not complain in respect of the amount of that element. We think that plaintiff\u2019s contention is not sustained. The rule supported by better reason and the weight of authority is that the just compensation assured by the Fifth Amendment to an owner, a part of whose land is taken for public use, does not include the diminution in value of the remainder caused by the acquisition and use of adjoining lands of others for the same undertaking. <em>See Walker v. Old Colony &amp; Newport Ry. Co., </em>103 Mass. 10, 15, 4 Am.Rep. 509; <em>Lincoln v. Commonwealth, </em>164 Mass. 368, 377, 41 N.E. 489; <em>Adams v. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Northern R.

United States of America, supra, </em>the damages resulting to the remainder of the land not taken were separable from those caused by the use to be made of the land acquired from others, because appellants own witnesses in their testimony were able to separate such alleged damages. We must therefore conclude that the trial judge was correct in refusing the proffered testimony as to the damage caused to the appellants\u2019 land by the use of adjoining land of others on which the proposed overhead electric line is to be constructed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>187 Md. at 473, 50 A.2d 918.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The Court of Appeals did not further diminish Johnson\u2019s consequential damages from public use of <em>his </em>land, even though the entire neighborhood was similarly affected, and even though his property would have no doubt suffered some depreciation if the transmission towers had bordered on his land. The <em>Johnson </em>holding thus puts the landowner in approximately as good a pecuniary position as if no taking had occurred. <em>Dodson </em>v. <em>Anne Arundel County, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Thus, the jury in the case <em>sub judice </em>should have considered consequential damages from the public use of the condemned land, not abutting lands, if these sources of damage were separable. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Gas &amp; Electric Co., supra; </em>Annot., 59 A.L.R.3d 488, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4 (1974); 27 Am. Jur.2d <em>Eminent Domain </em>\u00a7 310 at 127 (1966); 1 Orgel, <em>Valuation Under Eminent Domain, </em>\u00a7 56 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\"><em>Johnson </em>and the <em>Campbell </em>decision on which it relied, involved separated sources of damage. But when, as here, the public project involves vehicular traffic that moves toward the taken portion of an owner\u2019s land, through it, and then away, the attempt to discriminate between the sources of consequential damage may amount to little more than a quixotic \u201cattempt to separate the inseparables.\u201d 1 L. Orgel, <em>Valuation Under Eminent Domain </em>263 (1953). <em>Accord State v. Board of Education of City of Elizabeth, </em>282 A.2d at 77; <em>City of Tampa v. Texas Company, </em>107 So.2d 216, 224 (Fla. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>App.1958). It may be unrealistic to say that appellants\u2019 taken land is \u201cused\u201d only when traffic passes over it. The traffic approaching and departing their land increases the noise, pollution and other aesthetic detriment just as airplanes do when using an airport, or trains do when using a station. <em>See Blesch v. Railway Co., </em>2 N.W. 113 (Wis.1879); <em>Chicago, K. &amp; N. Ry. Co. v. VanCleave, </em>52 Kan. 665, 33 P. 472 (1893); <em>Haggard v. Ind. School Dist., </em>113 Iowa 486, 85 N.W. 777, 780 (1901) <em>cited in </em>170 A.L.R. 721, 726 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">If damages from the taken portion and abutting lands are inseparable, the <em>Johnson </em>decision does not furnish a measure of damages. The increased proximity rule, though precise, suffers from the same difficulty of application that renders the <em>Johnson </em>rule inapplicable. That is, if the jury could not separate out those damages uniquely stemming from the use of the taken land, it would be equally confounded by the task of measuring the damages attributable to the increased proximity of the project. <em>Id. </em>One could envision the trial court charging the jury to apply the increased proximity rule and then, smiling ingenuously, saying, \u201cI have described the Augean stables. Cleaning them is your job.\u201d (Without the Herculean strength.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\"> Perhaps for this reason \u2014 ease of application \u2014 if no other, the general rule is that when damages are inseparable, the jury may consider consequential damages from the entire project. 5 <em>Nichols on Eminent Domain </em>16-8 (1981); 1 L. Orgel, <em>Valuation Under Eminent Domain </em>258, 266 (1953); 27 Am.Jur.2d Eminent Domain \u00a7 310 at 127 n. 10 (1966); Annot., 59 A.L.R.3d \u00a7 3[b] at 494, 496 (1974). As the Superior Court of New Jersey said in <em>State v. Board of Education of City of Elizabeth, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">\u201cWhere part of an owner\u2019s land is taken for a public improvement such as this, and the part taken constitutes an integral and inseparable part of a single use to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>the land taken and other adjoining land is put, the owner is entitled to recover the full damage to his remaining property due to such public improvement, even though portions of the public improvement are located on land taken from surrounding owners.\u201d 282 A.2d at 77.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aql\">Federal courts interpreting the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Campbell </em>decision, on which the Maryland Court\u2019s <em>Johnson </em>decision relied, have held that in certain circumstances the property owner can recover consequential damages from the entire project if he can establish that his property was indispensable to the project, that the use put to his taken property was a substantial part of the project, and that the damages were inseparable. <em>United States v. 15.65 Acres of Land, </em>689 F.2d 1329, 1322 (9th Cir.1982); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pope and Talbot, Inc., </em>293 F.2d 822, 825 (1961); <em>cited in Griffith v. Montgomery County, supra </em>57 Md.App. 472, at 480, 470 A.2d 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">It may be objected that this crude measure of damages lacks the precision with which the Massachusetts rule produces parity between owners of abutting land and owners of partially taken land. Precise parity, however, is not essential. Owners of abutting land recover nothing, not because zero compensation is considered just, but because they have not met the threshold constitutional prerequisite of having land taken.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It would, therefore, be inappropriate to use them as the standard for determining just compensation of owners whose lands are partially taken. Annot., 59 A.L. R.3d 488, 492-93 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Also, as the Superior Court of New Jersey observed in <em>State v. Board of Education of City of Elizabeth, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJQ\">\u201c[A] margin of discretion exists for both courts and the legislature in order that they may assure just compensation \u2014 each may in this effort prescribe a rule of damages more favorable to the landowner than that which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>satisfy the minimum requirement of the Constitution.\u201d 282 A.2d at 79.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\"><em>See Lore v.

Md. Real Prop.Code Ann. \u00a7 12-104(b) (1981 repl. vol.). Depending on the evidence adduced at trial, the consequential damage caused by the part of the public project on the condemned portion may or may not be separable from detriment suffered by the public generally as a result of the entire project. If separable, the landowner should be compensated for all damages done to his remainder by the part of the public project on the condemned portion. <em>See Commonwealth Department of Highways v. Williams, </em>487 S.W.2d 290, 59 A.L.R.3d 481, 485 (Ky.1972). If inseparable, the landowner should be compensated for the specific damage done to his remainder by the entire project. <em>State </em>v. <em>Board of Education of City of Elizabeth, supra; Roman Catholic Bishop of Springfield </em>v. <em>Com., supra, </em>392 N.E.2d at 831. <em>See </em>Annot., 59 A.L.R.3d 488, 494-96 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Allowable consequential damages to the remainder caused by the taking may be based on the same specific conditions which adversely affect other properties near to or abutting the public project, but because there were no takings, these latter property owners would not be entitled to damages. These specific conditions affecting alike the remainder and other non-remainder properties and for which consequential damages are allowable when there is a taking, must be distinguished from those general conditions created by the public project affecting the general public and the community generally for which damages are not allowable in any event. Includable in the former or specific category are such conditions as noise, traffic, dust, dirt and pollution; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>in the latter, or general category are changes in the general environmental atmosphere such as from rural to suburban, from suburban to rural, or from residential to commercial. <em>Nichols, supra, </em>Volume 5, \u00a7 16.101[2] at 16-13 and <em>State v. McMurtrey, supra. Cf. Dennison, supra </em>(Court of Appeals of New York allowed both specific and general damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">The trial court in this case allowed the jury to hear evidence of general detriment done to appellees\u2019 neighborhood by the highway, some of which evidence would have been relevant had the damages been inseparable. There was no instruction as to the separability of the damages. Understandably, the court did not discriminate in its instruction to the jury between the two standards of compensation. Its general instruction to assess diminution of the remainder\u2019s fair market value invited the jury to consider the effects of the entire highway on that property. We will consequently remand for retrial for the purpose of determining whether the damages are separable and thereafter which standard of damage is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">On retrial, the appellees will have the opportunity to present evidence in accordance with this opinion of specific detriment done to their remainder by the roadway. In assessing the extent of the detriment and the separability <em>vel non </em>of its sources, the jury may consider such evidence as expert testimony and the appellees\u2019 testimony, in addition to its view of the site. <em>See Bergeman v. State Roads Comm., </em>218 Md. 137, 142-43, 146 A.2d 48 (1958); <em>City of Baltimore v. Smulyan, </em>41 Md.App. 202, 223, 397 A.2d 198 (1979); <em>Baltimore City v.

She testified that the map showed the path was near but not on her property. She also acknowledged that the new road\u2019s taking of a neighbor\u2019s property extinguished his existing right of way across her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Appellant wished to call two witnesses in rebuttal. One, Mr. Wilkerson of the Park and Planning Commission, brought the Master Plan plat shown to Mrs. Brannon in 1976. Appellant proffered that the plat would show the proposed roadway crossing the property. The trial court excluded this evidence, in the belief that Mrs. Brannon had testified that she could not tell whether the road crossed the property. The second witness, Isabelle Gatewood, was a real estate appraiser who had already testified during the appellant\u2019s case in chief. At that time she had been asked about the special or particular benefits to the property resulting from the roadway. The trial court, however, sustained an objection to such testimony, indicating that it would be more appropriate for rebuttal. In rebuttal, appellant proffered that the witness would testify that the extinguishment of the right of way would benefit the property; she would not, however, quantify the value of that benefit. The court excluded this testimony on the ground that it would not aid the jury in assessing damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">As we said in <em>Riffey v. Tonder, </em>36 Md.App. 633, 645, 375 A.2d 1138 (1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">\u201cBasically, rebuttal evidence is any competent evidence which explains, is a direct reply to or a contradiction of material evidence introduced by an accused in a criminal case or by a party in a civil action. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hepple, </em>279 Md. 265, 270, 368 A.2d 445 (1977), <em>aff\u2019g. Hepple </em>v. <em>State, </em>31 Md.App. 525, 358 A.2d 283 (1976); <em>Mayson v. State, </em>238 Md. 283, 289, 208 A.2d 599, 602 (1965); <em>Lane v. State, </em>226 Md. 81, 90, 172 A.2d 400, 404 (1961), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 993 [82 S.Ct. 611, 7 L.Ed.2d 529] (1962); 6 Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 1873 (Chadbourn rev. 1976).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>Accord Thimatariga v. Chambers, </em>46 Md.App. 260, 279, 416 A.2d 1326 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">Insofar as Mrs. Brannon denies that the 1976 map showed the proposed roadway crossing the subject property, admission of that map is proper rebuttal. Insofar as she admits extinguishment of the right of way, further testimony as to that fact alone would be needless duplication, not rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">rv.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\n<em>Closing Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Mrs. Brannon testified that her attorney had hired two real estate appraisers, Frederick Lauterbach and Anath Bright, to appraise her land, but that she never saw an appraisal. Neither appraiser testified at trial. In closing argument, appellant attempted to convince the jury that their absence implied that their appraisals were lower than appellees wanted. The trial court sustained appellees\u2019 objection to this argument, and instructed the jury, \u201cYou are not to consider any absence of witnesses in this case... . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Appellant contends that this constitutes an abuse of discretion. The general rule is stated in <em>Hoverter v. Director, </em>231 Md. 608, 609, 188 A.2d 696 (1963):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">\u201cIn a civil case it is well settled that failure of a party to produce an available witness who could testify on a material issue, if not explained, gives rise to an inference that the testimony would be unfavorable, and is a legitimate subject of comment by counsel in argument to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-10\"><em>Quoted </em>in <em>Hitch v. Hall, </em>42 Md.App. 260, 264, 399 A.2d 953 (1979). <em>See Walston v. Dobbins, </em>10 Md.App. 490, 496-97, 271 A.2d 367 (1970). <em>See generally, </em>29 Am.Jur.2d <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 180 <em>et seq. </em>(1967). This rule is subject to exceptions depending on the facts and circumstances of individual cases. <em>Critzer v. Shegogue, </em>236 Md. 411, 421, 204 A.2d 180 (1964).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>\u201cThe controlling requirement justifying the argument to the jury is that the available witness must be able to testify on a material issue, and that the testimony must be relevant and material, and not merely corroborative or cumulative. <em>Jacobson </em>v. <em>Julian, </em>246 Md. 549, 229 A.2d 108 (1967); <em>Brooks v. Daley, </em>242 Md. 185, 218 A.2d 184 (1966); <em>Critzer v.

This explanation, if still true at retrial, would warrant preclusion of adverse inference from his absence. Appellees state in their brief: \u201cThe details of Lauterbach\u2019s estimate were furnished the appellant at a Review Board hearing and under discovery, and his opinion of damages, $27,500, was closer to the landowner\u2019s estimate than to that of the government.\u201d Nonetheless, unless there is some other excuse for this appraiser\u2019s absence, opposing counsel may argue that the absence implies a variance between his estimate and the appellees\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED FOR TRIAL NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">COSTS TO BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN APPELLANT AND APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\">. <em>Andrews v.
