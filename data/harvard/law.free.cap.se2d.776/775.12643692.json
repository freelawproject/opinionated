Woods,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=278%20Va.%20196\">\n    278 Va. 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 204,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20S.E.2d%20288\">\n    677 S.E.2d 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 293 (2009). Accordingly, our narrative of the facts of this case comes directly from the circuit court's recitation of events as set forth in its written opinion, as supported by the evidence introduced at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Route 419 Project\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In February 2008, Ray Sink Pipeline Company (\"Ray Sink\") was acting as general contractor for a project on Route 419 in\n   Roanoke County. The Route 419 project required Ray Sink to lay water lines along the right edge of Route 419's southbound lanes. To accomplish this task, Ray Sink needed to cut a channel in the existing asphalt at the road's edge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ray Sink hired S.R. Draper Paving (\"Draper Paving\") as a subcontractor for the Route 419 project. Draper Paving provided workers who would follow the progress of Ray Sink's work and fill the open water-line channel with new asphalt. Ray Sink also hired LMC Barricade LLC (\"LMC Barricade\") as a subcontractor for the Route 419 project. LMC Barricade was responsible for establishing lane closures and setting up safety warnings, including signage, for the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Richard Slone's Jobsite Activities\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Draper Paving employed Richard Linwood Slone as a dump truck driver, and Slone was assigned to work the Route 419 project hauling loads of hot asphalt to the jobsite. Because of the logistics of the jobsite, Slone could not simply dump the asphalt from the truck into the open water-line channel. Instead, Slone would raise and lower the dump truck's bed to pour asphalt into the bucket of a front-end loader. The front-end loader would then transfer the asphalt into the open water-line channel, and other Draper Paving employees would level the asphalt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Draper Paving did not originally intend to use a front-end loader in this process. Initially, the crew planned to use a piece of machinery called a \"road widener,\" but that machine malfunctioned. The switch from the road widener to the front-end loader had two consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   First, because the dump truck's bed was wider than the front-end loader's bucket, hot asphalt would spill around the bucket's sides when Slone lifted the dump truck's bed to unload the asphalt. And because the crew was working at night in February, the spilled asphalt cooled quickly on the ground and hardened. To avoid leaving hardened piles of asphalt on the road, Slone would periodically exit the dump truck to check this spillage. If spillage needed to be picked up, Slone would pull the dump truck forward and other Draper Paving employees could scrape the spillage from the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Second, before the road widener malfunctioned, the project only required the closure of the right lane of Route 419. However, to use the front-end loader, the operator was required to back into the left lane of Route 419, so he could then turn the loader perpendicular to the dump truck and pull forward to dump the asphalt into the open water-line channel. Such use required periodic closures of the left lane. Draper Paving did not\n   communicate to LMC Barricade the need to close the left lane, and LMC Barricade did not adjust the safety setup or traffic pattern to accommodate this change. Instead, a Draper Paving employee would use a stop/ slow sign and stand in the center of Route 419 to flag motorists whenever the front-end loader needed to maneuver into the left lane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    James Harmon's Jobsite Activities\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Draper Paving employed James Harmon as a paving superintendent, and Harmon was assigned to work the Route 419 project as the project supervisor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Harmon also operated the front-end loader on the night of the accident because the original operator employee was unable to get to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To get to the jobsite, Harmon drove a company pickup truck. Harmon used the pickup truck to transport himself, other Draper Paving employees, and tools to the jobsite. It was also Harmon's \"regular practice\" to use the pickup truck as \"a safety tool\" by acting as a safety buffer between oncoming traffic and Draper Paving employees. To this end, the pickup truck was outfitted with a safety strobe light that would flash and spin when activated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Upon arriving at the jobsite for the Route 419 project, Harmon parked the pickup truck near the beginning of the worksite just beyond where the orange safety cones blocked oncoming traffic's access to the right lane of Route 419. Harmon turned on all of the pickup truck's lights, including the headlights, the hazard lights, and the safety strobe light. As Draper Paving's work progressed along the highway, Harmon would move the pickup truck forward so that it would remain in close proximity to the working Draper\n   Paving employees. At the time of the accident, the pickup truck was approximately 200 feet from where Slone and Harmon were working.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The Accident\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On the second night of the project, shortly after midnight, Slone had just finished unloading asphalt into the front-end loader, and Harmon was getting ready to drop the asphalt from the front-end loader into the open water-line channel. Before that could happen, however, Harmon heard a shout, turned in his seat to see vehicle headlights quickly approaching, and braced for impact. Two drunk drivers driving on Route 419 disregarded the Draper Paving employee who was acting as a flagger, and both vehicles crashed into the front-end loader. The crash spun the front-end loader in a clockwise direction and into Slone's dump truck. After the accident, Draper Paving employees discovered Slone pinned between one of the drunk driver's vehicles, the rear blade of the front-end loader, and the dump truck's left rear tires. Slone died of his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Bratton and Selective Insurance Company of America (\"Selective Insurance\") filed separate declaratory judgment actions in the Circuit Court of Roanoke County, and these cases were consolidated. Draper Paving had taken out a motor vehicle insurance policy with Selective Insurance (the \"Selective Insurance Policy\"). Bratton and Selective Insurance sought to determine whether Slone fell within the scope of this Selective Insurance Policy's coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Bratton and Selective Insurance filed cross motions for summary judgment. Because material issues of fact remained in dispute, the circuit court held a bench trial. At the conclusion of this trial, and upon consideration of the evidence and the arguments and briefs of counsel, the circuit court held in a written opinion that at the time of the accident Slone did not fall within the scope of the Selective Insurance Policy. Thus, Bratton was not entitled to insurance proceeds from Selective Insurance. The circuit court entered a final order to this effect, dismissed the declaratory judgment actions with prejudice, and memorialized the parties' stipulation\n   of what insurance proceeds Bratton is entitled to receive in the absence of coverage under the Selective Insurance Policy: proceeds already paid from the two drunk drivers' insurance\n   policies, and proceeds to be paid from Slone's personal motor vehicle insurance policy taken out with State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (\"State Farm\"). Later, the court summarily denied Bratton's motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Bratton timely appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Standard Of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This civil matter was \"decided by a court without the intervention of a jury,\" and therefore we review the lower court's factual findings with a degree of deference. Code \u00a7 8.01-680. We will not hold the circuit court's actions in error as contrary to the evidence \"unless it appears from the evidence that such judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20S.E.2d%20288\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And in reviewing the record, we \"examine the evidence in the light most favorable to [Selective Insurance], the prevailing party at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Nolte v.

At the center of this appeal is the construction and application of the terms of an insurance contract, which are issues of law that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Doctors Co. v. Women's Healthcare Assocs.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=285%20Va.%20566\">\n    285 Va. 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 571,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=740%20S.E.2d%20523\">\n    740 S.E.2d 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 525 (2013) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Virginia Farm Bureau Mut.

Importantly, this means that we determine de novo not only what contractual terms mean, but also \"how those terms apply to the facts of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Spectra-4, LLP v.

That is, even if we ascertain that the \"circuit court's findings of historical fact are supported by credible evidence and are not plainly wrong,\" so that they \"will not be disturbed on appeal,\" we must review de novo the legal issue of whether those facts give rise to coverage under a motor vehicle insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    Simpson v.

In compliance with the Code, Draper Paving and Selective Insurance executed an endorsement as part of the Selective Insurance Policy to govern uninsured and underinsured motorist insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In the \"Who Is Insured\" section of this endorsement, the policy reads \"2. Anyone else 'occupying' a 'covered auto.' \" The terms \"occupying\" and \"covered auto\" are further defined in the endorsement. There is no dispute that the two vehicles at issue in this appeal-the dump truck Slone operated, and Harmon's company pickup truck-were each a \"covered auto\" under this provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In dispute is whether Slone was \"occupying\" these vehicles at the time of the accident. In the \"Words And Phrases With Special Meaning\" section of the endorsement, the policy reads \"11. 'Occupying' means in, upon, using, getting in, on, out of or off.\" On appeal, Bratton argues that the circuit court erred by failing to hold that Slone was \"occupying\" the two covered vehicles by failing to hold (1) that Slone was both \"using\" and \"getting ... out of\" the dump truck, and (2) that Slone was \"using\" the pickup truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Coverage Of The Dump Truck\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Bratton's assignment of error 1 reads in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   I. The circuit court erred as a matter of law in determining that Karen Slone Bratton ... was not entitled to insurance proceeds through Slone's work vehicle [, the\n   dump truck,] when [Slone] was crushed and killed against the rear tires of that vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A. The circuit court erred as a matter of law in determining that at the time Slone was killed, he was not in the process of \"[g]etting out of\" his work vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   B. The circuit court erred in finding that Bratton agreed that Slone was not \"[g]etting out of\" his work vehicle at the time of his death and, therefore, the case hinged only on whether Slone was \"using\" the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Meaning Of \"Getting Out Of\" A Vehicle\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Selective Insurance Policy's provision central to this appeal is commonly found in motor vehicle insurance policies, whereby coverage extends to the \"occupying\" of certain vehicles, and \"occupying\" is further defined to cover a variety of discrete situations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tropf v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10695626\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/558/158/#p159\">\n    558 N.W.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 159-60 (Iowa 1997). We have encountered many such policies, and have established whether certain facts fall within the scope of some of these discrete situations which define \"occupying.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edwards v. Government Emples. Ins. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"697372\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/256/128/#p134\">\n    256 Va. 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 134-35,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20S.E.2d%20819\">\n    500 S.E.2d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 822 (1998) (determining whether an individual was \"occupying\" a vehicle because he was \"in\" or \"upon\" that vehicle). Although we have reviewed insurance policies that define \"occupying\" as including \"getting out of\" a vehicle, we have not addressed what it means to be \"getting out of\" a vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newman v. Erie Ins. Exch.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"697430\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/256/501/#p505\">\n    256 Va. 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 505,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=507%20S.E.2d%20348\">\n    507 S.E.2d 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 350 (1998). Similarly, we have encountered insurance policies that define \"occupying\" as including \"alighting\" from a vehicle-which is simply another way of phrasing \"getting out of\" that has become less common in contemporary vernacular-but we have not addressed what that language means.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania Nat'l Mut. Casualty Ins. Co. v. Bristow,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6810450\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/207/381/#p384\">\n    207 Va. 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 384-85,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=150%20S.E.2d%20125\">\n    150 S.E.2d 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 128 (1966).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We take this opportunity to define what it means to be \"getting out of\" a vehicle for purposes of a motor vehicle insurance policy. As the phrase is left undefined in the contract, the \"ordinary meaning\" of the language prevails, as understood \"in light of the contract as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Bartolomucci v. Federal Ins. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=289%20Va.%20361\">\n    289 Va. 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 371,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=770%20S.E.2d%20451\">\n    770 S.E.2d 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 456 (2015) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, to be \"getting out of\" a vehicle is simply to remove one's self from the vehicle, so as to depart from the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The self-evident meaning of this language is, of course, easily understood in the abstract. But difficulty arises when attempting to\n   apply this meaning to the facts of a case. In the related context of construing \" alighting\" language, courts from other jurisdictions have fallen into two groups. Some courts consider the act of leaving a vehicle to be complete as soon as an individual severs physical contact with the vehicle, whereas other courts look to additional factors beyond physical contact to determine whether the act has been completed.\n   <em>\n    West Am. Ins. Co. v. Dickerson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9999211\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/865/320/#p322\">\n    865 S.W.2d 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 322 (Ky.1993) (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We reject the bright-line rule that the process of \"getting out of\" a vehicle is complete as soon as physical contact with the vehicle is severed. The discrete situations illustrating the common and ordinary meaning of the term \"occupying\" certainly connote \"a close\n   <em>\n    proximity\n   </em>\n   \" to a vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Stern v. Cincinnati Ins.

But the ordinary understanding of the process of \"getting out of\" a vehicle does not necessitate ongoing physical contact with that vehicle. Indeed, such an unduly narrow construction of \"getting out of\" fails to find any basis in the language agreed to by the contracting parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tropf,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10695626\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/558/158/#p159\">\n    558 N.W.2d at 159-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"some insurers ... have added a physical contact requirement to their definition of 'occupying' \" because courts typically do not find that \"occupying\" turns solely upon physical contact).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Instead, we join those courts that look beyond mere physical contact to determine whether an individual was, or had already\n   completed, \"getting out of\" a vehicle. But even among these courts there is disagreement regarding when the process of departing from a vehicle is complete. At the farthest end of the spectrum are courts that employ a \"zone of safety\" test, so that an individual does not complete the act of departing from a vehicle \"until he or she reaches a place of safety ... to which he or she is proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Joins v.

Selective Insurance contends that this issue was not \"argued with any substance\" before the circuit court.

In relevant part, this motion identified the points in the record where Bratton had argued that Slone was covered by the Selective Insurance Policy because he was \"getting out of\" the dump truck. In response, the circuit court summarily denied Bratton's motion for reconsideration. Although the court did not explicitly address the issue in its order, by its ruling, the court, without analyzing the law or the evidence, implicitly held that Slone was not\n   \"getting out of\" the dump truck at the time of the accident. Pursuant to assignment of error I.A., this was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The evidence in the record establishes that Slone was operating the dump truck on the night of the accident. The last thing anyone saw Slone do prior to the collision was unload hot asphalt from the dump truck into the front-end loader. The next time Slone was seen was when he was discovered pinned between one of the drunk drivers' vehicles, the rear blade of the front-end loader, and the dump truck's left rear tires. The record reflects that approximately less than 30 seconds elapsed between the time when Slone completed the task of unloading the asphalt and the collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Selective Insurance correctly observes that Slone's exact location during these 30 seconds cannot be determined beyond all doubt. But inferences drawn from the direct evidence in the record establish that Slone was still vehicle-oriented, and therefore was \"getting out of\" the dump truck at the time of the accident.\n   <em>\n    Barry v.

Such inferences amount to circumstantial evidence.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The direct evidence establishes three events that occurred within the approximately 30 second timeframe prior to Slone's\n   death. First, after the asphalt was unloaded onto the front-end loader, and upon Harmon's signal, Slone lowered the bed of the dump truck into a flat position. Second, Slone departed from the dump truck's raised cab and, with the dump truck's engine still running, closed the door behind him. Third, Slone went down the stairs from the raised cab to the ground, and then traversed at least 9 feet to the rear tires. The inference from these actions, considered collectively, sufficiently establishes that Slone did not have enough time to begin a new activity separate from getting out of the vehicle. Likewise, there is no evidence that would lead to a contrary inference, that is, that Slone was no longer vehicle-oriented and had begun a new activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

In fact, no one knew Slone was outside the truck until he was found after the accident.\" J.A. at 349.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court also took into account the frequently repeated concession by the Estate that Slone had \"exited the dump truck\" prior to the accident.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 121-25, 316, 341. Though perhaps not technically a binding legal admission, it nonetheless rang true. Slone obviously had gotten out of the dump truck. He had closed the door to the truck cab, and he had walked at least nine feet prior to the accident. One of the drunk drivers struck Slone and pushed him underneath the dump truck between two rows of rear dual tires.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 421.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Despite these irrefutable facts, the Estate invited the trial court to find that Slone, after he had \"exited the dump truck,\" was nonetheless \"getting 'out of' \" it at the time of the accident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 334, 341. The trial court rejected this counter-intuitive reasoning, as would I. The majority, however, adopts it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Citing cases from Louisiana and South Carolina, along with an American Law Reports annotation, the majority applies a \"vehicle-oriented\" standard.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 781, 782. Under this new standard, never before applied in Virginia law, the majority holds that Slone was \"getting out of\" the dump truck at the time of the accident.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 782. The entire factual basis for this putative \"legal conclusion\" is that Slone \"departed\" (or, one might say, \"got out of\") the dump truck and walked at least nine feet away from the cab in less than a minute.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 782.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The \"inference\" from this evidence, the majority reasons, \"sufficiently establishes\" that Slone was \"still in the process\" of \"getting out of\" the dump truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   This aspect of the majority opinion leaves the rails guiding appellate review and disregards the applicable burden of proof. Plainly put, the majority reviews the evidentiary record and then, for the first time on appeal, draws the \"inference\" that Slone was getting out of the dump truck because no evidence supports the \"contrary inference\" that he \"had begun [some] new activity\" (that is, something other than getting out of the dump truck) after he \"departed\" from it.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   As a general rule, an appellate court should not be drawing inferences from the\n   evidence. \"We sit as an appellate court for a review of such evidence and issues, not as a trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Temple v.
