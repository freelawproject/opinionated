McCLANAHAN.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Allstate Property and Casualty Insurance Company (\"Allstate\") appeals from a judgment entered against it in this breach of contract action brought by Jennifer L. Ploutis for payment of losses claimed under a homeowner's insurance policy issued by Allstate. Allstate contends the circuit court erred in ruling that Code \u00a7 8.01-229(E)(3), providing for tolling of the statute of limitations of nonsuited actions, applies to the contractual period of limitations for filing an action under its policy. We agree and will reverse the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 19, 2010, Ploutis' home and certain contents were damaged when water pipes in the home burst. At the time of the\n   loss, Ploutis' home was insured under a policy issued by Allstate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Allstate provided an initial payment to Ploutis, the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the cost of remaining repairs. Ploutis filed a complaint for breach of contract against Allstate on March 16, 2012, and subsequently filed an amended complaint. Upon the request of Ploutis, an order of nonsuit was entered on February 22, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ploutis filed the present action on August 21, 2013, well over two years after the damage was sustained on March 19, 2010. The policy, attached as an exhibit to the complaint, requires that actions be brought within two years \"after the inception of loss or damage.\" Allstate therefore filed a demurrer asserting that Ploutis failed to comply with the conditions precedent under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The circuit court overruled the demurrer on the grounds that the limitations period was tolled pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-229(E)(3), which tolls \"the statute of limitations\" with respect to nonsuited actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court reasoned that because the language regarding the limitations period in Allstate's policy was \"substantively\" the same as that included in the Virginia standard policy form, the limitations period was\n   \"the Virginia statute of limitations,\" and therefore subject to tolling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A final order was entered in which Allstate, without waiving its objection to the circuit court's ruling on demurrer, consented to judgment in favor of Ploutis in the amount of $5,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II. ALLSTATE POLICY AND APPLICABLE CODE PROVISIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Allstate's policy insures, inter alia, against losses resulting from fire and, therefore, is designated as a fire insurance policy under Title 38.2, Chapter 21 of the Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.2-110 and 38.2-2100. Accordingly, the policy must include the standard policy form provisions set forth in Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.2-2104 (standard insuring agreement), 38.2-2105 (standard provisions, conditions, stipulations and agreements), and 38.2-2106 (standard form for execution of policies), or a \"simplified and readable policy of insurance\" that is \"in no respect less favorable to the insured\" and is \"approved by the Commission prior to issuance.\" Code \u00a7 38.2-2107(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The period of limitations in the standard policy form is contained in Code \u00a7 38.2-2105(A), which sets forth 172 lines of standard \"provisions, conditions, stipulations, and agreements\" that relate to eighteen topics ranging from concealment and fraud to subrogation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The language on lines 164 through 168 of the standard policy form provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   No suit or action on this policy for the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity unless all the requirements of this policy shall have been complied with, and unless commenced within two years next after inception of the loss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Thus, a two-year limitations period is the minimum period allowed for fire insurance policies whether the insurer uses the standard policy form provisions set forth in Code \u00a7 38.2-2105(A) or a \"simplified and readable policy\" as authorized by Code \u00a7 38.2-2107.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Allstate's policy does not use the standard policy form and the language regarding the period of limitations is not identical to the language contained in Code \u00a7 38.2-2105(A). The policy does,\n   however, adopt the standard policy form's two-year period for bringing suit on the policy. Specifically, the policy provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   No one may bring an action against us in any way related to the existence or amount of coverage, or the amount of loss for which coverage is sought, under a coverage to which Section I Conditions applies, unless:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   a) there has been full compliance with all policy terms; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   b) the action is commenced within two years after the inception of loss or damage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   III. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Allstate contends that the circuit court erred in overruling its demurrer because the period of limitations provided for in the policy is not a statute of limitations subject to tolling under Code \u00a7 8.01-229(E)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Massie v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Virginia,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"697435\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/256/161/\">\n    256 Va. 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20S.E.2d%20509\">\n    500 S.E.2d 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998), this Court held that the tolling provision in\n   Code \u00a7 8.01-229(E)(3) does not apply to a contractual period of limitations. Code \u00a7 8.01-229(E)(3) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   If a plaintiff suffers a voluntary nonsuit as prescribed in \u00a7 8.01-380,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    the statute of limitations\n   </em>\n   with respect to such action shall be tolled by the commencement of the nonsuited action, and the plaintiff may recommence his action within six months from the date of the order entered by the court, or within the original period of limitation, or within the limitation period as provided by subdivision B 1, whichever period is longer. This tolling provision shall apply irrespective of whether the action is originally filed in a federal or a state court and recommenced in any other court, and shall apply to all actions irrespective of whether they arise under common law or statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Emphasis added.) As we recognized in\n   <em>\n    Massie,\n   </em>\n   the \"plain meaning\" of this provision is \"that, after a voluntary nonsuit, the\n   <em>\n    statute\n   </em>\n   of limitations, not a\n   <em>\n    contractual\n   </em>\n   period of limitations, is tolled.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"697435\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/256/161/\">\n    256 Va. at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20S.E.2d%20509\">\n    500 S.E.2d at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). Because we \"must accept [the statute's] plain meaning and not resort to rules of construction or extrinsic evidence,\" we concluded that \"Code \u00a7 8.01-229(E)(3) does not apply to a contractual period of limitations\" contained in an insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20S.E.2d%20509\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Like Allstate's policy, the policy in\n   <em>\n    Massie\n   </em>\n   adopted a statutorily-imposed minimum period of limitations. Specifically,\n   <em>\n    Massie\n   </em>\n   involved a twelve-month limitations period in a group health and hospitalization insurance contract.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"697435\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/256/161/\">\n    256 Va. at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20S.E.2d%20509\">\n    500 S.E.2d at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Citing Code \u00a7 38.2-314, we noted that a contractual limitations period \"must not be unreasonably short\" and that pursuant to this statute the period of limitations in an insurance contract cannot be less than one year after the loss occurs.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"697435\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/256/161/\">\n    256 Va. at 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20S.E.2d%20509\">\n    500 S.E.2d at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We expressly distinguished the period of limitations provided in the insurance contract from the five-year statute of limitations applicable to written contracts generally under Code \u00a7 8.01-246(2).\n   <em>\n    Massie,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"697435\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/256/161/\">\n    256 Va. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   164 n. 2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20S.E.2d%20509\">\n    500 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   511 n. 2. The policy's adoption of the statutorily-imposed minimum period of limitations did not alter the contractual nature of the policy's limitations period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The circuit court's ruling in this case stems from its faulty premise that Code \u00a7 38.2-2105(A) is \"the Virginia statute of limitations\" for fire insurance policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Code \u00a7 38.2-2105(A), by its own language, is not a statute of limitations but prescribes standard\n   policy form provisions for fire insurance policies. To be sure, Code \u00a7 38.2-2105(A) does not bar Ploutis' action or provide the basis for Allstate's demurrer; the basis for Allstate's demurrer is Ploutis' failure to comply with the terms of the insurance contract. Allstate's use of \"substantively\" the same language as the standard policy form did not convert the contractual limitations period into a statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chichester v. New Hampshire Fire Ins. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"802314\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/74/510/\">\n    74 Conn. 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20A.%20545\">\n    51 A. 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 547 (1902) (rejecting insured's\n   argument that the establishment of a standard policy of insurance \"in some way changes the agreement of the parties to such a policy into a statute of limitations\"),\n   <em>\n    reaffirmed in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bocchino v. Nationwide Mutual Fire Ins. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"245255\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/246/378/\">\n    246 Conn. 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=716%20A.2d%20883\">\n    716 A.2d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 885-86 (1998) (fire insurance policy's limitations period is contractual \"irrespective of the fact that the policy provision was required by a statutory policy form\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The circuit court's conclusion that the contractual limitations period in Allstate's policy was a statute of limitations also ignores the voluntary nature of insurance contracts and the essential difference between a contractual period of limitations and a statute of limitations. In contrast to statutes of limitations such as those found in Chapter 4 of Title 8.01 of the Code, contractual periods of limitations are incorporated into the terms and conditions of contracts into which parties have voluntarily entered. Had the General Assembly wanted to enact a specific statute of limitations for actions on fire insurance policies, it could have done so. Instead, the General Assembly has directed insurers to issue either a standard policy form that incorporates at minimum a two-year period of limitations or a simplified and readable policy that is no less favorable to the insured. In doing so, the General Assembly has made the limitations period a matter of contract. Accordingly, even if the policy's limitations period is \"in the language of the General Assembly and expressed in words in which the statute requires to be inserted into the policy, word for word, line for line, number for\n   number,\"\n   <em>\n    Ramsey v. Home Ins. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2047532\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/203/502/#p506\">\n    203 Va. 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 506,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=125%20S.E.2d%20201\">\n    125 S.E.2d 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 204 (1962), it remains a voluntary agreement between the parties to the insurance contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In short, neither Code \u00a7 38.2-2105 nor the contractual period of limitations provided in Allstate's policy is a \"statute of limitations\" within the meaning of Code \u00a7 8.01-229(E)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ploutis and Allstate voluntarily chose to enter into a contract that contained a two-year period of limitations for bringing an action under the policy. The insurance contract itself did not include a tolling provision or incorporate Code \u00a7 8.01-229(E)(3). \"A court must give effect to the intention of the parties as expressed in the language of their contract, and the rights of the parties must be determined accordingly.\"\n   <em>\n    Massie,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"697435\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/256/161/\">\n    256 Va. at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20S.E.2d%20509\">\n    500 S.E.2d at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Foti v.
