A police detective, who later arrived on the scene, testified at trial that the officers reported smelling \"burnt\" marijuana. On brief, Evans concedes that \"[i]n the instant case, it was undisputed that the officers smelled the odor of burning marijuana\" emanating from his apartment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Br. at 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The officers knocked on the apartment door three times, and Evans' mother answered each time. During the first encounter, the officers asked \"questions about someone smoking\" and explained\n   to her the \"heavy odor of marijuana\" that they smelled. During the second encounter, Evans' mother appeared to be \"shaking\" and \"nervous.\" She exclaimed, \"Ain't nobody smoking weed in here,\" and then \"slammed\" the door in the \"face\" of one of the officers. During this brief episode, the officers smelled the odor of marijuana \"like a gust of wind\" coming from inside the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When knocking on the door the third time, the officers \"announced out loud it was the police.\" No one answered the door for about five minutes. During this period, the officers heard unspecified movement inside the apartment. After Evans' mother finally opened the door, she quickly tried to close it again. Another strong marijuana odor wafted through the doorway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Concluding that exigent circumstances existed at this point, one of the officers put his hand on the door to prevent it from closing, and as he did so, he told Evans' mother that he was coming in to investigate. The officer then entered the apartment and observed in plain view \"a burnt marijuana blunt\" and marijuana residue. When asked by the officers if there was marijuana in the apartment, Evans' mother admitted, \"My son was smoking a blunt,\" and offered, \"I'll get it for you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Shortly thereafter, an investigator asked for and received written consent from Evans and his mother to search the apartment. In their subsequent search, investigators found cocaine, morphine, a loaded Glock handgun previously reported as stolen, a loaded Taurus handgun, three boxes containing a total of 119 rounds of ammunition, and a revolver in a container along with 6 rounds of ammunition. They also discovered plastic sandwich bags and over $1,000 in cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the suppression hearing, Evans conceded that the officers had probable cause to believe that marijuana was in the apartment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=690%20S.E.2d%2095\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=690%20S.E.2d%2095\">\n    at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He argued, however, that his consent, as well as his mother's, should be deemed invalid because the officers entered their apartment without a proper showing of exigent circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to Evans, the police, by announcing their presence and their awareness of a heavy odor of marijuana, created the exigency wholly by police action. Evans concluded the suppression argument with the assertion that the police officers \"wholly set up\" the circumstances in which \"foreseeable evidence would be destroyed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Evans cited\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Evans failed to mention, however, that the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Kentucky v.

Neither the Commonwealth nor the trial court corrected Evans on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court denied Evans' motion to suppress, holding that his consent, as well as his mother's, was voluntarily and freely given. Evans then made a conditional plea of guilty to charges of cocaine distribution and unlawful possession of a firearm while in possession of cocaine. The guilty pleas were conditioned upon the preservation of Evans' right to appeal the trial court's adverse ruling on his motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In a per curiam order, a judge of the Court of Appeals denied Evans' petition for appeal, stating that \"on this record, we cannot say the trial court's factual finding that appellant voluntarily consented to the search was plainly wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    Evans v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   Record No. 1965-13-1, slip op. at 4 (Apr. 24, 2014) (unpublished). Upon further review, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals agreed that the petition for appeal should be denied.\n   <em>\n    Evans v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   Record No. 1965-13-1, slip op. at 1 (July 22, 2014) (unpublished).

Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123312\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/215/263/#p267\">\n    215 Va. 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 267,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=208%20S.E.2d%20746\">\n    208 S.E.2d 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 749 (1974) (finding connection between the illegality and consensual confession \"so attenuated ... as to dissipate the taint\"). In this case, there was no predicate illegality. Probable cause and exigent circumstances authorized the warrantless entry by the officers into the apartment-thus undermining the essential first premise of Evans' challenge to the validity of the later consensual search.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   No fixed legal definition fully captures the meaning of exigent circumstances. Police officers find themselves in a myriad of situations with varied fact patterns. No court could provide an exhaustive enumeration of factors that would distinguish circumstances that qualify as exigent from those that would not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The best that we can do is to consider a few commonalities and then make a practical, commonsense judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   One rather obvious commonality is that someone with illegal drugs would prefer not to be caught with them. That desire is at its apogee when the police are right on the verge of doing just that. Scores of cases have observed that one possessing illegal drugs in an apartment or home would quite likely try to get rid of them upon\n   realizing that the police are at the front door inquiring about the distinct odor of the drugs coming from inside.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has twice addressed this exact scenario. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Grissett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1789370\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/925/776/\">\n    925 F.2d 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir.1991), uniformed police officers knocked on a door of a motel room and identified themselves as police. When the door opened, they \"smelled the odor of marijuana wafting through the open doorway\" of the motel room.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1789370\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/925/776/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1789370\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/925/776/\">\n    at 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because it was obvious that everyone in the room now knew the police were aware of the marijuana, it was equally obvious to the officers that the moment they closed the door, those in the room would do whatever they could to get rid of any illegal drugs they possessed. The officers then entered the motel room and discovered marijuana and cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In response to the assertion that exigent circumstances did not justify the warrantless entry, the Fourth Circuit flatly disagreed. \"Exigent circumstances can arise when the evidence might be destroyed before a search warrant could be obtained.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1789370\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/925/776/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because the \"police had identified themselves\" to the occupants of the room, \"an officer could reasonably conclude that the occupants of the room would attempt to dispose of the evidence before the police could return with a warrant. This is especially true in the case of an easily disposable substance like drugs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1789370\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/925/776/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After all,\n   <em>\n    Grissett\n   </em>\n   emphasized, police officers need not \"produce concrete proof that the occupants of the room were on the verge of destroying evidence; rather, the proper inquiry focuses on what an objective officer could reasonably believe.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1789370\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/925/776/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Fourth Circuit reiterated the\n   <em>\n    Grissett\n   </em>\n   holding in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cephas,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11089512\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/254/488/#p496\">\n    254 F.3d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 496 (4th Cir.2001). In that case, an officer knocked on the door of an apartment. When it opened, the officer smelled a strong odor of marijuana coming from the\n   apartment. The person opening the door tried to slam it shut when the officer asked to come inside and speak with him. The officer forced his way in and discovered (as in our case) marijuana, cocaine, and firearms.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11089512\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/254/488/#p496\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11089512\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/254/488/#p496\">\n    at 490-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Cephas\n   </em>\n   identified the dispositive facts: The occupant was \"aware that a police officer was on his doorstep,\" and \"marijuana is readily destructible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11089512\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/254/488/#p496\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11089512\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/254/488/#p496\">\n    at 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Reversing the district\n   court, the Fourth Circuit held as a matter of law that the police officer could have \"reasonably believed that the marijuana would have been destroyed had he waited for a warrant. These reasons\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   would have justified his warrantless entry.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11089512\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/254/488/#p496\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In this case, two facts establish exigent circumstances prior to the officers' entry into the apartment: first, the cloud of heavy and extremely strong marijuana odors, some of which blew through the open doorway \"like a gust of wind,\" and, second, the contemporaneous knowledge of Evans' mother that the investigating officers at her doorway smelled the marijuana, which would naturally give her a potent incentive to destroy, discard, or hide the illegal drug (or ask others to do so) soon after she closed the door. By themselves, these facts establish exigent circumstances based upon\n   <em>\n    Grissett, Cephas\n   </em>\n   , and a host of analogous cases.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Those facts, while sufficient in themselves, are not the only facts in this case demonstrating exigent circumstances prior to the officers' entry into the apartment. After one of the officers explained to Evans' mother that they smelled marijuana coming from the apartment window (even as the odor continued to pour through the doorway), she slammed the door in his face. She was noticeably shaking and nervous as she did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   If the officers had made up the assertion without any basis simply to provoke her, slamming the door would have been an understandable nonverbal rebuke. But given that everyone at the doorway, including Evans' mother, could simultaneously smell the odiferous cloud of marijuana, her statement, \"Ain't nobody smoking weed in here,\" was little more than an unintentional apophasis worthy of the Bard's retort: \"The Lady doth protest too much, methinks.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Her inept remark, followed by slamming the door, implied that Evans' mother knew the police officers were aware that marijuana was present in the apartment, and she needed a little time and privacy to do something about the problem.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Urrego De Soto,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10528087\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/885/354/#p368\">\n    885 F.2d 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 368 (7th Cir.1989) (finding exigent circumstances and holding that the threat of destruction of evidence justified a warrantless entry of an apartment when the occupant responded to an officer's knock and identification by \"attempt[ing] to slam the door in [the officer's] face\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Equally telling is the fact that Evans' nervous and shaking mother waited about five minutes before opening the door following the third knock. During that time frame, one of the officers heard movement, though he did not know who was moving about or what was being moved. Evans' mother had promptly answered the door twice before; why would she not do so on the third occasion? Perhaps Evans' mother was simply tired of talking to the police. But the more realistic hypothesis is that she was informing her son (who she later said had been smoking a marijuana blunt at the time) of the presence of the police at the front door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The conspicuously delayed response of Evans' mother, coupled with unspecific sounds of movement, contributes to the totality of facts demonstrating exigent circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Aguirre,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859438\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/606/#p612\">\n    664 F.3d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 612 (5th Cir.2011) (finding that the lack\n   of response when the officers knocked and announced themselves followed by noises inside the home contributed to the totality of\n   exigent circumstances);\n   <em>\n    Cherry v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"433005\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/44/347/#p368\">\n    44 Va.App. 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 368,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"433005\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/44/347/#p368\">\n    605 S.E.2d 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 307 (2004) (holding that unidentified \" significant movement\" heard inside the house was an additional fact contributing to the totality of exigent circumstances).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Contesting this conclusion, Evans argues that a factually anemic \"mere supposition\" of exigent circumstances should be disregarded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Br. at 13. We agree. But that does not mean that irrefutable proof, or anything even close to that, is required. A far lower standard applies.

Persons in possession of valuable drugs are unlikely to destroy them unless they fear discovery by the police.

The facts are not in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   On May 22, 2013, while on uniformed bike patrol in Norfolk's Denby Park neighborhood, Officers Hathaway, Giraudo, and O'Rourke noticed a strong marijuana odor apparently coming from an open window on the second floor of an apartment building. The officers decided to investigate. They tried to open the front door of the building, expecting it to open into a common interior hallway with two upstairs and two downstairs apartments. The door was locked, however, so Officer O'Rourke knocked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Alice Evans, the defendant's mother, answered the door. The officers explained that they were investigating the marijuana odor that appeared to be coming from the building. The officers also asked about the building's layout. Ms. Evans explained that, unlike\n   the other apartment buildings in the complex, the building contained only a single, two-story apartment. Then, she closed the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Officer Giraudo walked around to the rear of the apartment, under the open window, where he observed the odor of marijuana again. After Officer Giraudo circled back to the front of the apartment, Officer O'Rourke knocked a second time. Ms. Evans opened the door, and Officer O'Rourke told her that the officers could smell marijuana coming from the apartment. Ms. Evans stated: \"Ain't nobody smoking weed in here.\" Then, she quickly closed the door. As she closed the door, Officer Hathaway smelled the odor of marijuana coming from the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Officer Giraudo knocked next. Ms. Evans was slow to respond-about five minutes passed before she opened the door. During this time, the officers heard \"normal movement\" inside the apartment. When she opened the door and saw the officers, she immediately tried to close the door a third time. Officer Hathaway put his hand on the door and placed his foot inside the apartment to prevent her from closing the door. As he did, he told Ms. Evans that \"she couldn't close the door on [the officers].\" Officer Giraudo told Ms. Evans that he was \"coming in to continue [the] investigation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   At this time, Officer Giraudo and Officer O'Rourke were standing in front of Officer Hathaway as he propped the door open with his hand and foot. As Officer Giraudo entered the apartment, he saw a person running up the stairs to the second floor and he gave pursuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   On the second floor, Officer Giraudo encountered the defendant, Tevin Gary Evans (\"Evans\")-who was not the person he had pursued-coming out of a bedroom. He drew his gun and directed Evans to show his hands, turn away, and walk backwards towards him. Officer Hathaway then handcuffed Evans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Additional officers arrived. These officers detained the Evanses and other individuals from the apartment downstairs while Officers Hathaway, Giraudo, and O'Rourke performed a protective sweep. While checking underneath a bed for additional persons, Officer Hathaway observed what appeared to be marijuana residue on the floor. In the other bedroom, Officer Hathaway observed a still-smoking marijuana blunt on the floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   After the officers completed the sweep, Officer Giraudo took Ms. Evans outside and asked her if there was any marijuana in the apartment. Ms. Evans conceded that there was and offered to retrieve it. Then Officer Giraudo asked her if there were other illegal narcotics in the apartment. Ms. Evans stated that there were not. Around this time, Officer Hathaway contacted the narcotics division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Investigator Goins responded to the call. When Goins arrived, Evans was in handcuffs,\n   and there were four or five officers inside the apartment. First, Goins approached Ms. Evans and explained that \"based on the circumstances,\" including the marijuana odor, there may be probable cause to obtain a search warrant. Goins then asked for permission to search the apartment, and Ms. Evans verbally gave her consent. Next, Goins approached Evans, who was still handcuffed, and explained the \"situation\" to him. When Goins asked for permission to search the apartment, Evans verbally gave his consent. Goins produced a consent form that Evans and his mother signed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   After obtaining their signatures, Goins searched the apartment. During the search, he recovered several grams of crack cocaine, morphine pills, packaging material, three loaded firearms, ammunition, and $1,202 in currency. Goins also recovered a receipt, a summons, and mail linking the items to Evans. After the search was complete, officers placed Evans under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   II.

During the sweep, the officers detained Ms. Evans, and immediately after the sweep, Officer Giraudo began questioning Ms. Evans about the presence of marijuana and other drugs in the apartment. Clearly, Ms. Evans was as much the subject of an investigation as her son. Investigator Goins confirmed as much, as he testified that both were actively under investigation when he arrived. Even though the consent form stated that the Evanses were free to withhold their consent, the circumstances plainly indicated otherwise. Officers Hathaway, Giraudo, and O'Rourke had already overrun Ms. Evans' previous attempts to withhold her consent at the threshold to her residence. Officer Giraudo had previously told her that she had no choice and that the officers were \"coming in to continue [the] investigation\" even though she had refused to speak with them. Now, under investigation, with numerous police officers in her home, Investigator Goins offered her a choice between a consensual search and a search pursuant to a warrant.

The potential presence of narcotics was the\n   <em>\n    sine qua non\n   </em>\n   of the officers' investigation. The unlawful, warrantless entry, during which officers observed a smoldering marijuana cigarette and marijuana residue, further encouraged the officers to seek either a warrant or the Evanses' consent to pursue a more intensive search.
