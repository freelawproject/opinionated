Denny appeals from an equitable distribution order in which the trial court assigned a 60/40 distribution of the marital estate in plaintiff Katherine Denny's favor. On appeal, defendant primarily argues that the trial court's findings of fact regarding the distributional factors set forth in N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 5020(c) (2013) were insufficient to support an unequal division of the marital property in plaintiff's favor. The trial court made specific written findings regarding the distributional factors for which evidence was presented, some of which favored defendant and some of which favored plaintiff. The trial court, however, failed to make any findings regarding how it weighed the factors or how the factors supported a 60/40 distribution in favor of plaintiff. Consequently, it is unclear from the findings whether the trial court adequately considered the factors in light of the strong policy in favor of an equal division of assets. We, therefore, reverse and remand for further findings of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff and defendant were married in 1994 and separated in 2012. The parties had two children during their marriage: a daughter born 13 February 2002, and a second daughter born 17 January 2005. On 21 February 2012, plaintiff filed a complaint for equitable distribution, child custody and support, and attorneys' fees. On 21 March 2012, defendant filed his answer and counterclaims including a claim for equitable distribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On 21 May 2012, plaintiff filed a verified reply to the counterclaims, a Motion for Interim Distribution, and a Motion for an Injunction, an Accounting, and an Order Preserving Property Pending Equitable Distribution. On 25 June 2012, the parties entered into an Interim Distribution Consent Order whereby the parties distributed certain marital property, including vehicles and household furnishings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After the parties separated, defendant continued to live in the marital residence while plaintiff and the minor children lived with plaintiff's parents. On 12 February 2013, plaintiff filed a Motion to Sell Real Property. On 19 February 2013, the trial court entered an order preserving marital property and on 19 April 2013, the trial court entered an order to sell real property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 9 September 2013, plaintiff filed a motion for contempt, alleging that defendant failed to comply with the 19 April 2013 order, in that he failed to maintain the property in a marketable condition, refused to use his best efforts and good faith to promptly sell the property, and refused to cooperate with the realtor. The motion alleged that as a result of defendant's behavior, the parties' realtor was terminating its listing agreement with the parties, effective 18 September 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   An equitable distribution trial was held on 18 and 19 September 2013. As part of a pretrial order for the hearing, the parties reached an agreement as to the value, classification, and distribution of most, but not all, of their marital property. The trial court entered an order on 19 December 2013, in which it determined that a 60/40 distribution of the marital estate in favor of plaintiff was equitable. The trial court also found defendant in contempt of the 19 April 2013 order. As a result of the contempt finding, the trial court granted plaintiff exclusive authority to work with a realtor to sell the marital residence and reserved the issue of attorneys' fees for a later hearing. Defendant timely appealed the order to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We first note that the order reserved the issue of attorneys' fees for a later hearing, and it is unclear whether this issue is still pending. Although defendant asserts in his brief that the trial court granted plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees, we have found nothing in the record that supports this assertion. Regardless whether the attorneys' fee issue remains pending, this appeal is properly before this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.

Subsequently, defendant married plaintiff, and they lived in the residence for three years while defendant was in law school. When defendant sold the residence, he paid $11,000.00 to his father and used the remaining $59,000.00 as a down payment on the first home purchased jointly by defendant and plaintiff as tenants by the entireties. Those funds were rolled over into subsequent homes, including the marital residence at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because defendant acquired the Oklahoma residence prior to his marriage to plaintiff, the residence and defendant's portion of the proceeds from the sale of the residence were defendant's separate property. Defendant then used this separate property as a down payment on the first home purchased jointly by defendant and plaintiff, which they owned as tenants by the entirety. Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Dewey,\n   </em>\n   the conveyance of property titled by the entireties indicates defendant's intent to convert the funds into marital property, and defendant has failed to point to any evidence that he intended his contribution to remain separate property. Therefore, we hold that the trial court properly classified the marital residence as marital property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant argues, alternatively, that the trial court erred by finding, in finding of fact 50(d), that the money that defendant's father contributed to the purchase of the Oklahoma residence is not a marital debt. \"Regardless of who is legally obligated for the debt, for the purpose of an equitable distribution, a marital debt is defined as a debt incurred during the marriage for the joint benefit of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Geer v.

Further, there is no evidence that regular payments were ever made to defendant's father aside from the initial $11,000.00 given to him from the sale proceeds, and a promissory note was never signed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \" 'The credibility of the evidence in an equitable distribution trial is for the trial court.' ...

Specifically, defendant argues that the trial court failed to make findings regarding his contribution of separate funds to the marital estate, the parties' incomes, defendant's mental health, and plaintiff's purported dissipation of divisible property. We address each of defendant's arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant first argues that the trial court should have considered his contribution of separate funds to the marital estate as a factor in his favor in distribution. We agree. \"[S]eparate property which is either given to the marital estate or 'which\n   <em>\n    trans mutes\n   </em>\n   [sic]\n   <em>\n    by implied gift\n   </em>\n   into marital property' ..., is a division factor which may justify an unequal division of the marital property.\"\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

Finding of fact 50(d) states that \"[defendant's] father did contribute money to the purchase of the parties' home in Oklahoma and the Court finds that it is not a marital debt[.]\" It appears that the trial court considered defendant's father's contribution as a gift to both plaintiff and defendant and did not consider the Oklahoma residence to be defendant's separate property. However, defendant testified that the deed was in his name and his father's name. Therefore, when the house sold for $70,000.00, defendant and his father were entitled to $35,000.00 each. Instead, defendant's father received $11,000.00 and defendant used the remaining $59,000.00 to buy a house for plaintiff and defendant. The trial court could find that defendant contributed $35,000.00 of his separate property to the marital residence and that defendant's dad gave a marital gift of $24,000.00. The $35,000.00 could have been considered by the trial court as a distributional factor in defendant's favor. The trial court's failure to make a finding of fact regarding this factor was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant next contends that the trial court erred in calculating the parties' income. He asserts that the trial court's calculation of plaintiff's salary, which included her base salary of $86,000.00 plus $10,000.00 in bonuses received in 2013 as of the September hearing, only accounts for a partial year salary for plaintiff. Meanwhile, defendant asserts, the trial court attributed an entire year's salary to defendant-his base salary of $84,000.00 per year-even though defendant had been unemployed during part of 2013. Additionally, defendant argues that the trial court did not consider that plaintiff's counsel had filed a North Carolina State Bar grievance against defendant in April 2013, which affected his ability to find employment and diminished his chances of a higher salary in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The relevant time frame for calculating the parties' income as a distributional factor under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50-20(c) is the time of distribution.\n   <em>\n    Godley v.

At the time of trial, defendant was employed and earning a salary of $84,000.00. Therefore, it was not error for the trial court to fail to consider his brief period of unemployment earlier that year. Defendant's arguments regarding plaintiff's unearned bonuses and the State Bar grievance against defendant affect their future earning capacities.

The trial court addressed this factor by finding that both plaintiff and defendant are in \"good health.\" This finding is supported by defendant's own testimony at the equitable distribution hearing that both his physical and mental health is \"fine.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant, nevertheless, asserts that the trial court's finding that he is in \"good health\" is contrary to the trial court's position in the custody proceedings, where the trial court has denied defendant temporary custody or visitation of his children due to his mental health issues. Again, we disagree. The purpose of each proceeding is distinct, and therefore, the inquiry regarding defendant's health in an equitable distribution proceeding serves a different purpose than defendant's health in a custody proceeding. In the custody proceeding, defendant's mental health was only relevant to the determination whether he was a fit parent and whether it was in his children's best interests that he be granted visitation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50-13.5(i) (2013) (\"In any case in which an award of child custody is made in a district court, the trial judge, prior to denying a parent the right of reasonable visitation, shall make a written finding of fact that the parent being denied visitation rights is an unfit person to visit the child or that such visitation rights are not in the best interest of the child.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On the other hand, in an equitable distribution proceeding, the parties' health is relevant to the extent it affects the equitable distribution of assets. For example, if a party's health affects his or her ability to earn a living or increases his or her living expenses, that may be a factor that supports an unequal division of assets in his or her favor.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Albritton v.

Defendant has not pointed to any evidence in the record that he is in poor health or that the mental health issues that the trial court found in the child custody proceeding affect his ability to earn a living or considerably increase his living expenses. Accordingly, we do not find persuasive defendant's argument that the trial court failed to adequately consider defendant's mental health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant also asserts that the trial court failed to consider that plaintiff took out $46,156.00 in loans on her 401(k), thereby devaluing the 401(k) by that amount, in violation of the order preserving marital property. Defendant correctly asserts that dissipating marital or divisible assets is a distributional factor that may be considered pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50-20(c)(11a). However, the record does not support defendant's contention that plaintiff's post-separation loans devalued her 401(k).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The trial court found that the value of the 401(k) on the date of separation and the date of distribution remained the same: $141,949.00. This finding is based upon the parties' stipulations contained in the Final Equitable Distribution Pretrial Order. It is well established that, \"[s]tipulations are judicial admissions and are binding upon the parties absent well-established exceptions[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Comstock v.

Here, defendant has not made any argument that the pretrial order should be set aside based upon any of these exceptions. Therefore, defendant is bound by the stipulation that establishes that plaintiff's post-separation loans did not devalue plaintiff's 401(k).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In sum, we hold that the trial court made specific findings of fact regarding all the distributional factors on which evidence was offered with the exception of whether defendant contributed his separate funds to the marital estate. On remand, the trial court must make findings of fact on this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We now turn to defendant's argument that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding a 60/40 distribution in favor of plaintiff when many of the factors upon which it made specific findings weighed in defendant's favor.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50-20 ] is a legislative enactment of public policy so strongly favoring the equal division of marital property that an equal division is made\n   <em>\n    mandatory\n   </em>\n   \"unless the court determines that an equal division is not equitable.\" N.C.G.S. 50-20(c). The clear intent of the legislature was that a party desiring an unequal division of marital property bear the burden of producing evidence concerning one or more of the twelve factors in the statute and the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that an equal division would not be equitable. Therefore, if no evidence is admitted tending to show that an equal division would be inequitable, the trial court\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   divide the marital property equally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   When evidence tending to show that an equal division of marital property would not be equitable is admitted, however, the trial court must exercise its discretion in assigning the weight each factor should receive in any given case. It must then make an equitable division of the marital property by balancing the evidence presented by the parties in light of the legislative policy which favors equal division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    White v.

Thus, \"in order to divide a marital estate other than equally, the trial court must first find that an equal division is not equitable and explain why.

Nor do the findings, as written, make it clear how the trial court determined that a 60/40 division of property is equitable. The findings indicate that defendant has reduced the principle amount owed on the marital residence by $10,800.00, he has paid other costs associated with the marital residence (although the trial court does not quantify these costs), and his income is $12,000.00 less than plaintiff's. These are factors that weigh in defendant's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   On the other hand, the trial court found that plaintiff continued to pay the children's tuition and contribute to their 529 plans and that defendant failed \"at times\" to make mortgage payments, which \"has had an impact on [plaintiff's] credit.\" The trial court does not quantify how much tuition plaintiff has paid or how exactly her credit has been impacted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Given the strong policy in favor of an equal division and the presence of competing distributive factors that the trial court failed to quantify, we cannot determine from the order whether the trial court adequately considered all of the factors.
