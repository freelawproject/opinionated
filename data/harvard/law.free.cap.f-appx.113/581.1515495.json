Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 199-202 (5th Cir.1997). The district court dismissed Ramsey\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint pursuant to <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and denied permission to proceed IFP on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-32\">Ramsey has failed to address the district court\u2019s reason for dismissal, and he has effectively waived the only issue rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>vant to his entitlement to IFP status on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Even if he had briefed this issue, any appeal would be frivolous. Ramsey may not challenge his conviction and sentence in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint unless his underlying criminal conviction has been found invalid. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87. Ramsey has not shown that his conviction has been reversed, expunged, declared invalid, or otherwise called into question. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">This appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 and n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. For purposes of the \u201cthree-strikes\u201d provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), Ramsey had two strikes prior to this proceeding. <em>See Ramsey v. Cleveland Police Department, </em>No. 2:00-CV-237-B-B (N.D.Miss. Dec. 20, 2000); <em>Ramsey v. Cleveland Police Department, </em>31 Fed.Appx. 155 (5th Cir.2001) (imposing two strikes). The district court\u2019s dismissal of Ramsey\u2019s complaint counts as an additional strike, and the dismissal of his appeal as frivolous counts as a fourth strike. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, Ramsey may not proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action' or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b603-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
