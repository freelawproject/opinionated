As an initial matter, Estrada argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Estrada concedes that this issue is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>to preserve it for further review. This court must follow the precedent in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Estrada\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">Estrada argues that the district court incorrectly used his prior Illinois conviction for aggravated battery of a child to increase his base offense level by 16 levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. Because Estrada raises this argument for the first time on appeal, the district court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is reviewed for \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>See United States v. Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d 308, 313 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc)(citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Estrada argues that aggravated battery of a child, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-4.3 (1995), is not a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. Pertinent commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 provides that \u201ccrime of violence\u201d includes any offense under state law \u201cthat has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">Illinois\u2019s aggravated battery of a child statute does not require any bodily contact; it requires instead that the defendant intentionally or knowingly \u201ccause[] great bodily harm or permanent disability or disfigurement.\u201d <em>See </em>720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-4.3. The statute provides that the harm may be effected \u201cby any means.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because aggravated battery of a child in Illinois can, but need not, involve the application of physical force to the child\u2019s person, it is not a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Calderon-Pena, </em>383 F.3d 254, 259-60 (5th Cir.2004)(en banc). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s 16-level enhancement of Estrada\u2019s offense level was clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">Moreover, the district court\u2019s error affected Estrada\u2019s substantial rights inasmuch as the error resulted in a higher sentence than Estrada would have otherwise received. <em>See United States v. Williamson, </em>183 F.3d 458, 464 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">Because the increase in the sentence that Estrada received as a result of the district court\u2019s erroneous application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 was dramatic, this court will exercise its discretion to correct the error. <em>See Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d at 313. Accordingly, Estrada\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED to the district court for resentencing without the enhancement provided for by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-10\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED and REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b23-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
