(collectively \u201cpetitioners\u201d), seek review of the final order of the Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d or \u201cBoard\u201d) that affirmed the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) calculation of Melancon\u2019s average weekly wage at $577.45 and awarded total disability compensation of $384.97 per week based on that average weekly wage calculation. We have carefully reviewed the record, paying particular attention to the opinion of the ALJ and the BRB, and have duly considered the factual analyses and legal arguments advanced by counsel for petitioners and respondents as set forth in their respective briefs to this court. When reviewed in the deferential framework that is applicable, viz., upholding the factual findings and legal conclusions of the ALJ if they are grounded in substantial evidence (more than a modicum and not necessarily a preponderance), and are rational and in accordance with law, we are convinced that review should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-20\">As the Board noted, the parties agree that the ALJ employed the appropriate subsection of the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 910(c), to determine Melancon\u2019s average weekly wage. Petitioners\u2019 dissatisfaction is not with the standard applied but with the particular historical earnings figures and sectors of the economy that the ALJ chose to use in his calculation. When viewed in the perspective of the policy of the LHWCA and the plethora of discrete facts in evidence here, we agree with the BRB\u2019s characterization of the ALJ\u2019s handling of this case. We cannot credit respondents\u2019 charge of bias; there is more than substantial evidence to support the facts found and law applied by the ALJ; in the context of \u00a7 910(c), the weekly wage calculations are reasonable\u2014not unreasonable\u2014estimates of Melancon\u2019s earning capacity when he was injured; and, candidly, petitioners\u2019 contention that this piledriver operator cum auto mechanic should have his annual earning capacity calculated solely on the basis of his own, subjective profit during a two-season entrepreneurial deviation into crawfish farming, with all of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>variables, vicissitudes, and vagaries, borders on the ludicrous.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In sum, we conclude that the determination of the ALJ, and the affirmance thereof by the BRB in its final order, are supported by substantial evidence and are rational and reasonable dispositions of the matter. The petition for review of the final order of the Board is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b668-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
