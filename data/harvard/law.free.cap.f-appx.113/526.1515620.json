Lynn-haven Inlet Fishing Pier Corporation and C.D.C. Enterprises, Inc., t/a Lynnhaven Inlet Fishing Pier Tackle Shop (collectively \u201cLynnhaven\u201d), and their restaurant-operating tenant, Kyrus Enterprises, Inc., d/b/a Lynnhaven Fish House (\u201cKyrus\u201d), appeal the court\u2019s award of summary judgment in favor of Scottsdale Insurance Company (\u201cScottsdale\u201d) and Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London (\u201cLloyd\u2019s\u201d). Scottsdale initiated this declaratory judgment action in the Eastern District of Virginia against Lynnhaven and Kyrus, asserting that an insurance policy it had issued to Lynnhaven did not provide coverage for damages suffered by the restaurant (the \u201cFish House\u201d). In turn, Lynnhaven and Kyrus counterclaimed against Scottsdale and filed their own third-party complaint against Lloyd\u2019s, seeking declarations that insurance policies issued by Scottsdale and Lloyd\u2019s provided coverage for damages suffered at the Fish House.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>On cross-motions for summary judgment, the magistrate judge, acting for the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c), ruled that the damages were not covered by the insurance policies. The court accordingly awarded summary judgment to Scottsdale and Lloyd\u2019s. <em>Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Lynnhaven Inlet Fishing Pier Corp., </em>No. 2:02cv238 (E.D. Va. Oct 31, 2003) (the \u201cOpinion\u201d). Lynnhaven and Kyrus have appealed and, as explained below, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Lynnhaven owns and operates a fishing pier in Virginia Beach, Virginia, upon which certain enclosed structures, including the Fish House, have been erected.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Fish House restaurant was built on the deck of the pier, above ground. Access to the Fish House, which is leased and operated by Kyrus, is available from beneath the pier. Prior to this dispute, Lynnhaven, in an effort to protect the Fish House\u2019s plumbing from freezing, insulated and covered the underside of the restaurant with plywood. The area below the restaurant\u2019s floor, consisting of this insulation, plywood, and floor joists, constitutes the Fish House\u2019s \u201csubfloor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">During the relevant period, Lynnhaven maintained coverage through an insurance policy issued by Scottsdale in Virginia, specifically Policy No. CPS328957, effective from November 1999 through November 2000 (the \u201cScottsdale Policy\u201d). Kyrus maintained coverage through an insurance policy issued by Lloyd\u2019s in Virginia, specifically Policy No. ROC0443, effective from July 2000 through July 2001 (the \u201cLloyd\u2019s Policy\u201d). The relevant terms of these policies are identical. They are both so-called \u201call risks\u201d policies, covering all risks of direct physical loss unless specifically excluded or limited by the policy terms. Among the excluded causes of loss set forth in Section B(2) of the \u201cCauses of Loss\u2014Special Form\u201d of each policy are: \u201cCollapse, except as provided below in the Additional Coverage for Collapse [Section D].... \u201d The parties agree that the damage to the subfloor of the Fish House would ordinarily be excluded from coverage under this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">Lynnhaven and Kyrus maintain, however, that they are entitled to coverage under Section D, which provides, in pertinent part: \u201c[The insurer] will pay for direct physical loss or damage to Covered Property, <em>caused by the collapse of a building or any part of a building insured under this Coverage Form, </em>if the collapse is caused by one or more of the following:\u201d listing among other causes, \u201chidden decay\u201d or the \u201cweight of people or personal property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Significantly, neither the Scottsdale Policy nor the Lloyd\u2019s Policy defines what it means by the term \u201ccollapse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">In August 2000, Lynnhaven retained a structural engineering firm to inspect the subfloor of the Fish House. As a result, that firm prepared a report, entitled Pier and Pier Deck Structural Evaluation (the \u201cReport\u201d), which concluded that the sub-floor was unsound in certain respects. The Report found that damage to the sub-floor had resulted from four causes: (1) condensation from refrigeration units and piping; (2) plumbing leaks from discon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>nected drainpipes; (3) seepage through the floor from the food preparation area; and (4) moisture trapped by the insulation. The Report also found that some locations of the subfloor were \u201ccompletely deteriorated,\u201d and that \u201cthe floor beams are saturated and the wood soft.\u201d In October 2000, on the basis of this Report, Lynnhaven filed a claim with its insurer, Scottsdale, seeking coverage for the subfloor damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">According to the kitchen manager at the Fish House, who is also the restaurant\u2019s chef, the floor became spongy and unstable during the first two weeks of November 2000, and several of the floor tiles cracked and popped off. He testified that, during that time period, \u201cthe subfloor was like a sand base that was wet and the wood beneath it was rotting.\u201d Viewed from below, the subfloor was visibly crumbling and falling apart. As a result, Lynnhaven retained a contractor who temporarily repaired the subfloor in November 2000. Lynnhaven notified Scottsdale that same month that the subfloor of the Fish House had collapsed and that Lynnhaven was proceeding with its claim under Section D of the \u201cCauses of Loss\u2014Special Form\u201d of the Scottsdale Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In March 2001, an engineer engaged by Scottsdale prepared a report on the sub-floor problem, concluding that the subfloor had decayed \u201cto the point that it could be penetrated with a screw driver.\u201d In August 2001, a wheel on a piece of the Fish House\u2019s restaurant equipment, a cooler, sank into the floor, penetrating the sub-floor and requiring additional temporary repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">In late August 2001, Kyrus gave notice to its insurer, Lloyd\u2019s, of its claim under the Lloyd\u2019s Policy for the damages sustained by the Fish House\u2019s subfloor in mid-November 2000. The Fish House was closed for a short time following Kyrus\u2019s notice, and the problem areas of the sub-floor were finally repaired on a more permanent basis in September 2001. In October 2001, an adjuster for Lloyd\u2019s reported to that insurer\u2019s London office that he had found that \u201ca portion of the building had collapsed, which is contrary to what we had previously thought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">In the summary judgment proceedings, Lynnhaven and Kyrus presented two experts who concluded that the subfloor had \u201ccollapsed.\u201d One of those experts, a structural engineer who had prepared the Report, stated by affidavit that, as his expert litigation report spelled out, the Fish House subfloor had in fact collapsed, in that the subfloor had broken down, fallen apart in a disorganized fashion, or disintegrated. In addition, an insurance claims expert opined by affidavit that the restaurant\u2019s \u201csubfloor had collapsed.\u201d Lynnhaven and Kyrus also proffered nearly 100 photographs to show the damage sustained by the subfloor.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">At the close of discovery in 2002, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In ruling in favor of Scottsdale and Lloyd\u2019s, the district court concluded that summary judgment was appropriate because, applying Virginia law, there was \u201cno evidence that the subfloor broke down completely, fell apart in confused disorganization, or disintegrated.\u201d Opinion at 17. According to the court, Lynnhaven and Kyrus failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate that a \u201ccollapse\u201d had occurred. Opinion at 19. Lynnhaven and Kyrus have appealed, and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s award of summary judgment, viewing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>facts and inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Seabulk Offshore, Ltd. v. Am. Home Assurance Co., </em>377 F.3d 408, 418 (4th Cir.2004). An award of summary judgment is appropriate only \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). A genuine issue of material fact is one \u201cthat might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law....\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A dispute presents a genuine issue of material fact \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Lynnhaven and Kyrus contend that the district court erred in awarding summary judgment to Scottsdale and Lloyd\u2019s because there is, under the evidence in the summary judgment record, a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a \u201ccollapse\u201d of the subfloor occurred. Scottsdale and Lloyd\u2019s, by contrast, maintain that the evidence presented by Lynnhaven and Kyrus does not establish any such \u201ccollapse\u201d and that summary judgment was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Significantly, the Supreme Court of Virginia has recently interpreted policy language identical to that found in the Scottsdale and Lloyd\u2019s policies in addressing an insurance coverage dispute where \u201ccollapse\u201d was an undefined policy term.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Lower Chesapeake Assocs. v. Valley Forge Ins. Co., </em>260 Va. 77, 532 S.E.2d 325, 330 (Va.2000). In <em>Lower Chesapeake, </em>the court accorded the term \u201ccollapse\u201d one of its ordinary and accepted meanings, that is: \u201c \u2018to break down completely: fall apart in confused disorganization: ... disintegrate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>443 (1993)), <em>cited with approval in Transcont\u2019l Ins. Co. v. RBMW, Inc., </em>262 Va. 502, 551 S.E.2d 313, 317 (Va.2001). Scottsdale and Lloyd\u2019s rely on this definition of \u201ccollapse\u201d to support their contention that Lynnhaven and Kyrus failed to produce sufficient evidence to satisfy their burden in opposing summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">This contention, however, overlooks a key and distinguishing aspect of the <em>Lower Chesapeake </em>decision. In that dispute, the Supreme Court of Virginia was able to rely on the trial court\u2019s <em>factual </em>findings, made by the lower court <em>after </em>a bench trial. 532 S.E.2d at 330-31 (\u201cThe [trial] court\u2019s factual finding ... is central to the resolution of this appeal.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And, according to the Supreme Court of Virginia, whether a \u201ccollapse\u201d has occurred, in the context of such a coverage issue, is a question of fact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The district court, in ruling on summary judgment, appropriately did not make a finding on whether a \u201ccollapse\u201d <em>of </em>the Fish House subfloor had occurred; however, the court decided that Lynnhaven and Kyrus had failed to produce sufficient evidence of a \u201ccollapse.\u201d We are unable to agree with that assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Lynnhaven and Kyrus, in opposing summary judgment, forecast the presentation of evidence by two expert witnesses, a structural engineer and an insurance claims expert, to the effect that the Fish House subfloor had indeed \u201ccollapsed,\u201d as that term was applied in the <em>Lower Chesapeake </em>decision. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 704(a) (providing that opinion testimony on ultimate issue of fact is not objectionable on that basis); <em>TFWS, Inc. v. Shaefer, </em>325 F.3d 234, 241-42 (4th Cir.2003) (vacating summary judgment award because non-moving party proffered expert reports demonstrating genuine issue of material fact); <em>see also Ashley Furniture Indus., Inc. v. Sangiacomo N.A., Ltd., </em>187 F.3d 363, 377 (4th Cir.1999) (\u201c[I]n many areas, an expert\u2019s affidavit will enable the plaintiff to survive summary judgment....\u201d). As we have pointed out, <em>see supra </em>Part I.B., Lynnhaven and Kyrus also presented multiple photographs showing the disintegration of the Fish House subfloor, they proffered testimony from the restaurant\u2019s kitchen manager describing the subfloor\u2019s disintegration in detail, and they presented a letter from the Lloyd\u2019s adjuster that a \u201cportion of the building had collapsed....\u201d Scottsdale and Lloyd\u2019s did not and do not challenge the admissibility of any of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">In these circumstances, the evidence forecast by Lynnhaven and Kyrus in opposition to summary judgment supports the reasonable inference that a \u201ccollapse\u201d of the Fish House subfloor occurred in November 2000, under the terms of the Scottsdale Policy and the Lloyd\u2019s Policy. Whether such a \u201ccollapse\u201d occurred is determinative of this dispute, and the evidence, viewed in the proper light, creates a triable issue of fact. Summary judgment, therefore, should not have been awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we reverse the award of summary judgment to Scottsdale and Lloyd\u2019s and remand for such other and further proceedings as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b553-12\">DUNCAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\">. Because this appeal is from an award of summary judgment, we present the relevant facts in the light most favorable to Lynnhaven and Kyrus, as the insureds and non-moving parties. <em>See Seabulk Offshore, Ltd. v. Am. Home Assurance Co., </em>377 F.3d 408, 418 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-6\">. In this matter, as found by the magistrate judge, Virginia appears to be the place where the policy was formed, and neither party has contested the application of Virginia law. Consequently, we are obliged, as was the district court, to apply the substantive law of Virginia in our resolution of this dispute. <em>See Seabulk, </em>377 F.3d at 418-19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b552-7\">. In <em>Lower Chesapeake, </em>the Supreme Court of Virginia assessed the trial court\u2019s decision under a deferential standard of review. The lower court's verdict would \u201cnot be set aside unless it appear[ed] from the evidence that the judgment [was] plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d 532 S.E.2d at 330. Our standard of review, on the other hand, is de novo, and we view the facts and inferences fairly drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to Lynnhaven and Kyrus, as the non-moving parties. <em>Seabulk, </em>377 F.3d at 418.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b553-13\">DUNCAN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">Federal courts sitting in diversity are bound to apply the substantive law of the state in which the court sits, as that law has been applied by the state\u2019s highest court. <em>Commissioner v. Estate of Bosch, </em>387 U.S. 456, 465, 87 S.Ct. 1776, 18 L.Ed.2d 886 (1967); <em>see also Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). Accordingly, I agree with the majority that the substantive law of Virginia applies to this case. Because, however, I believe that the district court correctly applied Virginia law as it has been interpreted by the Virginia Supreme Court, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion mandating reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-15\">The Virginia Supreme Court holds that \u201ccollapse,\u201d if not defined elsewhere in an insurance contract, means \u201cto break down completely: fall apart in confused disorganization: ... disintegrate.\u201d <em>Lower Chesapeake Associates v. Valley Forge Ins. Co., </em>260 Va. 77, 532 S.E.2d 325, 330 (2000). While the majority correctly notes that <em>Lower Chesapeake </em>was not a summary judgment case, it notes a distinction without a difference. The Virginia Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Court in <em>Lower Chesapeake </em>defined \u201ccollapse\u201d as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>(holding that collapse means \u201cto break down completely: fall apart in confused disorganization: ... disintegrate,\u201d without any reference to the factual findings of the district court (alterations in original) (internal quotations omitted)). It further held that the district court applied the correct legal definition of collapse and <em>separately </em>held that the district court\u2019s factual finding that the deck at issue in that case met the definition was not clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 330-31 (\u201c[T]he [trial] court properly applied the ordinary and customary meaning of [collapse] when reaching its conclusion.\u201d) In other words, the Virginia Supreme Court did give deference to the district court\u2019s factual findings, but not in regards to the definition of collapse. That definition is a legal, not factual, definition and is therefore applicable to this summary judgment proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Using that definition of \u201ccollapse,\u201d and taking everything that the plaintiffs posit as true, there is no basis here on which a jury could find that the flooring in question fell apart in confused disorganization. The expert reports and proffered testimony upon which the majority relies to create a dispute of material fact simply state legal conclusions\u2014not factual assertions. <em>See Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 704.04[1] (2004) (\u201cIn general, testimony about a legal conclusion, or the legal implications of evidence is inadmissible under Rule 704.\u201d). No one disputes that the flooring in question was damaged and required repairs. But no actual evidence, as opposed to mere conclusory statements, demonstrates that the flooring in question came close to \u201cbreaking down completely\u201d or \u201cdisintegrating\u201d as required by Virginia insurance law.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">I would therefore affirm the well reasoned opinion of the district court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b554-5\"> As the district court succinctly notes: \u201cThe ... evidence submitted to the Court, by both parties, similarly fails to describe damage beyond the clearly established rot, decay, and deterioration. In their briefs, Lynnhaven and Kyrus equate this deterioration with 'disintegration' and 'collapse\u2019 without setting forth any additional facts beyond the undisputed decay and deterioration of the restaurant's subfloor. Likewise, Millenium\u2019s expert report opines that the subfloor 'disintegrated' and 'coilapsed,\u2019 but provides no objective support for these conclusory statements. Mere recitation of the words 'disintegration' and 'collapse' is not sufficient to bring the damage within the scope of the ordinary and accepted meaning of 'collapse.' The Court finds no evidence that the subfloor broke down completely, fell apart in confused disorganization, or disintegrated.\u201d Dist. Ct. Opinion and Order at 17 (E.D.Va.# 2:02cv238, Oct. 31, 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
