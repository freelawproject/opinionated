The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, showed that Fletcher and his cohorts intentionally defrauded the government, and that Fletcher took various steps to conceal the fraud. Fletcher has raised several challenges to his conviction and sentence. As to those issues raised before the district court, we affirm on that court\u2019s reasoning. (J.A. at 127, 2328-31.) As to the remaining issues, which were raised for the first time on appeal, we have carefully reviewed the record and find no reversible error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (holding that issues raised for the first time on appeal are reviewed for plain error). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
