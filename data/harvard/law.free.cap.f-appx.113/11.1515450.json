The Commission removed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>suit; Howeth filed a motion to remand and sought an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). The district court found that the removal was not timely filed, remanded the case to the state court, and awarded Howeth attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $19,306. Although 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) precludes this court from reviewing the remand order, this court has jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs under \u00a7 1447(c). <em>Miranti v. Lee, </em>3 F.3d 925, 926-928 (5th Circ.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">The Commission argues that the removal was timely filed because it was filed within four days of Howeth\u2019s filing of its sixth amended complaint, which was the first pleading filed asserting claims giving rise to federal question jurisdiction. Howeth responds that its initial petition and fourth amended petition placed the Commission on notice that it was asserting federal claims and, thus, the Commission should have sought removal based on those earlier pleadings. The district court agreed with Howeth\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">A review of initial petition and the fourth amended petition reflects that Howeth was seeking relief under the Texas Constitution and state statutes. At that point in the litigation, the Commission did not have an objectively reasonable basis to seek removal to federal court. <em>See Valdes v. Wal-Mart Stores, </em>199 F.3d 290, 293 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Howeth alleged a federal takings claim in his sixth amended petition. However, that claim was not ripe for federal review and could not serve as a basis for removal. <em>See Samaad v. City of Dallas, </em>940 F.2d 925, 933 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Howeth\u2019s substantive due process claims specifically alleged in the sixth amended petition supported federal jurisdiction even if the related takings claim was not ripe for federal review. <em>See Simi Investment Co. v. Harris County, Texas, </em>236 F.3d 240, 248-49 (5th Cir.2000). Because the Commission did not have an objectively reasonable ground for removal until it received notice of the sixth amended petition, the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Valdes, </em>199 F.3d at 293. The judgment making the award attorney\u2019s fees is REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b33-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
