In reviewing the Commissioner\u2019s decision, we must determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the decision and whether the proper legal standards were used in evaluating the evidence. <em>Ripley v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 552, 555 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Phillips argues that the administrative law judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) determination that Allen suffered from borderline intellectual functioning and not mild mental retardation was based upon an error of law and an ambiguous evaluation of Allen by Mark Fruge, Ph.D. She contends that the ALJ did not use Allen\u2019s lowest IQ score from Dr. Fruge\u2019s evaluation and that Allen\u2019s lowest IQ score showed that he suffered from mild mental retardation, not borderline intellectual functioning. The ALJ found that Allen\u2019s borderline intellectual functioning was a severe impairment. In determining that Allen did not meet the requirements of Listing 112.05(D), the ALJ found that Allen did not have an additional impairment that imposed a significant limitation on his functioning, implicitly using Allen\u2019s lowest IQ score and finding that Allen met the IQ requirement of the listing. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R., Part 404, Subpart P, App. 1, \u00b6 112.05(D). Accordingly, any error committed by the ALJ in finding that Allen suffered from borderline intellectual functioning and not mild mental retardation did not affect the ALJ\u2019s decision or Phillips\u2019s substantial rights and was harmless. <em>See Morris v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 333, 335 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">Phillips additionally asserts that the ALJ\u2019s determinations that Allen\u2019s psychological impairments were not severe impairments and had not lasted and were not expected to last for 12 months were erroneous. The record reveals that the ALJ\u2019s determination that Allen\u2019s psychological impairments did not impose a significant limitation on his functioning was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Martinez v. Chater, </em>64 F.3d 172, 173 (5th Cir.1995). This determination was sufficient to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Allen did not meet the requirements of Listing 112.05(D). <em>See </em>20 C.F.R., Part 404, Sub-part P, App. 1, \u00b6 112.05(D). The ALJ\u2019s determinations that Allen\u2019s psychological impairments were not severe and had not lasted and were not expected to last for 12 months did not affect his decision because he determined that Allen did have a severe impairment and completed the proper sequential analysis of Allen\u2019s impairments. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.994a(b). Accordingly, even if the ALJ erred in making those determinations, any such error did not affect Phillips\u2019s substantial rights and was harmless. <em>See Morris, </em>864 F.2d at 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b667-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
