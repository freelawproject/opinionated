In his appeal, filed pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), counsel for Parks claims that the district court erred in (1) sentencing Parks in violation of the tenets of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and (2) denying his motion for a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-23\">Because Parks failed to object to the district court\u2019s imposition of an enhanced sentence based on the indictment\u2019s failure to specify drug quantity, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). The Government concedes that the sentence was erroneous because the indictment failed to include an allegation related to drug quantity. However, we will exercise our discretion to notice plain error only where the error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (quoting <em>United States v. Atkinson, </em>297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S.Ct. 391, 80 L.Ed. 555 (1936)). In this case, Parks stipulated to the relevant drug quantities at sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>ing, so there was independent and uncontroverted evidence establishing the threshold drug quantity to support an enhanced sentence. <em>See United States v. Cotton, 535 </em>U.S. 625, 633, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (holding where the evidence of the necessary drug quantity was overwhelming and essentially uncontradicted, there was no basis to conclude the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings). Accordingly, we deny relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Parks next claims that the district court abused its discretion by failing to grant a downward departure based on the Government\u2019s failure to move for a reduction in sentence pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). Under <em>US. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K2.0 (1998), a sentencing court may depart downward for an aggravating or mitigating circumstance not adequately taken into account under the guidelines. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 5K2.0, p.s. Parks believes that the Government\u2019s failure to provide him an opportunity to cooperate constitutes a mitigating circumstance. However, our review of the record contradicts Parks\u2019 understanding. The Government\u2019s failure to reward Parks with a Rule 35(b) motion was based on its perception of his perjury and his general lack of cooperation, not on an unfounded desire of the Government to preclude his cooperation. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Parks also claims that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence for possession of a firearm and for his role in the offense. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), 3131.1(c) (1998). Neither of these claims was preserved in the district court. Accordingly, they are reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Ford, 88 F.3d </em>1350, 1355 (4th Cir.1996). Our review of the uncontradicted facts considered by the district court finds no support for either of Parks\u2019 supplemental claims. To the contrary, both of the enhancements are well supported by the presentence investigation report, as adopted by the district court. Accordingly, we deny relief on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Finding no meritorious issues upon our review of the record, we affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We deny Parks\u2019 motion to substitute counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
