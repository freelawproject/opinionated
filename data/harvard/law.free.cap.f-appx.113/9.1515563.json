In filing the IFP motion, Eaton is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">The district court failed to comply with <em>Baugh </em>since it provided neither reasons for certifying that Eaton\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith, nor incorporated its decision on the merits of Eaton\u2019s complaint. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(3). Nevertheless, this court may dismiss the case <em>sua sponte </em>pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 42.2 if it is apparent that the appeal lacks merit. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">Eaton has not addressed the district court\u2019s determination that his claims are barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Thus, any challenge to the dismissal of the complaint on that basis is abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). However, because the district court failed to provide reasons for its bad faith certification, the court will address the merits of the appeal. This court\u2019s inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-11\">Eaton\u2019s complaint challenges the validity of his probation revocation and two additional convictions, but he has not shown that the revocation or convictions have been set aside or otherwise called into question. His claims are barred by <em>Heck </em>and, thus, have no arguable merit. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>Jackson v. Vannoy, </em>49 F.3d 175, 177 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-12\">Likewise, Eaton\u2019s complaint against the county court judge has no arguable merit because it is barred by judicial immunity. <em>See Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 11, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991); <em>Malina v. Gonzales, </em>994 F.2d 1121, 1124 (5th Cir.1993). Eaton has failed to identify a non-frivolous issue for appeal, and he has not shown that the district court erred in certifying that an appeal would not be taken in good faith. Eaton\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-13\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the dismissal of the complaint as frivolous by the district court both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Eaton is cautioned that once he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-14\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\u00a7 1915(g) SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b32-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
