We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">In criminal cases, the defendant is accorded ten days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>United States v. Raynor, </em>939 F.2d 191, 197 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">The district court\u2019s Amended Judgment and Commitment Order was entered on its docket on August 9, 2000. Jensen filed his notice of appeal on July 13, 2004. Because Jensen failed to file a timely notice of appeal, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order. Accordingly, we deny Jensen\u2019s motion for transcripts at government expense and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
