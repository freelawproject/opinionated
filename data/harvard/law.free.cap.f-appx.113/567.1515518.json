R. Civ. P 60(b) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 70 as successive and for lack of jurisdiction. In <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>this court held that a district court \u201cmust treat Rule 60(b) motions as successive collateral review applications when failing to do so would allow the applicant to \u2018evade the bar against relitigation of claims presented in a prior application or the bar against litigation of claims not presented in a prior application.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 206 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Calderon v. Thompson, </em>523 U.S. 538, 553, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 140 L.Ed.2d 728 (1998)), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 995, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003). Bilal's underlying Rule 60(b) and 70 motion was properly treated as a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion by the district comb because the claims she sought to raise attacked her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-24\">An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000); <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 368-89 (4th Cir.2004). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that her constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>triet court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Bilal has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">In addition, we construe Bilal\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief on appeal as an application to file a second or successive motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Winestock, </em>340 F.3d at 208. Bilal\u2019s claims do not satisfy the conditions set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(2), 2255 (2000). Therefore, we decline to authorize Bilal to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
