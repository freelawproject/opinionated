Minshew appeals his sentence for escape from custody. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a). He argues that the district court erred in departing upward from the guidelines pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 and imposing the statutory maximum sentence of 60 months. He contends that the court should have selected his sentence by considering successive increments above the guideline range. This argument is without merit, as the court\u2019s basis for its upward departure was lawful and the degree of departure did not reveal an abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l), (2)(A), (4); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 4A1.2, Application Note 8; <em>United States v. Bell, </em>371 F.3d 239, 243 (5th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied </em>(U.S. Oct. 4, 2004) (No. 04-5954); <em>United States v. Ashburn, </em>38 F.3d 803, 809-10 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc); <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>984 F.2d 658, 663-64 (5th Cir.1993) (en banc). The district court expressly stated \u201cI have considered an intermediate adjustment in arising [sic] [arriving] at this sentence.\u201d There is no requirement that the district court \u201cgo through a ritualistic exercise in which it mechanically discusses each criminal history category it rejects en route to the category that it selects.\u201d <em>Ashburn, </em>38 F.3d at 809; <em>see also Lambert, </em>984 F.2d at 663. The district court had ample reasons for upward departure in setting Minshew\u2019s sentence, including repeated convictions for escape, commission of crimes while incarcerated, and excessive criminal history points for Category VI. Minshew\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Cross, </em>289 F.3d 476, 4778-79 (7th Cir.2002), is misplaced. In that case, unlike the instant case, the court openly abandoned the guidelines altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Minshew\u2019s argument that the court plainly erred in increasing his sentencing exposure on the basis of prior convictions that were neither charged in the indictment nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt is foreclosed. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). To the extent that he relies on <em>Blakely v. Washington, \u2014\u2014 </em>U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 04-5263).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
