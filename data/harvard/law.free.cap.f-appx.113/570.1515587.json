Ruffin appeals the district court order dismissing all of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) claims, except that he was held in segregation without due process, for failure to exhaust. Ruffin further appeals the district court order dismissing his \u00a7 1983 claim that he was held in segregation without due process as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) (2000). We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. We note that even if Ruffin\u2019s claim that he was denied access to his legal materials was exhausted, it is also frivolous under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) because he failed to demonstrate injury or prejudice caused by his inability to obtain those materials. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
