The district court sentenced King to 235 months in prison. King timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-21\">King\u2019s appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) raising three issues: (1) whether there was sufficient evidence to convict on the carjacking charges; (2) whether there was sufficient evidence to convict on the felon in possession charge; and (3) whether the district court erred in its sentencing calculation relative to the felon in possession charge. King has filed a pro se supplemental brief raising various additional issues. King has also filed a motion to strike the <em>Anders </em>brief submitted by counsel and a motion for appointment of new counsel. The Government has elected not to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-22\">We have reviewed the issues presented by <em>Anders </em>counsel as well as the issues presented by King in his pro se supplemental brief and accompanying motions and conclude they are without merit. Construing the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the Government, we find it sufficient to support King\u2019s jury convictions. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). We also find King was properly sentenced. As for King\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, because the record on appeal does not conclusively show ineffective assistance, those claims should be asserted in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) action, not on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-23\">We have independently reviewed the entire record in this case in accordance with <em>Anders </em>and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm King\u2019s convictions and sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ther deny King\u2019s motion to strike the <em>Anders </em>brief and deny his motion for appointment of new counsel. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-19\">. Counsel for King has filed a motion seeking permission to file a supplemental brief and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>joint appendix so as to challenge certain aspects of his sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>- U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The motion is hereby granted, and the motion to file supplemental briefs is deemed to provide the supplemental argument regarding the effects of <em>Blakely. </em>After consideration of the order issued by the <em>en banc </em>court in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir.2004), we find no error in King\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
