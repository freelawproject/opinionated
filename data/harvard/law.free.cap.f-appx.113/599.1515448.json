Houston, </em>185 F.3d 521, 525 (5th Cir.1999). Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings and discovery \u201cshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fbd.R.Ctv.P. 56(c). \u201cIn response to a properly supported motion for summary judgment, the nonmovant must identify specific evidence in the record and articulate the manner in which that evidence supports that party\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Deep East Texas Regional Narcotics Trafficking Task Force, </em>379 F.3d 293, 301 (5th Cir.2004). The nonmovant cannot meet his burden with conclusional allegations, unsubstantiated assertions, or a scintilla of evidence. <em>See Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>The Plaintiffs assert that they raised a genuine issue of material fact concerning the City\u2019s failure to train its police officers on the use of force and police brutality. In support of this assertion, the Plaintiffs presented in their motion for new trial, Officer Boyd\u2019s testimony that the City did not train him regarding the use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence did not establish that Chief Brooke failed to train the officers whose conduct allegedly violated Lynn Dabney\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Thompson v. Upshur County </em>245 F.3d 447, 459 (5th Cir.2001). The evidence did not establish that the alleged failure to train Officer Boyd was causally connected with the violation of Lynn Dabney\u2019s rights. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The Plaintiffs assert that they produced evidence of a practice of widespread harassment and use of excessive force by the City\u2019s police officers. Charlie Hays, a Mexia citizen, testified that Officer Whisler, who is his uncle, threatened and harassed him and Lynn Dabney. Hays testified that on one occasion, an unidentified Mexia police officer, without provocation, punched him and injured his face.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Hays\u2019 testimony did not establish a \u201cpattern of similar incidents in which citizens were injured or endangered by intentional or negligent police misconduct and/or that serious incompetence or misbehavior was general or widespread throughout the police force.\u201d <em>See Fraire v. City of Arlington, </em>957 F.2d 1268, 1278 (5th Cir.1992). Hays\u2019 testimony did not establish that a governing body or policy-maker of the City had actual or constructive knowledge of any such \u201cpractice\u201d of police misconduct. <em>See Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>237 F.3d 567, 579 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The Plaintiffs assert that Chief Brooke, a policy-maker, delegated his authority to Officer Whisler, thereby making Whisler a policy-maker. The Plaintiffs contend that Whisler\u2019s actions were a direct cause of the violation of Lynn Dabney\u2019s constitutional rights, and because Whisler is a policy-maker, the City is liable for Whisler\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">The Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence did not establish that Chief Brooke delegated policy-making authority to Officer Whisler. <em>Webster v. City of Houston, </em>735 F.2d 838, 841 (5th Cir.1984) <em>(en banc). </em>Absent evidence that Whisler was a policy-maker, the City was not liable for Whisler\u2019s conduct. <em>See Bass v. Parkwood Hosp., </em>180 F.3d 234, 244 (5th Cir.1999). The Plaintiffs did not produce evidence sufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact concerning municipal liability for Lynn Dabney\u2019s injuries and death. <em>See Johnson, </em>379 F.3d at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">Because the Plaintiffs have not challenged the district court\u2019s finding that they did not name individual officers as defendants or the district court\u2019s dismissal of their claims against the Mexia Police Department, they have abandoned any appeal of these issues. <em>See Evans v. City of Marlin, Texas, </em>986 F.2d 104, 106 n. 1 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">The Plaintiffs have not shown that the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for new trial was an abuse of discretion. <em>Wallace v. Texas Tech Univ., </em>80 F.3d 1042, 1052 (5th Cir.1996). The Plaintiffs have not shown that the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for a continuance to conduct additional discovery was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Canady v. Bossier Parish Sch. Bd., </em>240 F.3d 437, 445 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Traillour Oil Co., </em>987 F.2d 1138, 1155 (5th Cir.1993) (we will not disturb the district court\u2019s decision on a motion for a continuance absent an abuse of discretion and will affirm the denial of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>continuance on a summary judgment motion \u201cunless it is arbitrary or clearly unreasonable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b622-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
