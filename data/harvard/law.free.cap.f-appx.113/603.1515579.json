Jones contends that the Judges of the 129th and 334th District Courts are not entitled to absolute immunity because they have not performed their duties and are not acting within their \u201cjudicial jurisdiction.\u201d Jones asserts that the defendants interfered with his right of access to the courts because they have not acted upon motions, requests, and correspondence that he filed in conjunction with his pending civil lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) of an IFP complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998). \u201cJudicial officers are entitled to absolute immunity from claims for damages arising out of acts performed in the exercise of their judicial functions.\u201d <em>Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 284 (5th Cir.1994) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-17\">Contrary to Jones\u2019s assertions, the Judges of the 129th and 334th District Courts are entitled to absolute immunity. <em>See Boyd, </em>31 F.3d at 284-85. The conduct about which Jones complains concerns the manner in which the state judges are handling cases that are pending on their dockets. This conduct is judicial in nature as it is \u201c \u2018normally performed by a judge\u2019 \u201d and affects parties who deal \u201c \u2018with the judge in [a] judicial capacity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-18\">As to the remaining defendants, the clerk of court and the Post Master General, the district court correctly determined that Jones\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim of denial of access to the court. A prisoner cannot prevail on an access-to-the-courts claim without proving an actual injury. <em>Ruiz, </em>160 F.3d at 275. Jones admitted that his civil lawsuits had not been dismissed, and he did not identify any injury or prejudice. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-19\">Jones\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is DISMISSED as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The dismissal by the district court of Jones\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Jones is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b626-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
