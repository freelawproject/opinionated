We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-25\">Baig remained in the United States beyond his voluntary departure date. As a result, the BIA determined that he was statutorily ineligible for an adjustment of status and denied his motion to reopen. Baig argues that the BIA abused its discretion because, after the conclusion of his deportation hearing, he became eligible for an adjustment of status due to his labor certification under the Legal Immigration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Family Equity Act (LIFE Act) Amendments.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Because Baig\u2019s deportation proceedings commenced prior to the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), the governing statutory provisions are found in the now-repealed Section 242B(e)(2)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b,<footnotemark>***</footnotemark> which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">Any alien allowed to depart voluntarily under 244(e)(1) or who has agreed to depart voluntarily at his own expense under Section 242(b)(1) who remains in the United States after the scheduled date of departure, other than because of exceptional circumstances, shall not be eligible for relief described in paragraph (5) for a period of 5 years after the scheduled date of departure or the date of unlawful reenter, respectively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">INA \u00a7 242B(e)(2)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(e)(2)(A) (repealed 1996). The relief that is unavailable due to a failure to voluntarily depart includes adjustments of status. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 242B(5)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(5)(C)(repealed 1996). For purposes of the voluntary departure provisions, \u201c[t]he term \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 refers to exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 242B(f)(2), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(f)(2)(repealed 1996). Subsequent statutory changes creating eligibility for adjustment of status are not one of the enumerated \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>See Shaar v. INS, </em>141 F.3d 953, 957 (9th Cir.1998). Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Baig\u2019s motion to reopen his deportation proceedings. <em>See Lara, </em>216 F.3d at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">Baig further argues that his due process rights were violated when the BIA denied his motion to reopen deportation proceedings prior to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS),<footnotemark>****</footnotemark> responding to his request for an extension of voluntary departure. We review due process challenges in immigration proceedings <em>de novo. Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">Baig\u2019s argument is not supported by the record as he did receive notice of the INS\u2019s denial of his extension request prior to filing his motion to reopen. Moreover, Baig has no fundamental right to be present in the United States. <em>See Shaar, </em>141 F.3d at 958 (citing <em>Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, </em>342 U.S. 580, 586-87, 72 S.Ct. 512, 96 L.Ed. 586 (1952)).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-14\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b597-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
