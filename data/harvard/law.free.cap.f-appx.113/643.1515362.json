Although Chappell concedes that he had no expectation of privacy since his garage door was open, he contends that the seizure of evidence therefrom, which was in plain view, was improper since officers were not authorized to enter the garage without a warrant. Chappell argues that, to the extent state law authorized the officers\u2019 entry into his garage, the applicable provisions of the Texas Transportation Code (TTC) violate the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Regardless of Chappell\u2019s challenge to the TTC, the exigent circumstances created by Chappell by leaving his garage door open and a firearm in plain view justified the officers\u2019 entry into his garage. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>239 F.3d 716, 719-22 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Chappell\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>6 F.3d 287, 289 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Chappell also renews his challenge to the presentence report\u2019s six-level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(C), arguing that one of the 25 firearms recovered from his residence belonged to his father-in-law. When overruling Chappell\u2019s objection to the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(C) enhancement, the district court rejected as incredible Chappell\u2019s argument that he lacked knowledge of the firearm. A credibility determination on a factual finding at sentencing is peculiarly within the province of the trier-of-fact. <em>See United States v. Sotelo, </em>97 F.3d 782, 799 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">For the first time in a Fed. R.App. P. 28(j) letter, Chappell contends that, pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), his offense level increases under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(C) and 2K2.1(b)(4) were improper since the facts supporting these enhancements were not submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Chappell acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 473 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004) (No. 03-30437), and he raises the issue solely to preserve it for future review.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b665-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
