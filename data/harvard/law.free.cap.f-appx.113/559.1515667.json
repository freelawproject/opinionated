We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Richardson v. Sanford, </em>No. CA-03-2425-4-26BH (D.S.C. filed June 18, 2004; entered June 21, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
