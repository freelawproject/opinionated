Hayes claims that the court improperly dismissed the appeal because \u00a7 8-8 (r) does not apply to actions taken during the time period in question or, alternatively, that the statute is impermissible retroactive legislation abrogating substantive legal rights. We agree that \u00a7 8-8 (r) is inapplicable but conclude that a different statutory provision, Special Acts 1999, No. 99-7, \u00a7 6 (c), applies to validate the amendment at issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Construing Hayes\u2019 alternative challenge directed at the applicable provision, we conclude further that Special Act 99-7, \u00a7 6 (c), is a proper exercise of legislative power. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant. Manchester Tolland Development, LLC, is the current owner of a 43.5 acre parcel of land in the town of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Manchester on which it seeks to construct multifamily housing. Hayes, a prior owner of that land, sought to develop it similarly. See footnote 1. On April 20, 1998, subsequent to a public hearing, the defendant made certain amendments to the section of the regulations governing planned residential development zones. A new provision established that in such a zone, \u201c[t]he total number of multi-family dwelling units shall not exceed ten (10) per acre of the multi-family dwelling site excluding wetlands <em>and slopes greater than 15%.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Manchester Zoning Regs., art. II, \u00a7 7.02.03 (c). The italicized portion of the quoted regulation has the effect of reducing substantially the number of units that potentially may be constructed on the subject property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">On May 15, 2003, Hayes filed an application with the defendant for a change of regulations, requesting that the defendant delete the portion of \u00a7 7.02.03 (c) that excludes slopes greater than 15 percent from the density calculation. At a September 3, 2003 public hearing concerning the application, Hayes argued that the defendant had not given proper public notice of the proposed amendment creating that requirement, nor did it file a copy thereof in the town clerk\u2019s office at least ten days prior to the hearing at which the amendment was considered. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 8-3 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hayes also argued that the amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>substantively was unnecessary.* *<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On September 15,2003, the defendant denied Hayes\u2019 request to delete the portion of the regulation excluding slopes greater than 15 percent from the density calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">On October 1, 2003, Hayes filed an appeal from the defendant\u2019s decision to the Superior Court; see General Statutes \u00a7 8-8; claiming that it had established at the September 3, 2003 hearing that no prior public notice had been given of the 1998 amendment to \u00a7 7.02.03, and, therefore, the amendment was void as a matter of law. The defendant filed an answer and raised two special defenses; first, that any failure of notice in 1998 was cured by its consideration of and action on Hayes\u2019 May 15,2003 application and, second, that Hayes\u2019 claim was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">A hearing was held on October 29, 2004. In a March 18, 2005 memorandum of decision, the court dismissed Hayes\u2019 appeal. After determining that Hayes was aggrieved by the defendant\u2019s action in passing the amendment, the court nevertheless concluded that the appeal was time barred. It noted first that, although the appeal was taken from the defendant\u2019s September 15, 2003 decision, it essentially was a challenge to the defendant\u2019s 1998 amendment to \u00a7 7.02.03 of the regulations. The court agreed with the defendant that Hayes\u2019 appeal from that action, which was based on a claim of irregularity regarding public notice, was barred by \u00a7 8-8 (r) because it was not brought within one year from the date of the challenged action. See footnote 2. It rejected Hayes\u2019 arguments that \u00a7 8-8 (r) was not intended to apply to appeals stemming from claimed irregularities predating January 1, 1999, and further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>that the statute could not properly apply retroactively from its passage in 1999. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">At the outset, we must address an argument raised by the defendant because it raises a question of subject matter jurisdiction. The defendant argues that the court improperly found that Hayes was aggrieved by the amendment of \u00a7 7.02.03. Specifically, it claims that, because the subject property is zoned rural residential and the amendment at issue applies to the planned residential development zone, Hayes was not specially and injuriously affected by the amendment. According to the defendant, \u201calleging the existence of a defective zoning regulation merely shows a general injury to the public.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">In zoning matters, aggrievement is \u201cthe key to access to judicial review . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>RYA Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>87 Conn. App. 658, 663, 867 A.2d 97 (2005). \u201cProof of aggrievement is essential to a trial court\u2019s jurisdiction of a zoning appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bethlehem Christian Fellowship, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>58 Conn. App. 441, 443, 755 A.2d 249 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">\u201c[T]he fundamental test for determining aggrievement encompasses a well-settled twofold determination: first, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully establish that this specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision .... Aggrievement is established if there is a possibility, as distinguished from a certainty, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>some legally protected interest . . . has been adversely affected.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 443-44. The question of aggrievement is a factual one. Id., 444. Accordingly, \u201c[o]ur review is to determine whether the judgment of the trial court was clearly erroneous or contrary to the law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In concluding that Hayes was aggrieved by the amendment of \u00a7 7.02.03, the court made the following factual findings: Hayes owned the parcel of land affected by the petition, which is in a rural residential zone; the property is bounded on two sides by land in the planned residential development zone and housing multifamily residential developments; the planned residential development zone is a floating zone;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Hayes had applied for its property to be designated in the planned residential development zone but withdrew its application \u201cfor technical reasons\u201d; and there are few parcels left undeveloped in town to which the planned residential development designation could apply, the subject property being one of them. The defendant does not dispute that the court\u2019s findings are supported by evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>In determining that the foregoing facts supported a finding of aggrievement, the court relied on, inter alia, the decision of our Supreme Court in <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>259 Conn. 402, 788 A.2d 1239 (2002). In <em>Harris, </em>owners of large parcels of undeveloped land in the town of New Milford claimed that they were aggrieved by the adoption of a zoning amendment, applicable generally to residential zones, that, similar to the regulation at issue here, excluded certain areas of a parcel from the calculation used to determine whether that parcel conformed to the minimum lot size required for development. The amendment had the effect, on undeveloped parcels, of reducing the potential number of lots. In concluding that the parties were aggrieved, the court reasoned that, although the amendment by its terms applied to the town as a whole, in reality, only a limited portion of the land in the town, i.e., that owned by the plaintiffs, actually was affected. The plaintiffs, therefore, had a personal interest in the regulation distinguishable from the community as a whole, and the regulation specially and injuriously affected them by reducing the development potential of their properties. Accordingly, they were aggrieved. See id., 411-15; see also <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>62 Conn. App. 284, 291-93, 771 A.2d 167 (2001) (employing similar analysis to similar regulation).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We conclude that the court in this case properly used analogous reasoning in finding Hayes aggrieved by the amendment of \u00a7 7.02.03. Although the amendment by its terms is of general applicability, in practice, it potentially applies only to a limited portion of land in the town, some of which was owned by Hayes. Although Hayes\u2019 land was not yet designated as within the planned residential development zone, it is in the very nature of a floating zone that it does not apply to a particular area of town until a specific application is approved. See footnote 8. Hayes demonstrated that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>owned and wanted to develop a particular parcel of land that would be directly affected by the regulation at issue and, therefore, had a personal interest distinguishable from the community as a whole. The court\u2019s factual findings as to the nature of the subject property, and the properties surrounding it, indicate a sufficient likelihood of approval such that the regulation will apply to reduce the property\u2019s development potential.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That reduction in development potential specially and injuriously affected Hayes. See footnote 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u201cAggrievement does not demand certainty, only the possibility of an adverse effect on a legally protected interest.\u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>supra, 62 Conn. App. 288. We conclude that Hayes demonstrated that possibility and, therefore, that the court properly found Hayes aggrieved by the amendment of \u00a7 7.02.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Hayes argues first that the court improperly concluded that this action was untimely pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (r) because that statute was not intended to bar challenges to failures of notice predating January 1, 1999. We agree with Hayes, but conclude nevertheless that a different provision, Special Act 99-7, \u00a7 6 (c), applies to validate the defendant\u2019s April 20, 1998 amendment of its regulations regardless of any failure of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u201cThe interpretation of a statute, as well as its applicability to a given set of facts and circumstances, involves a question of law and our review, therefore, is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>91 Conn. App. 619, 629, 882 A.2d 98, cert. denied, 276 Conn. 924, 925, 888 A.2d 92 (2005); see also <em>Florian </em>v. <em>Lenge, </em>91 Conn. App. 268, 279, 880 A.2d 985 (2005) (whether action is time barred is question of law subject to plenary review).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">If the meaning or applicability of a statute is clear from its text, this court in construing it should look no further. See General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z. If, however, the applicability of a provision is not so apparent, we must undertake \u201ca reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>supra, 91 Conn. App. 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Section 8-8 (r) provides in relevant part that when a zoning commission \u201cfails to comply with a requirement of a general or special law . . . governing the content, giving, mailing, publishing, filing or recording of any notice either of a hearing or of an action taken by the [commission], any appeal or action by an aggrieved person to set aside the decision or action taken by the [commission] on the grounds of such noncompliance shall be taken not more than one year after the date of that decision or action.\u201d The subsection does not include any express limitations as to its applicability, nor does it reference any other provision containing such a limitation. We therefore turn to the legislative history of \u00a7 8-8 (r) for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Section 8-8 is a comprehensive statute governing zoning appeals and frequently is the subject of amendment. Subsection (r) has its genesis in Public Acts 1999, No. 99-238 (P.A. 99-238), \u201cAn Act Concerning Validating Provisions.\u201d Section 5 of P.A. 99-238 repealed \u00a7 8-8 and substituted a version of the statute identical to the one previously existing except for the addition of subsection (r).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 8 of P.A. 99-238 provides that the \u201cact shall take effect from its passage, except that sections 1 to 6, inclusive, shall take effect July 1, 2000.\u201d Prior to that effective date, however, the legislature passed Public Acts 2000, No. 00-84 (P.A. 00-84), which, in \u00a7 3, repealed \u00a7 8 of P.A. 99-238 and substituted the following: \u201cPublic [A]ct 99-238 shall take effect from its passage, except that sections 1 to 6, inclusive, shall take effect July 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>2000, and sections 1, 2 and 3, subsection (f) of section 4 and <em>sections 5 </em>and 6 <em>shall apply to errors, irregularities and omissions occurring on or after January 1,1999.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Section 8-8 of the General Statutes subsequently was amended several more times prior to Hayes\u2019 institution of this action, but none of the amendments refers or pertains to the applicability date of subsection (r).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the applicability date for \u00a7 5 of P.A. 99-238 (now \u00a7 8-8 [r]) established by \u00a7 3 of P.A. 00-84 does not appear in the codified version of the statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>the basis of that circumstance, the court concluded \u201cthat the limiting language of [P.A. 00-84, \u00a7 3] is no longer in effect.\u201d It reasoned, essentially, that \u00a7 3 of P.A. 00-84 had been repealed by implication because it never was codified. We disagree with that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">A review of all of the subsequent amendments to \u00a7 8-8; see footnote 11; demonstrates that none of those amendments explicitly repealed P.A. 00-84 or, by substance, were in irreconcilable conflict with that act. See General Statutes \u00a7 2-30b (a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is well established in our jurisprudence that implied repeal of a statute is not favored and should not be presumed. See, e.g., <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>254 Conn. 214, 242, 756 A.2d 1264 (2000); <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Yap, </em>247 Conn. 638, 648, 726 A.2d 92 (1999); see also 1A J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction (6th Ed. Singer 2002) \u00a7 23:10, p. 480 (\u201c[r]eports abound with decisions reflecting and endorsing [the] presumption against repeal by implication\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Moreover, our examination of documents comprising the legislative history of P.A. 99-238 and P.A. 00-84 confirms that the legislature specifically intended the limitation period of \u00a7 8-8 (r) to apply only to challenges to failures of notice postdating January 1, 1999, as expressed in the latter act. That history indicates that, prior to the enactment of P.A. 99-238, the legislature customarily approved omnibus validating acts on a biennial basis in odd numbered years. Those provisions, passed as special acts, were intended to give legal effect to certain past acts or transactions that otherwise would be ineffective because of a failure to comply with some requirement of the law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Each validating act was intended to retroactively cure defects arising since the effective date of the last such act.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">By passage of P.A. 99-238, the legislature intended to accomplish <em>prospectively </em>and comprehensively what it previously had effected <em>retroactively </em>and piecemeal through the omnibus validating acts, i.e., in regard to actions of zoning entities, instead of curing failures of notice for the previous two years by a general validating provision, P.A. 99-238 prospectively created a new two year limit (now one year) within which to challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>actions taken without proper notice. As originally enacted, P.A. 99-238 was to take effect on July 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Because the new act was to operate prospectively only, the legislature also passed one last omnibus validating act to cure defects that had arisen since the last such act. That validating act appears as Special Act 99-7, and \u00a7 6 (c) thereof pertains to actions taken by zoning entities when sufficient notice was lacking.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Pursuant to \u00a7 10, Special Act 99-7 applies \u201cto any defect, omission or irregularity enumerated [in the act] which occurred on or before January 1,1999.\u201d See generally Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 2, 1999 Sess., pp. 454-60; see also Law Revision Commission, Validating Acts Review Committee, October 5, 1999 Memo re Proposed Technical Changes to 1999 Validating Act, Analysis of Connecticut Validating Acts \u00a7 6, and Report to the Judiciary Committee-Public Act 99-238 (except \u00a7 7) &amp; Special Act 99-7, available at \u201chttp:// www.cga. ct.gov/lrc/Validating%20Acts/ValidatingActs/ Main.htm\u201d (accessed 9/18/06). Accordingly, Special Act 99-7 applies to validate any alleged defect in notice of the defendant\u2019s action in amending \u00a7 7.02.03 of its regulations in 1998.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>In sum, Hayes is correct that \u00a7 5 of P.A. 99-238, which is codified as \u00a7 8-8 (r) of the General Statutes, does not apply to errors, irregularities and omissions occurring in 1998 and, therefore, that provision did not operate to bar Hayes\u2019 claim that the defendant failed to give proper notice when amending \u00a7 7.02.03 of its regulations. Accordingly, the court\u2019s determination in this regard was improper. We conclude nevertheless that Special Act 99-7, \u00a7 6 (c), does apply to cure 1998 notice defects and, thus, defeats Hayes\u2019 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Hayes argues alternatively that even if the legislature intended \u00a7 8-8 (r) to apply to acts predating its passage, the statute still should be held inapplicable because it is improper retroactive legislation abrogating substantive rights. According to Hayes, the notice requirements attendant to the amendment of zoning regulations are substantive, mandatory and jurisdictional and, hence, are not a proper subject of retroactive legislation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We address Hayes\u2019 argument but construe it as a challenge to Special Act 99-7, \u00a7 6 (c), rather than \u00a7 8-8 (r).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> So construed, Hayes\u2019 claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>As previously explained, \u00a7 6 (c) or similar provisions have been part of the omnibus validating acts passed biennially by the legislature prior to 1999. See footnote 15. The applicable law regarding validating acts has been stated by our Supreme Court as follows: \u201cThe effect of validating acts is to make legal and regular that which was illegal and irregular. The legislature may cure by subsequent enactment the nonobservance of a requirement which it originally might have dispensed with, provided that vested rights have not intervened . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Manchester Environmental Coalition </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>184 Conn. 51, 71, 441 A.2d 68 (1981), overruled on other grounds by <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 556, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002). \u201cIf the irregularity sought to be cured consists in a mode or manner of doing of some act which the [legislature might have made immaterial by prior law, it is equally competent to make the same immaterial by a subsequent law.\u201d <em>Sanger </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>124 Conn. 183, 186, 198 A. 746 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">It is true that, in cases involving deficient notice in zoning matters, Connecticut\u2019s appellate courts repeatedly have refused to consider the adequacy of public notice to be merely a procedural matter and consistently have treated failure to give proper public notice as a substantive, jurisdictional defect rendering agency actions void. See, e.g., <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>260 Conn. 399, 404, 796 A.2d 1187 (2002); <em>Lauver </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>60 Conn. App. 504, 509, 760 A.2d 513 (2000); <em>Cocivi </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>20 Conn. App. 705, 707, 570 A.2d 226, cert. denied, 214 Conn. 808, 573 A.2d 319 (1990). Furthermore, many courts have held that jurisdictional defects cannot be cured by retroactive legislation. See 2 J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction (6th Ed. Singer 2001) \u00a7 41:14, p. 474. The facts of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>case, however, present an instance of a jurisdictional defect that properly may be cured retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Specifically, \u201c[i]t is important to distinguish between \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 requirements prescribed by constitutional provisions and those established by ordinary legislation.\u201d Id., p. 475. In regard to the latter, \u201cthe legislature can legalize actions taken without compliance with [purely] statutory requirements by which a . . . public agency acquires jurisdiction.\u201d Id. Conversely, retroactive legislation purporting to cure constitutionally based jurisdictional defects underlying agency action potentially may implicate procedural due process. Id. \u201cIf the effect of legalizing acts of public officers would be to permit the taking of property without notice and hearing, the constitutional guaranty of procedural due process is violated, and the attempt at validation must fail. This has been the real basis for decision in the cases refusing to sustain curative acts directed at jurisdictional defects.\u201d Id., pp. 475-76; see also <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>107 Conn. 697, 707, 142 A. 574 (1928) (\u201cstatute will not be permitted to act retrospectively so as to validate what was before void <em>because in conflict with [the] State or Federal constitu</em>tion[s]\u201d [emphasis added]); 16B Am. Jur. 2d 192, Constitutional Law \u00a7 694 (1998) (retroactive acts that operate so as to take away property rights may be unconstitutional and void).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The present matter concerns the adoption of a regulatory amendment, allegedly without proper notice. When a zoning entity adopts regulations, it acts in a legislative capacity. See <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 415-16. \u201cThe fact that the proceeding is legislative, rather than adjudicative, in nature plays a role in the determination of what process is due.\u201d <em>Protect Hamden/North Haven from Excessive Traffic &amp; Pollution, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 527, 555, 600 A.2d 757 (1991). As our Supreme Court has made clear, when a zoning entity is \u201cacting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>in its legislative capacity, no notice or hearing [is] necessary to satisfy the requirements of due process of law.\u201d <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Board of Representatives, </em>148 Conn. 33, 40, 166 A.2d 849 (1961); see also 16B Am. Jur. 2d 498, supra, \u00a7 907 (\u201c[d]ue process requires a notice and hearing only in quasi-judicial or adjudicatory settings and not in the adoption of general legislation\u201d); cf. 2 E. Yokley, Zoning Law &amp; Practice (4th Ed. MacGregor 2001) \u00a7 11-7, pp. 11-55-11-57 (failure to provide notice of zoning amendment not jurisdictional defect where statute fails to provide for notice and hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Given the foregoing, we conclude that, although the notice requirements of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 8-3 (a) have been held to be substantive and jurisdictional, they are creatures of statute and are not constitutionally required. Because the legislature might originally have dispensed with a notice requirement in this context, it properly could cure the nonobservance thereof by subsequent enactment. See <em>Manchester Environmental Coalition </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 71; <em>Sanger </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, 124 Conn. 186. Consequently, any failure by the defendant to observe the notice requirements when amending its regulations in 1998 properly was cured by the validating provision in Special Act 99-7, \u00a7 6 (c). See <em>Connecticut State Employees Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Personnel Policy Board, </em>165 Conn. 448, 455, 334 A.2d 909 (1973) (board\u2019s failure to observe statutory notice, petition, hearing and approval requirements of Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq., cured by validating act); <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>13 Conn. App. 446, 447-48, 537 A.2d 509 (1988) (board\u2019s failure to provide supplemental notice required by town regulation cured by validating act).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Moreover, we are not persuaded that Special Act 99-7, \u00a7 6 (c), impaired any vested rights of Hayes. That provision removed Hayes\u2019 right to bring, at any time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>an action challenging the defendant\u2019s amendment of its regulations without the required statutory notice. \u201cTo be vested, a right must have become [e.g.] a title, legal or equitable, to the present or future enjoyment of property, or to the present or future . . . enforcement of a demand, or a legal exemption from a demand made by another.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Manchester Environmental Coalition </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 71. A right is not vested \u201cunless it amounts to something more than a mere expectation of future benefit or interest founded upon an anticipated continuance of the existing general laws.\u201d 16B Am. Jur. 2d 197, supra, \u00a7 701. \u201cThere can, in the nature of things, be no vested right in an existing law which precludes its change or repeal, nor any vested right in the omission to legislate on a particular subject.\u201d Id., 199, \u00a7 703; see, e.g., <em>Enfield Federal Savings &amp; Loan </em>v. <em>Bissell, </em>184 Conn. 569, 574, 440 A.2d 220 (1981) (no vested right to have claim adjudicated under previous version of statute governing deficiency judgments).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">We conclude that Hayes\u2019 right to sue for notice defects, prior to being extinguished by Special Act 99-7, \u00a7 6 (c), was only an expectation premised on the legal status quo existing prior to the act and, therefore, not a vested right.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See <em>Manchester Environmental Coalition </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 71 (plaintiffs\u2019 right to sue commissioner of department of commerce for failure to comply with statutory mandates in approving project plan for industrial park not vested right). Notably, by the plain terms of Special Act 99-7, \u00a7 6 (c), if Hayes had brought its action prior to the effective date of the act or if the usual time for taking an appeal had not yet expired, the act would not have operated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>to validate the defendant\u2019s allegedly improper action. See footnote 14. In sum, we conclude that Special Act 99-7, \u00a7 6 (c), as applied to the facts of this case, is a valid exercise of legislative power. On the basis of the foregoing analysis, Hayes\u2019 second claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-11\"> The zoning appeal originally was initiated and prosecuted by Hayes, which owned the affected property during the relevant period. While the case was pending in this court, Hayes sold most of that property to Manchester Tolland Development, LLC, which is pursuing development of the property in a similar fashion as was Hayes. Accordingly, we subsequently granted Hayes\u2019 motion to add Manchester Tolland Development, LLC, as a party plaintiff. See <em>New Milford Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Mulville, </em>56 Conn. App. 521, 524, 744 A.2d 447 (2000) (permitting party to intervene in appellate proceedings when \u201c[t]he judgment to be rendered [will] affect the proposed intervenor\u2019s direct or personal rights\u201d); <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>21 Conn.

Both of those cases involved general challenges, at the outset of their enactment, to regulations creating new floating zones. There is no indication in either case, as there is in the present matter, that the plaintiffs owned property whose development potential was impacted directly by a specific provision in those regulations.

That act provided [in \u00a7 2] that \u2018[sjection 8-8 of the general statutes, as amended by section 5 of public act 99-238, is repealed . . . .\u2019 The act amended \u00a7 8-8 by eliminating the need for a recognizance on appeal and allowed for the preparation of a transcript by other than the appellant agency. It left intact the provisions of subsection (r) in subsection (q). The act was effective October 1, 2000. No reference was made to P.A. 00-84 or its language regarding the application of certain of its sections to only errors, irregularities and omissions occurring on or after January 1, 1999.\u201d The court further stated: \u201c[T]he legislature has continued to amend \u00a7 8-8, and subsequent amendments do not reference the language of \u00a7 3 of P.A. 00- 84 .... On May 31, 2001, the legislature adopted Public Acts 2001, No. 01- 47, which amended \u00a7 8-8 to provide for a stay of proceedings while mediation of an appeal was pending and renamed subsection (q) to (r). On June 20, 2001, Public Acts 2001, No. 01-110, was adopted, and it specifically repealed subsection (q) of \u00a7 8-8 [now subsection (r)] and amended it to [provide for a one year appeal period instead of a two year period as previously]. In Public Acts 2001, No. 01-195, the legislature made technical amendments to \u00a7 8-8 not affecting the substantive language of subsection [r]. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 8-8 was amended by Public Acts 2002, No. 02-74, to allow for appeals from decisions on site plans.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\"> We note, however, that the effective date and applicability date for \u00a7 5 of P.A. 99-238 [now General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (r)], both of which were established by \u00a7 3 of P.A. 00-84, appear in the history section prepared by the legislative commissioner\u2019s office that immediately follows the statutory text of \u00a7 8-8. Prefatory information in the General Statutes instructs users to consult history sections for effective date information but cautions that those \u201chistories are not to be read or considered as statements of legislative intent,\u201d nor are they \u201cintended as a substitute for the full text of the public or special acts listed in the source of each section. \u201d General Statutes, preface, p. vii.

This provision pertains solely to consideration of Public Acts 2000, No. 00-108, the only other amendment to General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 passed in the same legislative session as P.A. 00-84.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\"> The defendant argues that \u00a7 2 of Public Acts 2000, No. 00-108 (P.A. 00-108), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[s]ection 8-8 of the general statutes, as amended by section 5 of public act 99-238, is repealed,\u201d effectively nullified P.A. 00-84 because, given the contemplated \u201crepeal,\u201d there no longer was anything to which P.A. 00-84 could apply. This argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Typically, our General Assembly\u2019s \u201cnomenclature of \u2018repeal\u2019 manifests [its] intent to modify and to amend prior legislation, and not to extinguish it ab initio\u201d; <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Yap, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 647; and such clearly was the case here. Although P.A. 00-108 by its terms \u201crepealed\u201d the recently amended General Statutes \u00a7 8-8, it thereafter reinstituted it in large part with, most importantly, subsection (r) left fully intact. See footnote 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Generally, \u201c[w]here a particular statute is incorporated into another statute by specific or descriptive words, the presumption is that the legislature did not intend that modification or repeal of the adopted statute should affect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the adopting statute. . . .
