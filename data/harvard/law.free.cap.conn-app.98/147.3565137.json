J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay7\">The plaintiff, Andrea Wilson, appeals from the judgment of the trial court rendered following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>the granting of a motion for a directed verdict in favor of the defendant, Wilhelmina Jefferson, on the plaintiffs amended complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff initiated the present action in Superior Court after the defendant, her landlord, was unsuccessful in a summary process action against her. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly directed a verdict in favor of the defendant on all counts of her amended complaint. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The following facts are relevant to the plaintiffs claims on appeal. The plaintiff entered into a lease with the defendant for the second floor apartment at 8 Han-ford Place in Norwalk (apartment) on July 1,1995.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant quickly became acrimonious as a result of numerous disagreements between them regarding their respective duties as tenant and landlord. In June, 1996, the defendant sent the plaintiff a letter notifying her that she planned to terminate her lease on July 31, 1996. On June 20, 1996, the defendant received notice of certain housing violations from the department of health of the city of Norwalk. Over the course of the next two years, the defendant attempted to initiate a successful summary process action against the plaintiff on four separate occasions. The first three actions either were dismissed or withdrawn because of procedural defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The fourth and final summary process action was filed on October 22, 1997, but a decision in that action was not forthcoming until February 25, 2002. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>final summary process action, the defendant had sought to evict the plaintiff on the bases that the apartment was needed for family use and that the lease had expired. The plaintiff asserted retaliatory eviction as a special defense pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47a-20.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The housing court found that the defendant had received notice of housing code violations within six months of the eviction proceeding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It concluded, therefore, that the plaintiff successfully had asserted her special defense, establishing a presumption of retaliatory eviction, and that the defendant had failed to demonstrate a reason for evicting the plaintiff that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>sufficient to rebut that presumption.* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The housing court rendered judgment for the plaintiff accordingly. Although the housing court found in favor of the plaintiff, it noted that it did not believe the defendant to have been uncooperative in any way, and it found both parties to be good and decent people.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Following the plaintiffs success in the summary process action, she remained a tenant of the defendant, and she brought this civil action. In counts one through four of the amended complaint, the plaintiff asserted claims for damages for retaliatory eviction pursuant to \u00a7 47a-20. In counts five through eight, the plaintiff set forth claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and in count nine, a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. Count ten asserted a claim for abuse of process. In count eleven, the plaintiff alleged a claim for a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), based on the defendant\u2019s repeated attempts at eviction. In count twelve, the plaintiff alleged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>the defendant had violated General Statutes \u00a7 47a-21 (h) by failing to keep her security deposit in an escrow account, and, in count thirteen, she asserted a second claim under CUTPA based on an alleged violation of \u00a7 47a-21 (h). Finally, in counts fourteen through seventeen, the plaintiff set forth causes of action for retaliatory eviction on the basis of General Statutes \u00a7 47a-33.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">A jury trial was commenced whereupon both sides presented their case to the jury. After both sides rested, the defendant moved for a directed verdict on all remaining counts of the plaintiffs complaint, to which the plaintiff objected. The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion in a lengthy oral opinion, and it instructed the jury to direct a verdict in favor of the defendant on all remaining counts of the complaint, which it did. The plaintiff later moved to set aside the verdict, and the court thoroughly readdressed the merits of the directed verdict, affirmed its earlier decision and denied the plaintiffs motion. The plaintiff now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Prior to addressing the propriety of the court\u2019s decision directing a verdict in favor of the defendant on all counts, we set forth the applicable standard of review that this court employs when determining whether the trial court properly directed a verdict. \u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s decision to direct a verdict for the defendant by considering all of the evidence, including reasonable inferences, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. ... A directed verdict is justified if . . . the evidence is so weak that it would be proper for the court to set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>aside a verdict rendered for the other party.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McCann Real Equities XXII, LLC </em>v. <em>David McDermott Chevrolet, Inc., </em>93 Conn. App. 486, 490, 890 A.2d 140, cert. denied, 277 Conn. 928, 895 A.2d 798 (2006). \u201cA verdict may be directed where the decisive question is one of law or where the claim is that there is insufficient evidence to sustain a favorable verdict. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Beale </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, </em>89 Conn. App. 556, 566, 874 A.2d 259 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">We first address the plaintiffs claims that the court improperly directed a verdict in favor of the defendant on counts one through four of her complaint, which alleged claims for damages based on each of the defendant\u2019s individual attempts to evict the plaintiff allegedly in violation of \u00a7 47a-20, and counts fourteen through seventeen, which alleged claims for damages based on each of the defendant\u2019s individual attempts to evict the plaintiff, allegedly in violation of \u00a7 47a-33. The court directed a verdict in favor of the defendant with respect to all of these counts, holding that neither statutory provision created a private cause of action for damages. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court\u2019s ruling was improper. We disagree. Additionally, we note that during trial, specifically on July 1, 2004, the plaintiffs counsel clearly agreed that counts fourteen through seventeen failed to state a cause of action. Accordingly, we do not address those counts in our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Although the court acted pursuant to the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, its rulings with respect to counts one through four specifically address the legal sufficiency of the complaint, and the court concluded as a matter of law that \u00a7 47a-2Q does not afford a private cause of action. The plaintiffs claim \u201cwith respect to \u00a7 47a-20a presents] an issue of statutory construction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Statutory construction is a question of law and, therefore, our review is plenary. . . . The meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Correa </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>91 Conn. App. 142, 146, 881 A.2d 393 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The plaintiff claims that the court improperly ruled that \u00a7 47a-20 does not provide a private cause of action for damages. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Section 47a-20 provides in relevant part that a landlord \u201cshall not maintain an action or proceeding against a tenant to recover possession of a dwelling unit . . . within six months after (2) any municipal agency or official has filed a notice, complaint or order regarding ... a violation [of provisions of chapter 368o, or of chapter 412, or of any other state statute or regulation, or of the housing and health ordinances of the municipality wherein the premises which are the subject of the complaint lie] . . . .\u201d See footnote 3. The text of \u00a7 47a-20 makes no mention of any right of a tenant to maintain an action for damages or other relief in the event that the landlord violates the terms of the provision. Indeed, our appellate case law consistently has construed \u00a7 47a-20 as creating only a <em>rebuttable presumption </em>of retaliatory eviction that arises when a landlord institutes a summary process action within six months of certain complaints or orders as enumerated in the statute. See <em>Visco </em>v. <em>Cody, </em>16 Conn. App. 444, 450 n.7, 547 A.2d 935 (1988) (\u201c[section] 47a-20 establishes retaliation as a presumption, if a summary process action is initiated within six months of a complaint, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>which the landlord must then successfully rebut\u201d); <em>Correa </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>supra, 91 Conn. App. 146-47 (concluding that enumerated grounds set forth in \u00a7 47a-20a are sole means of rebutting presumption of retaliation created by \u00a7 47a-20). Numerous Superior Court decisions also have interpreted the language of \u00a7 47a-20 to establish a restriction on a landlord\u2019s remedies, thereby construing the statute as a shield for the tenant, rather than a sword. See, e.g., <em>Alteri </em>v. <em>Layton, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 261, 264, 408 A.2d 18 (1979) (\u201c[u]nder \u00a7 47a-20 ... the retaliatory eviction defense is not a right given to tenants, but rather a limitation upon the remedies of the landlord\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The plaintiff argues that, despite the absence of any language in \u00a7 47a-20 indicating a private cause of action for tenants, to give full effect to the purpose of \u00a7 47a-20, this court should imply a cause of action. This we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The party seeking to invoke an implied right of action bears the burden of demonstrating that such an action is created implicitly in the statute. See <em>Asylum Hill Problem Solving Revitalization Assn. </em>v. <em>King, </em>277 Conn. 238, 246, 890 A.2d 522 (2006). The plaintiff has not met this burden. \u201cIn order to overcome the presumption in Connecticut that private enforcement does not exist unless expressly provided in a statute, the [plaintiff] must demonstrate that, in applying the three part test [our Supreme Court] established in <em>Napoletano </em>v. <em>CIGNA Healthcare of Connecticut, Inc., </em>[238 Conn. 216, 249, 680 A.2d 127 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1103, 117 S. Ct. 1106, 137 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1997)] no factor weighs against affording an implied right of action and the balance of factors weighs in their favor. Under that test, we examine: First, [whether] the plaintiff [is] one of the class for whose . . . benefit the statute was enacted .... Second, [whether there is] any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>create such a remedy or to deny one .... Third, [whether it is] consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Asylum Hill Problem Solving Revitalization Assn. </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, 246-47. \u201c[T]he amount and persuasiveness of evidence supporting each factor may vary, and the court must consider all evidence that could bear on each factor. It bears repeating, however, that the plaintiffs must meet the threshold showing that none of the three factors weighs against recognizing a private right of action.\u201d Id., 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">We note that because \u00a7 47a-20 is silent with respect to whether it confers a private right of action, our analysis of the plaintiffs argument is not limited by General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z. <em>See Asylum Hill Problem Solving Revitalization Assn. </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 268. Accordingly, we apply \u201cour well established process of statutory interpretation, under which we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Eder Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Wine Merchants of Connecticut, Inc., </em>275 Conn. 363, 372, 880 A.2d 138 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">We conclude with respect to the second <em>Napoletano </em>factor that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the legislature intended to create a private cause of action through the enactment of \u00a7 47a-20. To the contrary, the legislative history indicates that in enacting \u00a7 47a-20, lawmakers did not intend to create a cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>of action for damages. Section 47a-20 was enacted pursuant to a 1971 public act entitled \u201cAn Act Prohibiting Retaliatory Rent Increases and Evictions.\u201d Public Acts 1971, No. 71-852. Senator Wilber G. Smith introduced the legislation and explained: \u201c[T]he purpose of the bill . . . simply [is] to prohibit retaliatory rent increases and evictions solely because persons exercise their rights . . . presently given them under law, to file complaints with the State or local municipalities ... [to prevent] Housing Code violations and to protect [tenants] and to allow them to use [this law] as defense from being evicted . . . .\u201d 14 S. Proc., Pt. 7, 1971 Sess., pp. 3034-35. The public act, as originally proposed, included a subsection four, which provided a cause of action for a tenant who was evicted as retaliation whereby the tenant would be entitled to triple damages and attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The act subsequently was amended to delete subsection four in its entirety. Senator Smith explained the purpose of the amendment, remarking: \u201cSection 4 is completely deleted because of the fact that, points were well made that, no tenant . . . should be entitled to recover damages when [no one] knows how far this individual may or may not move. . . . [T]he bill, as amended, will still, in the intent, meet the [tenant\u2019s] needs.\u201d Id. Thus, as the recorded legislative history makes clear, the legislature expressly considered providing a private cause of action for damages based on retaliatory eviction, but then rejected that option, confident that the intent of the section, to prohibit retaliatory evictions and rent increases, would be accomplished without such a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">An examination of the relationship between \u00a7 47a-20 and other provisions of the Landlord Tenant Act, General Statutes \u00a7 47a-l et seq., also is revealing. See <em>Asylum Hill Problem Solving Revitalization Assn. </em>v. <em>King, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>supra, 277 Conn. 255. The placement of \u00a7 47a-20 among the provisions of the Landlord Tenant Act addressing the rights and responsibilities of landlords indicates that the provision sought only to limit landlords\u2019 rights. Similarly, the title of the provision, \u201cRetaliatory Action by Landlord Prohibited,\u201d strongly evidences that the legislature intended \u00a7 47a-20 to act only as a limit to a landlord\u2019s rights of summary process and rent collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Although the plaintiff argues that a cause of action for retaliatory eviction should be implied from the statutory framework of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47a-14h and 47a-20, her brief provides little substantive argument or analysis in support of this position. The plaintiff refers to the language of \u00a7 47a-14h* **<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and argues that it alludes to a cause of action pursuant to \u00a7 47a-20. Although \u00a7 47a-14h makes reference to \u00a7 47a-20, we do not agree with the plaintiffs argument that the references indicate an intention on the part of the legislature to recognize a separate private cause of action for damages or other relief on the basis of an alleged retaliatory eviction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The plaintiff has failed to cite any legislative history in support of such a position.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because it is the plaintiffs burden to demonstrate to this court that none of the <em>Napoletano </em>factors weighs against an implied cause of action, we decline to partake in further analysis. \u201c[F]or this court judiciously and efficiently to consider claims of error raised on appeal . . . the parties must clearly and fully set forth their arguments in their briefs.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Verderame </em>v. <em>Trinity Estates Development Corp., </em>92 Conn. App. 230, 232, 883 A.2d 1255 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">We conclude, accordingly, that the court properly directed a verdict with respect to counts one through four of the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The plaintiff next claims that the court improperly directed a verdict in favor of the defendant with respect to counts five through eight of the amended complaint, each alleging a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, one count for each summary process action filed by the defendant. We conclude that the court properly directed the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">In order to prevail in a case for liability under a theory of intentional infliction of emotional distress,</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the plaintiff must plead and prove four elements. \u201cIt must be shown: (1) that the [defendant] intended to inflict emotional distress or that he knew or should have known that emotional distress was the likely result of his conduct; (2) that the conduct was extreme and outrageous; (3) that the defendant\u2019s conduct was the cause of the plaintiffs distress; and (4) that the emotional distress sustained by the plaintiff was severe. . . . Whether a defendant\u2019s conduct is sufficient to satisfy the requirement that it be extreme and outrageous is initially a question for the court to determine. . . . Only where reasonable minds disagree does it become an issue for the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bombalicki </em>v. <em>Pastore, </em>71 Conn. App. 835, 840, 804 A.2d 856 (2002). \u201cLiability for intentional infliction of emotional distress requires conduct exceeding all bounds usually tolerated by decent society, of a nature which is especially calculated to cause, and does cause, mental distress of a very serious kind.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Muniz </em>v. <em>Kravis, </em>59 Conn. App. 704, 712, 757 A.2d 1207 (2000). \u201c[I]t is the intent to cause injury that is the gravamen of the tort . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ancona </em>v. <em>Manafort Bros., Inc., </em>56 Conn. App. 701, 708, 746 A.2d 184, cert. denied, 252 Conn. 953, 749 A.2d 1202 (2000). On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the evidence demonstrated that \u201cthe defendant knew . . . that an eviction action would ... be emotionally injurious to anyone . . . [that] outrageousness is demonstrated ... by [the defendant\u2019s] constant violations of state law . . . [and that] the severity of the emotional stress and suffering of the [plaintiff] is clear from the testimony.\u201d Additionally, she argues that her pleadings as to these counts also were sufficient. In directing a verdict on these counts, the court concluded that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>intended to cause emotional injury to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court explained that knowing that something would cause emotional injury and intending to cause such injury are two different things, and there was no evidence that the defendant <em>intended </em>to cause emotional injury. Although we affirm the judgment of the court directing a verdict on these counts, we do so on the ground that there was no evidence, nor even an allegation in the pleadings, that the conduct of the defendant was extreme and outrageous.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">We previously have concluded: \u201cThe act of filing a lawsuit, even if wrongfully motivated, does not transgress the bounds of socially tolerable behavior or make the average member of the community raise their hand and exclaim, \u2018Outrageous!\u2019 \u201d <em>Heim </em>v. <em>California Federal Bank, </em>78 Conn. App. 351, 371, 828 A.2d 129, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 911, 832 A.2d 70 (2003). Here, the only conduct of the defendant on which the plaintiff based her claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress was the defendant\u2019s individual attempts to initiate a summary process proceeding against her. Under these facts, the plaintiff cannot demonstrate, nor did she demonstrate during trial, extreme and outrageous conduct as is required to establish a prima facie case of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Accordingly, we conclude that the court properly directed the verdict on these counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The plaintiff next claims that the court improperly directed a verdict with respect to count nine, her claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>of negligent infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that the conduct of the defendant in wrongly bringing repeated summary process actions created an unreasonable risk of causing the plaintiff emotional distress and that the evidence showed that the plaintiff suffered physical symptoms as a result of that conduct. We conclude that the court properly directed a verdict on this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u201c[I]n order to prevail on a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant should have realized that its conduct involved an unreasonable risk of causing emotional distress and that that distress, if it were caused, might result in illness or bodily harm. . . . This . . . test essentially requires that the fear or distress experienced by the plaintiffs be reasonable in light of the conduct of the defendants. If such [distress] were reasonable in light of the defendants\u2019 conduct, the defendants should have realized that their conduct created an unreasonable risk of causing distress, and they, therefore, properly would be held liable. Conversely, if the [distress] were unreasonable in light of the defendants\u2019 conduct, the defendants would not have recognized that their conduct could cause this distress and, therefore, they would not be hable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Larobina </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>274 Conn. 394, 410, 876 A.2d 522 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">As with her claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the plaintiffs claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress was based solely on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>defendant\u2019s repeated attempts to initiate a successful summary process action against her. Even assuming that it was the defendant\u2019s negligence that led to the initiation of four summary process proceedings, we cannot say that such conduct was unreasonable in that it was foreseeable that the plaintiff <em>reasonably </em>would suffer severe emotional distress beyond that normally associated with litigation. The plaintiff specifically pleaded in paragraph four of the ninth count of her amended complaint that it was the defendant\u2019s \u201crepeated actions to evict the plaintiff [which constituted] a pattern of harassment with the knowledge that such actions would cause substantial mental pain, suffering and anguish on the part of the plaintiff, or a reckless disregard that such harm would occur, or negligently took such actions.\u201d We note that in the history of our summary process law, technicalities often have resulted in the dismissal of such actions one or more times before a landlord has been successful in recovering possession of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">In this case, there was no evidence that the repeated attempts to evict the plaintiff constituted a pattern of harassment such that would create an unreasonable risk of causing the plaintiff emotional injury. Further, just as the defendant\u2019s use of legal process to enforce her rights as landlord, without more, does not constitute extreme and outrageous behavior, it also cannot be considered unreasonable conduct in this context. See <em>Ancona </em>v. <em>Manafort Bros., Inc., </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 713 (upholding trial court\u2019s determination that plaintiffs failure to show that defendant should have anticipated that prosecuting its claim would cause plaintiff emotional distress beyond that normally associated with litigation was fatal to claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress). We conclude, therefore, that the court\u2019s ruling with respect to count nine was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">We next address the plaintiffs claim that the court improperly directed a verdict in favor of the defendant as to count ten of the amended complaint, which set forth a claim for abuse of process. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The entire argument and analysis provided by the plaintiff in her appellate brief provides: \u201cIn the instant case, we have the bringing of four eviction actions, which, because of their violations of \u00a7 47a-20, could bring about no purpose other than the harassment of the plaintiff. Hence, they constitute, or at least a jury could conclude that they constitute, an abuse of process. The malice on the part of the defendant is demonstrated even in the instant case with her special defenses and counterclaims.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cAn action for abuse of process lies against any person using a legal process against another in an improper manner or to accomplish a purpose for which it was not designed. . . . Because the tort arises out of the accomplishment of a result that could not be achieved by the proper and successful use of process, the Restatement Second (1977) of Torts, \u00a7 682, emphasizes that the gravamen of the action for abuse of process is the use of a legal process . . . against another <em>primarily </em>to accomplish a purpose for which it is not designed ....

In directing a verdict on this count, the court found that the evidence tended to show that the defendant sought to evict the plaintiff because she wanted possession of the apartment. Chapter 832 of our General Statutes, concerning summary process, was designed by the legislature for just this purpose \u2014 to enable a landlord to recover possession of a rental unit. See General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23 (a) et seq. \u201cSummary process is a special statutory procedure designed to provide an expeditious remedy. ... It enables a landlord to obtain possession of leased premises without the delay associated with common-law actions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>RockRimmon Grange </em># <em>142, Inc. </em>v. <em>The Bible Speaks Ministries, Inc., </em>92 Conn.

We decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Count eleven of the amended complaint alleged in relevant part: \u201cIn the conduct of her business of renting out apartments, the defendant brought repeated actions to evict the plaintiff in disregard of Connecticut law and with the intent of [injuring] the plaintiff, and specifically in doing so, violated [CUTPA].\u201d The court directed a verdict on the basis of the plaintiffs failure to plead with sufficiency the specific public policy on which she was basing this CUTPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff states in her brief that CUTPA has been applied in the landlord-tenant context. She then provides, in toto, the following analysis: CUTPA \u201capplies in the instant case [because of] public policy and the outrageous conduct in the actions of the defendant. The defendant has claimed that there was no misconduct pleaded although clearly, the pleading <em>does </em>indicate outrageous conduct \u2014 actions in violation of Connecticut law in prosecuting the eviction actions. The defendant admitted, through her attorney, that she was in the business of renting apartments. . . . This count should have gone to the jury at least so far as monetary losses and also on the emotional injuries.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original.) No legal analysis, legal citation or direction to the evidence in support of a CUPTA claim are presented to this court in the plaintiffs brief. Accordingly, we decline to review this claim. \u201c[W]e are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief. . . . Analysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failing to brief the issue properly. . . .

We decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Not only has the plaintiff failed to brief these issues adequately,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> but the plaintiffs counsel conceded, before the trial court, that these counts did not state a cause of action because they were premature.

See id., 130-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\"> The amended complaint originally contained nineteen counts. Counts eighteen and nineteen specifically were withdrawn prior to the court\u2019s ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. This appeal, therefore, concerns the remaining seventeen counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-9\"> The plaintiff was a recipient of a rent subsidy under the housing assistance program administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to \u00a7 8 of the National Housing Act, as amended in 1974 and codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b176-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47a-20, which is entitled \u201cRetaliatory action by landlord prohibited,\u201d provides: \u201cA landlord shall not maintain an action or proceeding against a tenant to recover possession of a dwelling unit, demand an increase in rent from the tenant, or decrease the services to which the tenant has been entitled within six months after: (1) The tenant has in good faith attempted to remedy by any lawful means, including contacting officials of the state or of any town, city or borough or public agency or filing a complaint with a fair rent commission, any condition constituting a violation of any provisions of chapter 368o, or of chapter 412, or of any other state statute or regulation, or of the housing and health ordinances of the municipality wherein the premises which are the subject of the complaint lie; (2) any municipal agency or official has filed a notice, complaint or order regarding such a violation; (3) the tenant has in good faith requested the landlord to make repairs; (4) the tenant has in good faith instituted an action under subsections (a) to (i), inclusive, of section 47a-14h; or (5) the tenant has organized or become a member of a tenants\u2019 union.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b176-7\"> A review of the housing court\u2019s decision leaves us somewhat perplexed. In concluding that Wilson successfully had sustained her burden with respect to the special defense of retaliatory eviction, the court found that such burden was met by Wilson\u2019s introduction into evidence of \u201cexhibit fourteen, which is a notice entitled notice of violation of unsafe building, wherein the communication for exhibit fourteen indicated the structure was unsafe. Exhibit fourteen was dated October 27, 1997, certainly within six months of these eviction proceedings.\u201d What is perplexing about this conclusion is that the court also specifically found that Jefferson had served Wilson with a notice to quit on September 10, 1997, and a summary process complaint on October 11,1997. This would mean that the document found by the court to have established Wilson\u2019s special defense of retaliatory eviction was dated one and one-half months <em>after </em>the notice to quit had been served and more than two weeks <em>after </em>the summary process complaint had been served. We are unable to fathom how exhibit fourteen could have established a retalia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>tory eviction when it was dated well <em>after </em>Jefferson started the final summary process procedures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b177-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47a-20a enumerates four bases by which a landlord may overcome the presumption of retaliatory eviction. It provides in relevant part: \u201cActions deemed not retaliatory, (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 47a-20, the landlord may maintain an action to recover possession of the dwelling unit if: (1) The tenant is using the dwelling unit for an illegal purpose or for a purpose which is in violation of the rental agreement or for nonpayment of rent; (2) the landlord seeks in good faith to recover possession of the dwelling unit for immediate use as his own abode; (3) the condition complained of was caused by the wilful actions of the tenant or another person in his household or a person on the premises with his consent; or (4) the landlord seeks to recover possession on the basis of a notice to terminate a periodic tenancy, which notice was given to the tenant before the tenant\u2019s complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">In the summary process action, to rebut the presumption of retaliatory eviction, the defendant asserted that she wanted to recover possession of the apartment for family use. See General Statutes \u00a7 47a-20a(2). The housing court concluded, however, that the defendant had not met her burden of proving family use by a fair preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b178-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47a-33 provides in relevant part: \u201cIn any action for summary process ... it shall be an affirmative defense that the plaintiff brought such action solely because the defendant attempted to remedy, by lawful means, including contacting officials of the state or of any town, city, borough or public agency or filing a complaint with a fair rent commission, any condition constituting a violation of any of the provisions of chapter 368o, or of chapter 412, or of any other state statute or regulation or of the housing or health ordinances of the municipality wherein the premises which are the subject of the complaint lie. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b183-7\"> Specifically, proposed subsection four stated: \u201cAny tenant from whom possession has been recovered or who has been otherwise involuntarily dispossessed in violation of any provision of this act, shall be entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>recover triple damages based on the actual damages sustained to him, including all costs of locating a new dwelling, moving expenses, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees associated with such an action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b184-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47a-14h (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny tenant who claims that his landlord has failed to perform his legal duties, as required by section 47a-7 or subdivisions (1) to (13), inclusive, of subsection (a) of section 21-82, may institute an action in the <em>superior court having jurisdiction over housing matters </em>in the judicial district in which he resides <em>to obtain the relief authorized by this section and sections 47a-20 </em>and 47a-68. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 47a-14h provides a cause of action for a tenant to enforce her rights as tenant and to compel a landlord to perform her legal duties. See <em>Dugan </em>v. <em>Milledge, </em>196 Conn. 591, 594, 494 A.2d 1203 (1985). It permits a tenant who has complied with certain jurisdictional requirements to bring an action to compel her landlord to comply with the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 47a-7. General Statutes \u00a7 47a-14h (k) provides: \u201cThe judges of the superior court may, in accordance with the provisions of section 51-14, adopt rules for actions brought under this section and sections <em>47a-20 </em>and 47a-68, including the promulgation of a simplified form for bringing such actions.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b185-10\"> We note, however, that according to the act\u2019s legislative history, \u00a7 47a-14h is procedural in nature and is designed to balance the competing interests of tenants and landlords by both providing a simple method by which an individual tenant may enforce housing code violations and also protecting a landlord\u2019s interest in collecting rent by requiring a tenant who initiates such an action to deposit rent with the clerk of the court during the action\u2019s pendency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b185-11\"> We note also that in <em>Stangle </em>v. <em>Sullivan Trust, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford, Docket No. CV-02-0815108-S (August 18,2002) (33 Conn. L. Rptr. 31), the plaintiff argued that a common law cause of action for retaliatory eviction could be inferred from the strong policy against retaliatory evictions in Connecticut, evidenced by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47a-20 and 47a-33. The court, <em>Koletsky, J., </em>declined to recognize such a private cause of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b187-9\"> The court did not consider the other elements of the claims, having found insufficient evidence on the first element.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b187-10\"> \u201c[I]t is axiomatic that [w]e may affirm a proper result of the trial court for a different reason. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rudder </em>v. <em>Mamanasco Lake Park Assn., Inc., </em>93 Conn. App. 759, 768 n. 13, 890 A.2d 645 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b188-8\"> The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict with respect to the plaintiffs claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to prove <em>intent. </em>Intent, however, is not an element of the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress. Nevertheless, \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that [w]e may affirm a proper result of the trial court foradifferent reason.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rudder </em>v. <em>Mamanasco Lake Park Assn., Inc., </em>93 Conn.

Despite her argument on appeal, nowhere in count ten did the plaintiff allege a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 47a-20 or that each attempted proceeding was in retaliation for her complaints to the authorities. Rather, the complaint simply alleged that the actions were \u201cwithout legal right.\u201d We conclude that the complaint failed to set forth a prima facie case for abuse of process. Accordingly, judgment could not have been rendered in favor of the plaintiff on the complaint. See <em>Verraster v. Tynan, </em>152 Conn. 645, 648, 211 A.2d 150 (1965) (\u201cany judgment, to be adequate as such, must conform to the pleadings, the issues and the prayers for relief\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b193-13\"> The entire briefing of these claims provides: \u201cThe court erred in directing a verdict on the twelfth count for . . . violations of [General Statutes \u00a7] 47a-21 and the thirteenth count as [a] CUPTA violation: <em>Standard of Review: The </em>standard of review is essentially the same as for the other counts. The issue is a determination of damages. <em>Application of Standard to the Facts of the Case: </em>As indicated in the Statement of Facts, the defendant placed the security deposit of the plaintiff in an account in her name and her husband\u2019s name and in which they also kept their own funds. This created a risk to the funds.
