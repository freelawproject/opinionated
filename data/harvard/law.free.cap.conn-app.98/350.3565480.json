On appeal, the defendant raises several claims, all premised on his contention that probable cause to make the arrest is an element of the crime. The defendant argues that because the state failed to prove that the police officer who arrested him had probable cause to do so, there was insufficient evidence by which the jury could find him guilty. Because probable cause to arrest is <em>not </em>an element of the crime of interfering with a police officer, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On October 9, 2004, the defendant; his mother, Estelle Barfield; his sister, Metasha Wearing; and other members of the family were present at a home on Sherman Avenue in New Haven, which the defendant and his father had just purchased. The defendant and his sister had a volatile argument. The defendant first, and then his sister, telephoned for police assistance. The defendant wanted the police to remove his sister and her motor vehicle from the premises. David Runlett and Victor Fuentes, New Haven police officers, responded to the calls that were classified by the dispatcher as a domestic dispute. Runlett and Fuentes were dressed in uniform when they arrived in separate marked police vehicles. Because Runlett arrived first, he conducted the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>When Runlett arrived, the defendant was standing on the porch in front of the residence. The defendant appeared to be agitated and upset when Runlett briefly spoke to him. Runlett therefore went into the house to interview the defendant\u2019s mother and sister. The interviews lasted approximately ten minutes. On the basis of the interviews and his training and experience, Runlett determined that the defendant should be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">While Runlett was conducting the interviews, Fuentes spoke to the defendant. The defendant spoke in a boisterous manner and used profanity. Fuentes detected the odor of alcohol on the defendant\u2019s breath. The defendant\u2019s aunt came outside and tried to calm him. By the time Runlett had completed the interviews, the defendant was standing in the front yard near Fuentes. Runlett indicated to Fuentes by crossing his arms and nodding toward the defendant that he was going to arrest the defendant. Runlett approached the defendant from behind and told him that he was under arrest. Runlett asked the defendant if he had anything dangerous in his pockets. The officers patted down the defendant. Runlett then placed a handcuff on the defendant\u2019s left wrist. The defendant became rigid and stiffened his right arm when Runlett attempted to place the handcuff on that arm. The defendant ignored the officer\u2019s command to put his right arm behind his back. The defendant is taller than six feet, and Runlett is five feet, seven inches tall. Due to the differences in their size, Runlett was unable, even with Fuentes\u2019 assistance, to handcuff the defendant\u2019s right arm. For the safety of the defendant and themselves and in accordance with department policy, the officers attempted to put the defendant in a prone position. A further struggle ensued, and the defendant put Runlett in a head lock. The two officers and the defendant continued to struggle until Runlett was able to spray the defendant with pepper spray. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>officers then placed the defendant on the ground and secured the handcuff on the defendant\u2019s right arm. The defendant was arrested and charged with four crimes: threatening in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62, disorderly conduct in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182, assault on a public safety officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167c and interfering with an officer in violation of \u00a7 53a-167a.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The state amended the information before trial, dropping the threatening and disorderly conduct charges, and charging the defendant only with assault of a peace officer and interfering with an officer. During trial, the state did not present evidence as to why Runlett decided to arrest the defendant. At the charging conference, the defendant asked the court to instruct the jury that a police officer must have probable cause to make a warrantless arrest. The court did not include that instruction in its charge. After the court instructed the jury,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>counsel for the defendant asked the court to clarify its charge by adding that \u201cif you find that there is no fact upon which the officer could have . . . concluded there was probable cause, then you must acquit . . . .\u201d The court denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The defendant filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the state had failed to offer into evidence the specific facts on which the jury could conclude that Runlett had probable cause to believe that the defendant had committed a crime on October 9, 2004. The court reserved judgment on the motion for a judgment of acquittal. After the jury found the defendant not guilty of assault of a peace officer but guilty of interfering with an officer, the defendant renewed his motion for a judgment of acquittal. The court denied the motion. The defendant thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration and for articulation with respect to the motion for a judgment of acquittal after the verdict. In his motion for reconsideration, the defendant relied on <em>State </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>191 Conn. 433, 465 A.2d 323 (1983), overruled in part by <em>State </em>v. <em>Brocuglio, </em>264 Conn. 778, 786, 826 A.2d 145 (2003), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Brocuglio, </em>264 Conn. 778, 826 A.2d 145 (2003), in which our Supreme Court affirmed one\u2019s right to resist an unlawful entry into one\u2019s home. The trial court issued a memorandum of decision in which it denied the defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration, concluding that the defendant had called for police assistance and that there was no evidence of an unlawful entry into the defendant\u2019s home because the defendant\u2019s mother had permitted Runlett to enter.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>doubt that he was guilty of interfering with an officer because the state failed to prove that the officers had probable cause to arrest him, (2) the court improperly failed to charge the jury on an element of the crime of interfering with an officer and (3) the court improperly denied the motion for a judgment of acquittal. Underlying each of the defendant\u2019s claims is his contention that to act within the scope of his or her duty, an officer must have probable cause to make an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument requires us to construe \u00a7 53a-167a, which presents a question of law to which the plenary standard of review applies. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>75 Conn. App. 223, 232, 815 A.2d 242, cert. denied, 263 Conn. 914, 821 A.2d 769 (2003). On the basis of our plenary review, we conclude that \u00a7 53a-167a does not contain an element that a police officer have probable cause to make an arrest. Consequently, the state was not required to prove that Runlett had probable cause to arrest the defendant, and the court properly instructed the jury and denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of interfering with an officer when such person obstructs, resists, hinders or endangers any peace officer ... in the performance of such peace officer\u2019s . . . duties.\u201d The elements of the crime, therefore, are (1) a person obstructs, resists, hinders or endangers, (2) a peace officer, (3) while the officer is in the performance of his or her duties. \u201cSection 53a-167a is broad in scope . . . and encompasses acts of physical resistance. ... In enacting \u00a7 53a-167a, the legislature sought to prohibit behavior that hampers the activities of the police in the performance of their duties. . . . The statute\u2019s purpose is to ensure orderly compliance with the police during the performance of their duties; any act intended to thwart this purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>violates the statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>94 Conn. App. 722, 728, 894 A.2d 1008, cert. denied, 278 Conn. 912, 899 A.2d 39 (2006). Furthermore, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-23 provides that \u201c[a] person is not justified in using physical force to resist an arrest by a reasonably identifiable peace officer, whether such arrest is <em>legal or </em>illegal.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>Brocuglio, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 793-94, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 445, in which our Supreme Court held that \u00a7 53a-23 does not abrogate the common-law right to resist an unlawful entry into one\u2019s home, is misplaced. The court here found that there was no evidence of an illegal entry into the defendant\u2019s home. The defendant himself called for police assistance. When the police officers arrived, the defendant did not object to their presence or Runlett\u2019s entering the home to conduct an investigation. The officers clearly were acting in the performance of their duties. The defendant was standing outside the house when Runlett informed him that he was under arrest. The defendant then resisted the officer\u2019s efforts to arrest him and failed to obey Runlett\u2019s commands to cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\"> The court instructed the jury with respect to interfering with an officer as follows: \u201cFor you to find the defendant guilty of [interfering with an officer], the state must prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt. One, that the defendant obstructed, resisted, hindered or endangered a peace officer. Two, that the conduct of the defendant occurred while the peace officer was ... in the performance of such peace officer\u2019s duties .... And three, that the defendant intended to obstruct, resist, hinder or endanger a peace officer. . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">\u201c[A] peace officer means a member of an organized local police department. ... If you find that . . . Runlett was a peace officer, you will consider the elements of the crime, the other elements. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">\u201c[T]he state must have proved that the conduct of the defendant occurred while the peace officer was ... in the performance of such peace officer\u2019s duties .... The phrase, in the performance of his duties, means that the police officer is simply acting within the scope of what he is employed to do. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">\u201cThe phrase, in the performance of his official duties, means that Runlett must have been acting within the scope of what he is employed to do. A police officer has the duty to enforce the laws and to preserve the peace. Whether he is acting in the performance of his duty must be determined under a good faith belief that he is carrying out that duty and his actions are reasonably designed to that end ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-11\">\u201cThe phrase, in the performance of his official duties, means that the police officer is simply acting within the scope of what he is employed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>do. The test is whether the police officer is acting within that compass or is engaging in a personal frolic of his own.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b380-9\"> The state presented evidence that the defendant\u2019s mother resided in the home.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
