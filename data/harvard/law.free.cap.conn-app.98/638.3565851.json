On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly denied (1) his motion to dismiss and (2) his motion to disqualify or recuse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of the defendant\u2019s appeal. The defendant was charged by substitute information with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor on the basis of two separate urine tests that measured his blood alcohol content. James E. O\u2019Brien, the defendant\u2019s medical expert, submitted a letter dated August 17,2004, to the defendant, in which O\u2019Brien concluded that the urine tests were \u201cinvalid and bear no relationship to [the defendant\u2019s] blood alcohol level at the time in question. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He based his conclusion on his understanding that the defendant \u201chad not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>voided for a couple of hours before the first urine sample, nor did he void completely before giving the second urine sample.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">On September 16, 2004, a pretrial conference was held during which the parties and the court, <em>Driscoll, </em>J., discussed the results reached by O\u2019Brien in his letter regarding the accuracy of the urine tests\u2019 measure of blood alcohol content. The prosecutor indicated that she would have another toxicologist review the results and the opinions of O\u2019Brien. After discussing the issue, the parties established that if the state\u2019s toxicologist agreed with O\u2019Brien\u2019s assessment or suggested reasonable doubt, then the charge would be reduced to reckless driving. The prosecutor noted the agreement on the defendant\u2019s file.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">After reviewing the evaluation of Robert H. Powers, a forensic toxicologist, the state concluded that the experts were not in agreement and that Powers had not suggested that O\u2019Brien\u2019s letter would introduce reasonable doubt into the proceedings. Thereafter, the state put the matter on the firm trial list.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">On October 13, 2004, the defendant filed a motion to strike the matter from the firm trial list, claiming that the state was not honoring the agreement and that the case should be referred back to the court \u201cfor further [pretrial] proceedings.\u201d On October 27, 2004, the defendant filed motions to dismiss and to quash, and on November 2, 2004, he filed a motion to disqualify Judge Driscoll from sitting on the motions because there was \u201ca dispute of facts as to what was agreed upon in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>in-chambers judicial pretrial in this matter on September 16, 2004.\u201d The defendant concurrently filed an affidavit in support of his motions. At the conclusion of the November 2,2004 hearing, the court denied all of the defendant\u2019s motions. Thereafter, the defendant pleaded nolo contendere to the charge of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, pursuant to \u00a7 14-227a, with the express condition that he reserve his right to appeal. The defendant was sentenced on February 1, 2005, to three years imprisonment, execution suspended after one year mandatory, followed by three years probation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly denied his motion to dismiss. Specifically, he argues that Powers agreed with O\u2019Brien and suggested reasonable doubt; therefore, pursuant to the plea agreement inscribed on the file, the court should have granted his motion to dismiss. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was based entirely on the allegation that the state failed to honor the plea agreement. The court made findings regarding the parties\u2019 inteipretation of the agreement, which we analyze under the clearly erroneous standard of review. \u201c[T]o the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. ... In making this determination, every reasonable presumption must be given in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>96 Conn. App. 488, 493, 901 A.2d 59, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 913, 908 A.2d 541 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Powers testified during the November 2,2004 hearing that, although a urine sample was not as accurate as a blood sample or even a Breathalyzer test in determining blood alcohol content, a urine sample was \u201cnot so inaccurate as to be completely misleading .... [T]here is a greater potential for error, but it\u2019s not a yes-no type error.\u201d When asked whether he agreed with O\u2019Brien\u2019s opinion that the urine tests were invalid and bore no relationship to the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content at the time, Powers answered, \u201cI would not agree with that. ... I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any scientific basis for that conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">During cross-examination, the defendant\u2019s attorney consistently attempted to have Powers admit to the fact that the urine sample did not provide an accurate reflection of the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content because he had not completely voided prior to giving the samples. Powers answered, \u201cThat seems a reasonable statement, <em>assuming the underlying truth. . . . </em>I\u2019m not accepting it as fact, but I \u2014 I do not disagree with Dr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s conclusion <em>based on his acceptance of that hypothetical.'\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The court found that \u201cPowers has clearly indicated that there are problems that exist with urine tests .... What he also pointed out, though, was that the problems that are demonstrated in [O\u2019Brien\u2019s August 17, 2004 letter] are based on a wholesale acceptance of the defendant\u2019s factual recitation. That\u2019s something you\u2019re going to have to convince the jury of. There\u2019s nothing that says that the state has to accept the defendant\u2019s point of view of what did I drink, when did I last drink, when did I last void, how much did I eat, how much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>nonalcoholic intake did I have, other factors that might affect a urine sample. So, I think the state \u2014 based upon the report of Dr. Powers, the state is justified in saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to leave this up to a jury.\u2019 \u201d The court subsequently denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">A careful review of the record demonstrates that the court\u2019s factual findings in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss were not clearly erroneous. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s first claim fails.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is that the court improperly denied his motion to disqualify and recuse prior to ruling on his motion to dismiss. Specifically, he claims that a reasonable person would have questioned Judge Driscoll\u2019s impartiality because of his participation in the pretrial agreement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">Canon 3 (c) (1) (A) of the Code of Judicial Conduct provides in relevant part: \u201cA judge should disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might <em>reasonably </em>be questioned, including but not limited to instances where . . . the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>83 Conn. App. 142, 848 A.2d 1246, cert. denied, 270 Conn. 915, 853 A.2d 530 (2004), recently addressed our long accepted reasonable person standard. \u201c[Canon 3 (c) (1)] of the Code of Judicial Conduct requires a judge to disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned. The reasonableness standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>is an objective one. Thus, the question is not only whether the particular judge is, in fact, impartial but whether a reasonable person would question the judge\u2019s impartiality on the basis of all the circumstances. . . . Even in the absence of actual bias, a judge must disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, because the appearance and the existence of impartiality are both essential elements of a fair exercise of judicial authority.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The defendant\u2019s motion to disqualify and recuse asserted that Judge Driscoll should not have presided over the hearing on the motions to strike and to quash because there was \u201ca dispute of facts as to what was agreed upon in the in-chambers judicial pretrial in this matter on September 16, 2004.\u201d He further alleges that \u201c[i]t is reasonable to assume that when the two attorneys disagree over what the pretrial agreement was and how the pretrial agreement is to be executed, the judge may be biased because he may have been prejudiced by \u2018off the record\u2019 information.\u201d The court found that the agreement itself was \u201cquite clear.\u201d In denying the defendant\u2019s motion to disqualify and recuse, it stated that \u201cif there\u2019s an agreement, that\u2019s the agreement, that\u2019s what\u2019s being enforced.\u201d Our review of the record reveals that there was no dispute over the agreement itself, as it was memorialized on the cover of the file; see footnote 3; but rather, the dispute concerned whether Powers agreed with O\u2019Brien\u2019s opinion and whether Powers suggested reasonable doubt. This was the precise reason why Powers testified at the hearing. Letters that had been exchanged between counsel and sent to the court asserted a difference of opinion concerning whether the physicians agreed and whether Powers suggested reasonable doubt. The court heard testimony and found that the matter should proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>The fact that Judge Driscoll attended the pretrial hearing, during which the agreement was made,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and later presided over the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motions, does not lead a reasonable person to question his impartiality. Our review of the record reveals no bias against the defendant on the part of Judge Driscoll, nor does it raise a reasonable question concerning his impartiality. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 464, 680 A.2d 147 (1996), aff'd after remand, 252 Conn. 128, 750 A.2d 448, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 835, 121 S. Ct. 93, 148 L. Ed. 2d 53 (2000). The defendant\u2019s claim thus fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-9\"> The defendant\u2019s statement of issues also includes claims that the court improperly denied his motion to quash and improperly failed to enforce the plea agreement. Because these claims are subsumed in our discussion of the first two claims, we do not review them separately. See, e.g., <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Souto, </em>277 Conn. 829, 833 n.5, 896 A.2d 90 (2006); <em>Zhang </em>v. <em>Omnipoint Communications Enterprises, Inc., </em>272 Conn. 627, 630 n.3, 866 A.2d 588 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b666-10\"> The letter was submitted to the defendant, and its contents formed the crux of the defendant\u2019s arguments during the pretrial conference. In addition, it was attached to the defendant\u2019s affidavit in support of his motion to disqualify and recuse, and was marked as an exhibit for the November 2, 2004 hearing on the defendant\u2019s motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b667-9\"> The state\u2019s notation on the defendant\u2019s file folder was comprised of the following: \u201c9/16/04, judicial pretrial with Driscoll, Judge; [the prosecutor]; at which I conveyed state\u2019s offer and battle of expert. Where\u2019s our tox report? Continued for our report. [Forensic toxicologist Robert H.[ Powers to review their expert\u2019s report. If our expert agrees with the defendant\u2019s or suggests reasonable doubt, then reckless; [if] not, three one five. Starts and scheduled for trial with Dannehy, J. (Foley, J. has conflict with attorney).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b668-9\"> This was the defendant\u2019s third conviction under General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b670-10\"> The defendant also argues that the plea agreement was subject to contract law and was therefore enforceable. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Garvin, </em>242 Conn. 296, 314, 699 A.2d 921 (1997). Because neither the state nor the court addressed the potential unenforceability of the agreement as stated, the defendant\u2019s argument is unavailing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b672-11\"> In his reply brief, the defendant cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>39 Conn. App. 175, 664 A.2d 1153 (1995), for the proposition that \u201c[ajctive involvement by trial judges in plea negotiations has frequently been criticized. . . . This criticism is predicated on the dangers inherent in such activity. In the first place, judicial participation in plea negotiations is likely to impair the trial court\u2019s impartiality. The judge who suggests or encourages a particular plea bargain may feel a personal stake in the agreement (and in the quick disposition of the case made possible by the bargain) and may therefore resent the defendant who rejects his advice.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 180-81. The defendant suggests that the court \u201cnot only had an appearance of a stake in the outcome of the hearing, he had an affirmative stake in the outcome\u201d and that \u201cJudge Driscoll was the person who suggested the pretrial agreement.\u201d The defendant offered no evidence, and we are unaware of any, to show that either of these statements are true. Therefore, we do not address his auxiliary argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
