Zaleski, appeal from the summary judgment rendered by the trial court in favor of the plaintiff, J. Corda Construction, Inc., in an action to enforce a judgment by default that was rendered by a California court. The defendants claim that the trial court improperly (1) determined that they waived their right to litigate the issue of personal jurisdiction by failing to file a motion to quash the service of a summons in the California court, thereby precluding them from raising a challenge to the California court\u2019s jurisdiction in the present action, and (2) granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the California judgment is valid, final and entitled to full faith and credit in Connecticut courts. We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">This action arises out of the defendants\u2019 sale of an allegedly defective \u201cSnow-Guard\u201d system<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the plaintiff. The plaintiff initially brought an action against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>defendants in the Superior Court for Placer County, California,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in a three count complaint claiming breach of contract, breach of implied warranty and breach of express warranty. On April 27,2004, the California court found that \u201c[t]he defendants . . . [had] been regularly served with Summons by personal service . . . [and had] failed to appear and answer [the] plaintiffs\u2019 complaint within the time allowed by law . . . .\u201d Accordingly, the California court rendered a judgment by default against the defendants in the amount of $42,080.96.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">On February 8, 2005, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court against the defendants, seeking to enforce the California default judgment. On August 15, 2005, the defendants filed an answer and special defenses. In their answer, the defendants admitted that the plaintiff had recovered a judgment by default against them for failure to appear in the California action. The defendants further admitted that the California default judgment remained wholly unsatisfied. The defendants raised two special defenses, claiming first that they had neither entered into an agreement with the plaintiff nor sold the Snow-Guard system to the plaintiff, and, second, that the failure of the Snow-Guard system was not the result of a defect; rather, it was caused by the plaintiffs improper installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">On September 8, 2005, the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment accompanied by a supporting memorandum of law and a signed, sworn affidavit of Louis A. Basile, the attorney for the plaintiff in the California action. On September 9, 2005, the defendants filed an amended answer and special defenses. The defendants\u2019 first special defense was amended to allege that the defendants were not subject to the personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>jurisdiction of the California court and that the judgment by default, therefore, is void for lack of personal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The amended pleading also added a third special defense that alleged that the full faith and credit clause of the constitution of the United States, article four, \u00a7 1, does not apply to the California judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">On September 22,2005, the defendants filed an objection to the plaintiffs motion for summaiy judgment with a supporting memorandum of law accompanied by (1) copies of the contract, pleadings, summons and judgment by default in the California action, (2) two business inquiries from the Connecticut secretary of the state\u2019s web site, and (3) a signed and sworn affidavit of Zaleski. On September 30, 2005, the court issued a memorandum of decision granting the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment. The court found that because the defendants had failed to seek to quash the service of summons in the California court, they waived their right to litigate the issue of personal jurisdiction under California law and, therefore, were precluded from challenging the California, court\u2019s jurisdiction in the present action. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Before addressing the merits of the defendants\u2019 claims, we set forth the applicable standard of review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment. \u201cPursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-49, summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . . A litigant challenging the trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment is entitled to plenary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>review of the court\u2019s decision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Regents <em>of the University of California </em>v. <em>Golf Marketing, LLC, </em>92 Conn. App. 378, 380-81, 885 A.2d 201 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">With respect to the factual issues before the court on summary judgment, there is no dispute that the defendants were served with notice of the proceedings in California, had ample opportunity to defend the action in California and were aware that the California court had rendered a judgment by default against them. This case, therefore, presents the limited question of whether the defendants, having chosen to ignore the California proceedings entirely, effectively waived their right to attack the California court\u2019s jurisdiction over them collaterally in the plaintiffs action to enforce the California judgment in Connecticut. We find that the defendants\u2019 mere nonresponsiveness to the California action does not constitute a waiver in this circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The validity of the California judgment in Connecticut implicates the full faith and credit clause of the constitution of the United States, article four, \u00a7 1. See <em>Packer Plastics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Laundon, </em>214 Conn. 52, 55, 570 A.2d 687 (1990). \u201cAs a general principle, the full faith and credit clause of the United States constitution permits a creditor who has obtained a judgment in one state to enforce that judgment in this state. This principle is inapplicable, however, if the foreign judgment is a default judgment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rendered by a court that did not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>personal jurisdiction over the judgment debtor.\u201d <em>Business Alliance Capital Corp. </em>v. <em>Fuselier, </em>88 Conn. App. 731, 732-33, 871 A.2d 1051 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court has consistently held . . . that the judgment of another state must be presumed valid, and the burden of proving a lack of jurisdiction rests heavily upon the assailant. . . . Furthermore, the party attacking the judgment bears the burden of proof regardless of whether the judgment at issue was rendered after a full trial on the merits or after an ex parte proceeding. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Phoenix Leasing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kosinski, </em>47 Conn. App. 650, 652-53, 707 A.2d 314 (1998). In order to mount a successful collateral attack on the California judgment, the defendants must establish that the California judgment \u201cis void, not merely voidable. . . . Broadly stated, this would require proof of the lack of a legally organized court or tribunal; lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, the parties, or both; or want of power to grant the relief contained in the judgment.\u201d Id., 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Thus, \u201ca debtor who seeks to challenge the validity of a foreign judgment that has been registered properly in this state may do so only by raising [constitutionally permissible defenses . . . that destroy the full faith and credit obligation owed to a foreign judgment . . . . Such defenses include lack of personal jurisdiction or lack of due process.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Business Alliance Capital Corp. </em>v. <em>Fuselier, </em>supra, 88 Conn. App. 736-37. \u201cA party can therefore defend against the enforcement of a foreign judgment on the ground that the court that rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>the judgment lacked personal jurisdiction, <em>unless the jurisdictional issue was fully litigated before the rendering court or the defending party waived the right to litigate the issue.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Packer Plastics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Laundon, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\u201cTo determine whether a foreign court lacked jurisdiction, we look to the law of the foreign state.\u201d <em>Business Alliance Capital Corp. </em>v. <em>Fuselier, </em>supra, 88 Conn. App. 737. \u201c[U]nder California law, a party who seeks relief on any basis other than a motion to quash for lack of personal jurisdiction will be deemed to have made a general appearance and waived all objections to defects in service, process, or personal jurisdiction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Regents of the University of California </em>v. <em>Golf Marketing, LLC, </em>supra, 92 Conn. App. 381-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The court, in its memorandum of decision granting the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, applied Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 418.10 (a) (Deering 1991)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and determined that the defendants were required under California law to appear in California, and to seek to quash the service of summons on the ground of personal jurisdiction and had not done so. The court further noted that the defendants had not complied with Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 473 (b) (Deering 1995),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>requires a court to grant relief from a default resulting from a mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect, provided that relief is sought within six months after the judgment. On the basis of the court\u2019s interpretation of California law, the court determined that the defendants had waived their right to challenge the personal jurisdiction of the California court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u201c[I]t has long been the rule in California that a party waives any objection to the court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction when the party makes a general appearance in the action.\u201d <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>127 Cal. App. 4th 337, 341, 25 Cal. Rptr. 3d 488 (2005). A party in California will be held to have made a general appearance when that party answers the complaint or somehow invokes the authority of the court or makes an <em>affirmative act </em>such as propounding discovery, moving for summary judgment before filing an answer, or filing a motion to strike or demurrer unaccompanied by a motion to quash. See id.; see also 2 B. Witkin, California Procedure (4th Ed. 1996) Jurisdiction, Illustrations: Acts Constituting General Appearance \u00a7\u00a7 200-205.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Thus, although a motion to quash is the appropriate procedural vehicle for a party to raise an objection to the court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction in California,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a party\u2019s mere failure to appear and move to quash in California does not constitute a waiver, the effect of which would preclude that party from raising the issue as a collateral attack in a subsequent proceeding to enforce the judgment in Connecticut. To conclude otherwise is not only unsupported by California law, but it would place the onus on a Connecticut defendant, sued in California, to appear in California, and to endure the time and expense of litigating this jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>issue, even if that party believed that it had no minimum contacts with the state of California. Moreover, a rule mandating a party to litigate the issue of personal jurisdiction in California would serve to preclude that party from ever raising the issue in a subsequent action in Connecticut under the principles of res judicata. See <em>Nastro </em>v. <em>D\u2019Onofrio, </em>76 Conn. App. 814, 819, 822 A.2d 286 (2003) (\u201c[An out-of-state money] judgment may be set aside if it is jurisdictionally flawed because the foreign court lacked subject matter or personal jurisdiction over the defendant or if that jurisdiction resulted from an extrinsic fraud. . . . <em>Even as to questions of jurisdiction, however, the principles of res judicata bar further inquiry if those questions have been fully and fairly litigated and finally decided in the court which rendered the original </em>judgment.\u201d [Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.]); see also <em>Packer Plastics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Laundon, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 56 (defense of personal jurisdiction maybe raised <em>\u201cunless the jurisdictional issue was fully litigated before the rendering </em>court\u201d [emphasis added]). Such a conclusion runs directly counter to established full faith and credit jurisprudence that a party may raise lack of personal jurisdiction as a defense to challenge the validity of a foreign court\u2019s judgment. See <em>Business Alliance Capital Corp. </em>v. <em>Fuselier, </em>supra, 88 Conn. App. 737 (defenses that destroy full faith and credit obligation owed to foreign judgment include lack of personal jurisdiction and lack of due process); see also <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>329 U.S. 545, 550-52, 67 S. Ct. 451, 91 L. Ed. 488 (1947) (holding that default judgments entitled to full faith and credit <em>absent finding of lack of jurisdiction of rendering court).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Thus, in order to waive objection to the California court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction under California law, the defendants must have made a general appearance, which requires that the defendants answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the complaint or somehow invoke the authority of the California court on their behalf or affirmatively seek relief. See <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra, 127 Cal. App. 4th 341 (defendant concedes jurisdiction of court \u201cif he invokes the authority of the court on his behalf, or affirmatively seeks relief\u2019). Here, unlike the situation in which a judgment debtor had already affirmatively sought relief from the foreign court,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it is undisputed that the defendants were completely inactive in the state of California and made no attempt to invoke the authority of the court in California in any way. Under California law, the defendants\u2019 mere inaction does not constitute a waiver. Accordingly, we hold that because the defendants did not make a general appearance before the California court, they should not have been precluded from challenging the California court\u2019s jurisdiction in the present action. The trial court, therefore, improperly rendered summary judgment, as genuine issues of material fact remain with respect to whether the California court had personal jurisdiction over the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Finally, the plaintiff urges us to affirm the court\u2019s judgment on alternate grounds, namely, that the defendants failed to move to dismiss the present action and failed to plead lack of personal jurisdiction as a special defense. With respect to the defendants\u2019 failure to move to dismiss the action on jurisdictional grounds, we note that the defendants seek to challenge collaterally the California court\u2019s jurisdiction and not the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction. As such, the defendants were not required to raise this issue in a motion to dismiss. See, e.g., <em>Regents of the University of California </em>v. <em>Golf Marketing, LLC, </em>supra, 92 Conn. App. 379 (judgment creditor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>raised issue of foreign court\u2019s personal jurisdiction in response to plaintiffs summary judgment motion). With respect to the defendants\u2019 alleged failure to plead lack of personal jurisdiction as a special defense, we note that on September 9, 2005, the defendants filed an amended answer and special defenses in which they raised the issue of personal jurisdiction. The plaintiff filed no objection to this pleading, thereby consenting to the amendments. See Practice Book \u00a7 10-60.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, the defendants raised the issue of personal jurisdiction and minimum contacts in their memorandum of law in opposition to the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and at oral argument on the motion. These claims, therefore, are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-11\"> As alleged in the California complaint, \u201cSnow-Guard\u201d is a design and system for the even distribution of snow weight and prevention of snow overloading in gutters for roofs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-7\"> Brian Daniels, doing business as Daniels Roofing Co., also was aplaintiff in the California action. He is not a party to the present action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\"> In the amended first special defense, the defendants allege that the Snow-Guard system was not sold to the plaintiff by either of the named defendants, rather, it was sold to the plaintiff by \u201cZaleski Snow-Guards &amp; Roofing Specialties, Inc.\u201d As such, the court interpreted the gravamen of the defendants\u2019 personal jurisdiction challenge to relate to this misnomer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\"> In the present case, the plaintiff elected to enforce the California judgment in this state by an action on the judgment instead of by utilizing the procedures set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-604.
