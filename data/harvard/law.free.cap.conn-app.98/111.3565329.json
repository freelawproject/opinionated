On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly concluded that he did not complete the program satisfactorily because it (1) based its decision solely on hearsay information that indicated he had been arrested for an identical offense during his probationary period and (2) did not afford him an adversarial hearing before terminating his participation in the program. We conclude that the court properly refused to grant the motion to dismiss because it reasonably concluded that it could not make a finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>the defendant satisfactorily completed his period of probation. We also conclude that the court improperly terminated the defendant\u2019s accelerated rehabilitation status on the sole basis of his subsequent arrest for an identical offense. Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The relevant facts are undisputed. On May 23, 2003, the defendant was arrested in North Haven and charged with promoting prostitution in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-87. The defendant applied for admission to the accelerated pretrial rehabilitation program, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56e, and the court granted his application on June 24, 2003. He was placed on pretrial probation for a period of two years without any special conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">At some time during that probationary period, an undated letter from Jane Driscoll, a probation officer with the court support services division, was sent to the office of the state\u2019s attorney in Meriden. The letter indicated that the defendant had been arrested in Windsor on November 12, 2003, and charged with the crime of promoting prostitution in the second degree. No action was taken by the state to terminate the defendant\u2019s participation in the accelerated pretrial rehabilitation program at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">On June 27, 2005, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the first charge against him, claiming that his two year period of pretrial probation had expired and that he had not been convicted of any subsequent crime during that period. The court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss on July 7, 2005. At that hearing, the state made an oral motion to terminate the defendant\u2019s accelerated rehabilitation status due to his arrest in November, 2003. Counsel for the defendant indicated that it was \u201cquite likely\u201d that the second charge would be nolled, and he requested a continuance until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>disposition was determined. The state responded that the defendant already had rejected a plea offer, that the offer had been withdrawn and that the case had been placed on the firm jury list.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After being apprised that the second charge was identical to the charge for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>which the defendant had been placed on pretrial probation, the court indicated that it was terminating the defendant\u2019s accelerated rehabilitation status. The court determined that there had been no successful completion of the program and, on that basis, refused to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges arising from his first arrest. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 54-56e, establishes a discretionary pretrial diversionary program in certain criminal cases. It suspends criminal prosecution for a stated period of time subject to such conditions as the court shall order. If the defendant satisfactorily completes the probationary period he may then apply to the court for dismissal of the charges lodged against him. The main thrust of the statute is suspension of prosecution. . . . The only right that the defendant acquires by the granting of a motion for accelerated rehabilitation is the right to a dismissal of the underlying criminal charge if the defendant satisfactorily completes the period of pretrial probation imposed.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Trahan, </em>45 Conn. App. 722, 734, 697 A.2d 1153, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 924, 701 A.2d 660 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Pursuant to the statute, the court in its discretion may grant an application for accelerated rehabilitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>if it believes the accused probably will not offend in the future and if the accused has no previous record of a criminal conviction. \u201cAccelerated rehabilitation is not a right at all. It is a statutory alternative to the traditional course of prosecution available for some defendants and totally dependent upon the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Satti, </em>2 Conn. App. 219, 224, 477 A.2d 144 (1984). In essence, \u201cthe legislature has declared [an accused] a worthy candidate for a second chance.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>194 Conn. 650, 658, 485 A.2d 139 (1984). \u201cThe purpose of probation is to afford a period during which a penitent offender may be assisted in rehabilitation. . . . Probation is designed to assure that the probation serves as a period of genuine rehabilitation and that the community is not harmed by the probationer\u2019s being at large.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Trahan, </em>supra, 45 Conn. App. 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charge against him, claiming that his two year period of pretrial probation had expired and that he had not been convicted of any subsequent crime during that period. Pursuant to \u00a7 54-56e, the court is required to dismiss such charge if it finds that the defendant has satisfactorily completed his period of probation. The court was unable to make such a finding. The defendant had been arrested, during his period of probation, and charged with an identical offense. Apparently, a letter from a probation officer with the court support services division was sent to the office of the state\u2019s attorney in Meriden, advising the state of the defendant\u2019s subsequent arrest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Counsel for the defendant did not dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>that arrest and, in fact, at the hearing on the motion to dismiss, indicated that he thought the charge would be nolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The court determined that the outstanding arrest prevented it from making a finding that the defendant had completed his probation satisfactorily. Under those circumstances, the court properly refused to grant the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The court then used the fact of the defendant\u2019s subsequent arrest as a basis for terminating his accelerated rehabilitation status. We focus on the fact that the only information provided to the court was that the defendant had been arrested. No other documentation or testimony relative to that arrest was submitted. Here, then, the determinative issue is whether the mere arrest of the defendant, without more, is a sufficient ground for the court to terminate his pretrial probationary status. We conclude that it was not and, for that reason, reverse that part of the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">In doing so, we preliminarily address and reject the defendant\u2019s argument that pretrial probation defendants and postconviction probation defendants enjoy the same rights in termination proceedings. Citing the postconviction cases, <em>State </em>v. <em>Deptula, </em>34 Conn. App. 1, 639 A.2d 1049 (1994), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>9 Conn. App. 59, 514 A.2d 394, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 811, 516 A.2d 886 (1986), the defendant claims that the underlying charge must be dismissed because the state failed to initiate termination proceedings within his two year probationary period. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">Pretrial probation and postconviction probation differ significantly in two respects. First, postconviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>probation is part of a convicted defendant\u2019s sentence, whereas pretrial accelerated rehabilitation probation suspends criminal prosecution for a stated period of time subject to such conditions as ordered by the court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Trahan, </em>supra, 45 Conn. App. 734. When a court revokes a defendant\u2019s postconviction probation, that defendant faces incarceration. Because the defendant is being deprived of a liberty right, the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment imposes certain procedural and substantive limits. <em>State </em>v. <em>Deptula, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 8. A defendant in the accelerated rehabilitation program, however, has been granted \u201ca second chance\u201d at the discretion of the trial court. If that defendant fails to complete the program satisfactorily, the suspension of the criminal prosecution may be terminated and he or she faces a trial with all of its attendant constitutional guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Second, the statutes governing the termination of pretrial probation and postconviction probation are not the same and contain significantly different provisions. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 sets forth the procedures for revoking postconviction probation for a defendant\u2019s violation of any of the conditions of his or her probation. That statute specifically provides that any warrant for the arrest of the defendant for a violation of the conditions of probation is to be issued \u201cduring the period of probation . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 (a). Upon the arrest, \u201cthe court shall cause the defendant to be brought before it without unnecessary delay for a hearing on the violation charges. ...\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 (a). If the violation is established, the court, as one of its options, may revoke the defendant\u2019s probation and require the defendant to serve the sentence imposed or the court may impose any lesser sentence. \u201cNo such revocation shall be ordered, except upon consideration of the whole record and unless such violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>is established by the introduction of reliable and probative evidence and by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 (b). In interpreting that statute, this court has determined that a defendant must be served personally with a notice to appear or issued a warrant for his arrest for violation of the conditions of probation <em>during </em>the period of probation. If that procedure is not followed, any resulting revocation is invalid. The probation expires at the end of that period. <em>State </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>supra, 9 Conn. App. 71-73. \u201cOnce a sentence has been fully served, it may not be increased.\u201d Id., 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The provisions of \u00a7 54-56e govern admittance to, participation in and termination from the accelerated pretrial rehabilitation program. Unlike \u00a7 53a-32, there is no requirement that termination proceedings be initiated during the period of probation or that a hearing be scheduled on the violation charges. Significantly, in order to have the underlying charge dismissed, subsection (f) of \u00a7 54-56e provides that the court must make a finding that there has been a \u201csatisfactory completion\u201d of the defendant\u2019s period of probation: \u201cIf a defendant released to the custody of the Court Support Services Division satisfactorily completes such defendant\u2019s period of probation, such defendant may apply for dismissal of the charges against such defendant and the court, on finding such satisfactory completion, shall dismiss such charges. If the defendant does not apply for dismissal of the charges against such defendant after satisfactorily completing such defendant\u2019s period of probation, the court, upon receipt of a report submitted by the Court Support Services Division that the defendant satisfactorily completed such defendant\u2019s period of probation, may on its own motion make a finding of such satisfactory completion and dismiss such charges. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-56e (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Accelerated rehabilitation probation is unlike a sentence that simply expires at the end of the designated period. The court must act affirmatively by making a finding of satisfactory completion of the program in order to dismiss the charges against the defendant. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim that the underlying charge must be dismissed because the state failed to initiate proceedings to terminate his accelerated rehabilitation status within his two year period of probation must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">We do agree, however, with the defendant\u2019s claim that his arrest during the probationary period, without more, is insufficient to terminate his participation in the program. Although we recognize that we are not bound by <em>State </em>v. Barnes, 37 Conn. Sup. 853, 439 A.2d 456 (1981), we find it persuasive. In <em>Barnes, </em>the defendant had been arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit larceny in the fourth degree. The defendant\u2019s application for accelerated rehabilitation was granted by the court, and a probation period of one year was imposed. During that period, the defendant again was arrested and charged with larceny in the fourth degree. At a hearing held to determine whether the defendant had completed his probationary period successfully, the defendant\u2019s probation officer testified, and a probation report was admitted into evidence noting the subsequent arrest. At the time of the hearing, the defendant had not been convicted of any criminal offense, and there was no claim that he had violated any specific conditions of his probation. The trial court rescinded the defendant\u2019s accelerated rehabilitation status for failure to complete his term of probation successfully under the program. Id., 853-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The defendant appealed from that decision to the Appellate Session of the Superior Court, claiming that mere proof of his arrest on an undisposed charge was not sufficient to revoke his participation in the program. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>In its opinion, the court first noted that \u00a7 54-56e contains no guidelines by which to determine what constitutes a satisfactoiy completion of probation. Id., 855-57. The court concluded that the general conditions of probation set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-30 (a) apply with equal force to both pretrial and postconviction probation. Id., 857 n.3. This court has cited <em>Barnes </em>with approval as to that conclusion and has held that \u201c[w]hile the trial court may impose additional conditions of probation . . . the defendant must comply with the general conditions of probation as set out in ... \u00a7 53a-30.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Trahan, </em>supra, 45 Conn. App. 734-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In <em>Barnes, </em>as in the present case, only subdivision (7) of \u00a7 53a-30 (a) is relevant. That subdivision requires a defendant on probation to \u201crefrain from violating any criminal law of the United States, this state or any other state . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-30 (a) (7). Accordingly, \u201cthe pivotal issue ... is whether mere arrest on undisposed charges provides a sufficient base from which to conclude that the defendant violated a criminal law.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>supra, 37 Conn. Sup. 858. In making such a determination, the court in <em>Barnes </em>noted, and we agree, that even though the evidence of the defendant\u2019s arrest was hearsay, it nevertheless was admissible. \u201cBecause hearings of this nature-are not full adversary proceedings and tend to be less formal, strict rules of evidence do not apply. . . . Thus, hearsay evidence which is both supported and reliable is fully admissible and available to the court when rendering its decision. . . . Moreover, where ... as here, the content of the hearsay testimony was admitted without objection, it became and remains evidence in the case, subject, of course, to any infirmative suggestions due to its inherent weakness.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Nevertheless, the court in <em>Barnes </em>concluded that the mere arrest of the defendant, without more, is an insufficient ground for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>revoking the defendant\u2019s eligibility for the dismissal of charges pursuant to the accelerated rehabilitation program. We agree and adopt that court\u2019s well reasoned decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Here, the defendant was arrested and charged with promoting prostitution in the second degree during his period of probation. That case was still pending at the time the court terminated the defendant\u2019s accelerated rehabilitation status. The basis for that termination was the undisposed charge. Other than the fact that the defendant had been arrested and charged with a crime identical to the underlying charge for which he sought dismissal, the court had no evidence or information before it concerning the second arrest and charge. On the facts of this case,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we conclude that the fact of an arrest, without more, was an insufficient basis for the court to determine by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had \u201cviolat[ed] any criminal law\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-30 (a) (7); in order to terminate the probation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>The judgment is reversed only as to the termination of the defendant\u2019s participation in the accelerated rehabilitation program. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.* *<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">In this opinion DiPENTIMA, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-56e (f) authorizes an appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss the charges against a defendant who has completed such defendant\u2019s period of probation or supervision or terminating the participation of a defendant in such program, thus, in effect, overruling the rule in <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>194 Conn. 650, 659, 485 A.2d 139 (1984), that an order terminating a defendant\u2019s participation in an accelerated rehabilitation program is not a final appealable judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b140-6\"> The transcript of the hearing on July 7, 2005, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">\u201c[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Good morning, Your Honor, we have one matter on the firm jury list that was continued one day from yesterday.

Although the transcript of the July 7,2005 hearing is ambiguous as to whether the plea discussion refers to this case or the case pending in Enfield, there is nothing in the record to show any court action terminating the accelerated rehabilitation. It would be unlikely that the state would move to terminate the accelerated rehabilitation on July 7 if it had already done so.

See General Statutes \u00a7 54-56e. The majority cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>278 Conn. 1, 895 A.2d 771 (2006), as supporting this proposition. In <em>Stevens, </em>however, our Supreme Court noted in upholding an enhanced sentence that the trial court had found probable cause to support the defendant\u2019s arrest and that the defendant did not dispute the fact that she had been arrested, she did not dispute that there was probable cause for her arrest, nor did the record reflect that she had challenged the veracity of the state\u2019s allegations regarding her criminal behavior. Id., 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>In this case, while he was a participant in the accelerated rehabilitation program, the defendant was arrested in Windsor on November 12, 2003, and those charges were still pending as of June, 2005, not having been dismissed or nolled. The defendant also did not dispute his arrest, probable cause for that arrest or challenge the state\u2019s allegation regarding the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">When the defendant\u2019s accelerated rehabilitation status was terminated, defense counsel only took exception and did not request a hearing. Justice Norcott, in his concurrence in <em>Stevens, </em>after concluding that the rule of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Berbary, </em>340 F.3d 63 (2d Cir. 2003) (requiring state to establish conditions for enhancing plea bargained sentence by preponderance of evidence), was not met, noted that the <em>Stevens </em>defendant, as in this case, did not contest the factual basis for the arrest. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 28 <em>(Norcott, J., </em>concurring).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">I would conclude that requiring this defendant to face trial for promoting prostitution because of his subsequent arrest on the same charge while on pretrial probation, in the circumstances, was proper.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-8\"> In footnote 1 of the majority opinion and in the majority opinion itself, the majority, on the issue of notice, states that no action was taken until July, 2005, to terminate the defendant\u2019s accelerated rehabilitation status. The record in this case reveals that while he was on accelerated rehabilitation, the defendant entered a plea of not guilty on September 22, 2004, and the prosecutor in this case indicated, without dispute, that a plea bargain was offered on December 17, 2004, and rejected and withdrawn on January 21, 2005. The case was then placed on the firm jury trial list. The record also reflects that on June 27, 2005, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charge under the accelerated pretrial rehabilitation program. Under these circumstances, I would conclude, to the contrary, that the defendant had prior notice that the state would move to terminate accelerated rehabilitation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
