Plaintiff homeowners association complained that the \u201cdishes\u201d violate a restrictive covenant that applies to all of the homes in the development, and the trial court agreed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The restrictive covenant to which defendant\u2019s property is subject provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">\u201cNo dwelling house, garage, fence, wall or other structures * * * shall be erected or constructed * * * unless a complete set of plans and specifications therefor * * * shall have been submitted to and approved by the homeowners association * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Defendants placed \u201csatellite dishes\u201d on each of their properties without submitting, a plan for approval. They argue that they are not \u201cother structures\u201d for purposes of the restrictive covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Although the term \u201cstructure\u201d is not defined, the declaration of restrictions includes numerous provisions which limit the owners\u2019 uses of the property to those consistent with the residential nature of the development. Article III, section D provides that \u201c[nothing] shall * * * be done or maintained [on the property] which may be or become an annoyance or nuisance to the neighborhood or detract from its value as a high class residential neighborhood.\u201d Article VI, section A, which includes the language at issue here, provides that approval of a plan for a proposed structure may be withheld, not only for noncompliance with the restrictions, but also if, in the judgment of the homeowners association, the proposed structure is \u201cinharmonious with the general plan of improvement\u201d or \u201cwith the structures erected on other building sites in the immediate vicinity\u201d of the site on which the proposed structure is to be built.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">On <em>de novo </em>review, we agree with the trial court that the term \u201cother structures\u201d includes \u201csatellite dishes\u201d of the type erected here, which are eight and one-half and ten feet in diameter and are bolted to concrete bases. Because they were erected without approval from plaintiff, we affirm the trial court\u2019s injunction requiring defendants to remove them.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
