The Board reopened the claim, on which aggravation rights had expired, on its own motion, without expressly finding that there had been a worsening of the compensated condition. The Board, on its own motion, is not authorized to award such benefits without that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">On <em>de novo </em>review, we find that claimant has shown that he has suffered a worsening of his compensable condition and that the Board correctly reopened the claim, thereby authorizing the award of temporary total disability. <em>See Gwynn v.
