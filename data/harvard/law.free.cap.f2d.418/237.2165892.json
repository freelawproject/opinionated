His petition does not challenge this Texas conviction. Instead, it challenges seven sentences imposed upon Rodgers by various Louisiana state courts between 1949 and 1954. Since neither the State of Louisiana nor its officials acting in their official capacities are subject to service of process in Texas, the District Judge properly dismissed Rodgers\u2019 petition. <em>See </em>Word v. North Carolina, 4 Cir., 1969, 406 F.2d 352, 357 (en banc). Habeas corpus relief from whatever restrictions are imposed upon Rodgers by the Louisiana sentences is not obtainable in a court lacking jurisdiction to issue the writ. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-16\">. We have concluded on the merits that this case is of the character that does not justify oral argument. Therefore, we have directed the Clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties thereof in writing. 5 Cir.R. 18; <em>see </em>Huth v. Southern Pacific Company, 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 526, Part I [No. 27439, October 7]; Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 804, 805-808.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
