Leopold, was convicted in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland of violating the mail fraud statute, 18 U.S. C. \u00a7 1341. Leopold hired a mailing service to send in November 1966 solicitation forms for listings in a \u201cClassified Directory\u201d to businesses all over the United States. The trial jury concluded that these forms were designed and intended to be interpreted by unwary recipients as bills for previously purchased listings in the classified yellow pages of local telephone directories. Several witnesses testified that they paid the amount stated on the form under this misapprehension. \u201cThe forms were designed and used in such manner that they would not be read closely and would thus ensnare and deceive,\u201d as were the forms involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>in Linden v. United States, 254 F.2d 560, 568 (4th Cir. 1958). The facts here are substantially similar to those in <em>Linden. </em>Indeed, the schemes in both cases were based on the premise that a significant number of business people would fail to differentiate between a \u201cClassified Directory\u201d and the classified section of their telephone directory when confronted with a solicitation form calculated to have the appearance of a bill. We have considered the several assignments of error and conclude they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
