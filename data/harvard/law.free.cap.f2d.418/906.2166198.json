(\u201cPier 8\u201d), brought this suit in admiralty for damages to compensate him for injuries suffered on September 20, 1963, when some stacked bags of coffee fell upon him while he was sweeping the floor of a warehouse on the pier where the bags were stored after being unloaded from the motor vessel <em>Lia </em>on either September 17 or 18, 1963. Judge Mansfield granted a motion for summary judgment by defendant International Terminal Operating Co., Inc. (\u201cI.T.O.\u201d), on the ground that there was no federal jurisdiction under any of the theories advanced by plaintiff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-18\">The record before us indicates that I.T.O. actually unloaded the ship and stacked the bags of coffee. In the briefs on appeal and at oral argument, it came to our attention that Judge Mansfield\u2019s opinion and order granting the motion for summary judgment, reported at 294 F.Supp. 736 (S.D.N.Y.1968), proceeds on the assumption that plaintiff was claiming to be a third-party beneficiary of a written contract between I.T. 0. and Brodin Line, the shipper which operated the <em>Lia. </em>From statements by counsel upon argument of the appeal, it appears that plaintiff\u2019s employer, Pier 8, had the stevedoring contract with Bro-din Line. However, the unloading work by I.T.O. was presumably done pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>to some contractual relationship \u2014 oral or written \u2014 between I.T.O. and Pier 8. Since Judge Mansfield had no evidence about this relationship before him, and since there is no evidence about it before us, we find it necessary to remand the case for further proceedings to establish the exact nature of the arrangement between I.T.O. and Pier 8 and for a re-examination of the question of federal jurisdiction in light of that relationship. When the parties have presented evidence on these questions, Judge Mansfield will be able to pass upon the relevance of these facts to plaintiff\u2019s claim and defendant\u2019s assertion that there is no federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">It is clear that the parties are responsible for the misunderstanding of the facts by the district court. I.T.O.\u2019s memorandum of law in support of its motion for summary judgment did not discuss the contractual relationship between any of the several parties. Di~ Paola\u2019s opposing memorandum of law alleged two bases for admiralty jurisdiction: (1) that the tort was a maritime tort; and (2) that I.T.O., as \u201cagents of the vessel,\u201d breached \u201ca maritime contract entered into by it.\u201d Defendant I. T.O.\u2019s reply memorandum of law did not deny the existence of such contract; I. T.O. made no effort to present to the district court an accurate picture of the contractual arrangements involved. Rather, I.T.O. argued that \u201c[j]urisdiction in admiralty. is not present because of remoteness of time and place.\u201d Several statements in Brodin Line\u2019s papers undoubtedly contributed to the confusion. The Brodin Line answer first set forth the fact that there was a written contract, dated August 29, 1968, between Brodin Line and Pier 8. However, the answer also stated that DiPaola\u2019s injuries were \u201cdue to the breach by [I.T.O.] of its warranty to defendants sued herein as Brodin Line, that said work would be carried on in a proper and workmanlike manner.\u201d The Bro-din Line pretrial memorandum alleged that both I.T.O. and Pier 8 \u201cwere guilty of breaches of contractual obligations owing to [Brodin Line] in connection with their services at Pier 8 * * The same memorandum also stated that Brodin Line would introduce in evidence a \u201cBerthing agreement between defendants and third-party plaintiffs (presumably, Brodin Line) and third-party defendant, Pier 8\u201d; a \u201cStevedoring contract,\u201d the parties to which were unspecified; and the \u201cStevedoring bills and work records of\u201d I.T.O.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">Moreover, several other pretrial memoranda \u2014 notably those of plaintiff DiPaola, third-party plaintiff Japan Line, and I.T.O. \u2014 indicated that any and all contracts between the parties would be introduced in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">Thus, the parties failed to present a complete and accurate record to the district court. Under these circumstances we think we should remand for such further proceedings as the district court may deem appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">Remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-12\">. DiPaola\u2019s original action was predicated on diversity of citizenship. However, it soon developed that both I.T.O. and DiPaola resided in New York, and the parties stipulated in a pretrial order that DiPaola\u2019s complaint would be deemed amended \u201cto include a statement that the matters and things therein alleged set forth a claim for relief within the Admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction of this Court within the meaning of Rule 9(h), F.R.C.P.\u201d Of course, as Judge Mansfield held, this stipulation by I.T.O. did not constitute a waiver of its right to object that there was no admiralty jurisdiction.
