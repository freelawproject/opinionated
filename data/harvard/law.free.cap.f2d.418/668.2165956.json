His suit is foreclosed by a final judgment on the merits rendered by a California court with jurisdiction of the cause upholding the validity of appellees' order. It is immaterial whether or not the constitutional issues were actually litigated in appellant\u2019s state court action, because we are here concerned with the application of that branch of the res judicata doctrine known as bar and not with the branch called collateral estoppel. \u201cA final judgment on the merits between parties who in law are the same operates as a bar to a subsequent action upon the same cause of action, settling not only every issue that was raised, but also every issue that might have been raised in the first action.\u201d Olwell v. Hopkins (1946) 28 Cal.2d 147, 152, 168 P.2d 972. (Accord: Parker v. Westover (9th Cir. 1955) 221 F.2d 603; Lester v. National Broadcasting Co., Inc. (9th Cir. 1954) 217 F.2d 399, cert. denied (1955) 348 U.S. 954, 75 S.Ct. 444, 99 L.Ed. 746.) Appellant\u2019s state and federal actions are based on the same claimed wrong, suspension of his license, and the parties to both are identical. Appellant is not permitted to fragment a single cause of action and to litigate' piecemeal the issues which could have been resolved in one action.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-20\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
