The Clerk of the Court, believing that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1923(c) still applies, would limit the costs for the printing of the brief as provided in said section to $75 whereas the amount actually paid for printing of appellees\u2019 brief is $889.09. Under the new Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, effective July 1, 1968, the subject of costs is covered by Rule 39. Rule 39(c) provides as taxable cost:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-22\">\u201cThe cost of printing or otherwise producing necessary copies of briefs, appendices, or copies of records *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-23\">The Enabling Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072) which empowered the Supreme Court to promulgate the new Rules provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-24\">\u201cAll laws in conflict with such rules shall be of no further force and effect after such rules [take] effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-25\">It would thus appear that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1923(c) has been superseded by Rule 39(c). Therefore, Section 1923 no longer applies and we must look to Rule 39(c) for the awarding of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-26\">Appellees\u2019 bill of costs is allowed in full as authorized by Rule 39.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
