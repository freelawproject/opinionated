See Rule 18 of the Rules of this Court and Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">This is an appeal from summary judgment granted in favor of the appellee, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso). Reames Well Service, a sole proprietorship of S. E. Reames (Reames), sought to recover from appellee $174,214.19 for damage done to one of its well servicing workover units and associated surface equipment. The property damage resulted from a fire and explosion which occurred on November 28, 1966, on El Paso\u2019s property referred to in the record as Mudge # 4, in San Juan County, New Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">On September 30, 1966, appellant Reames and appellee El Paso entered into a written contract in which Reames agreed to perform well service work for El Paso. Reames further agreed that it would have no cause of action against El Paso for damage to its workover unit and other surface equipment, regardless of who caused such damage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Paragraph 10 of the contract expressly covered damage by fire to the rig and equipment of Reames. Reames agreed to assume the risk and replace fire loss without cost to the appellee El Paso, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-14\">\u201c10. If oil and/or gas is encountered in sufficient quantities to endanger the rig, material, equipment or persons engaged in drilling said well, or their persons, Contractor shall assume the risk thereof, and, at its expense, remove and connect at a safe distance any boilers, fires, or other equipment or appurtenances which might constitute a hazard. If the rig shall be damaged by fire, or otherwise, Contractor shall replace the loss thereby without cost to the Company. In any case, Company shall not be liable to Contractor for delay pending replacement of the material and equipment destroyed, or for any damage to or loss of Contractor\u2019s property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-15\">After this day work agreement of September 30, 1966, was executed, whenever further well service work was needed on any of El Paso\u2019s wells other than the well described in that contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>the practice of the parties was to amend the contract by execution of a separate letter agreement as to each additional well. The purpose was to insure that all the services by Reames on El Paso\u2019s wells would be subject to the terms and provisions of the September 30, 1966 master contract. Other than providing that the additional well service work would be performed subject to the September 30, 1966 agreement, the letter agreements covering the additional wells made no changes in the basic terms and provisions of the master contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Normally, during the course of operations, the September 30, 1966 contract was amended prior to any work being done on a new well. However, in the present situation, i. e. Mudge # 4, a separate letter agreement was not sent to Reames until December 8, 1966, and Reames had already started its plugging and abandoning operations on November 27, 1966. The fire and explosion occurred on November 28, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The sole issue on appeal is whether or not the district court erred in holding as a matter of law that the parties intended the December 8, 1966 letter agreement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to make the provisions of the September 30, 1966 contract effective on November 25, 1966. Reames contends that the district court erred in holding that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that El Paso was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We agree with the district court that it is plain from the face of the December 8 letter agreement that the parties invoked the terms of the September 30 master con-</p>\n<p id=\"ARl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>tract, effective November 25, 1966. Mr. S. E. Reames\u2019 deposition testimony indicates that he read and accepted all the terms of the December 8, 1966 letter for the appellant and that he knew it applied to Mudge # 4.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Appellant\u2019s awareness of its obligations as to Mudge # 4 under the December 8, 1966 separate letter agreement is further verified by the affidavit of Dugan H. Pearce, Chief Clerk for El Paso at Farmington, New Mexico, filed in support of the motion for summary judgment. Rule 56, F.R.Civ.P. was properly invoked here. Wier v. Texas, 5 Cir. 1950, 180 F.2d 465, 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The remaining issues raised by appellant are so without merit that they do not require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-10\">.
