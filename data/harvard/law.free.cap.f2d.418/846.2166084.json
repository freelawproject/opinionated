Of these, at least one was seated inside the bar of the court behind defendants, and one was seated near the main entrance to the courtroom. Since defendants were not on bail, were serving sentences for other convictions, and were being tried for escape, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the district judge in this conduct. To do less would have been to take unnecessary risks and to endanger unduly spectators, those participating in the trial and the public generally. O\u2019Dell v. Hudspeth, 189 F.2d 300 (10 Cir. 1951), cert. den., 342 U.S. 873, 72 S.Ct. 116, 96 L.Ed. 656 (1951); Guffey v. United States, 310 F.2d 753 (10 Cir. 1962); Gregory v. United States, 365 F.2d 203 (8 Cir. 1966), cert, den., 385 U.S. 1029, 87 S.Ct. 759, 17 L.Ed.2d 676 (1967); Loux v. United States, 389 F.2d 911 (9 Cir. 1968), cert. den., 393 U.S. 867, 89 S.Ct. 151, 21 L.Ed. 2d 135 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b909-12\"><em> </em>The issue was raised by defendants\u2019 post-trial affidavits of what occurred at trial. With commendable candor, their court-appointed counsel, who had represented them at trial, told us in argument that they could not corroborate defendants\u2019 allegations. With this disclosure, we agree that their duty to their clients and to the Court which appointed them was to assert the points advanced by defendants. <em>Cf., </em>Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although the district judge, in his supplementation of the record, was critical of defendants\u2019 counsel for asserting their clients\u2019 contention before us, manifestly, he was unaware of the disclosures made to us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
