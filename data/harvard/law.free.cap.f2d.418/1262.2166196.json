Glass, the appellant, in favor of Betty Kinney, the appellee, and from the denial of appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-16\">In January 1964, the appellant and the appellee were involved in a three car collision in the west bound lane of the Schuylkill Expressway, Philadelphia, a divided highway with two lanes in each direction. Appellee contends that a third car stopped immediately ahead of her automobile in the right lane and that she came to a halt in order to avoid a collision. She alleges that shortly thereafter the appellant, also travelling in the right lane, hit her car from behind and pushed it into the stopped car which caused her vehicle and the third car to be carried into the left lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-17\">Contrary to appellee\u2019s version, appellant alleges that he was driving in the left lane approximately ten feet behind and to the left of the appellee. He asserts that the accident occurred when the appellee suddenly swerved into the left lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-18\">The appellant now assigns as error the trial judge\u2019s failure to sufficiently specify in his charge to the jury that section 1002(a) of the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposes a twofold duty upon a driver travelling in a line of traffic. First, appellant contends, it requires that a driver operate his vehicle in a manner as to permit him to bring it under control in a reasonably safe distance from preceding cars. Secondly, he asserts, it requires that a vehicle be operated in a manner to permit cars in the rear sufficient time and distance to stop. It is this second requirement that appellant contends the District Judge failed to clarify in his charge. However, the District Judge instructed the jury that the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>sions of section 1002 \u201ccould apply to both parties in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We find that this was sufficient to encompass appellant\u2019s theory of the duties imposed upon drivers by section 1002 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">Consistent with his theory of the accident, appellant also assigns as error the District Judge\u2019s failure to charge under section 1012(a) of the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This section essentially requires a driver to signal 100 feet before changing lanes. However, according to the appellant\u2019s theory \u201c[i]t all happened in a matter of, well, just like a flash of lightning.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Obviously, charging the jury that a signal was required would have little relevance under this account of the accident. Moreover, the court did charge the appellant\u2019s theory of the unexpected swerve by the plaintiff as negating appellant\u2019s responsibility for the accident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, failure to charge section 1012(a) is neither prejudicial nor erroneous. Furthermore, despite the court\u2019s direction that it would hear counsel\u2019s specific objections at the close of his charge, appellant was silent as to the omission of instructions on section 1012(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C., he lost his right to press this assignment of error, unless the omission constituted a miscarriage of justice. In this ease it cannot be characterized as that flagrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-8\">Additionally, appellant contends that the appellee failed to differentiate with reasonable approximation the damages resulting from the injuries of this accident and those in a second automobile accident which occurred one month later.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Relying on McGuire v. Hamler Coal Mining Co.,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the appellant urges that without a showing of such differentiation by the appellee the jury could not properly find a verdict in her favor.' But <em>McGuire </em>is sharply different from this case. There his suit was defeated because his own doctors were unable to say whether his complaints were attributable to either of two separate accidents he sustained. Here, evidence was given of appellee\u2019s hospitalization immediately following the first accident together with a history of disability culminating in surgery upon her spine, performed by Dr. Raymond Stein three years later. This surgeon\u2019s unequivocal and uncontradicted testimony was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-9\">\u201cWell, I think there is a definite relationship between these traumatic episodes. She was involved in two accidents. She had no history of having any difficulty with the neck before, and <em>unquestionably her problem started with the time of the first accident.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1326-10\">Unfortunately, any recital of further details of Dr. Stein\u2019s opinion relating to appellee\u2019s condition and the first accident was frustrated by the persistent objee<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>tions of the appellant, sustained by the District Judge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under such circumstances appellant may not be heard now to complain of the absence of evidence which he himself succeeded in suppressing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">The fact remains that unlike the circumstances in <em>McGuire, </em>Dr. Stein in this case affirmatively connected appellee\u2019s injuries with the first accident. The credit to which his testimony was entitled in light of the lapse of time between the accident and when Dr. Stein attended appellee was for the jury. We cannot say that the testimony of Dr. Stein and that of the appellee together with the hospital records of medical history admitted in evidence was insufficient for the jury to make a reasonable approximation of the damages sustained by the appellee as a result of the first accident as differentiated from the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">On cross examination of appellee, appellant\u2019s counsel brought out that her answers to interrogatories filed in the state court suit<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> described medical treatment and expenses substantially identical to those demanded in this suit. Hence, appellant argues it became impossible for the jury to apportion damages to the first accident with reasonable approximation. We do not agree. The effect of this cross examination was a factor for the jury\u2019s consideration against the background of the instructions of the District Judge that the appellee could recover only for damages resulting from this accident and that appellant should not be held responsible for any injury that came from any other source or from any other accident.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Apparently the jury was convinced that the damages claimed by appellee in this case stemmed from the first accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-11\">Finally, appellant asserts that it was prejudicial error for appellee\u2019s counsel to read from the hospital records during his closing arguments to the jury. Appellant\u2019s counsel had agreed that the hospital records should be marked in evidence anomalously reserving, however, that they should not go out to the jury. Both the District Judge and the appellee\u2019s counsel believed that the records were in evidence and were therefore properly for the jurors\u2019 hands. Considerable controversy ensued concerning this and at the very end of the case the District Judge finally was persuaded to withhold from the jury all of the medical records except the histories. An examination of the portions of the medical records read by appellee\u2019s attorney during the closing arguments discloses, however, that they were largely excerpts from the medical histories which were unquestionably stipulated by counsel to go into evidence. Counsel\u2019s non-history references were brief and insignificant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>They did not rise to the degree of prejudice claimed for them by the appellant and constitute no ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in favor of Betty Kinney and against Joseph H. Glass and the denial of the motion for a new trial will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1325-19\">. 75 P.S. \u00a7 1002(a) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-20\">\u201c(a) Any person driving a vehicle on a highway shall drive the same at a careful and prudent speed, not greater than nor less than is reasonable and proper, having due regard to the traffic surface, and width of the highway, and of any other restrictions or conditions then and there existing; and no person shall drive any vehicle, upon a highway at such a speed as to endanger the life, limb, or property of any person, nor at a speed greater than will permit him to bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1326-5\">.
