Obviously more proof is necessary for the Dyer Act charge, dependent on an intent that requires a stealing, than for an unauthorized use charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-17\">The Government contends the point is moot because the trial judge sentenced the appellants pursuant to the Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b) (1964), which necessarily means concurrent sentences. <em>Compare </em>Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 87 L.Ed. 1774 (1943). The question is not necessarily appropriate for a flat rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-20\">There may well be a significant difference between a record of three felonies (including robbery) and a record of one felony, in regard to what appellants will receive in terms of treatment and supervision, and also early conditional release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5017 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-21\">We think the interest of justice which controls appellate disposition, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 (1964), has particular vitality when the future of youth offenders is at stake. Accordingly, we enter judgment of affirmance of the sentence as a judgment entered following a conviction of unauthorized use,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but limited to that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-22\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-14\">. Since the point was not contested and may become academic in the light of future release, we do not consider the question arising from the fact that there is a possibility of a 6-year period prior to appellants\u2019 unconditional discharge, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. .\u00a7 5017 (c), although the maximum penalty for unauthorized use is 5 years. <em>Compare </em>In re Lee\u2019s Petition, 232 F.Supp. 415 (E.D.N.Y.1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
