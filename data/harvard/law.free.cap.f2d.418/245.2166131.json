Had it occurred in a trial to a jury we would be concerned, for the proper test is, of course, not whether Dunn should have known the vehicle was stolen, but whether he knew it wasr] The out of context inaccuracy of the phrase, however, is overcome by the district judge\u2019s other statements showing that he did not try the case under misapprehension of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">We have considered exceptions to the admission of evidence. If error occurred we think it harmless. In the reception of seized evidence we find no deprivation of Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-14\">Accordingly the conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AAI\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
