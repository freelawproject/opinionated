ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1266-13\">Appellant was convicted by a jury on two counts of \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d threatening the life of the President of the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The charges stemmed from a series of five successive calls appellant admittedly made to the White House on the evening of July 23, 1966, from a public telephone in the lobby of the apartment building in which he resided. The White House operator directed the calls to Secret Service agents who taped them, and at appellant\u2019s trial the tape was admitted into evidence and played to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-14\">The calls, excluding interruptions, consumed a total of about 50 minutes, and were interspersed profusely with discussions of \u201cthe War in Viet Nam,\u201d the \u201cRussians,\u201d and other topics of a controversial political nature. They also embraced what were described as \u201capproximately six statements of a threatening nature,\u201d and these became the basis of the prosecution. At the agents\u2019 request, appellant provided his name, address and telephone number, and agreed to await the arrival of other agents. More than an hour after the first call was placed, the latter agents found appellant still in the telephone booth talking to their colleagues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-15\">The sole defense offered at trial was that appellant was too intoxicated to form the specific intent which is an essential element of the offense charged, and the evidence made it clear that appellant had been drinking heavily during the day. Witnesses for the Government admitted that they detected the odor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>alcohol when appellant was arrested, but concluded, on the basis of his manner of speech and action, that he was in control of himself by the time he initiated the calls to the White House.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">Appellant brought this litigation here by separate appeals from the conviction and the denial of his motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As matters turn out, it is unnecessary for us to consider the points upon which he originally relied for reversal. While these appeals were pending, the Supreme Court, in another case, gave the statute upon which this prosecution was laid a construction materially at variance with the law by which the jury measured appellant\u2019s guilt. With prejudice to appellant's substantial rights flowing therefrom, we set his conviction aside and remand the case to the District Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-7\">Shortly after oral argument before us, Watts v. United States,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> involving a conviction under the same statute, was decided by another division of this court, and a review was sought in the Supreme Court. Because contentions were pressed in <em>Watts </em>which, if accepted, would substantially affect appellant\u2019s case, we issued an order deferring our disposition pending the Supreme Court\u2019s action. What eventuated in <em>Watts </em>was an interpretation of the statute requiring the proof of a \u201ctrue \u2018threat,\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and a direction of Watts\u2019 acquittal because the statements he made, partly in consequence of their conditional character, were a \u201c \u2018kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the President\u2019 \u201d which did not amount to a \u201cthreat.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-15\"><em>Watts </em>represented the Supreme Court\u2019s first construction of the statute, an endeavor in which various other federal courts had engaged.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Some of these courts,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on whose holdings the majority of our <em>Watts </em>panel relied,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> had expanded the concept of a \u201cthreat\u201d so broadly as to include utterances employing violent words intended and understood as mere jokes or political hyperbole. The Supreme Court, however, admonished that \u201cwe must interpret the language Congress chose \u2018against the background of a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, ruled the Court, to support a conviction under the statute, \u201cthe Government [must] prove a true \u2018threat.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-16\">At appellant\u2019s trial, the court quite understandably adopting pre-Waits doctrine, charged the jury that a \u201cthreat\u201d was a \u201cdeclaration of intention to injure another by the commission of an unlawful act,\u201d but that the offense could be committed by \u201cmerely idle talk or jests\u201d and that it was not a defense \u201cthat the alleged threats were uttered condition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>ally.\u201d The court also charged that appellant\u2019s intoxication was of moment only if it attained such a degree as to negate his capacity to entertain specific intent. By reflecting these now rejected characteristics of a \u201cthreat,\u201d the charge thus gave the jury erroneous instructions on a vital element of the offense. Neither \u201cidle talk\u201d nor mere \u201cjest\u201d is a \u201ctrue \u2018threat,\u2019 \u201d and the conditional nature of a statement, whether or not a complete defense, is certainly a factor bearing on the question whether the statement is an exaggerated expression rather than a \u201cthreat.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We note, too, that the charge did not mention the necessity, in determining whether a threat was made, of examining the statement in its full context.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A jury properly instructed on this score might have found that appellant\u2019s undisputed consumption of a large quantity of alcohol was also relevant to that question and not, as the trial judge charged, a circumstance probative only in relation to specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">These are flaws in appellant\u2019s trial of a type we cannot ignore. True it is that in the absence of objection before the jury retires to deliberate, we normally do not notice errors in the charge.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But in resolving appeals we are \u201cbound to consider any change, either in fact or in law, which has supervened since judgment was entered.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Where the trial court has followed case law then but no longer prevailing, \u201cour disposition is uninhibited by the requirement that issues proffered on appeal must normally be raised and decided initially in the trial court.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus we are brought to the remaining question whether the errors in the charge necessitate reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-14\">Appellant was entitled to have the issue as to whether his statements constituted a \u201cthreat\u201d properly submitted to the jury.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It follows that if the evidence suggested inquiries for the jury on that issue which the charge erroneously foreclosed, appellant must have a new trial. Our examination of the record reveals a close correspondence between the errors and logical questions imbedded in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-15\">In his telephone conversations, appellant discussed the war in Vietnam, \u201cRussia,\u201d crime, and \u201cWashington politicians,\u201d and as well voiced concern for his daughter and wife. . During 50 minutes of dialogue, he made, as we have stated, approximately six statements that Secret Service agents characterized from the witness stand as threatening. The record on appeal does not contain the tape itself or a transcription thereof, but the testimony uniformly indicates that most if not all of these statements were patently conditional.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1268-16\">All circumstances considered, a jury conceivably could have deemed appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>lant\u2019s statements hyperbole, expressing strong disagreement with the President and his policies, rather than as threats upon his life.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> While evening telephone calls to the White House are an offensive, bizarre medium for communication \u2014 and this might well have led the jury to accept the utterances as threats \u2014 appellant\u2019s third-grade education and excessive drinking increased the probability of expression in an unaccustomed way. These factors do not outlaw the possibility that the calls were threats, but they do tend to weaken any inference to be derived from their timing and destination.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, appellant\u2019s cooperation in telling the Secret Service of his whereabouts and waiting for their arrival could perhaps be seen as impressing on his language of violence a much less ominous connotation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-4\">In determining whether the errors in the charge were prejudicial, our task is not to judge whether appellant made a threat,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> for that is for a jury,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201c[n]or is it [for us] to speculate upon probable reconviction * * <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It is our responsibility, however, to reverse appellant\u2019s conviction unless we can say \u201cwith fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Here the evidence offered a number of possible inferences, leading both to guilt and to innocence, for the factfinders to consider. The charge excluded some of these inferences from the jury\u2019s consideration and led it astray as to others. Because we can only speculate as to the resulting impact on the jury, we must send the case back to the District Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-15\">In so doing, we reemphasize the view that the statute defining the crime of threatening the President is constitutional on its face.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We take care to point out that we have held neither that appellant\u2019s statements are constitutionally protected nor that the Government failed to adduce sufficient evidence to enable a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that they contained the ingredients of threats.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> What we have decided, and all that we have decided, is that appellant cannot stand convicted unless and until a jury acting under proper instructions finds from what appellant said that indeed he did make an unlawful threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-16\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1266-11\">. 18 U.S'.C. \u00a7 871(a) (1964) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEQU\">\u201cWhoever knowingly and willfully deposits for conveyance in the mail or for a delivery from any post office or by any letter carrier any letter, paper, writing, print, missive, or document containing any threat to take the life of or to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States, the President-elect, the Vice President or other officer next in the order of succession to the office of President of the United States, or the Vice President-elect, or knowingly and willfully otherwise makes any such threat against the President, President-elect, Vice President or other officer next in the order of succession to the office of President, or Vice President-elect, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1266-17\">Each count charged the making of the same threats in the hearing of a different Secret Service agent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1267-8\">.
