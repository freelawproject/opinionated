App. \u00a7 462. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-17\">Defendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the order to report for induction was invalid because it was signed by the local board clerk and there was no evidence that the local board actually selected and ordered the defendant to report for induction in accordance with Selective Service Regulation 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1631.7<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-18\">In United States v. Baker, 416 F.2d 202 (9th Cir. Sept. 17, 1969), this court dealt with a virtually identical argument. We pointed out that although section 1631.7 \u201cdoes suggest the need for a post-call meeting of a board, * * * an order of the Board contingent upon a later call is valid and that such an order may be implied from the action of a board in classifying a registrant I-A.\u201d 416 F.2d 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-20\">Applying these principles here, there was uncontroverted evidence that the defendant had been classified I-A by his local board, and no evidence indicating that further action in his case required any exercise of the board\u2019s discretion; thus \u201cthe Government was not obliged to prove an express order of the Board directed to [Doran].\u201d United States v. Baker, <em>supra, </em>416 F.2d at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-21\">The case before us differs from <em>Baker </em>in one respect. In <em>Baker </em>there was evidence in the record that the local board had complied with Selective Service Regulation 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.59, which provided that a local board could authorize its clerk to sign official papers \u201cby resolution duly adopted by and entered in the minutes of the meetings.\u201d There is no evidence in the present record that the local board adopted a resolution in compliance with section 1604.59.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-22\">Assuming that no such resolution was adopted, the board completed its \u201ccritical exercise of administrative judgment\u201d (Brede v. United States, 400 F.2d 599, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>600 (9th Cir. 1968)) by placing the defendant in Class I-A and the defendant suffered no prejudice \u201cby the board\u2019s disregard of a directory administrative detail in the performance of its duties.\u201d Smith v. United States, 157 F.2d 176, 182 (4th Cir. 1946); <em>see also </em>United States v. Cralle, 415 F.2d 1065 (9th Cir. Aug. 14, 1969); United States v. Crowley, 405 F.2d 400, 403 (4th Cir. 1968) (dictum); United States v. Lawson, 337 F.2d 800, 812 (3d Cir. 1964); Mason v. United States, 218 F.2d 375 (9th Cir. 1955); Talcott v. Reed, 217 F.2d 360, 364 (9th Cir. 1954); United States ex rel. Bergdoll v. Drum, 107 F.2d 897, 900 (2d Cir. 1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1289-13\"> 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1631.7 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuX\">\u201c(a) When a call is placed * * *, each local board * * * shall select and order to report for induction the number of men required to fill the call from among its registrants who have been classified in Class I-A and Class I-A-0 and have been found acceptable for service in the Armed Forces and to whom the local board has mailed a Statement of Acceptability (DD Form No. 62) at least 21 days before the date fixed for induction. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
