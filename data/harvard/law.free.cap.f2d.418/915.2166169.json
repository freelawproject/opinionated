The District Court concluded that there was a basis in fact for the Air Force\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-27\">Nothing in the record before the District Court supplied a basis in fact for the Air Force\u2019s denial of Sertic\u2019s claim. Both the Air Force and the District Court concluded that Sertie was sincere in the beliefs which he entertained. Those beliefs <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> fell directly within the test of Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>ed States v. Seeger (1965) 380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733, accordingly, reversal is compelled. <em>(E. g., </em>United States v. Haughton (9th Cir. 1969) 413 F.2d 736; United States ex rel. Brooks v.

Sertic\u2019s opposition to war in any form was based on Ms beliefs, in part, as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-14\">\u201cI believe that there is a spirit, God, in all men. This is a unified spirit which works to build its unity by the confrontation and interaction of its members. It is a creative force that brings out the qualities in man that lead him to the realization of God in himself and in all men. This realization will lead men to fulfill the obligation of working for the unity of the spirit by working for the welfare of all mankind. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-28\">\u201cBefore 1966 my religious training took place in my home and church. Even though neither of my parents have been active members of any religious denomination, we as a family went to church when I was 10 and 11 years of age. Later at the age of 14 I went to church and Sunday school on my own, and served as an acolyte in an Episcopalian church. In these religious experiences the emphasis was on the love and brotherhood of man as brought out by our association. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>ideals have always been reflected in my parents way of life which is based on the idea that there is a basic goodness in all men.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
