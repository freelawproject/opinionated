Thereafter, he called Mrs. Pate in Texas, advised her he had called his former wife (Mrs. Pate\u2019s daughter) and told her (his former wife) that if he did not hear from his daughter \u201cthat he would come down there and throw acid in your face. I will disfigure you so that even your friends won\u2019t know you. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-16\">The mailed threat was contained in a letter from appellant to his former wife, mailed in Los Angeles on October 6, 1967, addressed to his former wife, which stated, in part, as set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-17\">Two errors are alleged: <em>First: </em>that the court erred in admitting evidence of the appellant\u2019s telephone call to the mother, Mrs. Pate, because: \u201cthe two alleged crimes do not require specific intent and admission of such evidence was inflammatory, irrelevant, and prejudicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>to appellant.\u201d Second: that misconduct of the jury required the trial judge to declare a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">We find no merit in either error urged.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">As appellant recognizes in his brief, there exists little factual dispute \u2014 \u201cthe chief point in controversy * * * was whether appellant actually made an oral threat to injure the complaining witness, or whether he simply made derogatory oral statements concerning his former wife and her mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Appellant urges that \u201cintent\u201d is no element of the offenses charged against him, citing United States v. Pennell, 144 F.Supp. 317 (N.D.Cal. 1956). Appellant misreads the holding of that case. It holds that under \u00a7 875(c) of Title 18, \u201cCongress intended that the transmitting in interstate commerce of a communication threatening to injure the person of another should be, in and of itself, sufficient to constitute a violation under the Statute,\u201d <em>without being coupled with an intent to extort money or other things of value, </em>as the other subdivisions of \u00a7 875 require.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">\u201cIf a man intentionally adopts certain conduct in certain circumstances known to him, and that conduct is forbidden by the law under those circumstances, he intentionally breaks the law in the only sense in which the law ever considers intent.\u201d Ellis v. United States, 206 U.S. 246, 257, 27 S.Ct. 600, 602, 51 L.Ed. 1047 (1906).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">But proof of other criminal acts of an accused are admissible for several reasons other than to prove intent. As we so recently said in United States v. Jiminez-Robles, 415 F.2d 308, decided August 6,1969:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\">\u201cGranted, the <em>general </em>rule is, as appellant asserts, that evidence of prior criminal conduct is inadmissible. However, one well established exception to this rule is that such prior criminal conduct can be introduced to show state of mind or intent, design, knowledge or lack of innocent purpose. Craft v. United States, 403 F.2d 360 (9 Cir. 1968); Metheany v. United States, 390 F.2d 559 (9 Cir. 1968); Asher v. United States, 394 F.2d 424 (9 Cir. 1968).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-12\">In Seeber v. United States, 329 F.2d 572, 577 (1964), we characterized four instructions given (under the statute in effect prior to the time Congress made \u00a7 875(c) a separate crime) as not referring \u201cto the vital issue of intent, and to that extent are incomplete.\u201d From this it can be inferred we considered a general intent to threaten is an essential element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">Relying on our <em>Seeber </em>case, the Fourth Circuit in United States v. Dutsch, 357 F.2d 331 (1966) at 333, has specifically held that a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c) \u201crequires a showing that a threat was intended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-14\">Thus, the trial court was amply justified in admitting into evidence proof of the appellant\u2019s subsequent threats to Mrs. Pate in the telephone call made to her <em>after </em>he had first called and threatened his former wife, to establish the appellant\u2019s intent at the time the threat was made to his onetime wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-15\">For still another reason we hold the admission of such testimony \u201cof other threats\u201d was not error. It was introduced into evidence on cross-examination of the complaining former wife by appellant\u2019s counsel (R.T. p. 28, 1. 20). No motion to strike the witness\u2019 statement as nonresponsive (or on any other ground) was then made. On R.T. p. 30 appellant\u2019s counsel admitted he asked for hearsay testimony with respect to threats made by appellant to his former wife\u2019s mother, and specifically stated he had no objection to such testimony. Having thus created what is now asserted as error, appellant is in no position to complain.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Skiskowski v. United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>81 U.S.App.D.C. 274, 158 F.2d 177, 182 (1946); United States v. Bramson, 139 F.2d 598, 600 (2d Cir. 1943); Jarabo v. United States, 158 F.2d 509, 514 (1st Cir. 1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">As to appellant\u2019s second alleged error, we quote with approval a portion of the appellee\u2019s brief on this subject:</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">\u201c[Tjhree jurors * * * had engaged in some brief speculation as to whether Appellant was under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time he wrote the letter and/or made the phone calls (Tr. 148-165). Mrs. Wilson, the juror who instigated the conversation about the Appellant\u2019s possible use of alcohol or drugs, was excused by the Court and replaced by an alternate juror (Tr. 157). The other two lady jurors upon question by the Court, each stated that she could base her verdict solely on the evidence and testimony presented in the Courtroom (Tr. 160-163). After the alternate juror had been seated, the trial Court then asked whether there was any juror who could not base his decision solely upon the evidence presented in the Courtroom, to which no juror responded (Tr. 164). The Court thereupon reminded the jury of its sworn duty to base its verdict solely on the evidence in the ease and that it would be a violation of such duty to base the verdict upon \u2018anything other than the testimony and evidence that you hear here in the Courtroom\u2019 (Tr. 164). Finally, in the instructions at the close of the case, the District Court again reminded the jury of its duty to consider only the evidence properly admitted in this case (Tr. 271).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">\u201cIn view of the careful and repeated instructions of the trial Court in this regard we submit that no prejudice requiring reversal of the jury\u2019s decision can be shown in this case. Cavness v. United States, 187 F.2d 719, 723 (C.A. 9). This is especially true when it is considered that the nature of the speculation indulged in by the jurors was whether Appellant may have been under the influence of alcohol or drugs \u2014 factors which, if true, are ordinarily introduced by the <em>defense </em>in order to negative criminal intent. Indeed, it was the Appellant himself who later raised this issue when, in his closing argument to the jury, he denied that he was under the influence of alcohol or drugs but stated that, if such was the case, it would be a \u2018valid mitigating defense\u2019.\u201d (Tr. 182-184; Appellee\u2019s Brief, pp. 9-10.)</p>\n<p id=\"AXr\">We affirm the conviction on each count.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-11\">. \"* * * I talked with your mother after I called you. She laughingly said she is not engaged which is of no importance to me \u2014 she is still your dear mama and I doubt if she is guarded day and night. Hate to play it this way as I respect June somewhat. But I find it necessary for the time being. I quite meant what I told you. I was on my way to the airport when I picked up your \u2018letter\u2019\u2014 the ticket is still in my pocket. I suggest you put me in jail as you threatened \u2014 very soon or have Trist\u00f3n write me. Beginning now if she misses one week without an explanation from you I\u2019m headed to Texas on the next convenient week-end. Of course you know I will know from her letter if you make them a \u2018directed assignment\u2019 so I suggest you face the fact that your ex-husband is a bastard and have Trist\u00f3n handle her own letters \u2014 otherwise they will mean nothing. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about your mother I have already talked with her telling her exactly what I intend to do to her if it is necessary. I must say she took it lightly over the phone. Interesting.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">\u201cToday is the 6th. Make good your threat about jail or have Trist\u00f3n write. And if I receive a letter dictated by you to the effect that \u2018I\u2019m fine and going to school and drinking my juice and happy\u2019 forget it \u2014 the only thing which would make me more angry is a duplicate of your last letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-19\">\u201cYou have until the 15th, for me to receive a letter from Trist\u00f3n. That gives you nine days, but remember about the letter \u2014 it is to be from her if not you can kiss your dear mother\u2019s face goodby for whatever it is worth. I am quite sure a veil will cover it.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-20\">\u201cNext time you write have the dignity to sign it; from your letter Trist\u00f3n sounds like a small potential Tante which was to be expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-21\">\u201cDo you have now what you want out of life Diane? I have not yet but I intend to get it. You know if you leave Alaska your life expectancy is about zero after Bill\u2019s. How is the teaching \u2014 what grades ? your painting? drawing? or is it chile cheeze (sic) surprize and a roast and trips to the supermarket? Believe me dear I reserve all my disgust and hate just for you \u2014 someday you are bound to get it.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-22\">Baron\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-23\">(Tr. 18-20.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b688-10\">. The defense was, to say the least, inconsistent. The trial judge, previously to appellant\u2019s counsel having asked for the testimony as to \u201cother threats,\u201d had granted the appellant\u2019s motion to strike the complaining witness\u2019 conclusion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>defendant \u201chad threatened me before\u201d (R.T. p. 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">After seeking and placing the hearsay in the record, and stating he had no objection to it, counsel for defendant later changed his mind, asked that the hearsay be stricken, <em>and it was </em>(R.T. p. 31, lines 5-9), and the jury admonished to disregard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-20\">Subsequently, counsel for appellant again on cross-examination asked the complaining former wife about \u201cother threats\u201d (R.T. 44).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
