Poppell and Mrs. Nell D. Poppell, in their 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346(a) (1) suit for a refund of $27,434.62 in income taxes, fraud penalties, assessed interest and statutory interest paid for the taxable years 1957 through 1961. It is clear from the record that the District Court erred in admitting, over objection by the Government, testimony elicited by the taxpayers for the purpose of im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>peaching the testimony of a Government witness through a reputation for intemperance, and we therefore reverse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">During the course of trial the taxpayers sought to impeach the testimony of a Government witness by eliciting from a former attorney of the witness\u2019 husband testimony which was based upon an investigation by the attorney regarding unrelated child custody proceedings which took place some fourteen years prior to this suit and three years prior to the taxable years in question. The attorney\u2019s testimony simply recited a general reputation for intemperance which, whatever its moral aspects, had no bearing upon the witness\u2019 veracity. The attorney\u2019s testimony was wholly unrelated to the ability of the witness to observe, recall or testify as to any relevant occurrences and was replete with accumulations, of irrelevant and prejudicial hearsay, including highly inflammatory references to the content of various affidavits filed in the custody proceedings. To have permitted this form of impeachment through a showing of a general habit of intemperance unrelated to veracity was error. N. L. R. B. v. Baldwin Locomotive Works, 3 Cir. 1942, 128 F.2d 39, 46; Frazier v. F. Strauss &amp; Son, Inc., La.App.1937, 173 So. 343, 344; cf. Hudson v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 387 F.2d 331, 332; Wegman v. United States, 8 Cir. 1959, 272 F.2d 31, 34; Stansbury v. United States, 5 Cir. 1955, 219 F.2d 165. See generally 3 Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 933 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">We find it unnecesary to consider th&amp; Government\u2019s additional assignments of error because it is unlikely that they will reoccur upon the retrial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The taxpayers have cross appealed contending that the District Court erred in failing to enter a default judgment in their favor, assertedly due to the government\u2019s failure to answer interrogatories to their satisfaction. The subject matter of the interrogatories was moot. The cross appeal is utterly devoid of merit, and to that extent the decision of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\">. Pursuant to new Rule 18 of the Rules of this Court, we have concluded on the merits that this case is of such character as not to justify oral argument and have directed the clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties in writing. See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
