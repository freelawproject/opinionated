See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 409 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1969), and Huth v. Southern Pacific Company, 417 F.2d 526 [Oct. 7, 1969].</p>\n<p id=\"b632-24\">At the time he entered summary judgment for appellee in this case, presumably the District Judge did not have available to him the decision of the Florida Court of Appeals in Dorrell v. State Fire and Casualty Company, 221 So.2d 5 (April 1, 1969), decided only a few days before the motion was granted. Since we do not know on what governing principle or principles of law the motion was granted, we vacate the summary judgment and remand the case for further consideration in the light of <em>Dorrell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>On remand the appellant should be given opportunity to promptly amend the complaint to allege claims for coverage under any other clauses of the insurance policy than the clause raised in the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
