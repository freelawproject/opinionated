The property sold was a blank selective service registration form or \u201cdraft card.\u201d There was no proof of how it came into appellant\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-23\">Appellant contends that to establish guilt under \u00a7 641 the Government has the burden of proving that the property sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>was stolen from the Government. He asserts that there was no such proof here. He assigns as error the failure of the court so to instruct the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">We must reject appellant\u2019s contentions. He was not charged with theft or with sale of stolen property. He was charged with sale of Government property without authority. Theft is not an element of this offense; Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952), is inapplicable. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
