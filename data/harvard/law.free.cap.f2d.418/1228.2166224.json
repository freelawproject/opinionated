Yates is confined in the United States Penitentiary at Terre Haute, Indiana, under two four year concurrent sentences. He was convicted in a trial before a jury on indictment number CR 66-203 charging conspiracy and in a trial before the court on indictment number CR 66-204 charging a substantive offense. Both indictments involve the transportation of forged securities in interstate commerce. The securities in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>question were American Express Money Orders which had been taken in the armed robbery of a drug store.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">One of the conspirators, Bova, gave a written confession in the jail prior to trial which implicated Yates and other defendants. A motion was made to suppress this confession and other evidence alleged to have been taken by an illegal search and seizure. The district judge sustained the motion except as to the statement of Bova.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">At the trial, under Delli Paoli v. United States, 352 U.S. 232, 77 S.Ct. 294, 1 L.Ed.2d 278, the court admitted the Bova statement but ordered that Yates\u2019 and other names be masked so that they could not be read by the jury. The judge ordered the clerk to photograph the masked statement and the photograph was offered in evidence as an exhibit. The judge personally inspected the masked document to see that all names except Bova\u2019s were obliterated. He also instructed the jury that it should not consider the masked document in connection with any defendant except Bova. Bova did not testify in his own behalf at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">It is claimed on behalf of Yates that his identity was not sufficiently concealed by the masked document to avoid the type of prejudice that was proscribed by Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476. This opinion was handed down by the Supreme Court a few days after Yates\u2019 conviction was affirmed by our Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-8\">The district judge held that the standard of <em>Bruton, </em>supra, was not violated by the admission of Bova\u2019s statement in the form in which it was admitted. We agree. The case at bar is distinguishable on its facts from the <em>Bruton </em>case. By the time <em>Bruton </em>got to the Supreme Court the conviction of the petitioner\u2019s co-defendant, whose confession was involved, had been reversed by the Court of Appeals on the ground that the confession should not have been admitted into evidence. Thus <em>Bruton </em>may have been prejudiced by a confession which should not have been admitted in the first place. However, we understand, that the <em>Bruton </em>principle is not limite^ to that particular fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-10\">The Court said in <em>Bruton </em>at page 135, 88 S.Ct. at page 1627,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-11\">\u201cWe agree that there are many circumstances in which this reliance (that the jury will follow instructions) is justified. Not every admission of inadmissible hearsay or other evidence can be considered to be reversible error unavoidable through limiting instructions; instances occur in almost every trial where inadmissible evidence creeps in, usually inadvertently. \u2018A defendant is entitled to a fair trial but not a perfect one.\u2019 (Citations omitted.) It is not unreasonable to conclude that in many such cases the jury can and will follow the trial judge\u2019s instructions to disregard such information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1291-12\">We think this is such a case. The trial judge took adequate precaution to avoid any prejudice to Yates by reason of the admission of Bova\u2019s confession. It appears to us that he satisfactorily did so and we also rely on his judgment that he accomplished his purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-13\">It is further claimed that the appellant\u2019s constitutional rights were violated because he was excluded from the hearing to suppress evidence. We find no merit to this claim. If there were any error in this regard it did not affect the substantial rights of the appellant. (Rule 52(a) F.R.Cr.P.) The extent of the adverse ruling to the appellant from this hearing was the admission of the Bova confession in its masked form. We have held that this did not prejudice the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-14\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
