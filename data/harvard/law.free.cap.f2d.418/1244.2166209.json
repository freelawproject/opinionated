When the evidence is viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, and all conflicts in it resolved against appellant, the fact of his guilt as found by the jury is clearly evident. Babson v. United States, 330 F.2d 662, 663 (9 Cir., 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-16\">That the evidence is largely circumstantial, does not prevent its being proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-17\">Appellant\u2019s third point is unsubstantial, and we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-18\">We affirm the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
