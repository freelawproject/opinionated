See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 409 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-16\">The sole issue on this appeal is whether a general guardian of minor children, appointed by a state court in Mississippi, has the power under Fed.R.Civ. P. 17(b) or 17(c) to sue as such guardian in the federal district court of Louisiana when she would lack the power to sue in such capacity in\u2019 the state courts of Louisiana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court answered in the negative. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-17\">It is well settled that \u201c * * * where a guardian or other representative of a minor already has been appointed and qualified by a state court, his capacity, when he seeks to act in federal court, is tested by the law of the state in which the district court is held, but if an infant or incompetent does not have a validly appointed state representative, the federal court in which suit is brought may name a guardian ad litem or next friend to represent him, regardless of state law.\u201d 2 Barron and Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure (Wright ed., 1961), \u00a7 488. Accord: Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Bengston, 231 F.2d 263 (5th Cir. 1956), aff\u2019g 132 F.Supp. 512 (W.D. La., 1955); Fallat v. Gouran, 220 F.2d 325 (3d Cir. 1955); Brimhall v. Simmons, 338 F.2d 702 (6th Cir. 1964). See also 3A Moore, Federal Practice, (2d ed., 1969) \u00b617.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-18\">Similar to the instant case, and illustrative of the principle involved, is Frankel v. Styer, 201 F.Supp. 726 (E.D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Pa., 1962). A duly qualified guardian of minor children brought an action in the federal district court for the wrongful death of the children\u2019s father. In dismissing the action the court held that since the guardian of minor children was without power to sue on behalf of a class in the state courts of Pennsylvania he could not sue on behalf of a class in a diversity suit in the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-13\">. Since the minor children involved in this case do not reside outside Louisiana, only a tutor appointed by a Louisiana state court or the father or mother of these children can bring an action on the children\u2019s behalf in the state courts of Louisiana. LSA-C.C.P, arts. 683, 4431. Plaintiff Mary Virginia Slade does not fit within any of these three categories, and therefore lacks capacity to sue in Louisiana state court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
