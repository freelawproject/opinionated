We conclude that the finding of patent infringement on a truck trailer coupling device is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-20\">We reverse as to the award of attorney fees. The infringement was very retail and not aggravated. It was mostly a case of a stubborn layman. There is just not enough wilfulness to make the case the extraordinary one required for an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Perhaps all victors in patent cases should get attorney\u2019s fees, but that is not the law. Approval of attorney\u2019s fees here would just about mean that they could be allowed in every patent ease.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
