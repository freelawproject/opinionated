We need not decide the question. Defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>ant was sentenced to three years on each count, all sentences to run concurrently. The declaration was irrelevant to at least one count (count 9), and we are satisfied from an examination of the record as a whole that it did not influence the jury\u2019s guilty verdict with respect to that count. <em>See </em>Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 85, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 87 L.Ed. 1774 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Defendant\u2019s second ground of appeal is that it was error to permit the government to introduce testimony of defendant\u2019s bad reputation for truth and veracity. The testimony complained of was received in rebuttal after defendant had testified, but defendant contends that it was nonetheless inadmissible because it was really based upon specific acts of misconduct rather than upon the government witnesses\u2019 knowledge of defendant\u2019s general reputation. The witnesses themselves testified to the contrary, and we are not free to reject that testimony as untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Defendant cannot complain of the testimony relating to his specific acts of misconduct since it was elicited from the witnesses by the defendant himself during cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
