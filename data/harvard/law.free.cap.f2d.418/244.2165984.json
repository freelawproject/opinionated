The issues presented and decided adversely to Respondents involve preelection \u00a7 8(a) (1) violations, post-election \u00a7 8(a) (3) violations, and refusal to bargain charges in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (5) of the Act. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (1), (3) and (5). The \u00a7 8(a) (3) charges include the laying off of employee Pitts, and the refusal to reinstate unfair practice strikers. The refusal to bargain charges include the unilateral wage increase, the unilateral reduction of hours of employment of certain employees, and also the general refusal to bargain after the strike commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">The order of the Board in all respects is amply supported by substantial evidence considered on the record as a whole. The order will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">Enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-26\">.
