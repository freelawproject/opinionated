However, that paragraph covers \u201cadditions ... to the demised premises,\u201d not merely additions to existing structures. And a reading of the lease makes it clear that \u201cdemised premises\u201d includes land and buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">We agree with the district court that the lease authorized the additional structure in question and that the lessor is entitled to no more than the resultant advantage for which she bargained; namely, the incorporation of the new structure into the realty.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
