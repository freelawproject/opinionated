Such orders are reviewable by this court under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-9\">Petitioners were admitted as nonimmigrant exchange visitors to pursue medical studies, which have now been completed. Both are licensed to practice medicine in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-10\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(e), aliens such as these petitioners are not eligible for immigrant visas or for permanent residency in the United States, unless they have returned for a two-year stay in their home countries. Petitioner husband requested a waiver of this requirement, asserting exceptional hardship on his wife and two children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-11\">The application for waiver was denied by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The Immigration and Naturalization Service thereupon commenced deportation proceedings against both petitioners. Assuming without deciding that petitioners may question in a deportation proceeding the denial of a waiver in a separate proceeding, we find that the waiver was properly denied. Petitioners made out no case of \u201cexceptional hardship\u201d sufficient to overcome the strong congressional policy underlying the residency requirement. Mendez v. Major, 340 F.2d 128 (8th Cir. 1965); Talavera v. Pederson, 334 F.2d 52 (6th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-12\">The petition for review is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
