The injuries resulted from Dean\u2019s having slipped on two successive days, first on a pipe and the second time on a ladder, while working as an employee of Todd Shipyards, Inc. (Todd). Although the ship was afloat in navigable waters, it was tied to Todd\u2019s dock, undergoing extensive overhaul and reconstruction. Todd was performing the work under a contract which called for Government expenditure in the approximate sum of $2,900,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-13\">The accidents occurred in the vessel\u2019s Number 2 pump room, an area which, according to the District Court\u2019s determination, was under the exclusive control of Todd at all times relevant to the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-15\">In suing the Government, Dean alleged that the ship was unseaworthy and that the Government was negligent. As to the latter contention, the District Court found, in effect, that there was no negligence on the Government\u2019s part which contributed as a proximate cause of the accidents and Dean\u2019s resulting injuries. The finding is not clearly erroneous. There is abundant evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-16\">On the issue of unseaworthiness, the District Court\u2019s judgment in favor of the Government was based on the conclusion, among others, that \u201cDuring the period of the work * * * the USS Toluga was not a ship in navigation, but was, instead, a dead ship. In the case of a dead ship, no duty of furnishing a seaworthy ship is imposed on the ship owner.\u201d We agree with this conclusion. The magnitude of the work, in cost, has been previously mentioned. The scope of the work, as well as ample support for the challenged conclusion, is further revealed by certain additional findings of the District Court, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-17\">\u201c21. The work required and resulted in the ripping out and removing from the ship the following: (1) All or substantially all of the ship\u2019s propulsion equipment, including all of the turbines, all main engines, all boilers and all or substantially all generators; (2) the entire steering system; (3) the main condensate pumps; (4) the bilge pumps; (5) all electronic gear and communications equipment including all radar. The work in pump room #2 involved ripping out of all the important machinery therein including the foundations for the machinery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-18\">\u201c22. The ship left drydock on December 30, 1965, when it was refloated and was towed and tied up to a dock of the general contractor where it remained until the work was completed. In late March of 1966 when the two ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>cidents happened, all of the above-mentioned machinery and equipment was still off the ship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-4\">\u201c23. During the work and on the dates of the accidents,' the ship had no power of its own. All power and other services including steam, water, communications, etc., were furnished to the ship from the shore. The ship was unable to move on its own power or even to steer itself if towed. It was essentially a hulk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-5\">\u201c24. During the entire course of the work the ship remained a commissioned Navy ship with its crew, including the crew\u2019s commanding officer, aboard. The crew was housed and fed aboard and conducted musters and courtmartials aboard. The crew itself also performed certain maintenance and repair work during the period, which work was not called for in the contract with Todd Shipyards and which work did not overlap or interfere with the work of Todd under the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-6\">\u201c25. Although the ship\u2019s crew retained some control of some limited areas of the ship, such as its living quarters, galley, and ward room, it had no control over the other areas of the ship which were within the exclusive control of the contractor. Among the areas within the contractor\u2019s exclusive control was pump room #2. That room was in the exclusive control of the contractor throughout the work period including before, on, and after March 28 and 29,1966.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-7\">In the light of the foregoing findings and the evidence which supports them, no reasonable person could have believed, at the times in question, that the Toluga was a ship \u201cin navigation\u201d so that the Government was then holding its vessel, or pump room No. 2 thereof, out to Dean or anyone else as \u201cseaworthy.\u201d <em>See </em>West v. United States, 361 U.S. 118, 80 S.Ct. 189, 4 L.Ed.2d 161 (1959). <em>See also </em>Roper v. United States, 368 U.S. 20, 82 S.Ct. 5, 7 L.Ed.2d 1 (1961), wherein the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-8\">\u201cThe test for determining whether a vessel is in navigation is the \u2018status of the ship.\u2019 This is a question of fact, and consequently reversible only upon a showing of clear error. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aus-\">****** \u201cSince we are unwilling to upset the trial court's factual determination that the <em>S.S. Harry Lane </em>was not a vessel in navigation, it follows that there was no warranty of the ship\u2019s seaworthiness\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-9\">368 U.S. at 22, 24, 82 S.Ct. at 7 (citations omitted). <em>Compare </em>Berryhill v. Pacific Far East Line, 238 F.2d 385, 387 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 354 U.S. 938, 77 S.Ct. 1400, 1 L.Ed.2d 1587 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"Ay4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
