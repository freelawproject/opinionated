We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-13\">This was the testimony of prosecution\u2019s complaining witnesses: Appellant approached them on the street and asked whether they were interested in some feminine companionship. Complainants were; they went with appellant to an apartment house and climbed several flights of stairs. Appellant told them he wanted to arrange matters with the girls, and when he returned he told complainants to place their money in an envelope which he would mark and seal. They became suspicious and refused to give him custody of their money. Appellant pulled out and threatened them with use of a knife if they did not hand over the money. They turned over their cash, in excess of $300, and appellant fled.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-20\">Appellant\u2019s testimony denied the use or threat of force. He specifically denied pulling a knife on them. He testified as follows: His intention was merely to get their money through the \u201cMurphy Game.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The men voluntarily accepted his suggestion that they put their cash in the envelope he proffered, to avoid being \u201crolled\u201d by the girls. But when appellant turned around one of the men became suspicious and grabbed him. A scuffle ensued. Appellant wrested himself free and fled without the cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-21\">At the close of the evidence the trial judge and counsel discussed the proposed instructions. The court proposed substantive charges on robbery and assault with a deadly weapon, and both counsel acquiesced. After summations to the jury the court again conferred with counsel. He stated that he proposed to instruct on larceny as a lesser included offense of robbery. Defense counsel protested, but the judge gave that charge, and the verdict was for grand larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-22\">1. Appellant protests the trial judge\u2019s failure to advise his trial counsel of the intention to charge the lesser included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>larceny offense before defense counsel\u2019s argument to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure establishes a procedure whereby counsel can petition for instructions and learn the judge\u2019s intended course before arguing to the jury and can thus shape their argument in the light of the judge\u2019s forthcoming instructions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Customary practice, and the spirit of Rule 30 require the judge to advise counsel prior to the summation of his proposed instructions on matters not covered by requests of counsel. See Wright v. United States, 339 F.2d 578 (9th Cir. 1964). The arguments below were not transcribed, but we assume defense counsel may well have summed up differently had he anticipated a larceny instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">Assuming, however, that the failure to inform defense counsel of the larceny charge before he summed up constituted error under Rule \u25a0 30, it lacked the prejudice necessary to constitute reversible error. While it is never possible to assert with absolute certitude that the result would not have been different if no error had been committed,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we feel confident that actual prejudice to the defendant was negligible, \u201can inconsequential sort and ought not to set aside the trial.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-13\">\u201cThe relative strength of the evidence against the defendant is a material factor in weighing whether trial errors require reversal.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here defendant\u2019s admission in open court established his intention and attempt to trick complainants. Under the circumstances the damage was done when appellant took the stand, and it is not likely that any variation in summation would have changed the verdict. Even assuming, arguendo, that the summation of defense counsel was more clear-cut in referring to defendant\u2019s larcenous intent than would have been the case if he had known the judge would charge on larceny as a lesser included offense, defendant\u2019s testimony, if made, influenced the jury to disbelieve that part of defendant\u2019s testimony which would have negatived grand larceny.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-14\">There is more difficulty with the contrary possibility, that counsel went beyond what defendant testified. It could be said, and in some cases properly, that the trial judge could not have anticipated this, that to some degree the charge may be shaped to the argument.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>there is circularity involved in beginning with the premise that the defense counsel should have advance knowledge of the instructions in order to shape his summation, and then saying that the content and quality of his summation properly led to a re-shape of instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">The present record does not permit reflective delineation of the applicable doctrine beyond taking account of the problem. The rule that emerges will likely depend on appraisal of reasonable range for both counsel and the trial judge in the particular situation. Certainly, however, the interest of justice is best served by diligent effort on the part of the trial judge to apply Rule 30, both in letter and in spirit. In this case we have been more ready to assume that the instruction was error because the possibility of lesser included offense was in the case from the time the defendant testified. In general the trial judge should withhold charging on lesser included offense unless one of the parties requests it, since that charge is not inevitably required in our trials, but is an issue best resolved, in our adversary system, by permitting counsel to decide on tactics. If counsel ask for a lesser-included-offense instruction, it should be freely given. <em>See </em>Belton v. United States, <em>supra </em>note 10. If it is not requested by counsel, it is properly omitted by the trial judge, and certainly should not be initiated by the judge after summations are completed, except possibly in an extreme case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Taking the situation before us in its probable ramifications we conclude that the interest of justice is served by affirmance on the ground of lack of substantial prejudice. We take into account, <em>inter alia, </em>that defense trial counsel did not request leave to make a supplementary summation, which might remove prejudice in some cases, and more significantly did not point out to the judge how the proposed instruction would work particular prejudice in the light of the summation counsel had already made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">3. This leads us to appellant\u2019s contention that the indictment did not give adequate notice of the charges to be met and that the variation between the indictment and the charge to the jury violates the Sixth Amendment. The indictment is, for legal purposes, sufficient notice to the defendant that he may be called to defend the lesser included charge. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 31(c). This established doctrine has been approved in our cases, most recently by our en banc opinion in Fuller v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-9\">The Rule, and its legislative forbear, proceed on the premise that the overall interest of justice lies in permitting an instruction of a lesser offense \u201cnecessarily included in the offense charged,\u201d and permitting the prosecution to seek a verdict on that offense even though it has failed to convince the jury of some element of the greater offense named in the indictment. Kelly v. United States, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 205, 370 F.2d 227 (1966), cert, denied, 388 U.S. 913, 87 S.Ct. 2127, 18 L.Ed.2d 1355 (1967). It may be that actual notice of this possibility is different from the notice implied by a rule of law, but there is no injustice in requiring the defense to be sensitive about the possible legal risks involved when the defendant is implicated in elements of a \u201clesser\u201d crime by his own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-10\">These risks are offset by possible benefits from the manifestation or at least appearance of candor on the part of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>It is beyond dispute that larceny is a necessarily lesser included offense of the crime of robbery. <em>See </em>Lamore v. United States, 78 U.S.App.D.C. 12, 136 F.2d 766 (1943).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While Crosby v. United States,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> cited by appellant, holds that assault with a deadly weapon is not a lesser included offense within a robbery charge, it reaffirms the availability of a larceny verdict on a robbery indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1179-14\">. 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2901 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1179-15\">. 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 502 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1179-16\">. 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2201 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1179-17\">.

At the same time copies of such requests shall be furnished to adverse parties. The court shall inform counsel of its proposed action upon the requests prior to their arguments to the jury, but the court shall instruct the jury after the arguments are completed. <em>No </em>party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection. Opportunity shall be given to make the objection out of the hearing of the jury and, on request of any party, out of the presence of the jury. As amended Feb. 28, 1966, eff.

Whether the requirements of Rule 30 are flexible and can bend to permit the court to conform its charge to issues underscored by closing argument of counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>is a question we need not answer. The premise of Rule 30 is that after all the evidence is submitted it is possible to structure the issues and that counsel should be advised of the court\u2019s thinking so it may argue appropriately. We can, however, envision a case where the need for an instruction becomes apparent only after closing arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1181-11\">. Here the matter was not initiated by the prosecutor; it was picked up by the prosecutor after the judge advanced the point.
