Her first application was filed in December 1960, and she then claimed that she had become unable to work in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>July or August 1953, as a result of injuries which she had sustained more than twenty years before. After extended administrative proceedings, which included a hearing, it was finally determined administratively, on November 6, 1962, that the application should be rejected. Central to the decision was the fact that the appellant had actually engaged in substantial gainful activity from November 1947 until September 1952 and that there had been no manifest change in her physical condition between the time \u201cwhen she was last employed and March 31, 1958, when she last met the earning requirements.\u201d The Appeals Council thereupon affirmed the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision, concluding that the appellant was not under \u201cdisability\u201d within the meaning of the Act when she filed her application in 1960. The appellant did not seek judicial review of the appellee\u2019s final administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Subsequently, on March 22, 1965, the appellant again applied for the establishment of a period of disability and for disability benefits. After this second application had been denied initially and again upon reconsideration, a hearing was conducted at the appellant\u2019s request. The hearing resulted in the Hearing Examiner\u2019s recommendation that the application be denied upon the ground that the earlier 1962 decision was, \u201cto all intents and purposes,\u201d a decision \u201cof administrative finality and is <em>res judicata </em>of the issues therein contained.\u201d Thereafter, on July 18, 1966, the Appeals Council entered its decision denying the application. It treated the second application, the one then before it, as an application to reopen its 1962 decision. It explained its denial to reopen by noting that some of the additional medical evidence was essentially repetitious of that considered in 1962 and that other portions of the new medical evidence related to physical problems of the appellant which had arisen after the expiration of her 1958 insured status. The Appeals Council also pointed out that there was no new evidence presented in connection with the second application which affected \u201cthe correctness of the decision of November 6, 1962.\u201d The appellant thereupon sought judicial review of this final administrative decision. The District Court concluded that it was without jurisdiction to review the Appeals Council\u2019s decision of July 18, 1966, and dismissed appellant\u2019s action. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The attorney for. the appellant has frankly conceded, in oral argument, that if the appellee correctly treated appellant\u2019s second application as an attempt to reopen the 1962 decision, she may not' successfully challenge the District Court\u2019s order of dismissal. Filice v. Celebrezze, 319 F.2d 443 (9th Cir. 1963); <em>accord, </em>McCunney v. Gardner, 374 F.2d 110 (3d Cir. 1967); Hobby v. Hodges, 215 F.2d 754 (10th Cir. 1954). <em>Compare, </em>Cappadora v. Celebrezze, 356 F.2d 1 (2d Cir. 1966). It is argued, however, that it was improper to treat the second application as a petition to reopen the earlier decision. This argument rests upon appellant\u2019s contention that the Appeals Council\u2019s explanation of reasons for its 1966 decision discloses that it made new factual and legal determinations and that hence, the second application was determined on the merits so that the District Court had jurisdiction to review. We cannot accept the argument. It is true that the Appeals Council reviewed some of the evidence presented in connection with the second application. It is also true that the appellant established, in the second proceeding, that she had earned only approximately $10,000 during a certain period, rather than the approximate $13,000 which was thought to be the correct amount when the 1962 decision was made. This discrepancy, however, as the Appeals Council pointed out in its second decision, was not of such significance as to affect the earlier determination. Our review of the record convinces us, as the District Court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>convinced, that the appellant presented no new and different claim in her second application from that which was presented in the 1960 application. In presenting the 1965 application, the appellant sought to establish that she was under disability during the same period as that with which the 1960 application was concerned. The issue had been fully and fairly determined in the earlier proceeding, and we cannot see that the challenged 1966 decision was erroneous, either on the basis of the application of administrative discretion or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The fact that the appellee carefully expressed reasons in support of its 1966 decision not to reopen the earlier determination cannot, and should not, be held to convert the 1966 decision denying reopening, admittedly not judicially reviewable in the absence of expressed explanation, into a decision which the courts are empowered to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">It is called to our attention that the Act was amended in 1965. One of these amendments altered the previous definition of \u201cdisability.\u201d When the appellant filed her 1960 application, the statutory definition contemplated the loss of substantial gainful activity for a \u201clong-continued and indefinite duration.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(i) (1) (1964). The 1965 amendment changed the quoted language to read \u201cfor a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d Pub. L. 89-97 \u00a7 303(a) (1), 79 Stat. 366 (1965). During oral argument, appellant\u2019s counsel conceded that the particular amendment is not, in the particular circumstances of this case, material. The final administrative decision of 1962 held that the appellant was not under \u201cdisability\u201d during the period in question. It therefore follows that the 1965 amendment, pertaining to mere <em>duration </em>of dis\u00e1bility, rather than disability itself, was of no consequence in affecting either the second decision of the appellee or the determination made by the District Court and is of no consequence here.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
