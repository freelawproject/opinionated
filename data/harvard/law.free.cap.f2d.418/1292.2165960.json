Jenkins, who lived in St. Louis, Missouri, is entitled to a deduction under 26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 162(a) (2) for expenses incurred at Springfield, Illinois, for travel, meals and lodging while he was performing services at Springfield during the taxable years 1958, 1959 and 1960 as deputy president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. During each of such years and the preceding three years, taxpayer was in Springfield from 227 to 305 days. He performed no duty for his employer in St. Louis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-11\">The Tax Court upheld the Commissioner\u2019s determination that taxpayer\u2019s tax home was at Springfield and that reimbursed expenses which he received from the Brotherhood for travel to and meals and lodging at Springfield were not deductible business expenses during the tax years involved in this litigation, and that the money so received constituted taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-12\">The Tax Court\u2019s opinion is unofficially reported at 1967 P-H Memo T.C., par. 67,257, and 26 T.C.M. 1328. Taxpayer concedes that the basic facts are fairly stated by the Tax Court in its opinion but he challenges the inferences and conclusions drawn by the Tax Court. No purpose will be served by setting out the extensive factual background in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-13\">The Tax Court followed the established legal principles in determining the meaning of the words \u201caway from home\u201d as used in \u00a7 162, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1355-14\">\u201cThe meaning of the phrase \u2018away from home\u2019 in the tax sense has often been litigated, and the guiding principle which has evolved is that one\u2019s tax home is determined by the principal place of one\u2019s business or employment. If there is a change in duty station then often resolution of the problem must be based upon a factual distinction between temporary employment and indefinite or indeterminate employment. Peurifoy v. Commissioner [of Internal Revenue], 358 U.S. 59, 61, [79 S.Ct. 104, 3 L.Ed.2d 30] (1958), and cases there cited. If after a careful examination of all the facts and circumstances of a particular case it is determined that the taxpayer\u2019s employment at the questioned location is temporary, expenditures for travel including food and lodging will qualify as away-from-home expenditures. Not so, however, if it is indefinite or indeterminate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8cq\">See Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Stidger, 386 U.S. 287, 87 S.Ct. 1065, 18 L.Ed.2d 53; Peurifoy v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 358 U.S. 59, 79 S. Ct. 104, 3 L.Ed.2d 30; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Flowers, 326 U.S. 465, 66 S.Ct. 250, 90 L.Ed. 203; Filler v.

United States, 6 Cir., 408 F.2d 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">The issue of what constitutes a tax home is ordinarily one of fact. Peurifoy v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra; Wills v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra; Cockrell v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">A thorough examination of the record before us satisfies us that the Tax Court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence and are not induced by any erroneous view of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-6\">The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
