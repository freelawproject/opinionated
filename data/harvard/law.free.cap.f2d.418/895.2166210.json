The district court held the taxpayer could deduct his and his wife\u2019s expenses. The Government has not appealed from the allowance of his expenses, but asserts there is insufficient evidence to bring the wife\u2019s expenses within the statutory provisions of Section 162(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-16\">Taxpayer\u2019s eighty-six day trip was partly business and partly pleasure. At least thirty-two days were \u201cpure pleasure,\u201d or \u201cmostly a vacation\u201d in taxpayer\u2019s own words. About forty days were part business, but included some sightseeing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-17\">The Government states, and there is no denial, that the record discloses:</p>\n<p id=\"b958-18\">\u201cThe taxpayer did not sell wheat directly to any of the people he contacted on his trip in 1963 because such foreign sales were beyond the scope of his operation and his facilities. (Dep. 96; II-R. 66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b958-19\">\u201cThe taxpayer\u2019s wife does not work on the ranch, is not a partner in the ranch business, and is not engaged in public relations for either the ranch or the wheat industry in this country. Instead, she spends most of her energy on women\u2019s club work and on conservation matters and leaves the public relations work to her husband. She is not an expert miller or baker and she is not a nutrition expert or anything of that sort. (II-R. 64-65, 97; Dep. 39, 69-70.)</p>\n<p id=\"b958-20\">\u201cOn the 1963 trip, the taxpayer\u2019s wife accompanied her husband to business meetings. For example she was with him at a luncheon with flour millers outside of Tokyo, on an evening of business and pleasure when he met with the agricultural attache in Tokyo, at a demonstration of the use of wheat as a product being promoted by the Oregon Wheat Growers Association, and at a noodle factory when it was shown how noodles were made out of wheat, which taxpayer\u2019s wife found particularly interesting. Taxpayer\u2019s wife was intensely interested in the wheat program for she had been interested in the initial creation of the Oregon Wheat Commission and the wheat tax to promote the sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>wheat, and she was very much interested in seeing the progress that had been made in the market development program. She did not remember having advised Government trial counsel that she did not have a business purpose for the trip. Instead, she testified that if there had not been any business interest for taking the trip, there would not have been any trip. She did not testify that she had a specific business purpose to perform for her husband and she remembered that she anticipated the pleasure of the trip with a great deal of excitement. (II-R. 73-75.)</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">\u201cTaxpayer testified that he talks to his wife generally about business and that she helps him think. He also testified that she attended the business meetings on the trip and addressed a nutrition group once. (II-R. 56-57.) Taxpayer also testified that he thought her presence on the trip as his wife helped in establishing better personal relationships with the business people he contacted than would have been possible had he traveled alone. (II-R. 60-61; Dep. 69-70.)\u201d (Brief for Appellant, pp. 11-12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">While <em>interested </em>in her husband\u2019s business, the wife had no specific business <em>purpose </em>in making the trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\"> We. believe the district court erred, after finding the husband\u2019s trip had a business purpose, in finding the wife\u2019s participation was \u201cof equal importance to that of her husband,\u201d and her expenses therefore a part of taxpayer\u2019s ordinary and necessary business expense. We not only hold the court\u2019s findings was factually erroneous, but erroneous as a matter of law. A wife\u2019s travel expenses are not deductible unless it is shown that she provided <em>substantial </em>services <em>directly </em>and <em>primarily </em>related to the carrying on of her husband\u2019s <em>business. </em>We cannot hold \u201cthe particular matter under review is covered by the specific statutory provision relating to it.\u201d Blaine\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 22 T.C. 1195, 1212 (1954). In short, we agree with the Commissioner that the evidence discloses that \u201cthe alleged \u2018business\u2019 function of taxpayer\u2019s wife was to be a socially gracious wife, not a professional business woman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">Nor was the taxpayer\u2019s trip taken, or the wife\u2019s expenses incident thereto incurred, because of any \u201cexigencies\u201d of the taxpayer\u2019s business. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Flowers, 326 U.S. 465, 470, 474, 66 S.Ct. 250, 90 L.Ed. 203 (1946); Treas. Regulations, 26 C.F.R. Sec. 1.162-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">The judgment of the district court allowing deduction for the expenses of taxpayer\u2019s wife is reversed, and the matter remanded to the district court for such further proceedings as will permit the taxpayers to prove what part of the claimed deductions are his and what part hers.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-13\">. The precise division of days between \u201cpleasure\u201d and \u201cbusiness\u201d is described in detail in the Government\u2019s Brief, pages 8-11.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
