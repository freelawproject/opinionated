The judgment is premised on findings and conclusions determining that appellee was entitled to and did rescind certain contracts with appellant and was thus entitled to recover back monies paid to appellant. Our review of the record shows more than ample support for each of the trial court\u2019s findings, no error in law in the court\u2019s conclusions, and we affirm the judgment for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s memorandum decision. 305 F.Supp. 134, D.C. Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, the correctness of the judgment below is not premised nor dependent on a finding or conclusion that the subject agreements were or were not severable. The liability of appellant would follow in either instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
