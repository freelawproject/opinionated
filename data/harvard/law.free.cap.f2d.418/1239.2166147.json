Both in the case of testimony with respect to some gloves that were being carried by appellant and the government witness\u2019 testimony of an oral \u201cinculpatory statement,\u201d we conclude that the trial court properly held that there was no violation of Rule 16. There is no showing that would permit us to hold that the trial court erred in concluding that with respect to either of these items, the government was aware of them until the day of the trial. See in this connection Miller v. Pale, 386 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 785,17 L.Ed.2d 690,1967; Levin v. Katzenbach, D.C.Cir., 1966, 363 F.2d 287; and Jackson v. Wainwright, 5 Cir., 1968, 390 F.2d 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-14\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
