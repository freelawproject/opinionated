Venere, 5 Cir. 1969, 416 F.2d 144, September 9, 1969, and Simmons v. United States, 1968, 390 U.S. 377, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247. The trial court did not err in admitting the in-court identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">As to the second argument, the check in evidence was identified by official records of the proper government official as being a check issued to one Raymond Gallion; Gallion testified that he never received the check; the witnesses testified that the signature on the check in evidence had been placed there by appellant Hughes. It was not disputed that Hughes was not the payee, Gallion. No further proof of identification of this check described in the information was required. It was not error for the court to admit the check in evidence. If this check is shown to be the one stolen and is shown to be the one falsely endorsed by forging of the name of the payee, there is no requirement that the government show who had custody at each moment between the issuing of the check and the time of trial. See Robinson v. United States, 1960, 109 U.S.App.D.C. 22, 283 F.2d 508, cert. den. 364 U.S.. 919, 81 S.Ct. 282, 5 L.Ed.2d 259, setting forth the guidelines to be applied in deciding the sufficiency of continuity of possession of such an allegedly stolen document.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1285-10\">.
