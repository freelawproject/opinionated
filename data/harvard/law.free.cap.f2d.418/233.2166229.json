His Local Board classified him as 1-0 (conscientious objector).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-24\">In our opinion there was basis for this classification. This is all that the law requires. United States v. Mulloy, 412 F.2d 421 (6th Cir. 1969). We find no error in the Court\u2019s instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-25\">Appellant had a personal appearance before the Board. He did not appeal his classification. Later the State Selective Service Headquarters requested the Board to allow appellant to appeal, which he did, and the Appeals Board classified him I-O. We do not construe the request as one to reopen the classification. We find no failure on the part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>of the Board to accord to appellant his procedural rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">We regard the summary of the meeting of the Local Board, held on April 27, 1966, as a substantial compliance with Selective Service Regulation 1666.20(c) and as authorization to the Clerk to issue the order to report for civilian work. United States v. Boroski, 412 F.2d 668 (6th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Other claims of appellant have been considered and are deemed to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The sentence of .five years\u2019 imprisonment would seem to us to be rather severe. We do not have before us the presentence report which may have justified the sentence. The District Court, however, will have the opportunity to consider reduction of the sentence if request is made under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. United States v. Mulloy, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">District Judge BROWN did not join in the preceding paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ajy\">. 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 462 Appendix.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
