The developer and seller filed a cross-complaint for indemnification against various subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">Three subcontractors moved for summary judgment on the cross-complaint on the ground it was barred by section 337.15. The superior court granted their motions. The developer and seller, as well as the buyer, appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-12\">We reach the following conclusions. First, the exemption from the 10-year statute of limitations for \u201cactions based on willful misconduct\u201d (\u00a7 337.15, subd. (f)) applies to cross-complaints for indemnity. Second, a willful misconduct claim may be made in a cross-complaint by way of incorporating by reference allegations contained in the complaint. Third, because of these two conclusions and because triable issues of material fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>regarding the willful misconduct claim are present here, the trial court erred in granting the subcontractors\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Accordingly, the judgment will be reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\n<em>Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Plaintiff Pine Terrace Apartments, L.P. (Buyer), is a California limited partnership. Buyer purchased a 256-unit apartment complex located at 353 and 373 West Nees Avenue, Fresno, California, commonly known as the Windscape Apartments (Apartments). Cal-Neva Asset Management Co., Inc., is the general partner of Buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">Defendants and cross-complainants are (1) Windscape, LLC, a Washington limited liability company; (2) Windscape, L.P., a California limited partnership; (3) Andrade Development Company, a California corporation; and (4) Eugene J. Andrade, an individual who (a) is the managing member of Windscape, LLC, (b) is the president of Andrade Development Company, and (c) was alleged to have been the general partner of Windscape, L.P. For purposes of this opinion, these four parties will be referred to collectively as Developer-Seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">Windscape, L.P., was the original owner and developer of the Apartments. Andrade Development Company was the general contractor and builder. Windscape, L.P., transferred the Apartments to Windscape, LLC, which became the owner of record of the Apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">Cross-defendants are (1) Jeffrey Scott, Inc., doing business as Western Products Co. (Western), (2) Avila Cement, and (3) Weber-Iness Associates (collectively, Subcontractors).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-11\">\n<em>Apartments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b29-12\">Construction of the Apartments began in 1989 and ended in 1991. Weber-Iness Associates, an architecture firm, contracted to prepare the plans for the construction of the Apartments. The written contract for the architectural services to be provided by Weber-Iness Associates expressly excluded any construction or supervision of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Avila Cement contracted with Developer-Seller to supply concrete foundations and flatwork for the Apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Western manufactured and installed the windows for the Apartments pursuant to an oral agreement with Developer-Seller. Western admits that it installed the windows without flashing paper, but asserts that its work complied with the building code and with the standard practice at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">A notice of completion for the 373 West Nees parcel was recorded with the Fresno County Recorder\u2019s Office on October 31, 1990. The notice of completion for the 353 West Nees parcel was recorded on May 1, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">In 2002, Buyer and Developer-Seller entered agreements for the sale of the Apartments. Escrow for the sale closed on May 13, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\n<em>Alleged Defects</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">Buyer alleges that, after the sale, it became aware of numerous and pervasive defects and damage throughout the Apartments. The alleged defects include damaged and defective roofing, balconies, flashing, trim, pavement, and sidewalks. Buyer expressed particular concern with water and mold damage caused by the absence of any flashing around all windows in the Apartments. Buyer asserts that Eugene J. Andrade knew flashing had not been installed at the Apartments and did not disclose the absence of flashing to Buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">Buyer presented the opinion of Adam Posard regarding the absence of flashing. Posard is licensed by California as an architect and a general building contractor. Posard inspected the Apartments and viewed photographs taken by an architect and contractor who performed repairs to the Apartments in 2006. Posard stated that flashing has been used by builders for generations and is required by the Uniform Building Code. He stated his opinion that \u201cthe only reason the General Contractor and its subcontractors would omit the required flashing is to save money, at the expense and harm to any subsequent purchaser of the property.\u201d In Posard\u2019s opinion, the omission of the flashing was the result of willful misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">In its separate statement, Western asserted that its \u201cinstallation of the windows without flashing paper was open and obvious to any person monitoring, inspecting or working on the job site.\u201d Developer-Seller disputed this assertion of fact, contending that the omission was not open and obvious because Eugene J. Andrade \u201chad no knowledge that flashing paper could be installed around windows until after the pending case was filed.\u201d In contrast, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Buyer did not dispute Western\u2019s assertion of fact but made evidentiary objections to the declarations Western filed to support its assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">Western\u2019s moving papers and the opposition papers indicate that the parties dispute (1) whether Western\u2019s installation of windows complied with the Uniform Building Code and the City of Fresno Building Code and (2) whether, at the time of installation, the City of Fresno required flashing paper to be installed with the windows. Those papers also establish, and the parties do not dispute, that City of Fresno officials inspected and approved the window installation, although Buyer objected to the evidence Western submitted to support this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\n<em>Pleadings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Buyer filed a complaint against Developer-Seller and Does 1 through 1,000 on May 17, 2004. On October 15, 2004, Buyer filed a first amended complaint (FAC) that included claims for negligence, strict liability, breach of contract, breach of implied and express warranty, bond liability, express contractual indemnity, and concealment arising out of the construction and sale of the Apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Buyer alleged that Developer-Seller and the Doe defendants defectively built the Apartments and their work was so defective that it \u201cwas of a quality amounting to reckless disregard and/or willful misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">Developer-Seller filed a cross-complaint, naming as cross-defendants over a dozen subcontractors that worked on the Apartments, including Western, Avila Cement and Weber-Iness Associates. Developer-Seller\u2019s operative pleading against the Subcontractors is its first amended cross-complaint for declaratory relief, implied equitable indemnity, and express contractual indemnity, which was filed October 6, 2006 (Cross-Complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">The Cross-Complaint does not use the term \u201cwillful misconduct,\u201d but does incorporate by reference the allegations of the FAC. Further details regarding the allegations of the FAC and the Cross-Complaint are set forth in part m.B., <em>post.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">\n<em>Motions for Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b31-12\">In February 2007, Developer-Seller and Western both filed motions for summary judgment. Developer-Seller asserted the claims in Buyer\u2019s FAC were barred by the 10-year statute of limitations set forth in section 337.15. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Similarly, Western asserted Developer-Seller\u2019s Cross-Complaint against it was barred by section 337.15 because the FAC and Cross-Complaint were filed more than 10 years after completion of the Apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The superior court chose to hear Developer-Seller\u2019s motion for summary judgment before Western\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\n<em>Developer-Seller\u2019s Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Buyer opposed Developer-Seller\u2019s motion for summary judgment by contending that the 10-year limitations period does not apply (1) in cases of willful misconduct, (2) to persons in actual possession or control of the property at any time a defect proximately causes damage to the property, or (3) in cases of fraudulent concealment. Buyer also disputed that notices of completion were filed in 1990 and 1991 on the grounds that the notices constituted hearsay and had not been properly authenticated, and that judicial notice could not be taken of their contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Buyer also submitted the declaration of Posard to support its argument that a triable issue of material fact existed regarding whether Developer-Seller\u2019s actions constituted willful misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">In May 2007, the superior court determined (1) Developer-Seller had not met its burden of establishing when the Apartments were substantially completed and (2) triable issues of material fact existed regarding the willful misconduct exemption and the owner-in-possession exemption from the 10-year statute of limitations. Specifically, the court stated Buyer raised a triable issue of fact regarding whether Developer-Seller\u2019s failure to install flashing amounted to willful misconduct. The court denied Developer-Seller\u2019s motion for summary judgment but granted summary adjudication as to four of the 13 causes of action in the FAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">\n<em>Subcontractors\u2019 Summary Judgment Motions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">In June 2007, the superior court heard the Subcontractors\u2019 motions for summary judgment. The court sustained evidentiary objections regarding foundation and authenticity made by Developer-Seller to the copies of the notices of completion submitted by the Subcontractors in support of their motions. Based on its evidentiary rulings regarding the notices of completion, the court concluded that the Subcontractors had failed to establish that the 10-year limitations period expired before the filing of the complaint. Therefore, the court denied the Subcontractors\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>On July 2, 2007, Avila Cement filed a petition for a writ of mandate with this court <em>(Avila Cement v. Superior Court </em>(Aug. 2, 2007, F053192)), asserting that the superior court had erred by excluding the notice of completion from evidence. On July 10, 2007, this court issued an alternative writ directing the superior court either to show cause why the requested relief should not issue or to (1) set aside its June 2007 order denying the motion to take judicial notice and its related order denying Avila Cement\u2019s motion for summary judgment; (2) grant the motion for judicial notice; and (3) thereafter, reconsider the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">On July 20, 2007, the superior court responded to the alternative writ by taking judicial notice of the notices of completion and finding the Apartments were substantially completed on October 31, 1990, and May 1, 1991. Based on this finding and the filing dates of the pleadings, the court concluded the statute of limitations had run on the Cross-Complaint. It then granted the three Subcontractors\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">In August 2007, Developer-Seller filed a motion for reconsideration of the order granting the Subcontractors\u2019 motions for summary judgment. Buyer attempted to join in the motion for reconsideration. Both Developer-Seller and Buyer argued the superior court had failed to consider the willful misconduct exception to the 10-year limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The superior court denied the motion for reconsideration based on procedural grounds and the following three conclusions. First, Developer-Seller could not rely on the exemption in section 337.15, subdivision (f) because the Cross-Complaint made no allegations of willful misconduct. Second, Developer-Seller provided no evidence that the Subcontractors were guilty of willful misconduct or concealment. Third, section 337.15, subdivision (f) does not apply to cross-complaints for indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Both Buyer and Developer-Seller challenged the order granting Subcontractors\u2019 motions for summary judgment by filing petitions for writs of mandate with this court. Both petitions were summarily denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">\n<em>Motion for Fees and Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">In August 2007, Avila Cement, having prevailed on its motion for summary judgment, filed a motion for attorney fees and costs pursuant to section 1038. The motion asserted Developer-Seller\u2019s Cross-Complaint was brought and maintained without good faith or reasonable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">In September 2007, Weber-Iness Associates also filed a motion for attorney fees and costs pursuant to section 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The superior court granted the section 1038 motions for attorney fees and costs. It awarded Avila Cement $21,233.64 and Weber-Iness Associates $31,278.75.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">\n<em>Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Buyer asserts that its appeal challenges the July 20, 2007, order granting Western\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Developer-Seller\u2019s notice of appeal challenges the July 20, 2007, order granting the three Subcontractors\u2019 motions for summary judgment, and the related judgment, as well as the orders and judgment awarding Avila Cement and Weber-Iness Associates attorney fees and costs pursuant to section 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">II. <em>The 10-year Limitations Period and Willful Misconduct Exemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"AH\">A. <em>Statutory Provisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">Section 337.15 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) No action may be brought to recover damages from any person .. . who develops real property or performs or furnishes the design ... or construction of an improvement to real property more than 10 years after the substantial completion of the development or improvement for any of the following: [f] (1) Any latent deficiency in the design ... or construction of an improvement to, or survey of, real property. [$] (2) Injury to property, real or personal, arising out of any such latent deficiency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">This 10-year limitations period is subject to exemptions. For example, subdivision (c) of section 337.15 states: \u201cAs used in this section, \u2018action\u2019 includes an action for indemnity brought against a person arising out of that person\u2019s performance or furnishing of services or materials referred to in this section, except that a cross-complaint for indemnity may be filed pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 428.10 in an action which has been brought within the time period set forth in subdivision (a) of this section.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Subdivision (f) of section 337.15 provides: \u201cThis section shall not apply to actions based on willful misconduct or fraudulent concealment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">B. <em>Contentions of the Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Buyer contends the superior court erred in concluding the exemption contained in subdivision (f) of section 337.15 does not apply to cross-complaints for indemnity. Buyer and Developer-Seller argue the term \u201caction\u201d used in subdivision (f) of section 337.15 should be interpreted to include cross-complaints for indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">In contrast, Subcontractors contend that they are protected by the 10-year limitations period set forth in section 337.15. In addition to arguing in favor of the superior court\u2019s interpretation of subdivision (f), they assert the willful misconduct exemption does not apply to Developer-Seller\u2019s Cross-Complaint for indemnity because that pleading did not specifically allege willful misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">C. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">1. <em>Background on section 337.15</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">Generally, a lawsuit alleging a latent construction defect must be brought within three or four years (depending on the theory of recovery) after the plaintiff discovers, or should have discovered, the defect. <em>(Lantzy v. Centex Homes </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 363, 366 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 655, 73 P.3d 517] <em>(Lantzy).) </em>In 1971, the Legislature capped the open-ended nature of this discovery rule by enacting section 337.15, which \u201cestablished a further general rule that no action for latent construction defects may be commenced more than 10 years after \u2018substantial completion\u2019 of the construction project. [Citation.] This \u2018absolute\u2019 10-year limitations period applies regardless of when the defect was discovered.\u201d <em>(Lantzy, </em>at p. 366, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">The California Supreme Court\u2019s use of quotation marks around the word \u201cabsolute\u201d in <em>Lantzy </em>indicates that the 10-year limitations period cannot be regarded as absolute in all contexts. For example, \u201c[s]ection 337.15 itself provides several clear exemptions from the 10-year limit\u201d <em>(Lantzy, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 373), and our high court has recognized that a party might be equitably estopped from asserting that the 10-year period has expired <em>(id. </em>at p. 367).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>The two statutory exemptions relevant to our analysis are contained in subdivisions (c) and (f) of section 337.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">2. <em>Case law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Both Buyer and Developer-Seller rely on <em>Acosta </em>v. <em>Glenfed Development Corp. </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1278 [28 Cal.Rptr.3d 92] <em>(Acosta) </em>in support of their interpretation of subdivision (f) of section 337.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">In <em>Acosta, </em>the plaintiffs sued a developer/general contractor for construction defects in their homes. The developer/general contractor, in turn, sued various subcontractors for indemnification and on other theories. <em>(Acosta, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th at p. 1285.) The developer/general contractor moved for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was filed more than 10 years after substantial completion of their homes. The trial court determined that subdivision (f) of section 337.15 did not apply and granted the developer/general contractor\u2019s motion. <em>(Acosta, supra, </em>at p. 1285.) As a result, the trial court also granted the subcontractors\u2019 motion for summary judgment; the subcontractors could not be liable for indemnification when the developer/general contractor had prevailed against the plaintiffs. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1286-1287.)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The Court of Appeal reversed the trial court\u2019s order granting the developer/general contractor\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>(Acosta, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th at p. 1304.) The court concluded there was sufficient evidence in the record that a trier of fact could find (1) the subcontractors engaged in acts of willful misconduct in the construction of the plaintiffs\u2019 homes and (2) the facts and circumstances justified charging the developer/general contractor with the subcontractors\u2019 willful misconduct. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1301-1302.) The court partially based its conclusion on the declarations of the plaintiffs\u2019 experts. Those declarations identified many alleged defects, stated that the defects involved conspicuous failures to comply with the building code, and expressed the opinion that the defects could not be present without the tacit or express approval of the developer/general contractor. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1288-1289.)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The court also reversed the summary judgment in favor of the subcontractors on the ground that the reinstatement of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim against the developer/general contractor created the possibility that the subcontractors would be liable to indemnify the developer/general contractor. <em>(Acosta, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th at p. 1303.) The Court of Appeal declined to consider the substantive arguments raised by the subcontractors in support of their motions, concluding that the trial court should address those arguments in the first instance. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1304.)</p>\n<p id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Because the court in <em>Acosta </em>did not address the merits of the subcontractors\u2019 motions, we conclude that it did not actually decide whether the exemption in subdivision (f) of section 337.15 applied to cross-complaints for indemnity that alleged willful misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">Furthermore, the parties have cited, and we have located, no published opinion by a California court that has decided this issue of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">3. <em>Application of statutory definitions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">We will determine the meaning of subdivision (f) of section 337.15 by referring to various definitions set forth in the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">First, we return to subdivision (c) of section 337.15 because it appears to provide a partial definition of the word \u201caction.\u201d Subdivision (c) states in full: \u201cAs used in this section, \u2018action\u2019 includes an action for indemnity brought against a person arising out of that person\u2019s performance or furnishing of services or materials referred to in this section, except that a cross-complaint for indemnity may be filed pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 428.10 in an action which has been brought within the time period set forth in subdivision (a) of this section.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">The California Supreme Court has interpreted the first portion of subdivision (c) of section 337.15 to refer only to direct actions for indemnity. <em>(Valley Circle Estates </em>v. <em>VTN Consolidated, Inc. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 604, 611 [189 Cal.Rptr. 871, 659 P.2d 1160].) It has interpreted the second portion of subdivision (c) \u2014 the portion that begins \u201cexcept that\u201d \u2014 as \u201cclearly allowing] those parties who cannot be reached in a direct action to nonetheless be reached in a derivative action for indemnity pursuant to a cross-complaint brought in a direct action which has been timely filed under subdivision (a).\u201d <em>(Valley Circle Estates, </em>at pp. 610-611.)</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">The California Supreme Court\u2019s description of the second portion of subdivision (c) of section 337.15 contradicts Subcontractors\u2019 position that the term \u201caction\u201d excludes a cross-complaint for indemnity. Instead, the language used by our Supreme Court makes it clear that an indemnity claim pursued through a cross-complaint is an action, albeit a \u201cderivative action\u201d rather than a \u201cdirect action.\u201d <em>(Valley Circle Estates v. VTN Consolidated, Inc., supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 610.)</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Second, nothing in any portion of section 337.15 or the materials cited by the parties demonstrates that the Legislature intended to limit the willful misconduct exemption in subdivision (f) to <em>direct </em>actions and to subject <em>derivative </em>actions alleging willful misconduct to the 10-year limitations period. Further, common sense dictates that the term \u201caction\u201d used in subdivision (f) of section 337.15 applies to all actions, whether direct or derivative. If the term \u201caction\u201d in subdivision (f) were interpreted to mean only direct actions, then the Cross-Complaint would have been time-barred, but Developer-Seller still could pursue an indemnity claim based on willful misconduct in an exempt direct action. Accordingly, we will not interpret the term \u201caction\u201d to mean only direct actions. We can identify no policy reason for barring the use of cross-complaints when the same claim could be pursued in a direct action.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Third, the interpretation that the term \u201caction\u201d includes both direct and derivative actions is compatible with the rule of statutory construction that a court should not construe a statute to \u201cinsert what has been omitted\u201d by the Legislature. (\u00a7 1858.) In this case, it would violate section 1858 to construe subdivision (f) of section 337.15 to cover only \u201cdirect actions\u201d when the Legislature omitted the modifier \u201cdirect\u201d from the statutory text.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Fourth, our construction of section 337.15 also is consistent with the general provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure that define the terms \u201caction,\u201d \u201ccivil action,\u201d and \u201cpleading.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Initially, we note that section 21 identifies an action as one of two classes of judicial remedies \u2014 the other class is special proceedings. Section 22 sets forth the general definition of \u201caction\u201d as \u201can ordinary proceeding in a court of justice by which one party prosecutes another for the declaration, enforcement, or protection of a right, the redress or prevention of a wrong, or the punishment of a public offense.\u201d Under this broad definition, two kinds of action exist \u2014 civil and criminal. (\u00a7 24.) Section 30 defines a civil action as one \u201cprosecuted by one party against another for the declaration, enforcement or protection of a right, or the redress or prevention of a wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">In this case, Developer-Seller is proceeding in a court of justice by prosecuting the Subcontractors for a declaration of its right to indemnity. Thus, for purposes of section 30, Developer-Seller is pursuing a civil action against the Subcontractor. It necessarily follows that Developer-Seller is pursuing an action for purposes of section 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Furthermore, section 422.10 provides that \u201c[t]he pleadings allowed in civil actions are complaints, demurrers, answers, and cross-complaints.\u201d Thus, a cross-complaint is a type of pleading \u2014 that is, it is a document used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>to pursue an action, not the action itself. As a result, the term \u201caction\u201d cannot be interpreted to exclude claims pursued through a cross-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude the exemption from the 10-year statute of limitations for \u201cactions based on willful misconduct\u201d (\u00a7 337.15, subd. (f)) applies to derivative actions for indemnity that are pursued using a cross-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">III. <em>Incorporation by Reference to the Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\n<em>A. Contentions of the Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Developer-Seller contends that the trial court erred in concluding that the Cross-Complaint \u201cmakes no allegations of willful misconduct\u201d and granting summary judgment on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Developer-Seller\u2019s contention is based on the following grounds: (1) the Cross-Complaint effectively alleged willful misconduct against Subcontractors by incorporating by reference Buyer\u2019s FAC and (2) Subcontractors waived the issue regarding the sufficiency of the Cross-Complaint by failing to raise their challenge during the pleading stage. Buyer adds the arguments that (1) physically attaching a copy of the FAC to the Cross-Complaint was not required, (2) Western was on notice that the factual allegations in the FAC formed the basis for the Cross-Complaint and (3) \u201cany doubt as to which \u2018causes of action ... are irrelevant\u2019 can easily be resolved (and were resolved) through discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">Noting that the Cross-Complaint contained no specific allegations of willful misconduct, Subcontractors argue that the incorporation by reference of Buyer\u2019s FAC into the Cross-Complaint was insufficient to allege willful misconduct and to provide adequate notice of the claim against them. Weber-Iness Associates and Western further contend that Buyer never filed actions against Weber-Iness Associates and Western or amended its FAC to add them as Doe defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">B. <em>Contents of the Pleadings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">The operative pleadings central to this issue are Buyer\u2019s FAC filed October 15, 2004, and Developer-Seller\u2019s Cross-Complaint filed October 6, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">The relevant paragraphs within the FAC come under the heading, \u201cFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Against the Developers and Contractors for Negligence.\u201d In paragraph 13 of the FAC, Buyer describes \u201cDefendants Does 201 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>through 500\u201d as \u201csometimes collectively referred to as the \u2018Contractors\u2019 \u201d and those who \u201cdesigned, engineered, surveyed, provided specifications for, tested, graded, prepared the site for, assembled, manufactured, installed, supervised and provided other services and work related to the construction of the Property.\u201d Paragraph 14 of the FAC alleges: \u201cDefendants so negligently and defectively developed, constructed and provided the services, work and materials for the Property, as described above, as to directly cause numerous and pervasive defects and damages throughout the Property (the \u2018Deficiencies\u2019).\u201d In paragraph 15 of the FAC, Buyer alleges: \u201cDefendants\u2019 conduct, as above described, was of a quality amounting to reckless disregard and/or willful misconduct. In developing, constructing and providing the services, work and materials for the Property, as above described, defendants intentionally performed acts of an unreasonable character in disregard of risks known to them and/or so obvious that they must have been aware of them, and so great as to make it highly probable that harm in the nature of the Deficiencies would follow.\u201d Paragraphs 13, 14, and 15 were incorporated by reference into each cause of action contained in Buyer\u2019s FAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Paragraph 18 of the Cross-Complaint, under the heading \u201cGENERAL ALLEGATIONS,\u201d states: \u201cOn or about October 15, 2004, [Buyer] filed a first amended complaint (the \u2018Complaint\u2019) herein against [Developer-Seller]s seeking damages for negligence, strict liability, breach of contract, breach of implied warranty, breach of express warranty, bond liability, express contractual indemnity, and concealment. These claims arise out of the construction of an apartment complex located at 353 and 373 West Nees Avenue in Fresno, California (the \u2018Project\u2019). <em>The Complaint is incorporated herein by reference without admitting any of the allegations contained </em>therein.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">C. <em>Applicable Rule of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u201cThe phrase \u2018incorporation by reference\u2019 is almost universally understood, both by lawyers and nonlawyers, to mean the inclusion, within a body of a document, of text which, although physically separate from the document, becomes as much a <em>part </em>of the document as if it had been typed in directly.\u201d <em>(Republic Bank v. Marine Nat. Bank </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 919, 922 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 90].)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The statutory pleading requirements in the Code of Civil Procedure do not explicitly address the practice of incorporation by reference. The general requirement that a complaint or cross-complaint contain a \u201cstatement of the facts constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and concise language\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>(\u00a7 425.10, subd. (a)(1)) offers little guidance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, the California Rules of Court do not specifically address incorporation by reference used at the pleadings stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">Case law, however, does address the practice: \u201cThe general rule is that in the absence of restrictions imposed by statute or by rules of court, facts alleged in other pleadings in the same case may be incorporated by reference in subsequent pleadings therein. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Estate of Dargie </em>(1939) 33 Cal.App.2d 148, 157 [91 P.2d 126].)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Courts have applied this general rule to cross-complaints. \u201c[A] cross-complaint must itself be sufficient and cannot be cured by the pleadings in the original action, that is, the complaint and answer, apart from permissible incorporation by reference.\u201d <em>(Berg </em>v. <em>Investors Real Estate Loan Co. </em>(1962) 207 Cal.App.2d 808, 816 [24 Cal.Rptr. 701].)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">In <em>Turney v. Collins </em>(1941) 48 Cal.App.2d 381 [119 P.2d 954], the pleader in an amended answer and counterclaim incorporated by reference certain exhibits pleaded in the original answer. The court concluded there was \u201cnot the slightest reason\u201d for holding that a pleading could not incorporate by reference an exhibit or allegation found in another pleading in the same case, even though the pleading has been superseded by such later pleading. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 388.)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">One practice guide states that it generally is not good practice to incorporate by reference parts of other pleadings in the same lawsuit, even though there is no rule against it. (Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2008) ][ 6:239, p. 6-66 (rev. # 1, 2007).) The practice guide modifies this advice as follows: \u201cOne noteworthy exception: <em>Cross-complaints for indemnification </em>usually incorporate by reference the allegations of the complaint as a \u2018shorthand\u2019 way of showing the existence of the claim for which indemnification is sought.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">D. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Based on the authorities discussed above, we agree with Developer-Seller\u2019s contention that the Cross-Complaint effectively alleged willful misconduct against Subcontractors by incorporating by reference Buyer\u2019s FAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">Furthermore, our examination of the contents of the relevant pleadings in this case convinces us that the allegations incorporated by reference state that the Subcontractors engaged in willful misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Paragraph 13 of the FAC describes Doe defendants as \u201cContractors,\u201d who, in addition to performing the specific enumerated tasks listed in the paragraph, \u201cprovided other services and work\u201d related to the construction of the project. Paragraph 14 refers to defendants<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> who \u201cso negligently and defectively developed, constructed and provided the services, work and materials for the Property ... as to directly cause numerous and pervasive defects and damages . . . .\u201d Paragraph 15 of the FAC describes defendants\u2019 conduct as of a quality amounting to reckless disregard and/or willful misconduct, again using the language \u201cproviding the services, work and materials for the Property\u201d and setting forth the elements for willful misconduct. These three paragraphs are incorporated by reference into each cause of action in Buyer\u2019s FAC. The Cross-Complaint then incorporates by reference the entire FAC via the general allegations set forth in paragraph 18. Based on the language contained in both the FAC and Cross-Complaint, Subcontractors had sufficient notice that the indemnification claims against them included willful misconduct as a theory of recovery. The statutory requirement that a cross-complaint contain a statement of the facts constituting the cause of action in ordinary and concise language was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">E. <em>Conclusions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">We conclude that the general rule of law applicable to pleadings permits the Cross-Complaint to incorporate by reference allegations contained in the FAC. The FAC alleges that defendants \u2014 a term defined broadly enough to include the Subcontractors \u2014 engaged in willful misconduct. It follows that the Cross-Complaint contains an indemnification claim based on willful misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">We concluded earlier that the 10-year limitations period for latent construction defects does not apply to an indemnification claim based on willful misconduct and pursued using a cross-complaint. (\u00a7 337.15, subd. (f).) Therefore, we further conclude that the Cross-Complaint asserts a theory of recovery that is not barred by the 10-year limitations period set forth in section 337.15. Consequently, the order granting the Subcontractors\u2019 motions for summary judgment cannot be upheld on statute of limitations grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">IV., V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">The judgment in favor of cross-defendants Western, Avila Cement, and Weber-Iness Associates is reversed. The matter is remanded to the superior court for further proceedings and with directions to (1) vacate its July 20, 2007, order granting cross-defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment and (2) vacate its orders granting the motions of Avila Cement and Weber-Iness Associates for attorney fees and costs pursuant to section 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Plaintiff and defendants/cross-complainants shall recover their costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Levy, Acting P.
