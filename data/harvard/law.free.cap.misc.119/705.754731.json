It is conceded that in the month of September, 1920, plaintiff was employed by defendant under an agreement whereby he was placed in charge of a corps of salesmen for the purpose of selling to the public on a partial payment plan a certain part of the capital stock of defendant and that the compensation to be paid him for his services was five per cent on the par value of $100 of all stock subscriptions obtained by and through the efforts of the salesmen and twenty-five per cent on all subscriptions obtained individually by plaintiff, it being the contention of plaintiff that these commissions were to be paid upon the procuring and delivery to defendant of the subscriptions in question. The defense interposed is that the contract of hiring provided that the commissions to be paid plaintiff were to be estimated on all sums of money actually paid in by subscribers to the stock in the defendant corporation on subscriptions obtained by plaintiff or his salesmen. It was conceded by defendant on the trial that subscriptions for 532 shares of such stock obtained by the salesmen were turned into defendant by plaintiff together with a subscription for 12 shares obtained by plaintiff personally. Plaintiff testified that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>May or June, 1921, Siggins, secretary of defendant, checked up plaintiff\u2019s account and found due him $1,860 and told him to see Evans, the treasurer, which plaintiff did and that Evans said \u201c we admit owing you this amount and would like to settle with you now but we haven\u2019t got the money to do it.\u201d He suggested that plaintiff should write a letter to the company. This plaintiff did as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">\u201c The Arto Co.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMh\">\u201c <em>June </em>13, 1921\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">\u201c Central Avenue,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">\u201cWest Orange, N.

Thereupon plaintiff rested and defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was denied. Defendant then rested and moved for a directed verdict and that motion was granted, the trial judge holding that the agreement between plaintiff and defendant signed on April 21, 1921, to the effect that the rate of commission on any stock previously sold or thereafter to be sold would be twenty per cent on all moneys actually paid thereon. There are several errors assigned by plaintiff for a reversal of this judgment and there is considerable merit back of each of them. The real issue between the parties was <em>first, </em>as to when plaintiff\u2019s commissions became payable, and <em>second, </em>whether such commissions were to be based on moneys actually paid by subscribers or only on the par of their subscriptions. In view of defendant\u2019s concession that-subscriptions received by defendant through\u2019plaintiff\u2019s salesmen amounted to 532 shares of a par value of $53,200 on which admittedly plaintiff was entitled to a commission of five per cent, or $2,660, and that plaintiff personally obtained subscription for 12 shares of a par value of $1,200 on which he was entitled to a commission of twenty-five per cent, or $300, making in all commissions of $2,960 upon which payment of $950 had been made by defendant leaving unpaid a balance of $2,010, I think that plaintiff made out a <em>prima facie </em>case which required rebuttal. But in addition to this concession the plaintiff\u2019s case was materially strengthened by the proof submitted that Siggins, defendant\u2019s secretary, in May or June, 1921, had checked up plaintiff\u2019s account and found that there was due plaintiff $1,860 and which was subsequently confirmed by defendant\u2019s treasurer with the statement that if the defendant had the money the account would be liquidated for that sum. Furthermore, it was at the suggestion of Evans that plaintiff wrote the defendant relative to the non-payment of his commission account and that letter together with the reply thereto by the president of defendant was competent proof on the main question at issue as to when and on what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>basis plaintiff\u2019s commissions were payable. If these communications had been received in evidence plaintiff\u2019s proof would have been materially augmented and would no doubt have resulted in a denial of the motion for a directed verdict notwithstanding the agreement of April 21, 1921, which we conclude was improperly received over plaintiff\u2019s objection and exception. This paper writing provided in effect that the rate of commission on any stock previously sold or to be sold for defendant would be twenty per cent on any and all moneys actually received only. While it is true that this memorandum was signed by plaintiff and all his salesmen it is plainly apparent so far as plaintiff is concerned that aside from its lack of consideration, it is not binding on plaintiff in view of the admissions of defendant through its officials in the month of May or June following that there was due plaintiff $1,860 on the five and twenty-five per cent basis above referred to. Finding as we do that plaintiff made out a <em>prima facie </em>case it follows that the judgment should be reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Guy and Bijur, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
