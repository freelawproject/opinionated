It seems to us, however, that this order meets the test laid down in all the cases, whether the particular order there happens to have been sustained or condemned, namely, that it had direct relation to the facilitation of the transport of troops, war materials and supplies. We assume that we cannot sit in review on the wisdom or advisability of the order, and that its validity is to be determined by the fact that it has a reasonable relation to the purpose for which <em>\u201c </em>federal control \u201d of railroads was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-15\">Judgment reversed, with thirty dollars costs, and complaint dismissed on the merits, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-16\">All concur; present, Guy, Bijur and Delehanty, JJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-17\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
