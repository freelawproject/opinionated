There is no need, however, of determining that question since the learned judge below ruled that defendant was not entitled as matter of law to set up the defense of usury. In this we think he was in error. The ruling was based on the reasoning that defendant could not <em>\u201c </em>set up in his own defense usury in the notes which his brother made * * \u201d that defendant <em>\u201c </em>is not a party to the note * * * not even as endorser can you do it.\u201d Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>argued, as he does now, that the usurious notes being void the checks given therefor were without consideration. In support of this view he quotes from the language of the opinion in <em>Sabine </em>v. <em>Paine, </em>223 N. Y. 404: \u201c An instrument which a statute, expressly or through necessary implication, declares void, strictly speaking, is a <em>simulacrum </em>only. It is without legal efficacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">This language, however, was used to meet the claim that the Negotiable Instruments Law in its provisions defining the rights of a <em>bona fide </em>holder for value had practically changed the existing rule so that an instrument void in its inception might be good in the hands of such holder. The phrase quoted was not, in our opinion, intended to modify the long-standing and just principle that usury was a \u201c personal defense \u201d available only to the maker of a usurious instrument and his privies; or as it is sometimes said not available to a <em>\u201c </em>stranger.\u201d Respondent contends here, as he did in the court below, that defendant is such a stranger, in which we do not concur. One who volunteers to pay another\u2019s note is not a stranger, but so far as the circumstances of payment go stands practically in the shoes of the maker. The case seems to us to be quite analogous to that of the accommodation maker of negotiable paper who is undoubtedly entitled to set up this defense. <em>Catlin </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>11 N. Y. 368; <em>Claflin </em>v. <em>Boorum, </em>122 id. 385. It is evident that a note cannot be paid except on behalf of the one who is obligated thereon. Plaintiff testified repeatedly that defendant did not even pretend to buy the notes but to pay them.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Upon these facts it is our opinion that defendant was as much entitled as the maker himself to interpose the defense of usury.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with thirty dollars costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">All concur; present, Guy, Bijur and Delehanty, JJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
