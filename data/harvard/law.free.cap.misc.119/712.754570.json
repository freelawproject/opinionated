The defendant set up the statutory defense, and plaintiff on an affidavit showing that defendant was in the possession of premises demised to be occupied <em>\u201c </em>as a private dwelling and a doctor\u2019s office \u201d for a term beginning October 1, 1920, moved to strike out the defense upon the authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>of <em>Farnham Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Posner, </em>200 App. Div. 827, and from the order denying the motion the plaintiff appeals by permission of the justice who made the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">There is no warrant for the plaintiff\u2019s practice. Under the Municipal Court Code (\u00a7 88) all objections, other than to the jurisdiction, which might have been taken by demurrer may be taken by motion. As the defect must appear upon the face of the pleading to be open to demurrer, the objections referred to under that section are not such as may be shown by affidavit. Nor is there anything in the Rules of Civil Practice which authorizes a motion to strike out a defense upon affidavits. It is not claimed that the defense is either sham or frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Order affirmed, with ten dollars costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">All concur; present, Guy, Bijur and Delehanty, JJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
