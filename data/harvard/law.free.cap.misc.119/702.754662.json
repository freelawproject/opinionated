The proof establishes convincingly that during the entire course of dealings between plaintiff and defendant premiums were paid to a broker clothed with apparent authority to make collections on behalf of the plaintiff. The premiums sued for were paid by the defendant to said broker following the usual course of dealings between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The defense of payment having been fully established, judgment should have been rendered in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Judgment reversed, with thirty dollars costs, and judgment directed in favor of the defendant, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Bijur and Delehanty, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
