We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">In the first paragraph of the syllabus of <em>Recording Devices, Inc. v. Bowers </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 518, 23 O.O.2d 150, 190 N.E.2d 258, we stated: \u201cEstoppel does not apply against the state of Ohio as to a taxing statute.\u201d However, we qualified this pronouncement at 520, 23 O.O.2d at 151, 190 N.E.2d at 260: \u201c * * * yet where a long-established practice has been followed, such administrative practice does have much persuasive weight especially where the practice has gone on unchallenged for a quarter of a century.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">In <em>Recording Devices, supra, </em>and in <em>Ormet Corp. v. Lindley </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 263, 266, 23 O.O.3d 257, 259, 431 N.E.2d 686, 689, we acknowledged the commissioner\u2019s grant of an exemption. In both of those cases, \u201c * * * an exemption was granted, in writing, by the commissioner. Further, the error continued for an extended period of time.\u201d (In <em>Recording Devices, </em>it continued for twenty-five years; in <em>Ormet, </em>over twenty years.)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Here, we have no evidence of any longstanding administrative practice to exempt appellant from liability. Accordingly, the decision of the BTA is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b231-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, H.
