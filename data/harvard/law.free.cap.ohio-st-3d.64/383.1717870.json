In <em>Franklin Cty. Sheriff's Dept. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 498, 589 N.E.2d 24, we rejected arguments identical to those advanced in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">Paragraph one of the syllabus in <em>Franklin Cty. Sheriffs Dept. </em>holds:</p>\n<p id=\"A3m\">\u201cInvestigatory files compiled by the State Employment Relations Board pursuant to R.C. 4117.12 must be disclosed upon request pursuant to R.C. 4117.17 and 149.43 unless an <em>in camera </em>inspection demonstrates that all or any portions of the files are excepted from disclosure. Excepted information may be redacted prior to disclosure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">The appellate court, here, inspected the records <em>in camera </em>and found nothing to except or redact. Accordingly, we affirm the issuance of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">However, SERB validly questions the breadth of the appellate court\u2019s decision. In the <em>Eaton </em>case, it is undisputed SERB did not submit certain records it considered to be its work product and not sought by Eaton. The court of appeals referee, apparently without reviewing these records, nevertheless recommended that SERB be ordered to disclose its entire investigatory file. Thus, we limit the writ to the submitted records.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals issuing the writ. However, in the <em>Eaton </em>case, we limit the court of appeals\u2019 decision to the submitted records. If Eaton seeks the withheld records, the court of appeals shall inspect them <em>in camera, </em>pursuant to <em>Franklin Cty. Sheriffs Dept., supra, </em>and rule upon their disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, as modified.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b534-14\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
