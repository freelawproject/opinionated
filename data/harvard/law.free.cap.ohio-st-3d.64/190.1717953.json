The commission concedes that its order does not comply with <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245. The claimant, conversely, alleges a lack of some evidence supporting the commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Both parties are correct. The commission\u2019s boilerplate recitation of nonmedical disability factors does not satisfy <em>Noll. Noll </em>noncompliance, however, is overshadowed by the lack of \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s order. The only evidence relied on by the commission is the September 26, 1988 communication from the commission\u2019s rehabilitation division to the commission\u2019s legal section. That communication reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u201cThis memo is to advise you that Mr. Ronnie Wilcox (BWC#PE675765) has not completed the evaluations authorized by this agency as a result of his motion for permanent total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u201cMr. Wilcox has twice failed to appear for appointments scheduled for multidisciplinary evaluations at the J. Leonard Camera Center. This failure to appear has generated the closure of his case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">This communication is not \u201csome evidence\u201d indicating that claimant is capable of sustained remunerative employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The appellate court agreed that the commission\u2019s order constituted an abuse of discretion. In addition to vacating the order, however, the court directed the commission to suspend further consideration of claimant\u2019s application for permanent total disability compensation until claimant submitted to a rehabilitation evaluation. The court based its action on claimant\u2019s refusal to submit to scheduled rehabilitation evaluations and on former R.C. 4123.53, which stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">\u201cAny employee claiming the right to receive compensation may be required by the industrial commission to submit himself for a medical examination at any time * * *. If such employee refuses to submit to any such examination or obstructs the same, his right to have his claim for compensation considered, if his claim is pending before the commission, or to receive any payment for compensation theretofore granted, shall be suspended during the period of such refusal or obstruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">Former R.C. 4123.53, however, applied exclusively to <em>medical </em>examinations, not vocational evaluations performed by the rehabilitation division. We thus find that former R.C. 4123.53 did not make a rehabilitation evaluation a precondition to further consideration of claimant\u2019s application for permanent total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>We also reject claimant\u2019s entreaty that we direct the commission to issue an order granting him permanent total disability compensation. A lack of \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting denial of permanent total disability compensation does not automatically translate into \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting its award. <em>State ex rel. Lampkins v. Dayton Malleable, Inc. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 14, 542 N.E.2d 1105. Accordingly, we return the cause to the commission for further consideration of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">We reverse that portion of the appellate court\u2019s judgment which suspended further consideration of claimant\u2019s application for permanent total disability compensation pending a rehabilitation evaluation. The remainder of the appellate court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed in part and affirmed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b342-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
