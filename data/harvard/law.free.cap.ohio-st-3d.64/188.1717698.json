Noll v. Indus. Comm., supra. Noll </em>noncompliance, however, does not automatically warrant a return of the cause for additional consideration and amended order. Where medical factors alone preclude sustained remunerative employment, the commission\u2019s failure to comply with <em>Noll </em>is excused. <em>State ex rel. Galion Mfg. Div., Dresser Industries, Inc. v. Haygood </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 38, 573 N.E.2d 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The appropriateness of further consideration pursuant to <em>Noll </em>is presently unreviewable. Since the record does not contain the relevant medical evidence, it is impossible to determine whether there was medical evidence of claimant\u2019s inability to engage in sustained remunerative employment. However, even if a return of the cause to the commission is technically unnecessary under <em>Haygood, </em>the appellate court\u2019s decision does not merit reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Simple vacation of the commission\u2019s order granting permanent total disability compensation, however, does not satisfy appellant, who demands a new hearing. The asserted basis for this request is the participation of commissioner Mayfield, who was not present at the permanent total disability hearing and yet cast the tiebreaking vote in claimant\u2019s favor. Mayfield\u2019s voting participation is improper only if he did not <em>\u201cin some meaningful manner, </em>consider evidence obtained at hearing.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) State ex rel. Ormet Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 54 Ohio St.3d 102, 107, 561 N.E.2d 920, 925. The commission claims that Mayfield engaged in meaningful review. Given the presumption of regularity that attaches to commission proceedings <em>(State ex rel. Rouch v. Eagle Tool &amp; Machine Co. </em>[1986], 26 Ohio St.3d 197, 215, 26 OBR 289, 304, 498 N.E.2d 464, 478, Douglas, J., concurring), the commission\u2019s statement that it complied with <em>Ormet, </em>absent evidence to the contrary, should be accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Nevertheless, as the commission and appellate court observed, Commissioners Smith and Bell who heard and voted on claimant\u2019s application for permanent total disability compensation have been replaced. Thus, if the new members can not meaningfully review the evidence adduced at the first hearing, a new hearing, by necessity, must take place. In either event, appellant\u2019s due process rights will be protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Accordingly, the appellate court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b339-10\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
