Each has been thoroughly reviewed and for the reasons stated below we find them without merit, and uphold the appellant\u2019s convictions and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Appellant\u2019s second, third and fourth propositions of law are interrelated. They stem from the admission into evidence of a tape-recorded conversation between appellant and Billy Payton. The portion played to the jury contained the following passage:</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">\u201cLawson: Number one is this, * * * he fucked you around, your sister around, the kids around, a lot of people around him he fucked, my little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>brother around, my sister, he tried * * * to fuck me around, * * * that shit don\u2019t go, not with me, you know. <em>I\u2019ve killed before man, but everytime I\u2019ve killed, man, you seen how I looked, man, I turned fuckin white, man, fuckin start sweating and shit, felt sick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u201cPayton: No, you turn into a wild man.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u201c(Laughter)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">\u201cLawson: Hey, I can psych myself out now. I can psych myself out, man, that\u2019s I\u2019ve been down that road a few times, like this here. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Before the tape was played to the jury, defense counsel and the prosecutor met with the trial judge in chambers to discuss its admissibility. Initially, defense counsel asked that the above emphasized language be redacted as unfairly prejudicial. Defense counsel, later maintained that only the words \u201cI\u2019ve killed before, man, but everytime I\u2019ve killed, man\u201d required redaction. The trial judge asked the defense to state its position for the record; counsel asked for a chance to consult with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">After a recess, defense counsel stated that, having consulted appellant, \u201cwe do not seek an expungement.\u201d Defense counsel thought it \u201cgood strategy\u201d to let the jury hear the whole exchange and also declined a cautionary instruction because it might draw undue attention to the \u201cI\u2019ve killed before\u201d statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">In his second proposition of law, appellant maintains that the reference to prior killings should have been redacted as irrelevant, unfairly prejudicial, and inadmissible under Evid.R. 403 and 404(B). However, the defense waived any error by withdrawing its objection. Even in capital cases, this court has applied the doctrine of waiver to bar the defendant from raising on appeal those issues which had gone unchallenged in the courts below. See, <em>e.g., State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 140, 538 N.E.2d 373, 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">In his third proposition of law, appellant argues that he was deprived of his right to the effective assistance of counsel when his trial attorneys withdrew their objection to the \u201cI\u2019ve killed before\u201d statement. We find this argument to be without merit. The United States Supreme Court has stated that in order to prevail on this claim, the defendant must show both deficient performance and resulting prejudice. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693. As to the performance inquiry, the defendant must demonstrate \u201cthat counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The prejudice component of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>Strickland </em>test \u201crequires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Appellant maintains that since it was not a legitimate trial strategy to permit the jury to hear appellant\u2019s boastful comments that he had killed before, counsel\u2019s performance was \u201cineffective\u201d under the first prong of <em>Strickland. </em>To prevail, appellant must overcome the \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance * * <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d at 694. \u201cA fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Under the circumstances, we conclude that appellant\u2019s lawyers did not act incompetently in withdrawing their objection to the \u201cI\u2019ve killed before\u201d statement. Since appellant stipulated that he shot Martin, the only issue contested at trial was his mental state. Appellant\u2019s defense team\u2019s trial strategy was to prove appellant\u2019s innocence by reason of his insanity. To this end, his attorneys called as a witness Dr. John Peter Lutz, a psychiatrist, who testified that Lawson suffered from \u201cbrief reactive psychosis,\u201d a temporary form of insanity. Dr. Lutz testified that \u201c[pjsychosis means as a result of a mental or physical illness a person is unable to perceive the circumstances around him in such a way as to guide their internal conception of what is occurring or to make reasonable assessments.\u201d Dr. Lutz opined that appellant\u2019s statement that \u201cI\u2019ve killed before\u201d supported his psychiatric diagnosis because it evidenced appellant\u2019s alleged penchant for exaggeration and empty boasting.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Moreover, the \u201cI\u2019ve killed before\u201d statement also supported Lutz\u2019s diagnosis by providing the necessary context for Payton\u2019s response: \u201cNo, you turn into a wild man.\u201d The \u201cwild man\u201d comment bolstered appellant\u2019s insanity defense but would be rendered meaningless without the preceding statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">As for counsel\u2019s failure to ask for a cautionary instruction, he explained that he did so to avoid calling \u201cundue attention\u201d to the prejudicial nature of \u201cI\u2019ve killed before.\u201d This, too, does not seem to be unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">Having found that trial counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient as it bore a reasonable relationship to a legitimate trial strategy, we need not examine whether appellant has shown prejudice in the guilt phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">Appellant\u2019s fourth proposition of law concerns an alleged deprivation of the effective assistance of appellate counsel. Appellant contends that his appellate counsel erred by failing to raise on appeal the admissibility of the \u201cI\u2019ve killed before\u201d statement. Since we have already determined that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>judge did not commit reversible error by allowing the jury to hear the statement, we conclude that appellant\u2019s fourth proposition of law has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Appellant\u2019s sixth proposition of law alleges that the trial court erred in failing to order the state to disclose statements or notes taken during interviews with the Paytons or to review the statements or notes <em>in camera </em>for possible <em>\u201cBrady </em>material.\u201d In <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196-1197, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, 218, the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">On January 4, 1988, the defense filed a motion to compel the prosecuting attorney to produce for the trial court\u2019s <em>in camera </em>inspection \u201call statements made by William S. Payton and Sue Payton, including memorandum or summaries of such statements and written or recorded statements, to law enforcement officers and prosecuting attorneys\u201d to determine whether such statements contained <em>Brady </em>material. The prosecutor responded by indicating that the files had been reviewed and no <em>Brady </em>material was found to exist that had not been previously disclosed during discovery. During pretrial hearings, defense counsel demanded Agent Watson\u2019s FBI reports on his contacts with the Paytons. The prosecutor replied that he had not seen these reports, had no control over them, and therefore could not turn them over. The court, nevertheless, ordered the prosecutor to ask Watson whether the reports contained <em>\u201cBrady </em>material.\u201d The prosecutor obeyed and reported that Watson knew of none.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Also at issue were the contents of the prosecutor\u2019s notes taken from interviews with the Paytons. Although the prosecutor believed there was \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d favorable to the defense in his notes, he offered to meet the judge <em>ex parte </em>to \u201calert [him] to several matters in these notes and let him make a decision as to whether or not those matters are favorable * * The judge was willing to review the notes, but refused to meet with the prosecutor <em>ex parte. </em>The prosecutor then declined to submit his notes for <em>in camera </em>review, but he placed the sealed notes in the record for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Essentially, appellant argues that, at all relevant times, due process requires the trial judge to conduct an <em>in camera </em>inspection to determine whether material held by the prosecution contains exculpatory evidence. After reviewing the authorities, we decline to so hold. In <em>Pennsylvania v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number><em>Ritchie </em>(1987), 480 U.S. 39, 59, 107 S.Ct. 989, 1002, 94 L.Ed.2d 40, 59, the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u201cIn the typical case where a defendant makes only a general request for exculpatory material under <em>Brady * </em>* *, <em>it is the State that decides which information must be disclosed. </em>Unless defense counsel becomes aware that other exculpatory evidence was withheld and brings it to the court\u2019s attention, the prosecutor\u2019s decision on disclosure is final.\u201d (Emphasis added and footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Therefore, the prosecution, not the trial judge, bears the duty to examine documents for potential <em>Brady </em>material. In <em>State v. Patterson </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St.2d 181, 182-183, 57 O.O.2d 422, 423, 277 N.E.2d 201, 203, we found that, after the defendant\u2019s general request for exculpatory material, the prosecution\u2019s review and representation to the court that none exists is sufficient to satisfy <em>Brady. </em>See, also, <em>United States v. Presser </em>(C.A.6, 1988), 844 F.2d 1275, 1281: \u201c[W]hile the <em>Brady </em>rule imposes a general obligation upon the government to disclose evidence that is favorable to the accused and material to guilt or punishment, the government typically is the sole judge of what evidence in its possession is subject to disclosure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">In <em>United States v. Bagley </em>(1985), 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3383, 87 L.Ed.2d 481, 494, the United States Supreme Court expounded on the \u201cmateriality\u201d of evidence in a <em>Brady </em>context:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">\u201cThe evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">See, also, <em>United States v. Agurs </em>(1976), 427 U.S. 97, 109-110, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2400, 49 L.Ed.2d 342, 353: \u201cThe <em>mere possibility </em>that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish \u2018materiality\u2019 in the constitutional sense.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">A given <em>Brady </em>request may be in such form that it indicates to the prosecutor exactly what the defense is after. <em>Agurs, supra, </em>at 106, 96 S.Ct. at 2399, 49 L.Ed.2d at 351. For instance, in <em>Brady, </em>the defendant sought the disclosure of his accomplice\u2019s extrajudicial statements in order to demonstrate that it was actually the accomplice, and not Brady, who strangled the victim. <em>Brady, supra, </em>373 U.S. at 84, 83 S.Ct. at 1195, 10 L.Ed.2d at 217. See, also, <em>Agurs, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 104-105, 96 S.Ct. at 2398, 49 L.Ed.2d at 350. In other cases, a <em>Brady </em>request may not be particularized, <em>e.g., </em>the defense makes a general demand for either \u201call <em>Brady </em>material\u201d or \u201canything exculpatory.\u201d <em>Agurs, supra, </em>at 106, 96 S.Ct. at 2399, 49 L.Ed.2d at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant requested specific material. <em>Ritchie </em>suggests that a specific request will sometimes require the trial court to review the contested matter <em>in camera </em>to determine whether it is material or exculpatory despite representations to the contrary by the prosecutor. <em>Ritchie, supra, </em>480 U.S. at 58, 107 S.Ct. at 1002, 94 L.Ed.2d at 58, fn. 15. However, regardless of whether the request in this case is classified as a general request for exculpatory material<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or one for disclosure of specific material, we conclude the trial court\u2019s failure to conduct an <em>in camera </em>inspection was not reversible error. Although the trial court did not review the prosecutor\u2019s notes, they are in the record for appellate review. Since the trial court is in no better a position than a reviewing court to recognize <em>Brady </em>material, a reviewing court\u2019s examination is a fair substitute for <em>in camera </em>inspection at trial. The court of appeals examined the notes and found that they contained nothing favorable to the defense. After conducting our own review of the prosecutor\u2019s notes, we find they do not contain any additional evidence material to appellant\u2019s guilt or punishment. Also, whatever may be considered even remotely favorable to the accused had been disclosed to the defense through other means. Accordingly, any supposed error in the trial court\u2019s failure to examine was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Furthermore, we find no error with respect to the FBI reports even though they are not in the record and have not been reviewed by any court. Under <em>Brady, </em>the government\u2019s obligation to disclose evidence favorable to the defendant and material to guilt or punishment applies only to that evidence which is \u201cin its possession.\u201d <em>Ritchie, supra, </em>at 57, 107 S.Ct. at 1001, 94 L.Ed.2d at 57. Obviously, if the prosecutor had no control over the FBI reports, he is incapable of suppressing them in violation of <em>Brady. </em>Here, the record reflects that the FBI reports were <em>never </em>in the state of Ohio\u2019s possession \u2014 they were compiled by a separate sovereign, the United States of America, and their contents were never disclosed to the prosecution. Although Agent Watson may have assisted the state\u2019s investigation, his relationship to the state of Ohio in this case was no more than that of any citizen and his knowledge of potential <em>\u201cBrady </em>material\u201d cannot automatically be ascribed to the state. See <em>State v. Wiles </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 78, 571 N.E.2d 97, 110. See, generally, <em>State v. Mollica </em>(1989), 114 N.J. 329, 348-350, 554 A.2d 1315, 1325-1326. Therefore, we hold that since the FBI reports were not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the state\u2019s possession, they were not subject to <em>Brady, </em>and no <em>in camera </em>review was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s sixth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Appellant\u2019s seventh proposition of law claims as error the failure of the state to record the proceedings of the grand jury that indicted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In <em>State v. Grewell </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 4, 543 N.E.2d 93, syllabus, we held that grand jury proceedings in felony cases must be recorded pursuant to Crim.R. 22. However, nonrecordation will be deemed harmless error where the defendant fails to show a \u201cparticularized need for * * * grand jury testimony which outweighs the need to maintain grand jury secrecy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9, 543 N.E.2d at 98. See, also, <em>State v. Greer </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 139, 20 O.O.3d 157, 420 N.E.2d 982, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Appellant challenges the court of appeals\u2019 assumption that the prosecutor had represented to the trial court that Billy Payton did not testify before the grand jury. After reviewing the record, we find that appellant\u2019s challenge is well grounded. The prosecutor never said Billy Payton didn\u2019t testify; he only said no transcript of Billy\u2019s testimony existed. It is therefore incumbent on this court to determine whether appellant has demonstrated a particularized need to examine grand jury transcripts.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">We held in <em>Greer </em>that if the defendant is able to demonstrate a particularized need, <em>i.e., </em>where the surrounding circumstances indicate a probability that the failure to disclose the grand jury testimony will deprive the defendant of a fair trial, grand jury proceedings may be disclosed. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus. If the defendant demonstrates a particularized need, Crim.R. 6(E) gives him or her the right to inspect all <em>relevant </em>portions of grand jury testimony. <em>Id., </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 150-151, 20 O.O.3d at 164-165, 420 N.E.2d at 989. Also, \u201c[t]he question of whether a particularized need exists is within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Grewell, supra, </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 9, 543 N.E.2d at 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">Appellant\u2019s brief to this court cites no specific facts from the record to support his particularized-need claim. Additionally, we have reviewed his brief submitted to the court of appeals where he asserts that the specific circumstances proved particularized need to obtain Billy Payton\u2019s grand jury testimony. We conclude that appellant has failed to show particularized need and, consequently, the failure to record the grand jury proceedings was harmless error. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s seventh proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In his ninth proposition of law, appellant claims that the state\u2019s decision not to prosecute the alleged co-conspirators, William and Sue Payton, constituted selective prosecution in violation of state and federal due process protections. Appellant\u2019s argument is entirely without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">This court in <em>State v. Flynt </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 132, 17 O.O.3d 81, 407 N.E.2d 15, adopted the following test to judge selective-prosecution claims:</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">\u201c \u2018To support a defense of selective or discriminatory prosecution, a defendant bears the heavy burden of establishing, at least <em>prima facie, </em>(1) that, while others similarly situated have not generally been proceeded against because of conduct of the type forming the basis of the charge against him, he has been singled out for prosecution, and (2) that the government\u2019s discriminatory selection of him for prosecution has been invidious or in bad faith, <em>i.e., </em>based upon such impermissible considerations as race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 134, 17 O.O.3d at 82, 407 N.E.2d at 17, quoting <em>United States v. Berrios </em>(C.A.2, 1974), 501 F.2d 1207, 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Appellant fails to satisfy both necessary prongs of this test. First, he made no showing that \u201cothers similarly situated have not generally been proceeded against because of conduct of the type forming the basis of the charge against him * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, appellant points <em>solely </em>to the nonprosecution of the Paytons. Moreover, the Paytons are not \u201csimilarly situated\u201d because they did not kill or attempt to kill Martin. Second, appellant has failed to demonstrate that his prosecution was based upon \u201cimpermissible considerations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He asserts that the state chose to forgo prosecution of the Paytons in order to conceal <em>Brady </em>material. Again, appellant fails to supplement his proposition of law with any facts and asks that we <em>assume </em>that he was deprived of information material to his guilt or punishment by the state\u2019s failure to record the grand jury proceedings. We cannot infer from such an empty argument that the state\u2019s motive for nonprosecution was to conceal the Paytons\u2019 statements. However, we can infer from concrete facts that the state acted in good faith in not prosecuting the Paytons: the evidence indicated that the Paytons planned for Martin to be beaten up, not killed; Billy Payton refused to attack the dying victim with the knife offered to him by appellant; the Paytons reported the murder to Agent Watson and both fully cooperated in his investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Appellant has failed to establish selective prosecution and we therefore reject his ninth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">In his first proposition of law, appellant argues that certain comments made by the prosecutor during his penalty phase closing argument were improper because they appealed to the jury\u2019s passion and prejudice. The first of two prosecutorial comments reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\u201cNow, we heard from the defendant\u2019s mother. And, you know, this is very uncomfortable for me to speak about because I think you, just like I have, have watched the vigil that woman has kept for well going on to 40 days now. She quietly sat back there and supported this man. And I can\u2019t help and I haven\u2019t been able to help for 40 days to think about my own mother and when my father died and I watched her suffer and more so than me grieving over the death of my father, I watched my mother suffer and that hurt. And when she took that stand I hurt for Mrs. Lawson, and you can\u2019t deny that there is anyone that wasn\u2019t affected, and I saw a number of you cry and because I\u2019m out here and I\u2019m an attorney and this is my business I fought back the tears and I swallowed hard and there was only one person in this courtroom who didn\u2019t and it\u2019s that man right there. <em>And if anybody took the time to look over at him like I did and saw the reaction that he had to his own mother on that stand, it was chilling. And I want you to carry that with you when you weigh the aggravating circumstances versus the mitigating factors.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s immediate objection and denied his motion <em>for </em>mistrial. The judge, however, did instruct the jury that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks are not evidence. Appellant now argues that the death sentence is unreliable because the foregoing remarks constituted an improper comment on his demeanor at trial which had the prejudicial effect of implying that appellant was so cold and callous that he was unaffected by his mother's tearful pleas for his life. We disagree. In <em>State v. Brown </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 305, 317, 528 N.E.2d 523, 538, we held that \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s face and body are physical evidence\u201d and that it is permissible for the prosecution to comment on the accused\u2019s physical appearance. Even if the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were improper, we do not conclude that appellant was thereby prejudiced. \u201cThe test regarding prosecutorial misconduct in closing arguments is whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14. OBR 317, 318, 470 N.E.2d 883, 885. \u201cIn general terms, the conduct of a prosecuting attorney during trial cannot be made a ground of error unless that conduct deprives the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 266, 15 OBR 379, 402, 473 N.E.2d 768, 793. Reversal of appellant\u2019s death sentence is not required where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have recommended this penalty even absent the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks. <em>State v. Beuke </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 29, 33, 526 N.E.2d 274, 280. We find that appellant incurred no prejudice as a result of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks because, as will be discussed later in this opinion, we find that the aggravating circumstances clearly outweigh the mitigating factors even in the absence of these prosecutorial comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">We reach the same result with regard to the second comment made by the prosecutor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While appellant\u2019s trial counsel did not object or request a cautionary instruction, the court of appeals decided the issue on its merits and rejected it. Since we find that the outcome of the penalty phase would have been the same even had the prosecutor refrained from making this comment, we regard any alleged error as harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In his tenth proposition of law, appellant argues that the separate animus necessary to support a separate conviction for kidnapping does not exist in this case and, therefore, the kidnapping cannot stand as a specification in the aggravated murder conviction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Under R.C. 2941.25, a defendant may be convicted and sentenced for two or more offenses \u201chaving as their genesis the same criminal conduct or transaction, provided that the offenses (1) were not allied and of similar import, (2) were committed separately or (3) were committed with a separate animus as to each offense.\u201d <em>State v. Moss </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 515, 519, 23 O.O.3d 447, 450, 433 N.E.2d 181, 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">In <em>State v. Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345, we set forth guidelines to determine whether, pursuant to R.C. 2941.25(B), kidnapping and another offense of the same or similar kind are committed with a separate animus as to each. One of those guidelines states:</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">\u201cWhere the restraint or movement of the victim is merely incidental to a separate underlying crime, there exists no separate animus sufficient to sustain separate convictions; however, where the restraint is prolonged, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>confinement is secretive, or the movement is substantial so as to demonstrate a significance independent of the other offense, there exists a separate animus as to each offense sufficient to support separate convictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">See, also, <em>State v. Powell </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 255, 552 N.E.2d 191: \u201c \u2018[W]here murder * * * is the underlying crime, a kidnapping in facilitation thereof would generally constitute a separately cognizable offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261, 552 N.E.2d at 198, quoting <em>State v. Logan, supra, </em>60 Ohio St.2d at 135, 14 O.O.3d at 379, 397 N.E.2d at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the record indicates prolonged restraint and significant movement; Martin was transported for several hours over a great distance involving three counties. The prolonged deception over several hours was not incidental to Martin\u2019s murder and clearly constituted a separate and distinct act. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s tenth proposition of law is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">In his twelfth proposition of law, appellant claims the trial judge erred in the penalty phase by refusing appellant\u2019s request to instruct the jury that \u201c[reasonable doubt is present when you\u2019re not firmly convinced that death is the appropriate punishment.\u201d Appellant\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">R.C. 2929.03(D)(2) requires the jury to \u201cdetermine whether the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing are sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors present in the case. If the trial jury unanimously finds, <em>by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, </em>that the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors, the trial jury <em>shall recommend </em>to the court that the sentence of death be imposed on the offender. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">The trial court properly instructed the jury on reasonable doubt according to the definition set forth in R.C. 2901.05(D). The statutory language requires the jury to balance aggravation and mitigation; it does not empower the jury to decide, without regard to that balance, whether the death sentence is \u201cappropriate.\u201d Since the instructions given adhered as closely as possible to the language of R.C. 2901.05(D), they were both proper and sufficient. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s twelfth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">Appellant\u2019s fifth and eleventh propositions of law raise issues which have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>been repeatedly raised in other death penalty cases before this court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See, <em>e.g., State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264. \u201cR.C. 2929.05 requires this court to review capital cases in a certain manner but does not require this court to address and discuss, in opinion form, each and every proposition of law raised by the parties.\u201d <em>State v. Bonnell </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 179, 181, 573 N.E.2d 1082, 1085. As our position on these issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>remains unchanged, we will not waste valuable judicial resources discussing what continues as well-settled law.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Having considered appellant\u2019s propositions of law, we must independently weigh the aggravating circumstances against the factors presented in mitigation as required under R.C. 2929.05(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Appellant was convicted of two aggravated murder counts; since both involve the same victim, they merge. As to each count, appellant was convicted of three aggravating circumstances: murder during kidnapping, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7); murder to escape detection, apprehension, conviction, or punishment for the Titus burglary, R.C. 2929.04(A)(3); and murder of a witness to prevent his testimony, R.C. 2929.04(A)(8). The aggravating circumstances for Count One also merge into those for Count Two. We find that the aggravating circumstances were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Against these aggravating circumstances we weigh all mitigating factors drawn from the nature and circumstances of the offense; the history, background, and character of appellant; and any other factors listed in R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) through (7) which exist in this case. One strong mitigating factor potentially applicable is contained in R.C. 2929.04(B)(3), which requires consideration of \u201c[wjhether, at the time of committing the offense, the offender, because of a mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">At trial, appellant presented the testimony of one psychiatrist, Dr. John Lutz. According to Dr. Lutz, appellant suffered from a \u201cbrief reactive psychosis\u201d when he fatally shot and beat'the victim. Dr. Lutz explained that a brief reactive psychosis is a sudden, temporary psychosis, or detachment from reality, lasting between a few hours and two weeks, characterized by emotional turmoil and rapid mood shifts. Such a psychosis may be triggered by a \u201cmajor stress\u201d; in appellant\u2019s case, Lutz believed, stress was caused by appellant\u2019s ruminating over what the Paytons told him about Martin\u2019s behavior. Lutz concluded that appellant\u2019s \u201cability to distinguish right from wrong was markably [sic] impaired, and * * * he was unable to refrain\u201d from shooting Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The prosecution presented the testimony of one psychiatrist and two psychologists. All disagreed with Lutz\u2019s diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Another potential mitigating factor is appellant\u2019s heavy drug and alcohol consumption prior to the murder. Any impact, however, is weakened by the fact that appellant had no difficulty driving to the murder scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The Paytons\u2019 role in this crime constitutes another possible mitigating factor. See R.C. 2929.04(B)(2) and (7). The Paytons made inflammatory statements about Martin\u2019s behavior toward the Lawson family. Specifically, they told appellant that Martin had \u201cset up\u201d appellant\u2019s sister on false charges. According to the Paytons, police relying on Martin\u2019s false accusations searched appellant\u2019s sister\u2019s house and placed a gun against the head of her ten-year-old daughter. The Paytons also said that Martin threatened to kill appellant\u2019s family and \u201crip [the head] off\u201d Desiree Henson\u2019s baby. Because appellant was highly suggestible, intensely loyal to and protective of his family and eager to please his family and friends, the Paytons\u2019 allegations infuriated appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">While the record demonstrates that the Paytons manipulated appellant to achieve their own ends, evidence also indicates that appellant hated Martin even before he spoke to the Paytons. In addition, no evidence shows that the Paytons suggested murder; that was appellant\u2019s idea alone. He brought the gun, he drove the car, and he gave the commands.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">We therefore give appellant\u2019s personal weaknesses (suggestibility, low intelligence, impulsiveness) little weight in reducing his culpability. Also, we reject Dr. Lutz\u2019s diagnosis of appellant as suffering from \u201cbrief reactive psychosis\u201d as did most of the experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Appellant murdered Martin to prevent his testimony against Tim Lawson and to prevent appellant\u2019s own apprehension, conviction, and punishment for the Titus burglary. These aggravating circumstances strike against the judicial system itself and deserve severe punishment. Moreover, appellant murdered Martin during the course of a kidnapping. The lack of violence in the kidnapping arguably reduces the weight of the specification, but does not eliminate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Having conducted the statutory balancing, we conclude that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the factors presented in mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">X</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">Our final task is to determine whether the sentence of death is appropriate in this case. In his eighth proposition of law, appellant argues that the death penalty in this case is disproportionate because the Paytons were the principal offenders in the Martin murder, but were never even indicted for the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>This proposition lacks merit for two reasons. First, its premise \u2014 that the Paytons were the principal offenders \u2014 is invalid. The \u201cprincipal offender\u201d in a capital case is whoever \u201cpersonally performed every act constituting the offense of aggravated murder. * * * \u201d <em>State v. Sneed </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 3, 12, 584 N.E.2d 1160, 1168. Appellant concedes that he was the trigger man. Second, the alleged crimes of people who were never tried, let alone convicted and sentenced to death, are not \u201csimilar cases.\u201d R.C. 2929.05(A). See <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">After conducting a proportionality review and comparing Lawson\u2019s case with others, we find that Lawson\u2019s death sentence is appropriate and not excessive. This court has upheld death sentences in cases where the only death penalty specification was murder during a kidnapping. See, <em>e.g., State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 513 N.E.2d 267. We have also upheld death sentences in cases involving witness murder, see <em>State v. Hooks </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 67, 529 N.E.2d 429, and murder to avoid detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for another offense, see <em>State v. Wickline </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 114, 552 N.E.2d 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b503-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, H.

This comment reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">\u201cAnd let's consider the mitigation hearing he [the victim] got in the back of that cornfield on September 23rd, 1987, when he wasn\u2019t too proud to beg for his life. And nobody stepped forward to help him and one man kicked him in the head like a football until he quit breathing. So, consider that for whatever mitigation you might want to and finally consider what this man told Dr. Lutz, \u2018If I had the chance I would do it again.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b500-4\">. Appellant\u2019s six-part fifth proposition of law challenges the validity of the Ohio death penalty statutes and reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u201cThe Ohio death penalty statutes are unconstitutional, violating the Eighth Amendment proscription of cruel and unusual punishments, the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees to due process of law and to the equal protection of the laws, and also violating the concomitant provisions of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u201c(A) The death penalty is so totally without penological justification that it results in the gratuitous infliction of suffering, and that consequently, there is no rational state interest served by the ultimate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u201c(B) The use of the same operative fact to first elevate what would be \u2018ordinary\u2019 murder to aggravated murder, and then to capital, death-eligible aggravated murder permits the state (1) to obtain a death sentence upon less proof in a felony murder case than in a case involving prior calculation and design, although both crimes are ostensibly] equally culpable under the Revised Code, and (2) fails to narrow the capital class to those murderers for whom the death penalty is constitutionally appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\u201c(C) The requirement that a jury must recommend death upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh only to the slightest degree the mitigating circumstances renders the Ohio capital statutes quasi-mandatory and permits the execution of an offender even though the mitigating evidence falls just short of equipoise with the aggravating factors, with the result that the risk of putting someone to death when it is practically as likely as not that he deserves to live renders the Ohio capital process arbitrary and capricious, and, in the absence of a requirement that, before death may be imposed, aggravating factors must <em>substantially </em>outweigh mitigating factors, unconstitutional. [Emphasis sic.]</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">\u201c(D) The Ohio capital statutes are constitutionally infirm in that they do not permit the extension of mercy by the jury even though aggravating factors may only slightly outweigh mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">\u201c(E) The provisions of Crim.R. 11(C)(3) permitting a trial court to dismiss specifications upon a guilty plea only under the nebulous and undefined concept \u2018in the interests of justice\u2019 (1) needlessly encourages guilty pleas and the concomitant waiver of the right to jury, to compulsory process and to confrontation and (2) reintroduces the possibility that the death sentence will be imposed arbitrarily and capriciously.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">\u201c(F) The Ohio capital sentencing scheme is unconstitutional because it provides no standards for sentencing or review at several significant stages of the process and consequently death sentences are imposed, and reviewed, without sufficient statutory guidance to juries, trial courts and reviewing courts to prevent the unconstitutional arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">In his eleventh proposition of law, appellant argues that he should have been allowed to present closing arguments first and last in the penalty phase. This court has long rejected that argument. See <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 214-215, 15 OBR 311, 354-355, 473 N.E.2d 264, 307-308; <em>State v.
