However, not all sums paid in a transaction are part of the \u201cprice.\u201d <em>Columbus Equip. Co. v. Limbach </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 62, 63, 526 N.E.2d 294, 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">LDI, as the owner of the leased equipment, paid personal property taxes and, as provided in the master lease, passed those taxes through to its customers in a separate billing. The BTA found that the indemnification clause (of the master lease) was \u201ca severable part of a divisible contract, and that sales tax does not apply to otherwise nontaxable charges which are clearly separated from the price of the equipment.\u201d See <em>Materials Contractors, Inc. v. Donahue </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 19, 22-23, 43 O.O.2d 10, 10-13, 235 N.E.2d 525, 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">We agree. In <em>Xyovest, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 469, 471, 584 N.E.2d 675, 677, we stated: \u201cBy analogy, the lessees\u2019 reimbursement payments of personal property taxes here were not part of the price, but were separate items agreed to by contract.\u201d <em>Xyovest </em>is indistinguishable from this appeal and is dispositive of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">Appellant further argues that in order for the reimbursement charges to be a part of the price, there must be a separate consideration given for the payments. However, there is no requirement that a separate consideration be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>established; it suffices that the contractual provision be separate and divisible. See <em>Columbus Equip. Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">We now address the issue of the applicability of the permissive tax herein. R.C. 5739.01(B) defines a \u201csale\u201d to include all transactions for a consideration \u201c * * * [in] which title or possession, or both, of tangible personal property, is or is to be transferred.\u201d Except for certain inapplicable transactions, a presumption exists that all sales occur at the vendor\u2019s place of business. R.C. 5739.01(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The BTA found that the presumption that the \u201csales\u201d occurred at LDI\u2019s place of business in Cuyahoga County was rebuttable, and that LDI had overcome that presumption. The BTA determined that possession of the equipment was transferred at the customers\u2019 locations, after delivery and installation of the equipment and the customers\u2019 acceptance of possession. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">As we stated in <em>Arga Co. v. Limbach </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 220, 222, 522 N.E.2d 1074, 1077:</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\u201cThe transfer of title to or possession of tangible personal property is a \u2018sale\u2019 and the taxable event on which the tax is imposed. <em>Where </em>this occurs is <em>where </em>the tax may be imposed. \u2018Only those sales made within this state can be taxed, but not those outside its borders\u2019 * * (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">We hold that these same principles apply here, and the BTA correctly reversed the commissioner\u2019s imposition of the permissive tax. See, also, <em>Thomas Steel Strip Corp. v. Limbach </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 340, 575 N.E.2d 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">The decision of the BTA is neither unreasonable nor unlawful and it is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b448-11\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
