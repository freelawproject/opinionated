Ramirez, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 630, 23 O.O.3d 518, 433 N.E.2d 586. Until recently, permanency was perceived to be an absolute bar to receipt of further temporary total disability compensation. In <em>State, ex rel. Bing, v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 424, 575 N.E.2d 177, however, we re-examined \u201cpermanency\u201d within the context of the commission\u2019s R.C. 4123.52 continuing jurisdiction and concluded that, in some situations, temporary total disability compensation could be reinstated despite a prior permanency finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">In this case, the commission initially terminated temporary total disability compensation after finding that claimant\u2019s allowed conditions had become permanent. At that time, however, only physical conditions had been allowed in the claim. The commission\u2019s subsequent allowance of a psychiatric condition prompted a renewed request for temporary total disability compensation. Despite this additional allowance, however, the commission denied temporary total disability compensation, again basing its decision on permanency. We must determine whether the commission\u2019s decision is supported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Burley, v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936, syllabus. For the reasons that follow, we find that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">For permanency to be a basis for the denial of temporary total disability compensation, the permanent condition must be one that has been alleged as contributing to the disability. The reports of Drs. Llewelyn, Brown and Cunningham \u2014 all dealing exclusively with claimant\u2019s physical condition \u2014 are not, therefore, \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s order. The contents of these reports also indicate that despite the commission\u2019s bare allegation to the contrary, claimant\u2019s psychiatric condition was not truly considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The commission\u2019s reliance on <em>State, ex rel. Rouch, v. Eagle Tool &amp; Machine Co. </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St.3d 197, 26 OBR 289, 498 N.E.2d 464, is misplaced since <em>Rouch </em>is distinguishable from the case at bar. Unlike the claimant in <em>Rouch, </em>the. present claimant does not allege that the combined effects of his allowed physical and mental conditions have temporarily and totally disabled him. He has alleged that his psychiatric condition <em>alone </em>is temporarily and totally disabling. <em>Rouch </em>is, therefore, not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">We share the appellate court\u2019s concern over the permanency standard used by the commission, since the district hearing officer\u2019s 1989 order suggested that she evaluated permanency in terms of claimant\u2019s inability to work. However, as we have previously stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u201c * * * [Permanency] relates solely to the perceived longevity of the condition at issue. It has absolutely no bearing upon the claimant\u2019s ability to perform the tasks involved in his former position of employment. * * * [Permanency is] * * * a condition which will, * * * \u2018with reasonable probability, continue for an indefinite period of time without any present indication of recovery therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vulcan Materials Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 31, 33, 25 OBR 26, 27, 494 N.E.2d 1125, 1127.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The appellate court\u2019s decision to vacate and to return the cause to the commission for reconsideration of the permanency issue was thus proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b220-10\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b220-11\">Wright, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
