Appellees counter that some evidence did exist, and that appellant cannot contest the award because appellant: (1) did not appeal the September 18, 1986 order extending temporary total compensation, and (2) was statutorily required to continue payments until compensation was terminated by the commission. Appellees\u2019 arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The September 18, 1986 commission decision awarded compensation from \u201cdate last paid through 9-29-86 and to continue upon the submission of supporting medical evidence.\u201d Appellees maintain that Jeep, by not appealing this order, consented to pay temporary total compensation so long as claimant submitted \u201csupporting medical evidence\u201d of temporary total disability. Appellees\u2019 statement, while correct, however, ignores the fact that medical evidence of maximum medical improvement is not \u201csome evidence\u201d of temporary total disability. <em>Vulcan Materials Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 31, 25 OBR 26, 494 N.E.2d 1125.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Where a statement of maximum medical improvement of an allowed condition is made by the claimant\u2019s doctor, not only is that report not \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting continued temporary total compensation for that condition, it is justification for a self-insured employer to cease temporary total compensation without prior commission hearing. <em>State ex rel. Jeep Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 64, 577 N.E.2d 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">We must next determine whether the Hein, Hawkins or O\u2019Connor reports are \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting temporary total disability compensation from March 1, 1987 through August 19, 1987. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. Dr. Hein\u2019s narrative clearly is not. Hein\u2019s opinion is not probative over the period preceding his June 24, 1987 exam. It cannot, therefore, support temporary total compensation from March 1, 1987 through June 23, 1987. In contrast, while his opinion is relevant for the period June 24, 1987 through August 19, 1987, Dr. Hein stated that claimant had reached maximum recovery. As a result, his report cannot be considered \u201csome evidence\u201d of temporary total disability over this latter period.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Dr. Hawkins\u2019 report is also not \u201csome evidence\u201d for two reasons. First, <em>State ex rel. Zamora v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 17, 543 N.E.2d 87, prohibits the commission from relying on a medical report that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>commission had earlier found unpersuasive. In <em>Zamora, </em>the claimant simultaneously applied to have an additional psychiatric allowance and to have himself declared permanently totally disabled. The claimant was examined by various specialists, including Dr. Dennis W. Kogut, who stated that the claimant\u2019s depression preceded his industrial injury and that the contribution of the industrial injury to the depression was minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The commission allowed the psychiatric condition and, in so doing, implicitly rejected Kogut\u2019s report. However, ten months later, the commission denied the application for permanent total disability based partially on Dr. Kogut\u2019s same narrative. The claimant challenged the commission\u2019s subsequent reliance on that report, arguing that once rejected, the report was removed from evidentiary consideration. We agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Comparable facts exist here. Jeep, in initially moving to terminate temporary total compensation in 1986, submitted Dr. Hawkins\u2019 report as proof that claimant was not temporarily and totally disabled. In granting temporary total compensation, the commission inherently rejected, at a minimum, the doctor\u2019s conclusion that claimant had attained maximum improvement. The commission then relied on that report in its August 20, 1987 order. Under <em>Zamora, </em>the rejection of that report is sufficient to remove that document from further evidentiary consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Second, even if properly before the commission, Dr. Hawkins\u2019 report concluded that claimant had reached maximum recovery. His report, therefore, did not substantiate a temporary total disability award.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">The most controversial reports in this case are Dr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s, particularly his July 22, 1987 C-84 report. Prior to that report, the doctor had, on September 19, 1986 and March 12, 1987, stated that his patient had reached maximum medical improvement. On July 22, 1987, Dr. O\u2019Connor extended claimant\u2019s estimated return-to-work date to August, noting that claimant would \u201cnever attain complete recovery.\u201d The appellate court found that this report constituted \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting temporary total compensation. We disagree. Dr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s July 22, 1987 impairment opinion is based in part on degenerative joint disease in both of claimant\u2019s knees, which is not an allowed condition in this claim. As such, the report does not constitute \u201csome evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">In consideration of the above, we reverse the judgment of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b531-11\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Douglas and Resnick, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b532-4\">H.

In this case, the Industrial Commission granted claimant temporary total disability compensation. A unanimous court of appeals, by denying appellant\u2019s requested writ, affirmed the decision of the fact-finding commission. The court of appeals found that this was a \u201csome evidence\u201d case and found, in Dr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s report of July 22, 1987, some evidence to support the commission\u2019s decision. I would affirm the court of appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b532-6\">Alice Robie Resnick, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ACk\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent from the majority decision. In this case relator\u2019s motion to terminate compensation was heard on August 20, 1987 by a district hearing officer, who issued an order finding, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">\u201cBased on the allowed conditions of this claim and the reports of Drs. Hein, Hawkins and O\u2019Connor, it is found that claimant\u2019s condition is permanent as defined in <em>Vulcan Materials v. Industrial Commission </em>and that no further compensation for Temporary Total Disability is to be paid effective 8-20-87. Based on the reports of Drs. Hein, Hawkins and O\u2019Connor, the allowed conditions of this claim and the provisions of 4123.56, it is found that claimant was not able to return to his former position of employment through 8-19-87 and that compensation for Temporary Total Disability is to be paid from last date of payment through 8-19-87 only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">By order dated January 13, 1988, the regional board of review affirmed the district hearing officer\u2019s order. The Industrial Commission refused review. It would appear that a majority of this court are substituting their judgment for that of the fact finder in this case by interpreting the report of Dr. O\u2019Connor and making a finding that his report does not provide some evidence that respondent was experiencing temporary total disability up to and including August 19, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">It is an accepted premise that the determination of disputed facts is solely within the jurisdiction of the commission. Additionally, it is within the exclusive authority of the commission to weigh credible evidence and to make decisions based on that evidence. <em>State ex rel. Hudson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 169, 12 OBR 237, 465 N.E.2d 1289; <em>State ex rel. Allerton v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 396, 23 O.O.3d 358, 433 N.E.2d 159; <em>State ex rel. Haines v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 15, 58 O.O.2d 70, 278 N.E.2d 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">The commission refused to hear the appeal from the regional board and, thereby, in effect, found some evidence to support the finding of temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>total disability until August 19,1987. In view of that fact we should not sit as a Supreme Industrial Commission and make a different factual finding as to Dr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s report. An important additional consideration is that the reports of the doctors were factually confusing. Since Dr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s July 22, 1987 report did contain some evidence of temporary total disability, the decision should remain in effect and not be subject to an action in mandamus. <em>State ex rel. Hudson, supra; State ex rel. G F Business Equip., Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 446, 20 O.O.3d 379, 423 N.E.2d 99. Hence, based on those facts I would affirm the decision of the court of appeals and deny the writ.</p>\n<judges id=\"b533-6\">Douglas, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
