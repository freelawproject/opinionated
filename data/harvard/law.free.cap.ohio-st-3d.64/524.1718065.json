At issue before the commission was causal relationship: did claimant\u2019s allowed condition force her to take an allegedly less strenuous (and lower paying) job at Higbee\u2019s? The commission found that claimant had suffered a wage loss. The appellate court, however, found that the commission\u2019s order did not satisfy <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>and, therefore, could not be reviewed. For the reasons to follow, its judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The parties focus on Dr. Zachary\u2019s January 21, 1988 letter to claimant\u2019s counsel, which claimant contends is \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s decision. Dairy Mart disagrees, citing perceived deficiencies in the letter. However, the parties\u2019 focus assumes that the commission actually based its decision on that \u201creport.\u201d The order does not indicate that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Evidentiary review is confined to reports on which the commission expressly relied. <em>Mitchell; State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. We will not assume that the commission relied on evidence not specifically identified in its order. Here, the order contains standard boilerplate language, indicating reliance on \u201cclaimant\u2019s application, evidence in the file and/or evidence adduced at the hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Claimant argues that the order\u2019s reference to her application rescues the order from a return to the commission under <em>Mitchell, </em>which only criticized blank reference to \u201cevidence in the file and/or * * * adduced at the hearing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 483, 6 OBR at 533, 453 N.E.2d at 724. This assertion, however, does not aid claimant\u2019s position. Claimant relies heavily on the January 1988 Zachary report. That report, however, did not accompany claimant\u2019s wage-loss application \u2014 the report was submitted later. Thus, even if the commission did rely on claimant\u2019s application, there was no inherent reliance on the Zachary report since it was not part of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">The parties\u2019 position also ignores an equally valid possibility \u2014 that the commission rejected all of Dr. Zachary\u2019s reports as unpersuasive (hence, the lack of reference to them in the order) and relied on other unnamed evidence. To assume that the commission, to the exclusion of all other possible evidence (including other Zachary reports that may be more or less persuasive than his 1988 letter), relied solely on the January 1988 report is improper. The parties are also essentially asking us to weigh, in the first instance, not only the disputed report, but the disputed report in conjunction with other reports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>prepared by Dr. Zachary. Such judicial evaluation conflicts with <em>Burley </em>and must be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b677-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
