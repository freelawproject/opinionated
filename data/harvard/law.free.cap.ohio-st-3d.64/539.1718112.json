Our review reveals that the commission\u2019s order was based in part on an abuse of discretion and, accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Effective August 22, 1986, R.C. 4123.56(B) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">\u201cWhere an employee in a claim allowed under this chapter suffers a wage loss as a result of returning to employment other than his former position of employment or as a result of being unable to find employment consistent with the claimant\u2019s physical capabilities, he shall receive compensation at sixty-six and two-thirds of his weekly wage loss not to exceed the statewide average weekly wage for a period not to exceed two hundred weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Supplementing the statute, Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(D) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">\u201cIn injury claims in which the date of injury, or in occupational disease claims in which the date of disability, is on or after August 22, 1986, the payment of compensation or wage loss pursuant to division (B) of Section 4123.56 of the Revised Code shall commence upon application with the finding of any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">\u201c(1) The employee, as a direct result of the allowed conditions in the claim, returns to employment other than his former position of employment and suffers a wage loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">\u201c(2) The employee returns to his former position but suffers a wage loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">\u201c(3) The employee, as a direct result of the allowed conditions in the claim, is unable to find work consistent with the employee\u2019s physical capabilities and suffers a wage loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">The commission\u2019s award was premised on subsection (3) and the commission\u2019s determinations: (1) that claimant received no wages from April 10,1987 through November 3, 1988, and (2) that his lack of wages stemmed from his inability to work at The Andersons or secure other employment because of his allowed conditions. Appellant responds: (1) that the layoff is evidence that there was no causal relationship between injury and wage loss, and (2) that there is no contrary evidence of the requisite causal relationship. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">We find initially that the commission abused its discretion in awarding wage loss compensation from January 1, 1988 through April 15, 1988. The commission apparently found that claimant did not work between April 10, 1987 and November 3, 1988. However, sworn wage statements substantiated total or partial loss of wages only from April 10, 1987 through December 31, 1987 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>April 16, 1988 forward. There is no evidence of any wage loss from January 1, 1988 through April 15, 1988. Claimant admits in his brief that he worked for Johnston\u2019s Fruit Farm from January 1, 1988 through April 15, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Appellant asserts that claimant\u2019s layoff shows that any wage loss was not caused by the allowed conditions. Prior decisions have not addressed a layoff\u2019s effect on R.C. 4123.56(B) wage loss benefits. We have, however, discussed the issue with respect to the companion provision for temporary total disability compensation, now at R.C. 4123.56(A). <em>State ex rel. B.O.C. Group v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 199, 569 N.E.2d 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Like R.C. 4123.56(B) benefits, temporary total disability compensation replaces lost wages. <em>State ex rel. Ashcraft v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 42, 517 N.E.2d 533. Similarly, the temporarily and totally disabled claimant must always causally relate the claimed disability to the industrial injury. The requisite causal connection in temporary total disability cases, can, under certain circumstances, be broken when an employment relationship ends. Voluntary departure, for example, severs the causation chain. \u201cInvoluntary\u201d departure does not. <em>Ashcraft; State ex rel. Rockwell Internatl. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 44, 531 N.E.2d 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">An injury-induced departure is always considered involuntary. <em>Rockwell. </em>The character of other departures, however, can depend on many factors. Layoff is often considered involuntary since it is initiated by the employer, not the employee. <em>State ex rel. B.O.C. Group, supra. </em>In this case, claimant\u2019s departure was initiated by the employer, without evidence of any intent on claimant\u2019s part to abandon employment. Appellant nonetheless in effect urges us to find that the departure was voluntary, since claimant accepted employment knowing that he would be released at season\u2019s end. Appellant\u2019s position, however, conflicts with our policy of encouraging gainful employment. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. Wireman v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 286, 551 N.E.2d 1265, and <em>State ex rel. Diversitech Gen. Plastic Film Div. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 381, 544 N.E.2d 677. Its argument ignores the possibility that claimant took the temporary position with The Andersons because it was the only job he could find. For this reason, we reject appellant\u2019s argument and find that claimant\u2019s layoff does not bar wage loss compensation in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">We must next determine whether \u201csome evidence\u201d supports a causal relationship between claimant\u2019s allowed conditions and his lack of wages. We find that \u201csome evidence\u201d exists. Dr. Schneider\u2019s reports establish that claimant\u2019s allowed condition would have prevented him from resuming his former position of employment. Claimant's Ohio Bureau of Employment Services card indicates that he was looking for work, presumably consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>with Dr. Schneider\u2019s restrictions. Claimant\u2019s sworn wage statements, however, indicate that his efforts were unsuccessful. Taken together, these documents are \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting claimant\u2019s alleged wage loss due to the allowed conditions. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Turning to claimant\u2019s AWW, the commission, as a general rule, computes AWW by dividing claimant\u2019s total wages for the year preceding the date of injury by fifty-two weeks. R.C. 4123.61. The statute, however, also provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">\u201cIn ascertaining the average weekly wage for the year previous to the injury, or the date the disability due to the occupational disease begins any period of unemployment due to sickness, industrial depression, strike, lockout, or other causes beyond the employee\u2019s control shall be eliminated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">In the case at bar, the commission calculated claimant\u2019s AWW at $237.37 by excluding periods of unemployment. The appellant claims that because claimant voluntarily accepted seasonal work, layoff periods were not beyond his control and, therefore, should not have been excluded. For the reasons stated previously, this argument is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Appellant also alleges that the AWW creates a windfall for claimant since it exceeds any weekly wage received by claimant when he was working. This, too, fails. Wage loss compensation is paid at sixty-six- and two-thirds percent of the AWW. Two-thirds of claimant\u2019s AWW, as set by the commission, is $158.24. Claimant\u2019s weekly wage with appellant, based on a forty-hour week, was $260.40. Claimant\u2019s AWW thus does not provide a windfall for the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Appellant\u2019s claim that the commission did not adequately explain its calculation also lacks merit. The commission\u2019s order specifically indicated that it omitted weeks of unemployment in arriving at its figure. Contrary to appellant\u2019s representation, this explanation satisfies <em>State ex rel. Mitchell v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 481, 6 OBR 531, 453 N.E.2d 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">We reverse that portion of the appellate court\u2019s judgment sustaining the commission\u2019s wage loss award from January 1, 1988 through April 15, 1988. We order the commission to recalculate the award in accordance with this decision. The balance of the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed in part,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A7q\">\n<em>affirmed in part</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ADsO\">\n<em>and writ allowed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b693-12\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
