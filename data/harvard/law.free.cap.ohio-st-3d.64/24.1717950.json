We will also determine the effect, if any, a city charter may have on a city\u2019s right to appeal a decision of its own board of zoning appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In the absence of constitutional or statutory authority, the aggrieved party may not seek appellate review of the order of an administrative determination as the right to appeal is neither inherent nor inalienable. See <em>Roper v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 168, 173, 18 O.O.2d 437, 440, 180 N.E.2d 591, 594. While administrative appeals on the state level are governed by the Administrative Procedure Act (R.C. Chapter 119), administrative appeals at the township and municipal levels are governed by R.C. Chapter 2506. R.C. 2506.01, in relevant part, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\"><em>\u201cEvery final order, </em>adjudication, or decision of any officer, tribunal, authority, <em>board, </em>bureau, commission, department, or other division of any political subdivision of the state <em>may be reviewed by the court of common pleas </em>of the county in which the principal office of the political subdivision is located as provided in Chapter 2505. of the Revised Code, except as modified by this chapter.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">R.C. Chapter 2506, while providing generally for administrative appeals from administrative determinations by political subdivisions, does not address the question of <em>who </em>has standing to bring such an appeal. Under the common law, it is well settled that the right to appeal can be exercised only by those parties who are able to demonstrate a present interest in the subject matter of the litigation which has been prejudiced by the judgment of the lower court. <em>Ohio Contract Carriers Assn., Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1942), 140 Ohio St. 160, 161, 23 O.O. 369, 370, 42 N.E.2d 758, 759. \u201cAppeal lies only on behalf of a party aggrieved by the final order appealed from. Appeals are not allowed for the purposes of settling abstract questions, but only to correct errors injuriously affecting the appellant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">In prior cases involving standing to appeal a board of zoning appeals\u2019 determination to the common pleas court, this court has not interpreted R.C. 2506.01 as limiting standing only to the party whose requested variance was denied. Adjacent or contiguous property owners who oppose and participate in the administrative proceedings concerning the issuance of a variance are equally entitled to seek appellate review under R.C. 2506.01. See <em>Roper, supra, </em>at syllabus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThe Legislature, in our opinion, recognized the need for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>an opportunity for review of the decisions of administrative agencies and broadened the right of review to include \u2018every final order, adjudication, or decision of any * * * board * * * of any political subdivision of the state.\u2019 \u201d <em>Roper, supra, </em>173 Ohio St. at 173, 18 O.O.2d at 440, 180 N.E.2d at 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The court of appeals, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>limited the municipality\u2019s ability to challenge decisions of its own board of zoning appeals by grafting a \u201cdirectly affected\u201d requirement for standing to the provisions of R.C. 2506.01. This language was taken from our prior decision in <em>Schomaeker v. First Natl. Bank </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 304, 20 O.O.3d 285, 421 N.E.2d 530. In <em>Schomaeker, </em>a contiguous property owner challenged the village planning commission\u2019s grant of a use variance by seeking declaratory judgment relief in the court of common pleas. <em>Id. </em>at 305, 20 O.O.3d at 286, 421 N.E.2d at 533. We held that such an action did not lie because the property owner had standing to bring a direct appeal pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2506. <em>Id. </em>at 310, 20 O.O.3d at 289, 421 N.E.2d at 536. In other words, since the property owner was a person \u201cdirectly affected\u201d by the order of the planning commission, she possessed standing to seek review in the courts of common pleas. <em>Id. </em>at 312, 20 O.O.3d at 290, 421 N.E.2d at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The \u201cdirectly affected\u201d language in <em>Schomaeker </em>merely serves to clarify the basis upon which a private property owner, as distinguished from the public at large, could challenge the board of zoning appeals\u2019 approval of the variance. The private litigant has standing to complain of harm which is unique to himself. In contrast, a private property owner across town, who seeks reversal of the granting of a variance because of its effect on the character of the city as a whole, would lack standing because his injury does not differ from that suffered by the community at large. The latter litigant would, therefore, be unable to demonstrate the necessary unique prejudice which resulted from the board\u2019s approval of the requested variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The case <em>sub judice </em>does not involve a particular landowner aggrieved by a board of zoning appeals\u2019 decision to grant a requested variance. Rather, it is the municipality itself which demands appellate review. Appellee Bar\u2019s Sahara\u2019s position is that it is only under the narrowest of circumstances that a municipality could be directly affected by a decision of its board of zoning appeals. According to appellee, an example of such limiting circumstance would be a variance permitting a noxious or heavy industrial use adjacent to property owned by a municipality, such as a park, which would directly affect the municipality, thereby entitling it to appeal the issuance of the variance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>This interpretation of <em>Schomaeker\u2019s </em>\u201cdirectly affected\u201d language would deny the city appellate review of the board\u2019s determination unless the city could establish standing via the interests of a property owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">We conclude that there is absolutely no reason to limit the municipality\u2019s standing through the use of a \u201cdirectly affected\u201d test and thereby preclude it from initiating an appeal under R.C. Chapter 2506. R.C. 2506.01 makes no mention of a \u201cdirectly affected\u201d requirement. Instead, the statute applies to \u201c[e]very final order.\u201d It is doubtful that the General Assembly would have used the term \u201cevery\u201d if it had intended to exclude orders adverse to municipalities. The broad language of R.C. 2506.01 necessitates the conclusion that municipalities do have legislative authority to appeal rulings of their own boards of zoning appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Additionally, we recognize that there is nothing in R.C. 2506.01 that would limit the rights of a municipality, or treat it differently than any other party. As this court noted in <em>Gold Coast Realty v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(1971), 26 Ohio St.2d 37, 41, 55 O.O.2d 20, 23, 268 N.E.2d 280, 282:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u201cThese sections [R.C. 2506.01 through 2506.04] set forth the procedure for appeals from administrative officers and agencies to the courts. <em>A perusal of R.C. Chapter 2506 discloses nothing which would prohibit the city or commissioner of building from appealing adverse rulings of the Cleveland Board of Zoning Appeals, so long as such rulings are among those prescribed by R.C. 2506.01.\u201d </em><footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">In dismissing Willoughby Hills\u2019 administrative appeal, the court of common pleas, and later the court of appeals, relied primarily upon two cases. The first case is <em>State, ex rel. Broadway Petroleum Corp., v. Elyria </em>(1969), 18 Ohio St.2d 23, 47 O.O.2d 149, 247 N.E.2d 471. The second and more recent decision relied upon is <em>Kasper v. Coury </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 185, 555 N.E.2d 310. However, the court of appeals failed to observe that neither of these two cases prohibits Willoughby Hills from filing an administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">In <em>Broadway Petroleum, </em>a relator, whose request for a building permit was granted by the board of zoning appeals, filed a petition in mandamus against the city of Elyria, its building inspector and its mayor (\u201crespondents\u201d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>requiring them to comply with the board\u2019s determination that the permit be issued.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The respondents challenged the writ of mandamus by appealing to the court of appeals, which reversed the order issuing the writ. We concluded that the judgment of the court of appeals was in error because it \u201cerroneously authorized an attack upon a decision that the Elyria Board of Zoning Appeals was authorized to make.\u201d <em>Id., </em>18 Ohio St.2d at 26, 47 O.O.2d at 151, 247 N.E.2d at 474. Specifically, we held:</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u201c * * * [W]here legislation, <em>including the city\u2019s charter and its ordinances, </em>has specifically provided for the review by a city board of zoning appeals of the determination of its building inspector in refusing a building permit, neither the building inspector, the city nor its mayor may attack or avoid in judicial proceedings a decision of that board, <em>except as authorized by legislation to do so.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 32, 47 O.O.2d at 154, 247 N.E.2d at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In <em>Kasper, </em>this court revisited <em>Broadway Petroleum </em>and applied its holding to a situation, similar to the one in the case at bar, where a township zoning inspector\u2019s administrative appeal of a board of zoning appeals\u2019 decision to grant a variance was dismissed by the common pleas court for lack of standing. Essentially, the issue presented for our review in <em>Kasper </em>was \u201cwhether R.C. 519.24 provides a township zoning inspector or township board of trustees the right to appeal a decision of the board of zoning appeals to the court of common pleas.\u201d <em>Kasper, supra, </em>51 Ohio St.3d at 186, 555 N.E.2d at 311. We recognized that <em>Broadway Petroleum </em>created an exception which <em>would </em>permit the administrative official to seek appellate review as long as such right was legislatively authorized. <em>Id. </em>at 187, 555 N.E.2d at 312. In particular, <em>Kasper </em>focused its attention on interpreting whether R.C. 519.24 was the \u201clegislation\u201d referred to in <em>Broadway Petroleum </em>which authorized the township trustees to file an administrative appeal. We concluded in <em>Kasper </em>at 188, 555 N.E.2d at 313, that R.C. 519.24 neither explicitly nor implicitly provided the necessary legislative authority to allow for an appeal of the board\u2019s decision and, as a consequence, the township trustees or zoning inspector did not have the authority to \u201cattack\u201d a decision of the board of zoning appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Thus, <em>Kasper </em>is distinguishable from the instant appeal in that we are now faced with ascertaining the legal effect to be given to a municipality\u2019s charter. Unlike <em>Kasper, </em>in the case <em>sub judice </em>we are presented with the Charter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>the city of Willoughby Hills, which provides the requisite legislation to enable the city to appeal adverse rulings of its board of zoning appeals to the common pleas court. Specifically, pursuant to Sections 3 and 7, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Willoughby Hills adopted a home-rule charter which empowered the city to enact and enforce comprehensive zoning regulations independent of any statutory provisions which authorize municipal zoning. In accordance with the authority set forth in Section 5.1 of the charter,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Willoughby Hills promulgated a Master Plan and comprehensive zoning ordinances for the protection of its residents by providing for the development, physical character and future growth of the municipality. The charter also established a board of building and zoning appeals in Section 5.3, upon which was conferred exclusive authority within the municipality to grant exceptions to or variances from the zoning ordinances or building codes. However, Section 5.33 of the charter specifically authorized Willoughby Hills to attack or avoid decisions of the board of building and zoning appeals, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u201cFinality of Decisions. Decisions of the Board of Building and Zoning Appeals shall be final within the Municipality, except that an appeal therefrom <em>may be taken </em>to any court of record in accordance with the laws of the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>of Ohio, by any proper and interested party <em>including the </em>Municipality.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Accordingly, we hold that where a municipality\u2019s charter or its ordinances expressly allow the municipality to seek appellate review of determinations made by its board of zoning appeals, the municipality has standing pursuant to R.C. 2506.01 to \u201cattack or avoid\u201d such decisions in the common pleas court. Alternatively, in the absence of a charter provision or ordinance which expressly provides for appellate review to the common pleas court, the municipality may only defend a decision of the board of zoning appeals on appeal to the common pleas court. See <em>Kasper, supra, </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">As we have previously seen, a statutory or constitutional grant is necessary before a party can make use of the state court system. See <em>Roper, supra. </em>The Charter of the city of Willoughby Hills could <em>not </em>grant a right to such appellate review had the General Assembly not enacted R.C. Chapter 2506. Absent R.C. 2506.01, the final order of the board of zoning appeals could not be reviewed by the common pleas court regardless of which party, the property owner or the municipality, was aggrieved. However, in the instant case, we have determined the General Assembly by enacting R.C. 2506.01 provided a mechanism for appeals, thereby allowing the municipality to appeal under its own charter. Section 5.33 of the Willoughby Hills Charter specifically authorized the city to avail itself of an R.C. Chapter 2506 administrative appeal in the common pleas court from the decision of its own board of building and zoning appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">We recognize that Section 5.33 demonstrates appellant\u2019s fundamental interest in protecting the integrity of its zoning ordinances. Illegal variances undermine legitimate municipal objectives implemented by comprehensive zoning ordinances. A decision by a board of zoning appeals which allows a variance to expand to an area greater than that which is otherwise permitted by zoning ordinances is, in effect, a legislative act done by a quasi-judicial body. See <em>Schomaeker, supra, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 312, 20 O.O.3d at 290, 421 N.E.2d at 537. (\u201cThe decision of a planning commission granting a use variance is made in a judicial, capacity, and the reasonableness of such decision is subject to appeal pursuant to R.C. 2506.01 and 2506.04.\u201d) The purpose behind R.C. Chapter 2506 is to authorize judicial review of local quasi-judicial decisions that are \u201cunconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the whole record. * * * \u201d R.C. 2506.04. Allowing a municipal corporation standing to appeal to the common pleas court when its board of zoning appeals either exceeds its limited jurisdiction or misapplies the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>standards established for the granting of variances is certainly within the purview of R.C. 2506.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and hold that where permitted by charter or ordinance, R.C. 2506.01 does not prohibit a municipality from seeking appellate review of an adverse decision of its board of zoning appeals. The cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b190-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Wright and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b190-8\">Douglas, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b190-9\">H. Brown, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-9\">. The syllabus in <em>Roper </em>provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">\u201cA resident, elector and property owner of a township, who appears before a township Board of Zoning Appeals, is represented by an attorney, opposes and protests the changing of a zoned area from residential to commercial, and advises the board, on the record, that if the decision of the board is adverse to him he intends to appeal from the decision to a court, has a right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>appeal to the Common Pleas Court if the appeal is properly and timely made pursuant to Sections 519.15 and 2506.01 to 2506.04, inclusive, and Chapter 2505, Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b186-9\">. The reference to \u201csuch rulings\u201d in <em>Gold Coast Realty </em>is to final orders, adjudications, or decisions, which were defined in former R.C. 2506.01.

The <em>Broadway Petroleum </em>opinion, 18 Ohio St.2d at 32, 47 O.O.2d at 154, 247 N.E.2d at 477, expressly reserved the question of whether R.C.
