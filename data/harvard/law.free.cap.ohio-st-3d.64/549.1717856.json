Dr. DiMarco diagnosed asbestosis, related it to work exposure, and concluded that claimant was totally disabled as a result. On the other hand, Dr. Martin found no asbestosis attributable to work exposure, only pleural disease. He also diagnosed obstructed airways disease due to claimant\u2019s chronic smoking. While both causes contributed to claimant\u2019s disability, Dr. Martin could not quantify their respective contributions. We must determine whether these reports are \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting an award of temporary total disability compensation from February 20, 1987 through February 1, 1988. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. We find that they are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The appellate court correctly concluded that neither the reports of Drs. Martin nor DiMarco, standing alone, provided \u201csome evidence\u201d of temporary total disability. Dr. Martin\u2019s report fails to provide some evidence because it partially attributes claimant\u2019s inability to work to a nonindustrial obstructed airways disease. See <em>State ex rel. Burdette v. Dayton Walther Corp. </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 29, 14 OBR 331, 470 N.E.2d 897 (the presence of other nonindustrial lung problems precludes a finding of permanent total disability in a respiratory occupational disease claim). See, also, <em>State ex rel. Frigidaire Div., Gen. Motors Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 105, 518 N.E.2d 1194 (commission can abuse its discretion by relying on a report that partially attributes disability to a nonallowed condition) and <em>State ex rel. Taylor v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 7 Ohio App.3d 263, 7 OBR 343, 455 N.E.2d 513 (no evidence in file exists to support a claim of permanent and total disability when a physician fails to specifically attribute disability to an allowed condition).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Unlike Dr. Martin, Dr. DiMarco attributes claimant\u2019s condition exclusively to a nonallowed condition \u2014 asbestosis. As the parties and examining physicians agree, \u201casbestosis\u201d and \u201casbestos pleural disease\u201d are distinct terms that should not be used interchangeably. Accordingly, Dr. DiMarco\u2019s reports do not support a temporary-total-disability compensation award.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">The appellate court\u2019s cumulative reading of the doctors\u2019 reports \u2014 which pieced together Dr. DiMarco\u2019s work-related disability certification with Dr. Martin\u2019s accepted diagnosis \u2014 conflicts with <em>State ex rel. Zamora v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 17, 543 N.E.2d 87. Under <em>Zamora, </em>the commission cannot rely on a report that it rejected to deny a claim. Here, Dr. DiMarco diagnosed asbestosis. Dr. Martin disagreed and the commission accepted his diagnosis. In so doing, the commission inherently rejected part of Dr. DiMarco\u2019s reports. Thus, Dr. DiMarco\u2019s reports that diagnose asbesto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>sis could not be some evidence supporting temporary total disability compensation and can not be part of any cumulative reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Appellant also claims that the commission\u2019s order does not fulfill the evidentiary specificity requirements of <em>State ex rel. Mitchell v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 481, 6 OBR 531, 453 N.E.2d 721. This contention fails. <em>Mitchell </em>was intended to assist courts in their review of commission orders. The order at bar is capable of our review as written and does not require more elaborate explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">For the reasons discussed above, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b702-8\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Wright and H. Brown,, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AvQJ\">Douglas and Resnick, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b702-9\">Douglas, J., dissenting. I would affirm, in all respects, the judgment of the court of appeals.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b702-10\">Resnick, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
