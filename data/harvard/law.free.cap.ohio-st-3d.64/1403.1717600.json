We perceive no prejudice to respondent because the principal issue would be argued the same way under either a mandamus or prohibition theory. Moreover, since we consider the case as one in prohibition, respondent\u2019s argument that the complaint should be dismissed because it was not captioned as a \u2018petition\u2019 in mandamus is moot.\u201d</p>\n<judges id=\"b846-5\">Holmes and Resnick, JJ., would grant.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
