We must consider the admissibility of the statements at trial pursuant to the hearsay exception contained in Evid.R. 803(4). The principal dilemma arises in attempting to apply to children evidentiary rules which were drafted with adults in mind. In applying these rules of evidence to children, we encounter considerable problems in devising a reasonable and workable application. Nevertheless, we continue to strive for balance in this troublesome area of the law. As was noted in <em>State v. Boston, supra, </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 113, 545 N.E.2d at 1226: \u201c * * * [I]t is the goal of all the members of the judiciary that results are reached that are equitable and fair to both society and defendants who find themselves charged with the crime of child abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">In considering the circumstances in the instant case, we must address two principal issues: (1) Did the trial judge abuse his discretion in allowing Dr. Saluke to repeat at trial statements Kristen made to her during the medical examination as an Evid.R. 803(4) hearsay exception? <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) What, if any, is the impact of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on our inquiry?</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">For the reasons which follow, after careful consideration, we resolve the first issue by finding no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge in admitting the hearsay testimony pursuant to Evid.R. 803(4). As to the second issue, we determine that Evid.R. 803(4), as applied to the circumstances of this case, is a firmly rooted hearsay exception; we apply the analysis contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number><em>White v. Illinois </em>(1992), 502 U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848, to that conclusion; and we find no violation of Dever\u2019s right of confrontation. We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, and reinstate Dever\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The initial issue for our consideration is whether the trial court abused its discretion in admitting into evidence Kristen\u2019s hearsay statement to Dr. Saluke under Evid.R. 803(4). A related question, which directly affects the Confrontation Clause issue presented in Part III of this opinion, is whether the Evid.R. 803(4) exception, in the circumstances of this case, is a firmly rooted hearsay exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Because this court wrestled with many issues raised in similar circumstances in <em>State v. Boston, supra, </em>a detailed examination of that case is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\"><em>Boston </em>involved a defendant who was tried and convicted of gross sexual imposition based on an incident involving his two-and-one-half-year-old daughter. The defendant had been given weekend visitation rights with his daughter pending a divorce from his wife. After being with the father one weekend, the child awoke during the night screaming. The mother questioned the child, who related, \u201cDaddy put something up my bucket.\u201d Upon finding redness around the child\u2019s vagina and anus, the mother took the child to a doctor the next day. Although the doctor found no specific evidence of abuse, he referred the mother to Akron Children\u2019s Hospital. The director of the hospital\u2019s Child Abuse Team, a pediatrician, later examined the child. The child told the pediatrician that \u201cD\u00e1ddy put a telephone in here and it hurt.\u201d Based on the child\u2019s statements, her medical history, and the examination (which revealed a whitish discharge and redness around the labia minora, and a hymenal opening larger than normal), the doctor made a diagnosis of probable vaginal penetration and possible rectal penetration. A psychologist, an expert in child sexual abuse, counselled the child, and determined that the child was not falsifying, and that she had been a victim of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">At defendant\u2019s trial, the prosecution attempted to present the child\u2019s testimony. The trial judge conducted a voir dire examination of the child, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>found her incompetent to testify.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, hearsay statements made by the child to her mother, to the doctor who had diagnosed probable vaginal penetration, and to the psychologist were admitted at trial. In addition, the court permitted opinion testimony that the child had not fantasized her accusation. The jury returned a verdict of guilty of gross sexual imposition, and the defendant was sentenced. Upon appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of conviction. <em>Id., </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 108-111, 545 N.E.2d at 1222-1225.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">This court, in reversing the judgment of conviction and remanding to the trial court, addressed a number of evidentiary issues which arise within the context of a child abuse case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Especially relevant to the instant case is Boston\u2019s discussion of Evid.R. 803(4), the hearsay exception involving statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment, including the motivational component of Evid.R. 803(4), the effect of Ohio\u2019s Evid.R. 102 on Evid.R. 803(4), and the admissibility of statements by a child identifying the perpetrator in an abuse prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Evid.R. 803(4) allows into evidence, as an exception to the hearsay rule, \u201c[statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.\u201d Ohio\u2019s Evid.R. 803(4) is identical to Fed.R.Evid. 803(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In essence, <em>Boston </em>found that the admissibility of statements for medical treatment or diagnosis pursuant to Evid.R. 803(4) depends upon the motivation of the declarant to make the statement. \u201c \u2018 * * * The rule\u2019s narrow limitation is based upon the belief that the declarant\u2019s subjective motive generally guarantees the statement\u2019s trustworthiness. Since the effectiveness of the treatment depends upon the accuracy of information given to the physician, the declarant is motivated to tell the truth. * * * <em>Id., </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 121, 545 N.E.2d at 1233, quoting <em>State v. Eastham </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 307, 312, 530 N.E.2d 409, 413 (H. Brown, J., concurring). Serious problems arise in admitting the statements when a \u201cchild of tender years\u201d is the declarant because that child will often not be personally motivated to seek treatment. \u201c * * * [S]uch a young child is not giving the doctor the information for the purposes required by Evid.R. 803(4). More than likely, the child does not even want to be seeing the doctor[.]\u201d <em>Boston, supra, </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 122, 545 N.E.2d at 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">While <em>Boston </em>noted that many courts have applied Evid.R. 803(4) in child abuse prosecutions when the declarant is a young child without considering the motivational component of that hearsay exception, <em>Boston </em>concluded that such an interpretation is inconsistent with Ohio\u2019s version of Evid.R. 102. <em>Id., </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 121-122, 545 N.E.2d at 1233-1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Fed.R.Evid. 102 states that the Federal Rules of Evidence shall be construed in order to promote the \u201cgrowth and development of the law of evidence * * In contrast, Ohio Evid.R. 102 states that Ohio\u2019s Rules of Evidence \u201cshall be construed to state the common law of Ohio unless the rule clearly indicates that a change is intended * * <em>Boston </em>concluded that this significant difference between the two rules means that federal courts (or any court sitting in a state which has a rule identical to Fed.R.Evid. 102) are permitted to construe the rules of evidence broadly, but that Ohio courts may not do so. <em>Id., </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 116, 545 N.E.2d at 1229. See Staff Note to Ohio Evid.R. 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\"><em>Boston, </em>in commenting on a federal court decision that did not question whether a three-year-old child\u2019s motivation in telling a doctor about an abuse episode was relevant to the admissibility of the child\u2019s hearsay statements <em>(United States v. Nick </em>[C.A.9, 1979], 604 F.2d 1199), stated: \u201c* * * [B]y discarding the motivational component of Evid.R. 803(4) * * *, the federal appellate court has rewritten the rule \u2014 or at least very liberally construed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>rule to promote the \u2018 * * * growth and development of the law of evidence * * ' Fed.R.Evid. 102.\u201d <em>Boston, </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 122, 545 N.E.2d at 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\"><em>Boston </em>also raised the question whether Evid.R. 803(4) may be construed to allow into evidence a young child\u2019s statement identifying the perpetrator of the abuse. <em>Id., </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 123, 545 N.E.2d at 1235. Because <em>Boston </em>conditioned the admissibility of statements made by a child on the child\u2019s motivation to seek treatment, it was not necessary in that case to resolve that specific issue. If the child was not personally motivated to seek treatment, <em>Boston </em>found that <em>none </em>of the child\u2019s statements would be admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 803(4), including the statement identifying the perpetrator of the abuse. <em>Id. </em>at 122-123, 545 N.E.2d at 1234-1235.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In summary, <em>Boston </em>reasoned that the common-law hearsay exception for statements made for medical treatment stems from the declarant\u2019s motivation to speak the truth in order to obtain effective treatment. <em>Boston </em>also found that Ohio\u2019s Evid.R. 803(4), as adopted in 1980, did not dispense with the common-law motivational component. <em>Id. </em>at 121, 545 N.E.2d at 1233. Moreover, <em>Boston </em>found that the child declarant\u2019s statements to the pediatrician were not admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 803(4), because the motivational component was absent, and that the statements did not fall within a defined hearsay exception. <em>Boston </em>did find, however, that certain of the statements were admissible under <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, 608, which requires a \u201cparticularized guarantee of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Boston, supra, </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 125-128, 545 N.E.2d at 1237-1239.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\"><em>Boston, </em>in noting that Ohio Evid.R. 102 requires an Ohio court to apply the common law unless a change clearly is intended, essentially found that no change from the common-law motivational requirement was intended, and hence concluded that the medical diagnosis or treatment hearsay exception will rarely apply when a child of tender years is the declarant. <em>Id., </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 120-122, 545 N.E.2d at 1232-1234. For the reasons which follow, we disagree with that conclusion reached in <em>Boston, </em>and modify <em>Boston </em>accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>We are aware of the significant factual difference between the case at bar and <em>Boston. Boston </em>involved allegations of child sexual abuse which occurred in the context of a \u201cbitter battle for custody.\u201d <em>Id., </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 108, 545 N.E.2d at 1222. For that reason, the possibility that the child\u2019s statements to professionals may have been programmed or influenced by the custody battle made those statements more suspect than the statements in the instant case. Although the <em>Boston </em>court did not approve the admission of the child\u2019s statements under Evid.R. 803(4), the court did ultimately find them admissible because they were sufficiently trustworthy. However, in the circumstances of this case, we find that the trial court did not err in finding that the child\u2019s statements were in fact admissible under Evid.R. 803(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The practical result of reading <em>Boston\u2019s </em>rigid motivational requirement into Evid.R. 803(4) is that a young child\u2019s statements to a doctor in the course of a medical examination will virtually never be admissible under that rule. While we do recognize that Evid.R. 102 significantly restricts our ability to interpret the Ohio Rules of Evidence,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we do not believe that Evid.R. 102 requires such a sweeping result.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Though we agree with <em>Boston </em>that \u201capplying this [Evid.R. 803(4) ] exception to this category of cases entails inherent problems[,]\u201d <em>id., </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 121, 545 N.E.2d at 1234, we do not believe Evid.R. 102 mandates such a restrictive approach to these problems. <em>Boston </em>gives the impression that if the slightest possibility exists that the child\u2019s statements were not motivated by her own desire to obtain medical diagnosis or treatment, the statements may not come in as an Evid.R. 803(4) exception. We believe that it is not necessary to apply that approach to every instance in which a child of tender years makes a statement in the course of diagnosis and treatment. While we recognize that a young child would probably not personally seek treatment, but would generally be directed to treatment by an adult, we do not find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>the child\u2019s statements relating to medical diagnosis or treatment are always untrustworthy for that reason alone. Once the child is at the doctor\u2019s office, the probability of understanding the significance of the visit is heightened and the motivation for diagnosis and treatment will normally be present. That is to say, the initial desire to seek treatment may be absent, but the motivation certainly can arise once the child has been taken to the doctor. Absent extraordinary circumstances, the child has no more motivation to lie than an adult would in similar circumstances. Everyday experience tells us most children know that if they do not tell the truth to the person treating them, they may get worse and not better. An overly strict motivational requirement for the statements of young children will almost <em>always </em>keep those statements out of evidence. That is not an acceptable balance of competing interests. We are unwilling to approve a rule which allows a person accused of abusing a young child (when there is no physical evidence of that abuse) to keep the child\u2019s statements to a doctor out of evidence simply because of a lack of initial motivation to seek treatment. In many situations, the statements of young children are sufficiently trustworthy and can appropriately be admitted pursuant to Evid.R. 803(4). See <em>State v. Larson </em>(Minn.1991), 472 N.W.2d 120; <em>People v. Meeboer </em>(1992), 439 Mich. 310, 484 N.W.2d 621. We further find that Evid.R. 102 does not foreclose that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">We do not find that the common-law basis for the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule, at least where young children are concerned, is as specific as <em>Boston </em>found. Rather, the focus must be slightly different when a child is involved. The trial court has broad discretion to determine whether a declaration should be admissible as a hearsay exception. <em>State v. Rohdes </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 225, 229, 23 OBR 382, 385, 492 N.E.2d 430, 434; see, generally, <em>State v. Duncan </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 215, 7 O.O.3d 380, 373 N.E.2d 1234. The trial court should consider the circumstances surrounding the making of the hearsay statement. If the trial court finds in voir dire that the child\u2019s statements were inappropriately influenced by another, then those statements would not have been made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment. This inquiry will vary, depending on the facts of each case. For example, the trial court may consider whether the child\u2019s statement was in response to a suggestive or leading question (as was the case in <em>Idaho v. Wright), </em>and any other factor which would affect the reliability of the statements (such as the bitter custody battle in <em>State v. Boston). </em>If no such factors exist, then the evidence should be admitted. The credibility of the statements would then be for the jury to evaluate in its role as factfinder. In addition, the witness whose testimony brings in the child\u2019s hearsay statement can be cross-examined about the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement. But if the trial court discerns the existence of sufficient factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>indicating that the child\u2019s statements were not made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment, the statements must be excluded as not falling within Evid.R. 803(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">We find further support for our holding in that portion of Evid.R. 102 which allows a court to deviate from the common law when \u201cthe rule clearly indicates that a change is intended * * Prior to 1980, Ohio allowed into evidence hearsay statements in medical treatment situations only when the statements were specifically relevant to the doctor\u2019s <em>treatment </em>of the patient. See <em>Cleveland Ry. Co. v. Merk </em>(1932), 124 Ohio St. 596, 180 N.E. 51. When Evid.R. 803(4) was adopted in 1980, that rule changed the common law by also allowing into evidence hearsay statements for purposes of <em>diagnosis. </em>See Staff Note to Evid.R. 803(4); Palmer, Ohio Courtroom Evidence (1988) 23-12 to 23-13, Chapter 23. This change, making Ohio\u2019s Evid.R. 803(4) identical to Fed.R.Evid. 803(4), shows that a strict common-law interpretation of the hearsay exception for medical diagnosis or treatment is not appropriate in all situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">In addition, the motivational element of Evid.R. 803(4) (often termed the \u201cselfish interest\u201d rationale) is not the only reason that statements for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment are more reliable than other hearsay statements. In <em>Renville, supra, </em>the court noted that there is a second reason for the medical diagnosis or treatment hearsay exception \u2014 that such statements are \u201creasonably relied on by a physician in treatment or diagnosis.\u201d <em>Id., </em>779 F.2d at 436. See, generally, Mosteller, Child Sexual Abuse and Statements for the Purpose of Medical Diagnosis or Treatment (1989), 67 N.C.L.Rev. 257. See, also, 2 McCormick on Evidence (4 Ed.1992) 250 (\u201cThe general reliance upon \u2018subjective\u2019 facts by the medical profession and the ability of its members to evaluate the accuracy of statements made to them is considered sufficient protection against contrived symptoms. Within the medical profession, the analysis of the rule appears to be that facts reliable enough to be relied on in reaching a diagnosis have sufficient trustworthiness to satisfy hearsay concerns.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Because the Ohio version of Evid.R. 803(4) allows the admission of hearsay statements made for the purpose of <em>diagnosis, </em>it is apparent that this reliance factor is also a basis for the exception. The aspect of Evid.R. 803(4) which provides a hearsay exception for statements for diagnosis is inconsistent with the rigid \u201cselfish interest\u201d analysis of <em>Boston. </em>Although we recognize that \u201cprofessional reliance,\u201d standing alone, may not be as significant an indicator of reliability as \u201cselfish interest,\u201d it must be afforded some weight. It further supports the admissibility of hearsay statements in situations involv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>ing young children. For those reasons, the motivation of the declarant is not the only factor supporting the reliability of the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Keeping in mind that the child\u2019s motivation is not the sole focus of the Evid.R. 803(4) inquiry, we find evidence of the child\u2019s motivation in the record, as revealed in Dr. Saluke\u2019s testimony. The court of appeals, in its majority opinion reversing Dever\u2019s conviction, found insufficient evidence of Kristen\u2019s motivation to seek treatment. Dr. Saluke testified that, during the course of the examination, she followed the customary procedure of explaining to Kristen why she was asking the questions. The court of appeals, however, was unconvinced that Kristen understood the purpose of the questioning. In reaching that conclusion, the court was heavily influenced by Dr. Saluke\u2019s testimony that she could not recall Kristen\u2019s specific response to the explanation of the need for the questioning. But, as we have stated above, a court should not presume, as the court of appeals did, that the statements are unreliable merely because there is no indisputable evidence of the child\u2019s motivation. Rather, in a case such as this, when an examination of the surrounding circumstances casts little doubt on the motivation of the child, it is permissible to assume that the factors underlying Evid.R. 803(4) are present.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">\u201cWhile in cases involving adults a cognitive connection between speaking the truth to physicians and receiving proper medical care may seem obvious, further analysis of the circumstances surrounding the examination of a child is necessary to determine whether the child understood the need to be truthful to the physician.\u201d <em>People v. Meeboer, supra, </em>439 Mich, at 322-323, 484 N.W.2d at 626. We agree with this reasoning, but stress that our holding in this case requiring this specific examination of the circumstances applies only to Evid.R. 803(4) and only to declarants of tender years.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">We therefore hold that a trial court does not abuse its discretion when it admits a child declarant\u2019s statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment pursuant to Evid.R. 803(4), without first establishing the child declarant\u2019s unavailability to testify. Once the statements are admitted, their credibility is a matter to be evaluated by the factfinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>In applying our holding to the facts of this case, we find that the trial court properly evaluated the circumstances accompanying the making of the child\u2019s statements. Since there is insufficient reason to doubt that the statements were made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the statements were admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 803(4). Neither Evid.R. 803(4) nor 102 requires exclusion of the child\u2019s statements from the evidence, when as here the record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the requirements of Evid.R. 803(4) were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">We now proceed to specifically consider the propriety of admitting a child\u2019s statement identifying the perpetrator of her abuse under Evid.R. 803(4). Generally, statements of fault are seen as outside the scope of Evid.R. 803(4) because such statements are usually not relevant to either diagnosis or treatment. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Iron Shell </em>(C.A. 8, 1980), 633 F.2d 77, 84. However, in <em>United States v. Renville, supra, </em>779 F.2d at 436-438, the leading case in this area, a federal appellate court found that statements made by a child identifying the perpetrator of the sexual abuse <em>are </em>pertinent to both diagnosis and treatment of the child. The <em>Renville </em>court made a distinction between statements of fault generally (not admissible pursuant to the medical diagnosis or treatment hearsay exception) and specific statements of <em>identity </em>by children in sexual abuse cases (which the court found to be admissible). The <em>Renville </em>court found several reasons why the statement of identity is pertinent to treatment or diagnosis. The statement assists the doctor in treating any actual injuries the child may have, in preventing future abuse of the child, and in assessing the emotional and psychological impact of the abuse on the child.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\"><em>Boston, </em>in considering the admissibility of a child\u2019s statement identifying the perpetrator, stated that <em>\u201cRenville\u2019s </em>conclusion, however, rests on the underlying assumption that the victim\u2019s motivation in identifying the abuser is to aid in her treatment or diagnosis.\u201d <em>Boston, </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 123, 545 N.E.2d at 1235. Thus, the <em>Boston </em>court was not required to resolve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>question, even though it did raise it. In so doing, <em>Boston </em>did not reject <em>Renville\u2019s </em>analysis <em>per se, </em>but found it inappropriate in the circumstances of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In view of our modification of <em>Boston, </em>we adopt <em>Renville\u2019s </em>reasoning, and hold that statements made by a child during a medical examination identifying the perpetrator of sexual abuse, if made for purpose of diagnosis and treatment, are admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 803(4), when such statements are made for the purposes enumerated in that rule. This means that a child\u2019s statement identifying his or her abuser should be treated the same as any other statement which is made for the purposes set forth in Evid.R. 803(4). We thus find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Kristen\u2019s statement identifying Dever as her abuser.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">In order to avoid any confusion we note that Evid.R. 807, effective July 1, 1991 and therefore not applicable here, requires an examination of the totality of the circumstances surrounding statements made by a child in a child abuse case in order to determine admissibility. The test contained in Evid.R. 807 has a purpose different from the test discussed here. Evid.R. 807\u2019s \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test is designed specifically with Confrontation Clause requirements in mind. See Staff Note to Evid.R. 807. On the other hand, the test under Evid.R. 803(4) goes solely to whether a statement was made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment. If a statement <em>is </em>made for purposes of diagnosis or treatment, it is admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 803(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">We also recognize that Evid.R. 807(A)(2) requires that a trial court make a finding that \u201c[t]he child\u2019s testimony is not reasonably obtainable by the proponent of the statement\u201d before the child\u2019s statements may be admissible pursuant to that exception. On the contrary, no finding of unavailability is necessary when a statement is admitted pursuant to Evid.R. 803(4), because the rule itself provides that availability of the declarant is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">The Staff Note to Evid.R. 807 states: \u201cThe rule recognizes a hearsay exception for the statements of children in abuse situations. This exception is <em>in addition to </em>the exceptions enumerated in Evid.R. 803 and 804.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the trial court in its discretion determines which hearsay exception, if any, would most appropriately support the admission of the child\u2019s statements into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">Having thus found that the trial judge properly admitted Kristen\u2019s statements, as related at trial by Dr. Saluke, pursuant to Evid.R. 803(4), we now consider the impact of the Confrontation Clause on this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>In examining the Confrontation Clause issue, we must consider several decisions by the United States Supreme Court regarding the interplay between the hearsay rule and the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Although the hearsay rule (along with its exceptions) and the Confrontation Clause protect similar values, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly noted that the two are not coextensive. See <em>California v. Green </em>(1970), 399 U.S. 149, 155-156, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 1933-1934, 26 L.Ed.2d 489, 495; <em>Dutton v. Evans </em>(1970), 400 U.S. 74, 86, 91 S.Ct. 210, 218, 27 L.Ed.2d 213, 225-226. Thus, in some situations, even if evidence is admissible at trial as a hearsay exception, that evidence may nonetheless be inadmissible because it violates a defendant\u2019s right of confrontation. The United States Supreme Court has provided a framework in which to analyze how the Confrontation Clause affects a particular hearsay exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">In <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 56, 65, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2538, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, 607, the United States Supreme Court set forth a general approach for accommodating the sometimes competing interests of the Confrontation Clause and the hearsay exceptions. The court stated that the Confrontation Clause \u201coperates in two separate ways to restrict the range of admissible hearsay. First, in conformance with the Framers\u2019 preference for face-to-face accusation, the Sixth Amendment establishes a rule of necessity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In a holding which the court substantially narrowed in later cases, see <em>infra, Roberts </em>stated that the prosecution must make a good faith effort to produce the declarant, or demonstrate the declarant\u2019s unavailability. <em>Id. </em>The declarant\u2019s statement should then be admitted \u201conly if it bears adequate \u2018indicia of reliability.\u2019 Reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception. In other cases, the evidence must be excluded, at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">In <em>United States v. Inadi </em>(1986), 475 U.S. 387, 106 S.Ct. 1121, 89 L.Ed.2d 390, the Supreme Court considered whether the Confrontation Clause requires the prosecution to show that a co-conspirator is unavailable to testify before the co-conspirator\u2019s statements may be admitted into evidence. The court held that the prosecution was not required to establish unavailability in that situation, and that this specific requirement of <em>Roberts </em>applies only where the prosecution seeks to admit testimony from a prior judicial proceeding instead of live testimony. <em>Inadi, </em>475 U.S. at 392-394, 106 S.Ct. at 1124-1126, 89 L.Ed.2d at 396-398. The court stated that <em>Roberts </em>\u201ccannot fairly be read to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>stand for the radical proposition that no out-of-court statement can be introduced by the government without a showing that the declarant is unavailable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394, 106 S.Ct. at 1125, 89 L.Ed.2d at 398. The court also noted that the true mission of the Confrontation Clause is to \u201c \u2018advance \u201cthe accuracy of the truth-determining process in criminal trials.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396, 106 S.Ct. at 1126, 89 L.Ed.2d at 399, quoting <em>Tennessee v. Street </em>(1985), 471 U.S. 409, 415, 105 S.Ct. 2078, 2082, 85 L.Ed.2d 425, 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The Supreme Court again considered the admissibility of statements made by a co-conspirator in <em>Bourjaily v. United States </em>(1987), 483 U.S. 171, 107 S.Ct. 2775, <em>97 </em>L.Ed.2d 144. The court observed that the hearsay exception for statements of a co-conspirator is firmly rooted. <em>Id. </em>at 183, 107 S.Ct. at 2782, 97 L.Ed.2d at 157. For that reason, the Supreme Court held that a co-conspirator\u2019s statements carry with them sufficient \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d and therefore a court need not conduct an independent inquiry into the reliability of the statements. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">While the foregoing cases set forth a general method of applying Confrontation Clause analysis when the declarant does not testify at trial, two recent Supreme Court decisions considered the interaction of the Confrontation Clause with hearsay exceptions in circumstances involving sexual abuse of young children. In <em>Idaho v. Wright </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 805, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638, the court considered whether a trial court properly admitted a hearsay statement made by a child pursuant to Idaho\u2019s \u201cresidual hearsay exception.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court began its analysis by noting that \u201cIdaho\u2019s residual hearsay exception, * * * under which the challenged statements were admitted, * * * is not a firmly rooted hearsay exception for Confrontation Clause purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 110 S.Ct. at 3147, 111 L.Ed.2d at 653. For that reason, <em>Roberts </em>requires that the hearsay testimony be inadmissible unless \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d are present. The court did not believe that the child\u2019s statement was particularly trustworthy,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and therefore found that the state had failed to carry its burden of demonstrating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>\u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d in the totality of the circumstances.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">The <em>Wright </em>court made clear that its analysis would have been completely different if the hearsay exception had been \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d: \u201cAdmission under a firmly rooted hearsay exception satisfies the constitutional requirement of reliability because of the weight accorded longstanding judicial and legislative experience in assessing the trustworthiness of certain types of out-of-court statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 110 S.Ct. at 3147, 111 L.Ed.2d at 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In <em>White v. Illinois, supra, </em>502 U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848, the Supreme Court again considered the use of hearsay statements made by a child against a defendant being prosecuted for sexual assault of the child. The trial court allowed the hearsay statements into evidence as spontaneous declarations and also as statements made in the course of medical treatment. The appellate court affirmed that decision, finding that the accused\u2019s right of confrontation was not denied. Although the four-year-old girl did not testify at trial, no specific finding of unavailability was made by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The <em>White </em>court began its analysis by limiting the application of the unavailability requirement of <em>Roberts, </em>stating that <em>\u201cRoberts </em>stands for the proposition that unavailability analysis is a necessary part of the Confrontation Clause inquiry <em>only when the challenged out-of-court statements were made in the course of a prior judicial proceeding.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>White, supra, </em>502 U.S. at-, 112 S.Ct. at 741, 116 L.Ed.2d at 858. Thus, unavailability of the declarant need not be demonstrated when a hearsay statement is admitted pursuant to an Evid.R. 803 exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">In \u00e1greeing that there was no denial of the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation, the Supreme Court held that \u201cwhere proffered hearsay has sufficient guarantees of reliability to come within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule, the Confrontation Clause is satisfied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 112 S.Ct. at 743, 116 L.Ed.2d at 859. The court noted that such firmly rooted hearsay exceptions as spontaneous declarations and statements made in the course of receiving medical care are recognized as normally occurring in contexts that provide substantial guarantees of trustworthiness. <em>Id. </em>at-, 112 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>742, 116 L.Ed.2d at 859. For that reason, the Confrontation Clause is automatically satisfied by a hearsay exception which is firmly rooted \u2014 the presence of \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d need not be shown. <em>Id. </em>at-, 112 S.Ct. at 742-743, 116 L.Ed.2d at 859-860.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Consistent with that approach, we determine that Evid.R. 803(4) is a firmly rooted hearsay exception in the circumstances of the case before us. See <em>White, supra, </em>at-, 112 S.Ct. at 742, 116 L.Ed.2d at 859, fn. 8. To the extent that <em>Boston </em>indicates a contrary result, we clarify that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">In summary, <em>Wright </em>and <em>White </em>hold that, even in cases involving hearsay statements of children in the prosecution of the children\u2019s alleged abusers, if the hearsay statement at issue falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception, as in the instant case, its admission does not violate the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation. <em>White, supra, </em>at-, 112 S.Ct. at 743, 116 L.Ed.2d at 859; <em>Wright, supra, </em>497 U.S. at-, 110 S.Ct. at 3146, 111 L.Ed.2d at 652. In such a case, the prosecution is not required to demonstrate the unavailability of the declarant. <em>White, supra, </em>at-, 112 S.Ct. at 741, 116 L.Ed.2d at 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-13\">On the other hand, if the hearsay statement at issue does not fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception, further inquiry is required. Hearsay not falling within a firmly rooted exception must be excluded unless \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d can be shown. <em>Wright, supra, </em>497 U.S. at-, 110 S.Ct. at 3147, 111 L.Ed.2d at 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-14\">In the instant case, Kristen\u2019s hearsay statements were admitted under a firmly rooted hearsay exception. Therefore, Dever\u2019s right of confrontation was not denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-15\">Our interpretation of <em>White </em>and <em>Wright </em>comports with the interpretation of other courts. For example, in <em>Dana v. Dept. of Corr. </em>(C.A. 8, 1992), 958 F.2d 237, the court found that a four-year-old child\u2019s hearsay statements to a pediatrician fell within the medical diagnosis and treatment hearsay exception. The court, citing <em>White, </em>concluded that, because this exception is firmly rooted, the reliability of the statements could be inferred and the admission of the statements into evidence did not violate the Confrontation Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 239. See, also, <em>United States v. George </em>(C.A. 9, 1992), 960 F.2d 97, 99 (\u201cWhen hearsay testimony is properly admitted pursuant to [the medical treatment] exception, no further guarantees of trustworthiness are required.\u201d); <em>United States v. Balfany </em>(C.A.8, 1992), 965 F.2d 575 (Confrontation Clause does not preclude admission of child's out-of-court statements under firmly rooted hearsay exception for medical treatment).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>We hold that Evid.R. 102 does not prevent us from finding that the Evid.R. 803(4) hearsay exception is firmly rooted in the circumstances of this case. The admission into evidence of a hearsay statement pursuant to a firmly rooted hearsay exception does not violate a defendant\u2019s right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In conclusion, we find that the hearsay statements made by Kristen to Dr. Saluke were properly admitted into evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 803(4). Additionally, we find that Kristen\u2019s statement to Dr. Saluke identifying Dever as the perpetrator of the abuse was properly admitted into evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 803(4). We further find that Dever\u2019s right of confrontation was not violated by the admission of these statements.

Among the many issues discussed in <em>Boston </em>which either are not relevant to the instant case, or will not be revisited, are: (1) a child\u2019s competency to testify as a witness and Evid.R. 601(A); (2) unavailability of a child witness and Evid.R. 804(A)(2); (3) the admissibility of excited utterances under Evid.R. 803(2) in child abuse prosecutions; (4) the use of expert testimony in child abuse cases, Evid.R. 702, 703, 704, and 705; (5) whether a statement by a child to someone other than a medical doctor can be admissible under Evid.R. 803(4), the medical diagnosis or treatment exception; (6) the application of Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c), allowing prior statements by a witness into evidence as non-hearsay if the declarant also testifies at trial; and (7) whether it is proper for an expert witness to give an opinion of the veracity of the child\u2019s hearsay statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">The resolution of the last issue above was the basis for the reversal of the conviction.

Evid.R. 807 was subsequently adopted, effective July 1, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b559-7\">. Perhaps the time has come to reevaluate Ohio\u2019s Evid.R. 102 as it now exists. While federal courts and courts of most states allow evolutionary development of the law of evidence, Ohio courts are required to apply the common law to evidence rules which are almost certainly inconsistent in spirit, if not in literal wording, with many of the common-law foundations. An amendment of Evid.R. 102, to put it in step with Fed.R.Evid. 102, is an idea whose time has come. The drafters of Ohio\u2019s Evidence Rules feared dire consequences if Ohio adopted an Evid.R. 102 identical to the federal version. See Walinski &amp; Abramoff, The Proposed Ohio Rules of Evidence: The Case Against (1978), 28 Case W.Res.L.Rev. 344, 370 (arguing that Ohio\u2019s then-proposed Evid.R. 102, to be identical to Fed.R.Evid. 102, constituted a \u201cdisturbing feature\u201d of the evidence rules). Ohio Evid.R. 102 was altered in response to such criticism, but the perceived horrors associated with the federal counterpart have not materialized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\">. In a dissenting opinion filed in the court of appeals, the judge stated that the hearsay statements were properly admissible under Evid.R. 803(4): \u201c * * * [I]t is entirely reasonable to infer, as the trial court could have reasonably inferred under all the circumstances, that the child had the awareness and understanding necessary to grasp that the purpose of responding to the doctor\u2019s questions was to obtain diagnosis and treatment as a result of the molestation. We should not reverse the trial court's judgment without a more affirmative demonstration that an error of law, and not merely a finding of fact which happens to vary from the majority\u2019s view of the facts, was made below.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b563-9\">. We approve of Renville\u2019s analysis regarding the child\u2019s identification of the perpetrator in sexual abuse prosecutions involving young children. There are several reasons for finding that the identification of the perpetrator is relevant to diagnosis and treatment. As Dr. Saluke testified at trial in this case, questioning of the allegedly abused child is important in determining the extent of contact, if any, the possibility of continued exposure to the perpetrator, and the possibility of sexually transmitted diseases. The identity of the perpetrator is particularly relevant to those inquiries, as well as to the psychological effects on the child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b566-9\">. The issue of unavailability of the declarant was not before the Supreme Court. The court assumed that the declarant was an unavailable witness, primarily because the trial court had found that the child was incapable of communicating with the jury, and defense counsel at trial did not disagree with that finding. <em>Id., </em>497 U.S. at-, 110 S.Ct. at 3147, 111 L.Ed.2d at 652.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b566-11\">. The court noted that the questioning of the child was conducted in a suggestive manner, raising concerns about the reliability of the statement. <em>Wright, supra, </em>at-, 110 S.Ct. at 3152-3153, 111 L.Ed.2d at 659-660.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b567-13\">. The court specifically held that corroboration of the statement by other evidence was not a part of the trustworthiness inquiry. <em>Id. </em>at-, 110 S.Ct. at 3148-3149, 111 L.Ed.2d at 655. That holding means that one of the factors announced in <em>State v. Boston </em>for analyzing trustworthiness of a child\u2019s hearsay statement, corroboration, is no longer valid. <em>Id., </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 127, 545 N.E.2d at 1238. Because this case does not require us to consider whether \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d are present (we find that the child\u2019s statements were admissible as an Evid.R. 803[4] exception to the hearsay rule, a firmly rooted hearsay exception), we do not resolve that problem at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b569-9\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVt\">dissenting. I simply cannot join in the majority\u2019s decision to ignore this court\u2019s prior decisions and to rewrite Evid.R. 803(4). The hearsay exception for statements pertinent to medical treatment or diagnosis \u201c * * * is based upon the belief that the declarant\u2019s subjective motive generally guarantees the statement\u2019s trustworthiness. Since the effectiveness of the treatment depends upon the accuracy of information given to the physician, the declarant is motivated to tell the truth.\u201d <em>State v. Eastham </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 307, 312, 530 N.E.2d 409, 413 (H. Brown, J., concurring). If a child is not capable of comprehending the doctor\u2019s role and the danger of mistreatment, his or her statements cannot be presumed to be reliable, at least under this particular hearsay exception.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>United States v. Renville </em>(C.A.8, 1985), 779 F.2d 430, 439; <em>United States v. Iron Shell </em>(C.A.8, 1980), 633 F.2d 77, 83-84; <em>Cassidy v. Maryland </em>(1988), 74 Md.App. 1, 29-30, 536 A.2d 666, 680. Until today, this court has, and rightfully so, refused to follow other jurisdictions that have dispensed with the requirement that a child understand that his or her statements are for the purpose of medical treatment or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>diagnosis. See <em>State v. Boston </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 122, 545 N.E.2d 1220, 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">I fully sympathize with the pain and anguish suffered by abused children and their families, and understand the difficulties inherent to the prosecution of a terrible crime that may leave no physical evidence and whose victims are unable to competently speak for themselves. The temptation is great to liberally construe the hearsay exceptions to allow more effective prosecution of these crimes. We must remember, however, that our ruling on the scope of this hearsay exception will apply with equal force to cases in which the evidence is overwhelming and to cases in which a doctor\u2019s statements are the only evidence that supports a conviction. If one imagines an innocent man or woman accused of this heinous crime, today\u2019s ruling evokes grave concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The majority\u2019s decision not only allows the child to speak through the mouths of others in a situation where the child cannot be questioned, but also gives the child\u2019s words the extra authority of being spoken by a doctor. Moreover, the testimony does not possess the traditional guarantees of reliability that form the basis for this particular hearsay exception. Evid.R. 102 mandates that this court construe the Ohio Rules of Evidence in accordance with the common-law basis for those rules. It is not the province of this court to eviscerate those rules in order to make it easier for the state to prosecute certain categories of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Most importantly, this decision seriously undermines Evid.R. 807, which went into effect July 1, 1991. Evid.R. 807 was promulgated in recognition of the unique evidentiary problems raised in a child sexual-abuse case and sets forth a separate hearsay exception for the testimony of a sexually abused child. As the majority properly recognizes, Evid.R. 807 provides a hearsay exception that is in addition to the exceptions provided in Evid.R. 803 and 804. See Staff Note to Evid.R. 807. The majority\u2019s liberal interpretation of Evid.R. 803(4) will actually allow prosecutors to evade the carefully considered controls of Evid.R. 807. Under today\u2019s decision, it appears that the child\u2019s testimony to a doctor will be admissible under Evid.R. 803(4), unless the defense can show the child was unduly influenced or some other special reason why the testimony is unreliable. Under Evid.R. 807, the doctor\u2019s testimony is not admissible unless the trial court carefully determines that the child is not able to testify, examines the totality of circumstances surrounding the statement when it was made to determine whether the statement is reliable and finds that there is independent proof of the sexual act. I believe that Evid.R. 807 strikes the appropriate balance between the needs of the child, the rights of the defendant, and the state\u2019s interest in prosecuting this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>crime, and I am saddened to see the rule stripped of its effectiveness so prematurely.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">I agree with the court of appeals that this case should be remanded to the trial court. An advanced four year old might have the required level of understanding,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but because the trial judge ruled that this child\u2019s awareness of the need for medical treatment was irrelevant to the admissibility of her statements, the trial record was not developed on this factual question. Accordingly, I would affirm the well-reasoned judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b571-5\">Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b569-10\">. The majority conveniently characterizes the motivational requirement of Evid.R. 803(4) as a strict requirement that the child be motivated to go to the doctor for treatment. This cramped interpretation strengthens the majority\u2019s argument that this requirement is unnecessarily stringent. While the strict foundation discussed by the majority is unnecessary, I do not believe that it is unreasonable to require that a child understand the doctor\u2019s role and why it is important to tell the doctor the truth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b571-15\">.
