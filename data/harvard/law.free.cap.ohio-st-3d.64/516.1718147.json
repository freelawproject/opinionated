For the following reasons, we reject appellant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Appellant first argues that the court of appeals violated Civ.R. 54(B) by deciding fewer than all his claims without an express finding that there is no just cause for delay. However, the record indicates that the court decided all his claims. Therefore, appellant\u2019s first proposition of law is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">Next, appellant argues that he should have been granted a peremptory writ of mandamus since there was no answer filed. However, the court of appeals allowed appellee\u2019s motion to file his motion to dismiss instanter, and the defense of failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted may be presented by motion under Civ.R. 12(B). Therefore, appellant\u2019s second proposition of law is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">Next, appellant argues that the court erred by not giving proper notice when it converted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. However, the record indicates that the court made no such conversion. Therefore, appellant\u2019s third proposition of law is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">Finally, appellant argues that the court of appeals erred by not holding a separate hearing on his motion for attorney fees, as required by R.C. 2323.51. However, the court of appeals held, <em>inter alia, </em>and we affirm, that R.C. 2323.51 provides for attorney fees, not compensation for <em>pro se </em>litigants. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>separate hearing to make that determination would have been pointless. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s fourth proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b668-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
