Kirby Lumber Company, and it is appealed here by the said receivers, complaining of the finding of facts made by the special master. The report of the special master on law and facts seems to have been well considered, and, as it was approved and confirmed by the Circuit Court, we are not disposed to go behind it. The decree of the Circuit Court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
