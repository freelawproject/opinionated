This is an appeal from an interlocutory decree of the Circuit Court, Western District of New York, holding certain claims of letters patent 611,438, issued Sept. 27, 1898, to Philips, for a speed wagon, to be valid and infringed. The opinion of <em>the </em>Circuit Court is reported in 100 Fed. 966.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aass\">Osgood &amp; Davis, for appellant. L. H.

It is contended that the claims should be so narrow-by construed that defendant\u2019s structure will not infringe. The defendant\u2019s truss frame does not extend upward \u201cperpendicularly from the spindles,\u201d nor \u201cbetween two vertical planes from said spindles\u201d; the quoted phrases being taken from claims 1 and 2, respectively. But the deflection from the perpendicular is slight, and effects no new result; and we are of the opinion that a truss substantially perpendicular to the spindles is fairly within the claim, concurring with Judge Hazel in his conclusions as to- infringement. It Is contended, however, that the words \u201cperpendicular\u201d and \u201cvertical\u201d are to be strictly construed, for the reason that they were Inserted while the application was pending in the Patent Office, after rejection of original claims upon a reference to patent to Wells, No. 577,339, for a sulky. The theory is that the Patent Office required applicant to make an election, either to be rejected on : - reference or to avoid- the reference by confining himself strictly to an absolutely perpendicular truss. But wo are not satisfied that this theory is correct, or that it was the insertion of the words \u201cperpendicular\u201d and \u201cvertical\u201d that saved the claims. The proposed amended claims were inclosed in a letter to the examiner, which discussed the Wells sulky and pointed out that it did not have the inclined brace, which was referred to in applicant\u2019s specification as \u201cparticularly effective.\u201d Presumably this argument convinced the examiner \u2014 the Wells sulky was quite a different contrivance \u2014 and induced allowance of the claims. It is difficult to see how the mere restriction of them to perpendicular trusses would have avoided the reference, because In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>Wells sulky the \u201cmain or central bow, 4,\u201d on which alone the driver's seat is mounted, extends up perpendicularly from the spindles, so that \u201cits top portion [is] directly over the axles of the wheels.\u2019\u2019 Decree affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
