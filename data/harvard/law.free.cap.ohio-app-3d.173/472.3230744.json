(\u201cWFC\u201d) and Nelson D. Wenrick appeal from a judgment of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas, which granted summary judgment in favor of Janice E. Dice and Eugene Collins on their unjust-enrichment and constructive-trust claim and awarded prejudgment interest beginning on October 20, 1999. Dice and Collins cross-appeal, claiming that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of WFC and Wenrick on their conversion claim and in offsetting their damages by the amount they received from a third party\u2019s insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">{\u00b6 2} The facts underlying this matter are largely undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">{\u00b6 3} Krishan Chari and Michael Karaman were partners in a business entity known as Invesco, L.L.C. Wenrick apparently knew of Karaman\u2019s involvement with Invesco, but not of Chari\u2019s involvement. The ostensible purpose of Invesco was to engage in real-estate transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-14\">{\u00b6 4} On several occasions in 1999, WFC and Wenrick each made short-term bridge loans to Invesco. When lending money to Invesco, WFC and Wenrick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>either wrote checks or wired money to Dayton Title Agency, Inc. (\u201cDTA\u201d). National City Bank (\u201cNCB\u201d) was the depository of monies held by Dayton Title in an escrow account.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">{\u00b6 5} On September 3, 1999, WFC and Wenrick separately made bridge loans, totaling $4.8 million, to Invesco. Wenrick\u2019s loan in the amount of $1.6 million was to finance the purchase of a Staples location. Wenrick made the $1.6 million loan to Invesco by wiring funds to Dayton Title\u2019s Interest on Trust Account (\u201cIOTA\u201d) escrow account at National City. In return, he received a promissory note executed by Karaman personally and on behalf of Invesco. WFC\u2019s loan in the amount of $3.2 million concerned Invesco\u2019s purchase of real estate located at 9550 Montgomery Road in Warren County. WFC received a promissory note and a personal guaranty by Karaman in return.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">{\u00b6 6} The loans to Invesco became due on or before October 3, 1999. Soon after the loans were past due, WFC and Wenrick received checks from Chari drawn on a Texas Interest on Lawyers\u2019 Trust Account (\u201cIOLTA\u201d) of John Lewis. The Texas checks were returned for insufficient funds. Wenrick stated in his deposition that he talked with Karaman after the Texas check bounced. Kara-man told Wenrick that he would get Wenrick the money, that Wenrick did not have to worry, and that he would be repaid by Karaman personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">{\u00b6 7} On October 19, 1999, Chari delivered a forged $5 million check to Dayton Title. Dayton Title deposited the check and directed National City to issue two checks drawn on the escrow account on the provisional credit of the forged check. Those two checks, totaling $4,885 million, were issued to WFC and Wenrick to repay the September loans. On the same day, Karaman delivered a $1,625 million check to Wenrick, who deposited the check at his bank that night. Wenrick used the money to repay a $1.1 million loan from his line of credit at Security National Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">{\u00b6 8} On October 20,1999, Karaman met Timothy White, President of WFC, at the downtown branch of National City Bank. Karaman gave White a check for $3.26 million drawn on the Dayton Title escrow account. White presented that check to a teller at National City and requested a bank check for $3.26 million, which he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">{\u00b6 9} WFC\u2019s check from Dayton Title\u2019s account cleared on October 20, 1999. Wenrick\u2019s check cleared on October 25,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">{\u00b6 10} Shortly after National City had issued and honored the two Dayton Title checks, it learned that the check deposited by Dayton Title, i.e., Chari\u2019s check, had been forged. By that time, Dayton Title\u2019s escrow account had been drained of funds. The account had contained funds owed by Dayton Title to Collins, Dice, and others from their respective real-estate closings. At the time the account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>was closed, Dice had been issued a check drawn on the escrow account in the amount of $108,626.72 that remained unsatisfied, and Collins was owed $50,046.43 from the account. Dayton Title was forced to file bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">{\u00b6 11} Dice, Collins, and a number of other individuals or entities that had suffered similar losses were unable to recover on their claims in the bankruptcy proceeding. On July 16, 2003, Dice and another individual initiated the instant litigation against WFC and National City. In the most recent amended complaint, filed on January 20, 2006, Dice and Collins have brought suit against WFC and Wenrick, alleging conversion, tortious interference with business relations, fraudulent transfer, constructive trust, unjust enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">{\u00b6 12} On August 1, 2006, WFC and Wenrick filed a motion for summary judgment on all of Dice and Collins\u2019s claims. On the same day, Dice and Collins filed a motion for partial summary judgment on their claims for conversion and fraudulent transfer. On November 27, 2006, the trial court overruled the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment and overruled in part and sustained in part WFC and Wenrick\u2019s motion. The trial court granted summary judgment to WFC and Wenrick on the conversion, tortious-interferenee-withbusiness-relations, breach-of-fiduciary-duty, and fraudulent-transfer claims. The court further indicated that the collateral-source rule did not apply, and thus, WFC and Wenrick would be entitled to a setoff of any insurance payments that Dice and Collins had received under Dayton Title\u2019s errors-and-omissions insurance policy. The court denied summary judgment to WFC and Wenrick on the constructive-trust and unjust-enrichment claim. The court noted that Dice and Collins had not moved for summary judgment on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">{\u00b6 13} On December 11, 2006, Dice and Collins filed a motion for partial summary judgment on their unjust-enrichment claim. The trial court granted the motion on February 2, 2007. The court awarded damages to Dice in the amount of $54,315.94 and to Collins in the amount of $25,024.93, representing prejudgment interest from October 20,1999, to May 8, 2006. The principal losses incurred by Dice and Collins had been repaid from Dayton Title\u2019s insurance escrow account as part of Dayton Title\u2019s bankruptcy case.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">{\u00b6 14} WFC and Wenrick appeal, claiming that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Dice and Collins on the unjust-enrichment and constructive-trust claim and in awarding prejudgment interest from October 20, 1999. Dice and Collins cross-appeal, claiming that the trial court erred in denying them summary judgment on their conversion claim and on the issue of a setoff of damages. Dice and Collins have not appealed the trial court\u2019s ruling on their fraudulent-preference, tortious-interference-with-business-relations, and breach-of-fiduciary-duty claims. We will begin with a discussion of Dice\u2019s and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Collins\u2019s conversion and unjust-enrichment and constructive-trust claims, and then turn to the issues of prejudgment interest and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">{\u00b6 15} Our review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment is de novo. See <em>Helton v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1997), 123 Ohio App.3d 158, 162, 703 N.E.2d 841. Civ.R. 56(C) provides that summary judgment may be granted when the moving party demonstrates that (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made. See <em>State ex rel. Grady v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 181, 183, 677 N.E.2d 343; <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 65-66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">A. <em>Conversion claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">{\u00b6 16} In their cross-appeal, Dice and Collins claim that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to WFC and Wenrick on their claim for conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">{\u00b6 17} Conversion is an exercise of dominion or control wrongfully exerted over property in denial of or under a claim inconsistent with the rights of another. <em>Joyce v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 93, 96, 551 N.E.2d 172; <em>Union Sav. Bank v. White Family Cos., Inc., </em>167 Ohio App.3d 51, 2006-Ohio-2629, 853 N.E.2d 1182, \u00b6 26. Typically, \u201c[t]he elements of a conversion cause of action are (1) plaintiffs ownership or right to possession of the property at the time of the conversion; (2) defendant\u2019s conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of plaintiffs property rights; and (3) damages.\u201d <em>Haul Transport of VA, Inc. v. Morgan </em>(June 2, 1995), Montgomery App. No. 14859, 1995 WL 328995; see <em>Knoop v. Knoop, </em>Montgomery App. No. 22037, 2007-Ohio-5178, 2007 WL 2821508, \u00b6 20. Where conversion is premised on the unlawful retention of property, the plaintiff must establish that \u201c(1) he or she demanded the return of the property from the possessor after the possessor exerted dominion or control over the property, and (2) that the possessor refused to deliver the property to its rightful owner.\u201d <em>Barnes v. First Am. Title Ins. Co. </em>(Aug. 8, 2006), N.D.Ohio No. L:06CV574, 2006 WL 2265553, citing <em>Tabar v. Charlie\u2019s Towing Serv., Inc. </em>(1994), 97 Ohio App.3d 423, 427-28, 646 N.E.2d 1132. Where an action for conversion is based on the conversion of cash, the action will \u201conly lie if \u2018identification is possible and there is an obligation to deliver the specific money in question.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haul, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">{\u00b6 18} In granting summary judgment to WFC and Wenrick on the conversion claim, the trial court did not determine whether Dice and Collins\u2019s funds were sufficiently identified. Instead, it stated that, even assuming that the funds were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>\u201cearmarked,\u201d \u201cthere is no evidence that a relationship existed between Defendants and Plaintiffs which obligated Defendants to deliver the specific money in question.\u201d The court noted that WFC and Wenrick had received the money from the Dayton Title account as repayment of a debt and \u201c[ujnless and until ordered by a court, Defendants were under no legal obligation to repay the Plaintiffs.\u201d The court further found no evidence that WFC and Wenrick\u2019s acceptance of the checks was wrongful. Relying upon <em>Hinkle v. Cornwell Quality Tool Co. </em>(1987), 40 Ohio App.3d 162, 532 N.E.2d 772, the trial court indicated that WFC and Wenrick could not be liable for conversion because they had received the checks as repayment of an antecedent debt and without knowledge that they were drawn from funds held in trust for Collins and Dice.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">{\u00b6 19} Dice and Collins argue that the trial court erred in requiring them to prove that the money was earmarked. They claim that they were simply required to prove that the funds were placed in Dayton Title\u2019s escrow account, that the funds were transferred to WFC and Wenrick, and that WFC and Wenrick acquired knowledge that the funds had been held in trust; Dice and Collins claim that the evidence supports each of these elements. Dice and Collins rely, in part, on <em>United States v. NBD Bank, </em>N.A. (E.D.Mich.1996), 922 F.Supp. 1235, to support their assertion that funds transferred to a third party in payment of an antecedent debt can be recovered by the trust beneficiary under a conversion theory when the transferee has knowledge that the debt is paid from a trust account. WFC and Wenrick respond that the trial court properly granted summary judgment on the conversion claim because the money at issue was not earmarked.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>NBD Bank, </em>Fidelity Guarantee Mortgage Corporation had issued mortgages under the federal government\u2019s mortgage-backed securities program. Fidelity had legal title to the mortgages and serviced them, but equitable title was held by the Government National Mortgage Association (\u201cGNMA\u201d), which guaranteed the mortgages. As part of the program, separate escrow accounts existed for principle and interest (\u201cP &amp; I\u201d) payments and for tax and insurance (\u201cT &amp; I\u201d) payments. Fidelity had escrow accounts, as well as its corporate accounts, at NBD Bank. NBD made significant loans to Fidelity. In 1992, Fidelity\u2019s president withdrew by check $225,000 from the T <em>&amp; </em>I escrow account and deposited the money in Fidelity\u2019s corporate accounts. Fidelity then made payments to NBD on its indebtedness. Fidelity subsequently filed for bankruptcy, and GNMA sued NBD to recover the T &amp; I funds, asserting constructive trust, conversion, and breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">{\u00b6 21} The federal district court granted summary judgment to GNMA on its constructive-trust, conversion, and breach-of-contract claims with respect to approximately $64,000 of the misdirected trust funds. With regard to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>constructive-trust claim, the court found that GNMA adequately traced approximately $64,000 of the funds to NBD. Because trust and personal funds were commingled, the court employed the intermediate balance rule. It further found that GNMA had a greater equitable rights to the funds. The court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cNBD knew that the T &amp; I account held money in trust. Further, NBD knew that money had been transferred from the T &amp; I account to Fidelity\u2019s operating account. * * * NBD is liable because it <em>accepted </em>funds from the operating account after T &amp; I funds had been placed in that account. This court holds that when NBD accepted funds from the operating account in satisfaction of Fidelity\u2019s debt to NBD, NBD took the risk that those funds were actually misdirected trust funds from the T &amp; I account. NBD cannot now assert an equitable right to those funds paramount to that of the beneficiary of the constructive trust created by the misdirection of the funds. In short, NBD must return the trust money traced to it.\u201d <em>NBD Bank, </em>922 F.Supp. at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">{\u00b6 23} The court also granted summary judgment in the amount of $64,033.52 on the conversion claim. The court noted that the T &amp; I funds could be converted and that GNMA had the greater equitable title to the money. The trial court rejected the bank\u2019s contention that the Michigan version of the UCC applied to the circumstances before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">{\u00b6 24} <em>NBD Bank </em>is distinguishable from the case before us. <em>NBD Bank </em>involved the fiduciary\u2019s removal of escrow funds from an escrow account and the placement of those funds in an operating account, from which the funds were used to pay the fiduciary\u2019s personal debt. Here, there was no commingling of personal and escrow funds, nor did Dayton Title take Dice\u2019s and Collins\u2019s funds for its own use. Although <em>NBD Bank </em>supports the contention that conversion and unjust-enrichment claims may exist under certain circumstances, it is not relevant to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">{\u00b6 25} The trial court relied upon <em>Hinkle, </em>which concluded that Cornwell Quality Tool Company could not recover embezzled funds under a conversion theory. Therein, Cornwell\u2019s employee embezzled funds from Cornwell to pay back a former employer, Akron Novelty, for funds that she had previously embezzled from Akron. On appeal, the Ninth District concluded that Akron Novelty should have been granted judgment on the conversion claim, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cReasonable minds could not differ as to the bona fide nature of Akron Novelty\u2019s conduct in accepting the checks. [Akron Novelty] received the two instruments without any notice that the funds were embezzled. The funds were received as payment for an antecedent debt. There is absolutely no evidence in the record before, during, or after the trial which would negate Akron Novelty\u2019s bona fide status.\u201d The <em>Hinkle </em>court concluded that Akron was a holder in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>{\u00b6 27} Although the trial court did not indicate that it was relying on the Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d), it followed the UCC doctrine of a holder in due course when it followed <em>Hinkle. </em>Under UCC 3-302, a holder becomes a holder in due course if the holder takes the instrument (1) for value, (2) in good faith, (3) and without notice of any claims or defenses otherwise available to the person obligated on the instrument or of various defects in the instrument. R.C. 1303.32(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\"> {\u00b6 28} The UCC\u2019s allocations of loss are, at times, inconsistent with the common law of conversion. To state a claim for conversion, the plaintiff need not demonstrate that the defendant acted in bad faith. \u201c[NJeither motive nor mistake is a defense to a claim of conversion.\u201d <em>Busch v. Premier Integrated Med. Assoc., Ltd., </em>Montgomery App. No. 19364, 2003-Ohio-4709, 2003 WL 22060392, \u00b6 98; see, also, <em>DeLorean Cadillac, Inc. v. Weaver </em>(Oct. 2, 1997), Cuyahoga App. No. 71827, 1997 WL 607533 (\u201cIt is not necessary to demonstrate intent or wrongful purpose by the defendant. * * * Mistake or good faith is not a defense to conversion\u201d). In contrast, under UCC 3-305, a holder in due course takes checks free from all claims to them and all defenses of any party to the instruments with whom the holder has not dealt, with some exceptions. See R.C. 1303.35. Thus, while good faith would not be a defense to a conversion claim, a defendant who qualifies as a holder in due course could be exempt from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">{\u00b629} In <em>Olympic Title Ins. Co. v. Fifth Third Bank of W. Ohio, </em>Montgomery App. No. 20145, 2004-Ohio-4795, 2004 WL 2009285, we held that the plaintiffs conversion claim was precluded because the matter was governed by the UCC. Although we noted that the UCC did not completely supplant the common law, we stated that parties may not \u201crely on a common law action to avoid the clear mandates of the UCC.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 31, quoting <em>Amzee Corp. v. Comerica Bank-Midwest, </em>Franklin App. No. 01AP-465, 2002-Ohio-3084, 2002 WL 1012998, \u00b6 10. We concluded that \u201cthe UCC provides the exclusive remedy where the dispute is governed by its statutory provisions. Common law causes of action may not be raised to circumvent the UCC\u2019s rights, claims, and defenses where the statute applies.\u201d <em>Olympic Title </em>at \u00b6 31; see, also <em>Natl. City Bank v. Citizens Natl. Bank of Southwest Ohio, </em>Montgomery App. No. 20323, 2004-Ohio-6060, 2004 WL 2588182, \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">{\u00b6 30} Upon review of the record in this case, we conclude that WFC and Wenrick were holders in due course. The checks that WFC and Wenrick received were valid on their face. There are no allegations that the instruments were forged or altered. Although Dice and Collins suggest that WFC and Wenrick were suspicious about whether their October 1999 repayment checks would be honored, there is no evidence that WFC and Wenrick engaged in wrongful conduct. They were merely receiving repayment for their loans, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>was overdue and which they were legally entitled to receive. Chari engaged in misconduct, not WFC and Wenrick. Although Wenrick and White both immediately deposited their checks after receiving the Dayton Title checks from Karaman, we do not believe that merely depositing a check upon receipt is evidence of a lack of good faith. Even accepting Dice\u2019s and Collins\u2019s contention that WFC and Wenrick should have known that Dayton Title\u2019s account contained money belonging to other third-parties, there is no evidence that WFC and Wenrick knew when they received the checks that Invesco had not properly deposited funds to support the repayment checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">{\u00b6 31} At oral argument, Dice and Collins asserted that the recipient of a check from an escrow account can never be a holder in due course. They cited R.C. 1303.37(B)(4), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cIf an instrument is issued by the represented person [beneficiary] or by the fiduciary of the represented person to the taker as payee, the taker has notice of the breach of fiduciary duty if any of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(a) The instrument is taken in payment of or as security for a debt known by the taker to be the personal debt of the fiduciary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c(b) The instrument is taken in a transaction known by the taker to be for the personal benefit of the fiduciary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(c) The instrument is deposited to an account other than an account of the fiduciary as fiduciary for the represented person or an account of the represented person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">{\u00b6 36} None of the circumstances described in R.C. 1303.37(B)(4) exist in this case. Dayton Title did not issue the checks to WFC and Wenrick to pay a debt of Dayton Title or for Dayton Title\u2019s benefit. Rather, the checks were issued to pay Invesco\u2019s debts to WFC and Wenrick related to the September 3 loans. Moreover, WFC and Wenrick clearly accepted the checks as \u201crepresented persons.\u201d The evidence demonstrates that WFC had repeatedly conducted its real-estate loans to Invesco through Dayton Title and had received repayment from the Dayton Title account. Wenrick had also wired loan money into the Dayton Title account and had received repayment from Invesco through Dayton Title. Accordingly, WFC and Wenrick\u2019s receipt of funds from Dayton Title did not create notice of a breach of fiduciary duty under R.C. 1303.37 or indicate a lack of good faith under R.C. 1303.32.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">{\u00b6 37} We find no authority to support Dice\u2019s and Collins\u2019s assertion that the payee of an instrument drawn on a fiduciary account can never be a holder in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>{\u00b6 38} Accordingly, we find no genuine issue of material fact as to whether WFC and Wenrick were holders in due course. Thus, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to WFC and Wenrick on their conversion claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">B. <em>Unjust Enrichment and Constructive Trust</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">{\u00b6 39} Wenrick and WFC assert that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Dice and Collins on their unjust-enrichment and constructive-trust claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">{\u00b6 40} In its February 2007 judgment, the trial court adopted its reasoning in . its November 27, 2006 order as the basis for granting summary judgment to Collins and Dice on their constructive-trust and unjust-enrichment claim. The court stated on November 27, 2006:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cA constructive trust is an equitable remedy that protects against unjust enrichment. <em>Estate of Cowling v. Estate of Cowling, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 276, 281, 2006-Ohio-2418, 847 N.E.2d 405. A constructive trust may be imposed when it is against the principles of equity that the property be retained by a certain person even though the property was acquired without fraud. Id.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cPlaintiffs argue that it is inequitable for Defendants, who knowingly took a business risk in dealing with Chari and Karaman, to not suffer a loss, while Plaintiffs, who did not take such a risk, suffer a loss. Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are well taken in that the Court believes the following principle of equity applies: where one of two innocent persons must suffer by the fraud of a third person, he who trusted the third person and was instrumental in producing the condition that caused the loss must suffer the loss. <em>Miller v. Albright </em>(1899), 60 Ohio St. 48, 53 N.E. 490; <em>Hillside Dairy Co. v. Cleveland Trust Co. </em>(1944), 142 Ohio St. 507, 27 O.O. 435, 53 N.E.2d 499; <em>Edgar v.

However, when Chari repaid Defendants through a forged check drawn on a non-existent account, it was Plaintiffs, the beneficiaries of funds held in DTA\u2019s escrow account, who suffered the loss. Despite the fact the Defendants are not liable for the other legal claims of the Plaintiffs, Defendants, who trust Chari and Karaman and loaned them money, should suffer the loss to the extent to which the Plaintiffs have not been fully reimbursed.

The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cA constructive trust is a \u2018 \u201ctrust by operation of law which arises contrary to intention and in invitum, against one who, by fraud, actual or constructive, by duress or abuse of confidence, by commission of wrong, or by any form of unconscionable conduct, artifice, concealment, or questionable means, or who in any way against equity and good conscience, either has obtained or holds the legal right to property which he ought not, in equity and good conscience, hold and enjoy. It is raised by equity to satisfy the demands of justice.\u201d \u2019 (Footnotes omitted.) <em>Ferguson v. Owens </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 223, 225, 9 OBR 565, 459 N.E.2d 1293, quoting 76 American Jurisprudence 2d (1975) 446, Trusts, Section 221. A constructive trust is considered a trust because \u2018 \u201c[w]hen property has been acquired in such circumstances that the holder of the legal title may not in good conscience retain the beneficial interest, equity converts him into a trustee.\u201d \u2019 Id. at 225, 9 OBR 565, 459 N.E.2d 1293, quoting <em>Beatty v.

Lynch, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 118, 2002-Ohio-3748, 772 N.E.2d 105, paragraph three of the syllabus.] <em>Lynch </em>specifically referred to the claimant\u2019s burden of proof and the evidentiary standard for proving the unjust-enrichment aspect of a constructive trust. * * * We conclude that the same evidentiary burden should apply to tracing and that the burden of proof is on the claimant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cA claimant seeking the imposition of a constructive trust must specify the particular property over which the constructive trust is to be placed. If the form or possessor of the property over which the constructive trust should be placed changes during a lawsuit, the claimant should be given an opportunity to conduct discovery, if necessary, and present evidence of the new location or form of the property over which the trust should be placed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cA constructive trust is an equitable remedy that must be imposed on particular assets, not on a value. For example, if a party is inequitably deprived of 100 shares of stock that are valued at $10,000, a constructive trust should be imposed over 100 shares of stock, not $10,000. The value of the stock may decrease to $9,000 through no fault of the present possessor. In that instance, it would be inequitable to impose a constructive trust for a higher dollar amount than the stock\u2019s new value. Similarly, should the stock rise, the beneficiary of a constructive trust should not be deprived of that increase in value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cConstructive trusts should be placed over the property of the party who wrongfully obtained the property. When, as in this case, the property was subsequently transferred to third parties, a constructive trust can be imposed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">{\u00b6 55} Upon review of the record, we agree with WFC and Wenrick that there is no evidence that they were \u201cinstrumental in producing the condition which caused the loss.\u201d Although WFC and Wenrick were involved in high-interest and high-risk bridge loans with Invesco, no harm would have befallen Dice and Collins had Chari\u2019s $5 million check been genuine. As stated above, although Dice and Collins suggest that WFC and Wenrick were suspicious about whether their October 1999 repayment checks would be honored, there is no evidence that WFC and Wenrick acted wrongfully when they received payment for the antecedent debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>{\u00b6 56} Nevertheless, the absence of wrongdoing is not fatal to Dice\u2019s and Collins\u2019s unjust-enrichment and constructive-trust claim. While constructive trusts are often imposed when the property is obtained by fraud, the Supreme Court has clearly recognized that fraud or wrongdoing is not required. Rather, as stated above, the possessor of the property need only \u201cobtain} ] or hold[ ] the legal right to property which he ought not, in equity and good conscience, hold and enjoy.\u201d <em>Cowling </em>at \u00b6 18. Although there was no evidence of wrongdoing by WFC and Wenrick, we agree with the trial court that the evidence established that WFC and Wenrick obtained monies that clearly were not meant for them. WFC and Wenrick were to be repaid from the $5 million that Chari deposited with Dayton Title; that money never materialized. Having trusted Chari and Karaman, WFC and Wenrick should suffer the loss to the extent that Dice and Collins were not reimbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">{\u00b6 57} WFC and Wenrick assert that Dice and Collins cannot directly trace their funds to them. They state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cMultiple millions of dollars flowed through DTA\u2019s IOTA Account each month, and \u2018when the dust settled\u2019 there were funds in DTA\u2019s IOTA Account that exceed the principal amounts that Appellees claim they were owed. Appellees completely failed [to] offer any evidence to show that it was in fact Appellants who received their funds as opposed to any other distributee of DTA\u2019s IOTA Account, including NCB who took the entire balance in the IOTA Account following the closure of the account. Appellees failed to offer an accounting for DTA\u2019s IOTA Account to establish that Appellants actually received their funds. There was no determination that Appellants received Appellee\u2019s funds, if Appellees\u2019 funds remained in DTA\u2019s IOTA Account when NCB swept the account after \u2018the dust settled\u2019, or if their funds were included in the millions of dollar paid from DTA\u2019s IOTA account in [the] time period between when Appellants received payment and \u2018when the dust settled.\u2019 Appellees have failed to meet their burden to prove their conversion claim by \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019 and as a result, the Court should not overturn the Trial Court\u2019s granting Appellants summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">{\u00b6 59} We acknowledge that the evidence presented by Dice and Collins does not lend itself to the transaction-by-transaction tracing that is typically necessary to establish the flow of money. Dice and Collins have merely presented evidence that their money was deposited into the Dayton Title escrow account, that they were unable to obtain their money in November 1999, and that the Dayton Title account had been depleted and left with a deficit of more than $4 million as a result of Chari\u2019s dishonored checks. WFC and Wenrick, on the other hand, have presented the October 1999 and November 1999 bank statements for the National City Bank account, as well as the November 1999 bank statement for Dayton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Title\u2019s National City Bank account. The bank statements reflect numerous debits and credits, none of which can be readily attributed to a particular entity or individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 60} Despite the lack of fiscal accounting that WFC and Wenrick assert is necessary, we find no genuine issue of material fact that WFC and Wenrick received money that rightfully belonged to Dice and Collins. Dice\u2019s and Collins\u2019s undisputed evidence establishes that the proceeds from their real-estate transactions were placed in Dayton Title\u2019s escrow account. Consequently, Dayton Title held these funds in trust for Dice and Collins, and these individuals had an ownership interest in those funds. The parties agree that Chari\u2019s deposit of $5 million into the escrow account was dishonored, and thus, the anticipated source of WFC\u2019s and Wenrick\u2019s repayment checks did not materialize. Consequently, the source of the repayment checks clearly was not Chari but, rather, was, in part, the other individuals and entities who had deposited funds with Dayton Title. Considering that Dice and Collins had not withdrawn their funds from the Dayton Title account at the time \u201cthe dust settled\u201d and all account activity ceased, there is little doubt that their money was ultimately used to satisfy the Dayton Title\u2019s checks to WFC and Wenrick after Chari\u2019s checks were dishonored. See <em>Union Savings, </em>supra. Accordingly, we find no fault with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Dice and Collins satisfied the requirements of an unjust-enrichment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">{\u00b6 61} The critical question, therefore, is whether Dice and Collins may pursue an unjust-enrichment claim in light of the UCC. In our judgment, they may not. As stated, the UCC provides that a holder in due course takes a check free from most claims and defenses. To permit a claim for unjust enrichment when the UCC precludes liability is contrary to the \u201cdelicately balanced statutory scheme\u201d of the UCC. <em>Olympic Title, </em>supra. Accordingly, we must conclude that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Dice and Collins on their unjust-enrichment and constructive-trust claim and in failing to grant summary judgment to WFC and Wenrick on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">C. <em>Prejudgment Interest and Setoff</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">{\u00b6 62} In light of our disposition of the assignments of error concerning Dice\u2019s and Collins\u2019s common law claims, the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment interest to Dice and Collins. The issue of the setoff is rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">{\u00b6 63} The trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Dice and Collins on their unjust-enrichment and constructive-trust claim is reversed. The trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to WFC and Wenrick on Dice\u2019s and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Collins\u2019s conversion claim is affirmed. The trial court\u2019s award of prejudgment interest is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b517-5\">Brogan and Fain, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
