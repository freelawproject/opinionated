In that relationship, Ihenacho participates in Coverall\u2019s \u201cFranchise Owner Job Related Accident Policy\u201d (\u201cFOJ policy\u201d), which provides a form of coverage for work-related injuries. Ihenacho paid monthly premiums for that coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">{\u00b6 3} Ihenacho was injured in an automobile accident on Saturday, November 1, 2003. Contending that he was then traveling to perform janitorial services for a customer, Ihenacho sought coverage under the FOJ policy for his medical expenses and other losses. Coverall denied coverage after concluding that Ihenacho had not, in fact, been traveling to perform work when he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">{\u00b6 4} Ihenacho commenced the action underlying this appeal in the court of common pleas against Coverall, seeking coverage under the FOJ policy. Exhibits pertaining to the accident and his purchase of coverage were attached to Ihenacho\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">{\u00b6 5} Coverall filed a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss the action Ihenacho filed. Coverall\u2019s memorandum contends that per their franchise agreement, Ihenacho was obligated to obtain workers\u2019 compensation and automobile liability insurance coverage, including coverage for personal injuries and property loss, and did not. Coverall further argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-11\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cAdditionally, Coverall\u2019s records indicate that the only account Plaintiff would have serviced on a Saturday was the Wright Patterson Credit Union. However, the route from Plaintiffs home to the Wright Patterson Credit Union differs substantially from the location of the accident. A map of the area in question with a comparison of the route versus the location of the accident is attached hereto as Exhibit 3. It is obvious that the accident did not occur during the course of Plaintiffs Coverall business. Consequently, there are no policies of insurance in force that would cover him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">{\u00b6 7} Coverall\u2019s motion and memorandum were supplemented by exhibits. They include purported copies of its franchise agreement with Ihenacho, the FOJ policy covering him, and a map indicating where the accident occurred and Ihenacho\u2019s likely route of travel to the place of business of the customer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>concerned, which do not converge. None of the exhibits are supported by an affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">{\u00b6 8} Ihenacho filed a memorandum contra Coverall\u2019s motion. He attached additional exhibits to his memorandum. None are supported by an affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">{\u00b6 9} Coverall filed a response to Ihenacho\u2019s memorandum contra, supported by more exhibits. Again, none are supported by an affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">{\u00b6 10} On June 27, 2006, the trial court granted Coverall\u2019s motion. The court cited and relied on the provision of Civ.R. 12(B)(6) providing that \u201c[w]hen a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted presents matters outside the pleading and such matters are not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as a motion for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Civ.R. 56.\u201d On that basis, the court converted Coverall\u2019s motion to one for summary judgment and granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">{\u00b6 11} In its analysis, the court found that there was no genuine issue of material fact that Ihenacho was involved in an automobile accident and that he has a right to coverage under the FOJ policy. However, the court further found that because Ihenacho failed to obtain automobile liability insurance covering his losses in an automobile accident and because the \u201cevidence presented by [Ihenacho] indicates that he serviced the [customer to whose facility he was traveling] on Fridays rather than Saturdays,\u201d the day of the accident, Ihenacho is not entitled to coverage for his injuries and losses under the FOJ policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">{\u00b6 12} Ihenacho filed a timely notice of appeal and appears pro se. His brief on appeal does not identify a particular assignment of error, as App.R. 16(A)(3) requires. Instead, Ihenacho merely repeats the contentions of his claim that he is entitled to coverage for his injuries and losses under the FOJ policy, a claim the trial court found lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">{\u00b6 13} We necessarily take Ihenacho\u2019s argument to contend that the trial court erred when it granted Coverall\u2019s motion. Because the court granted the motion pursuant to Civ.R. 56, we conduct a de novo review of the relief that Coverall requested in its motion. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 671 N.E.2d 241. \u201cDe novo review means that this court uses the same standard the trial court should have used, and we examine the evidence to determine whether as a matter of law no genuine issues exist for trial.\u201d <em>Brewer v. Cleveland City Schools Bd. of Edn. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 378, 383, 701 N.E.2d 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">{\u00b6 14} Coverall\u2019s motion was filed pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6). A motion filed pursuant to that rule tests the legal sufficiency of the claims for relief in the pleadings. <em>Powell v. Vorys, Sater, Seymour &amp; Pease </em>(1998), 131 Ohio App.3d 681, 723 N.E.2d 596. In resolving a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion, the court is confined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>to the statements set forth in the pleading under attack. <em>Jackson v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 579, 649 N.E.2d 30. In this instance, that is the form of complaint that Ihenacho filed. Civ. R. 8(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">(\u00b6 15} Civ.R. 12(B)(6) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cWhen a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted presents matters outside the pleading and such matters are not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as a motion for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56. Provided, however, that the court shall consider only such matters outside the pleadings as are specifically enumerated in Rule 56. All parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all materials made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">{\u00b6 17} The \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d provision of Civ.R. 12(B)(6) requires the court to notify the parties when the court converts the motion to a Civ.R. 56(C) motion for summary judgment prior to ruling on the motion. Failure to give the required notice is reversible error. <em>State ex rel. Boggs v. Springfield Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 94, 647 N.E.2d 788; <em>State ex rel. Baran v. Fuerst </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 94, 563 N.E.2d 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">(\u00b6 18} The trial court erred when, on June 27, 2006, finding that Coverall\u2019s motion presented matters outside the pleadings, the court converted Coverall\u2019s Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss to a Civ.R. 56(C) motion for summary judgment and, without notice to the parties of the conversion, granted Coverall\u2019s motion pursuant to Civ.R. 56. The effect of the court\u2019s error implicates the following provision of Civ.R. 56(C):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cSummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. No evidence or stipulation may be considered except as stated in this rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">{\u00b6 20} The only evidentiary materials before the court were the exhibits attached to Ihenacho\u2019s complaint, Coverall\u2019s motion, and Ihenacho\u2019s memorandum contra. None were supported or opposed by affidavits made on personal knowledge, as Civ. R. 56(E) requires. Therefore, per Civ.R. 56(C), the court could not consider the evidence before it. <em>State ex rel. Boggs, </em>72 Ohio St.3d 94, 647 N.E.2d 788. Not having evidence required by Civ.R. 56(C) on which it could act, the trial court erred when it granted Coverall\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>{\u00b6 21} The assignment of error is sustained. The judgment from which the appeal was taken is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings on Ihenacho\u2019s claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b47-6\">Fain and Donovan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
