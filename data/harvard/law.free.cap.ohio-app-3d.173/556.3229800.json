In two related assignments of error, Williams contends that his convictions should be set aside because he was denied the assistance of counsel and he did not knowingly or voluntarily waive the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-18\">{\u00b6 2} Williams was charged on April 16, 2006, and he was brought to trial on June 8, 2006. On the day of trial, the following occurred in open court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-19\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cMORNING SESSION, THURSDAY, JUNE 8, 2006</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>{\u00b6 4} \u201cTHE COURT: This is 06CRB710. Anthony Williams is present in court. Also present is Ron Lewis, and it\u2019s my understanding that we are having a jury trial today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cMR. LEWIS: That is my understanding as well, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cTHE COURT: The first thing we need to do is give Mr. Williams a Kleenex so he can get rid of the gum in his mouth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: There is no gum, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. What are you chewing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I was trying to keep from having to spit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Mr. Williams, you don\u2019t have an attorney with you. Why is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-11\">{\u00b6 11} <em>\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Well, at this time, I really can\u2019t afford one, and I don\u2019t qualify for a public defender or whatnot.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. And you did file a jury demand. You want this before a jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-13\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma\u2019am. I think that would be the best.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-14\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cTHE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-15\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cMR. LEWIS: For the record, Your Honor, we did make an offer to Mr. Williams this morning to plead to one count of assault, dismiss the balance. For the record, we would further recommend that the State would stand silent on sentencing. It is my understanding that Mr. Williams has turned down that offer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-16\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cTHE COURT: Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-17\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma\u2019am. I would be willing to plead guilty to disorderly conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-18\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Well, apparently, that has not been offered, so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-19\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cMR. LEWIS: Additionally, Your Honor, we would respectfully ask the Court to dismiss the drug paraphernalia charge. It has not come back from the lab yet. If it comes back positive for cocaine, we\u2019ll be pursuing that as a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-20\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. That is dismissed at no cost to the Defendant without prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-21\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cActually, before I do that, is there anything you want to say about that proposal, Mr. Williams?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-22\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Excuse me, ma\u2019am?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>{\u00b6 23} \u201cTHE COURT: Is there anything you want to say about that request to dismiss?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: No, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. That is going to be dismissed without prejudice at no cost to the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cMR. LEWIS: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cTHE COURT: All right. So we are going to try this case, then, to a jury. If Mr. Williams wants to do that, he needs <em>to </em>\u2014 we <em>are going to have you write on this that you waive your right to counsel because you can\u2019t afford one or however you want to word it, but I need that signed at the bottom. Just </em>\u2014 you <em>can just add a notation on your jury demand here.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cTHE BAILIFF: Will this suffice, Your Honor? (Indicating.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cTHE COURT: Yeah, that is good. I didn\u2019t know we had that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-10\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Both of these case numbers, then, or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-11\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cTHE BAILIFF: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-12\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I\u2019m going to need some tissue probably.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-13\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cTHE COURT: There\u2019s a box on my desk back there. Okay. I guess we should bring in the jury, then.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">{\u00b6 34} In <em>State v. Tymcio </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 39, 71 O.O.2d 22, 325 N.E.2d 556, the Ohio Supreme Court held that it is the duty of the trial court in a criminal case to inquire fully into the circumstances impinging upon an accused\u2019s claimed inability to obtain counsel and his consequent need for assistance in employing counsel, or for the assistance of court-appointed counsel. In <em>Tymcio, </em>the defendant had been determined a month before trial not to be indigent. Id. at 40, 71 O.O.2d 22, 325 N.E.2d 556. On the day of trial, Tymcio appeared in court without counsel and asked the court to appoint counsel for him because he had no funds and could not borrow money to employ counsel. Id. The trial court denied Tymcio\u2019s request, noting that another judge had previously in this case found him not to be indigent. Id. The trial proceeded, Tymcio was convicted, and his conviction was affirmed on appeal. In reversing Tymcio\u2019s conviction, Judge Paul Brown wrote on behalf of the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-15\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cTo make the right to the assistance of court-appointed counsel a factual reality, the determination of need must turn, not upon whether an accused ought to be able to employ counsel, but whether he is in fact able to do so. Absent a knowledgeable and intelligent waiver, a defendant may not be imprisoned unless he was represented by counsel at his trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>{\u00b6 36} \u201cWe hold that a preliminary determination of indigency can not be permitted to foreclose a redetermination of eligibility for assigned counsel, when, at a subsequent stage of a criminal proceeding, new information concerning the ability or inability of the accused to obtain counsel becomes available. It is then the duty of the trial court to inquire fully into the circumstances impinging upon the defendant\u2019s claimed inability to obtain counsel, and his consequent need either for assistance in employing counsel, or for the assistance of assigned counsel. When an accused is financially able, in whole or in part, to obtain the assistance of counsel, but is unable to do so for whatever reason, appointed counsel must be provided. In such case, appropriate arrangements may subsequently be made to recompense appointed counsel for legal services rendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cThe trial court\u2019s failure to ensure that defendant was adequately represented by counsel violated the mandate of <em>Argersinger </em>[v. <em>Hamlin </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 25, 37, 92 S.Ct. 2006, 32 L.Ed.2d 530], and invalidates the judgment below. Therefore, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Court of Common Pleas for further proceedings.\u201d <em>Tymcio, </em>42 Ohio St.2d at 45, 71 O.O.2d 22, 325 N.E.2d 556.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">{\u00b6 38} In this matter, the trial court failed to inquire fully into the circumstances impinging upon Williams\u2019s claimed inability to obtain counsel and his consequent need for assistance in employing counsel or for the assistance of court-appointed counsel. The court merely informed Williams: \u201c[W]e are going to have you write on this that you waive your right to counsel because you can\u2019t afford one or however you want to word it.\u201d This comment by the trial court hardly sufficed to demonstrate that Williams was knowingly and intelligently waiving his right to be represented by counsel. Appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error are sustained. The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b589-8\">Wolff, P.J., and Fain, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
