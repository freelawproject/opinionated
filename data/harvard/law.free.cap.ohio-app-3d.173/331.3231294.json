Hockenberry, for an Ohio loan officer\u2019s license. For the following reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">{\u00b6 2} On May 1, 2002, appellee submitted a loan officer\u2019s license application to appellant. The application instructions included the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">You must answer each question on this application fully and truthfully. Any omission, untruthful answer or incomplete answer may result in your being denied the privilege of obtaining a Mortgage Loan Officer License and acting as a loan officer in the State of Ohio, or in subsequent legal action. Questions 2 through 6 must be fully answered regardless of dismissals or similar terminations, and must include all actions or legal proceedings occurring in any court in any jurisdiction. This includes any matter dismissed favorably to you, filed by you or in which you were involved in any manner other than as a witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-11\">If you have any doubts about whether any matter should be reported on this application, report it. If you are not sure of the dates, times, places, or other information requested, you should consult the court, government agency, or other entity involved to obtain the correct and full information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">{\u00b6 3} Appellee answered \u201cno\u201d to question number 5 of the application, which asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Have you or has any company for which you have been an officer, or more than 5% owner or director, ever been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any criminal offense including, but not limited to, theft, receiving stolen property, embezzlement, forgery, fraud, passing bad checks, money laundering, or drug trafficking, or any criminal offense involving money or securities? If the answer is yes, furnish details.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">{\u00b6 4} As part of its evaluation process, appellant conducted a background check on appellee. That background check revealed that in 1992, appellee had been convicted of unauthorized use of property \u2014 a fourth-degree misdemeanor. Upon learning this information, appellant requested appellee to provide additional information concerning the undisclosed conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">{\u00b6 5} In a letter to appellant dated October 8, 2002, appellee described the events that resulted in the conviction. Appellee explained that when he was in college, he and two friends were walking back to his car after eating at Max <em>&amp; </em>Erma\u2019s Restaurant in the City Center Mall, Columbus, Ohio. Appellant\u2019s car was parked in an attached garage. As they exited the mall, two of appellee\u2019s friends took \u201cAmeri Flora flags\u201d displayed inside the mall. Appellant went into the garage and got into his car. As soon as his friends with the flags got into appellant\u2019s car, they were confronted by security officers and detained. Appellant and his friends were subsequently arrested by Columbus police officers. Appellant\u2019s friends were charged with a form of theft. Appellant was charged with receiving stolen property. At his court appearance, appellant pleaded no contest and explained to the judge the circumstances that resulted in the charge. The judge reduced the charge and found appellee guilty of unauthorized use of property. Appellee\u2019s sentence was limited to a fine. Appellee further stated that he was in the process of having the conviction expunged from his record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">{\u00b6 6} On April 30, 2003, appellant issued to appellee a notice of its intent to deny the loan-officer license and a notice of an opportunity for a hearing. The notice of denial was based primarily upon appellee\u2019s failure to disclose his 1992 conviction on his application. Appellee requested a hearing. A hearing officer for appellant held a hearing on June 25, 2003, pursuant to appellee\u2019s request. Appellee appeared as a witness. He testified that when he paid the fine for the 1992 conviction, the clerk told him the conviction would be automatically removed from his record with the passage of time. Therefore, appellee believed he answered question number 5 truthfully. Appellee denied that he had intended to mislead appellant about his conviction, although he admitted his answer to question number 5 was inaccurate. Following the hearing, the hearing officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>filed a report and recommendation with appellant that appellant approve appellee\u2019s application and grant him a loan-officer license.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant rejected the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation and issued an order on July 29, 2005, denying appellee\u2019s application. The order stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOr\">For the reasons stated hereafter, the Division disapproves: paragraph 14 on page 6 of the Report and Recommendation; paragraph 15 on page 7 of the Report and Recommendation; and the recommendation on page 7 of the Report and Recommendation. First, violations of R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1322.07(A) and (B) do not require a \u201cweighing\u201d as done by the hearing officer and are strict liability. Second, an applicant\u2019s criminal history is a \u201cmaterial fact\u201d under R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1322.07(A) and (B). R.C. \u00a7 1322.07(A) forbids any license applicant from \u201c[o]btain[ing] a * * * license through any false or fraudulent representation of a material fact or any omission of a material fact required by state law, or [from] mak[ing] any substantial misrepresentation in any * * * license application[.]\u201d Hockenberry\u2019s failure to disclose his conviction on his loan officer license application is a violation of R.C. \u00a7 1322.07(A). R.C. \u00a7 1322.07(B) prohibits a license applicant from \u201c[m]aking false or misleading statements of a material fact, [or] omission of statements required by state law[.]\u201d Hockenberry\u2019s failure to disclose his conviction on his loan officer license application is a violation of R.C. \u00a7 1322.07(B).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">{\u00b6 8} Appellee appealed appellant\u2019s order to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to R.C. 119.12. Appellee also filed a motion to suspend appellant\u2019s order pending the outcome of the appeal, which the trial court granted. On September 25, 2006, the trial court reversed appellant\u2019s order and further ordered that appellant grant appellee a loan-officer\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant now appeals, assigning the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">I. The lower court erred as a matter of law and abused its discretion in holding the Division\u2019s order was not in accordance with the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">II. The lower court abused its discretion in holding the Division\u2019s Order was not based upon reliable, probative and substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">{\u00b6 10} In an administrative appeal pursuant to R.C. 119.12, the trial court reviews an administrative order to determine whether it is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. <em>Huffman v. Hair Surgeon, Inc. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 83, 87, 482 N.E.2d 1248. On appeal to this court, the standard of review is more limited. Unlike the court of common pleas, a court of appeals does not determine the weight of the evidence. <em>Rossford Exempted Village School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. State Bd. of Edn. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 705, 707, 590 N.E.2d 1240. In reviewing the court of common pleas determination of whether the administrative order was supported by reliable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>probative, and substantial evidence, this court\u2019s role is limited to determining whether the court of common pleas abused its discretion. <em>Roy v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 675, 680, 610 N.E.2d 562. The phrase \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. However, on the question of whether the commission\u2019s order was in accordance with law, this court\u2019s review is plenary. <em>Univ. Hosp., Univ. of Cincinnati College of Medicine v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 339, 343, 587 N.E.2d 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">{\u00b6 11} In its first assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in holding that the division\u2019s order was not in accordance with law. Appellant argues that the trial court applied the wrong portions of R.C. 1322.07(A) and (B) in holding that these provisions require a finding of intentional dishonesty. Appellant points out that the applicable portion of R.C. 1322.07(A) requires only a \u201csubstantial misrepresentation in any registration or license application\u201d \u2014 not an intentionally false or fraudulent misrepresentation. Likewise, appellant notes that R.C. 1322.07(B) also prohibits \u201comissions of statements required by state law,\u201d a prohibition that would include the failure to disclose a conviction as required by state law. Although we agree that R.C. 1322.07(A) and (B) are not limited to an intentionally false or fraudulent misrepresentation, appellant has misinterpreted the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">{\u00b6 12} Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, the trial court did not hold that R.C. 1322.07(A) and (B) require a finding of intentional dishonesty. Rather, the trial court found that appellant was not prohibited from granting appellee a license even though appellee had provided a false response to a question on the application in violation of R.C. 1322.07(A) and (B). The trial court found that appellant had the authority to weigh the evidence and to grant appellee a license if appellant determined that appellee had demonstrated sufficient credibility, character, and honesty, despite appellee\u2019s violation of R.C. 1322.07(A) and (B). Therefore, the trial court held that appellant had erred as a matter of law when appellant determined that it lacked the authority to issue appellee a license under these circumstances. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 1322.041 requires appellant to issue a license to an applicant if the applicant meets the required conditions, including compliance with R.C. 1322.07. However, there is no provision that prohibits appellant from granting a license if an applicant fails to meet all of the conditions. As noted by the trial court, the statutory scheme requires appellant to weigh the evidence presented and to determine whether the applicant has demonstrated sufficient credibility, character, and honesty justifying appellant\u2019s issuance of a license. This is precisely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>what appellant\u2019s hearing officer did when he recommended that appellant issue appellee a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">{\u00b6 14} The clear purpose of the statutory scheme is to require appellant to determine an applicant\u2019s fitness to work as a loan officer. That determination permits appellant to weigh a variety of factors. If an applicant satisfies the express conditions set forth in R.C. 1322.041, appellant is required to grant the applicant a license. However, if an applicant fails to satisfy all the express conditions, nothing prohibits appellant from granting the applicant a license if the applicant\u2019s character and general fitness command the confidence of the public and warrant the belief that the business will be operated honestly and fairly in compliance with the law. R.C. 1322.041(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">{\u00b6 15} This conclusion is also consistent with <em>Bellante v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, Dept. of Financial Institutions, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 86712, 2006-Ohio-2472, 2006 WL 1360807. In <em>Bellante, </em>a hearing officer for the division of financial institutions found that the applicant had given a false answer when he denied he had been convicted of a criminal offense. In fact, appellant had three misdemeanor convictions. The hearing officer weighed the evidence, including the applicant\u2019s explanation for the false response, and concluded that the applicant failed to demonstrate the credibility, character, and honesty necessary to command the confidence of the public. Therefore, the hearing officer recommended that the division deny the applicant a license. The division agreed and denied the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">{\u00b6 16} The trial court reversed the division\u2019s denial and ordered the division to issue a \u201cprovisional license\u201d to the applicant, with a probationary period to end one year from the date of issue upon a showing that the applicant had operated an honest business in originating loans. Notably, in reversing the trial court\u2019s decision, the court in <em>Bellante </em>did not find that the division lacked the authority to issue a license because of the applicant\u2019s false response. Nor did the <em>Bellante </em>court find that the division should not have considered the applicant\u2019s explanation for his false response in determining the applicant\u2019s fitness. Rather, <em>Bellante </em>held that the trial court had abused its discretion in reversing the division\u2019s order because there was substantial, reliable, and probative evidence supporting the division\u2019s determination that the applicant lacked the necessary character and general fitness to command the confidence of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">{\u00b6 17} Because we agree with the trial court\u2019s determination that appellant misinterpreted its statutory authority, we overrule appellant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">{\u00b6 18} In its second assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in holding that appellant\u2019s order was not based upon reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. Appellant argues that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>court did not give due deference to appellant\u2019s administrative resolution of the evidentiary conflicts. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">{\u00b6 19} As discussed above, appellant did not weigh the evidence in determining whether to issue appellee a license. It denied the application based upon what it perceived as a statutory limitation on its authority. Nor did the trial court hold that appellant\u2019s order was not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. It reversed appellant\u2019s order based upon appellant\u2019s misinterpretation of its statutory authority. Nevertheless, we agree with appellant that the trial court abused its discretion when it ordered appellant to grant appellee a loan-officer\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">{\u00b620} It was undisputed that appellee had failed to comply with all the statutory conditions because of his false response to question number 5 on the application. Therefore, appellant was not required to grant appellee a license. R.C. 1322.07. However, once the trial court determined that appellant had misinterpreted its statutory authority, the trial court should have reversed appellant\u2019s order and remanded the matter to appellant so that appellant could weigh the evidence and determine appellee\u2019s fitness for a loan-officer\u2019s license. The trial court abused its discretion when it ordered appellant to issue appellee a license under these circumstances. Therefore, to this extent, we sustain appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">{\u00b6 21} In conclusion, we overrule appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, and we overrule in part and sustain in part appellant\u2019s second assignment of error. Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand this cause to the trial court with instructions to return the matter to appellant for a determination, after weighing the evidence, of whether appellee\u2019s character and general fitness warrant the issuance of a loan officer\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b368-9\">Bryant and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\">.
