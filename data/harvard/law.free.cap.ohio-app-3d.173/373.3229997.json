On December 13, 2005, Dillard was indicted on one count of possession of heroin, in an amount exceeding 250 grams, in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), with an attached major-drug-offender specification, pursuant to R.C. 2929.01, 2929.14(D)(3)(a), and 2941.1410. Following a jury trial, Dillard was convicted and sentenced to ten years on the possession of heroin charge and an additional eight years on the major-drug-offender specification, to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>The events giving rise to this matter began on October 26, 2006, when officers responded to 5113 Kingsford Drive, in Trotwood, Ohio, where shots had been fired. An officer in the area heard the shots and requested that other officers respond to determine the exact location of the gunfire. Also, Renata Anderson, Dillard\u2019s girlfriend and a resident of 5113 Kingsford Drive, placed a 911 call, stating that she had heard shots near her home and that she was hiding in her closet. Responding officers found two men with gunshot wounds on the front porch of 5113 Kingsford Drive. One of them was pronounced dead at the scene and the other was transported to the hospital, where he died. There were keys hanging in the lock in the front door of the home, and as officers approached the door, Anderson opened the door and ran from the home, screaming hysterically. The officers entered the home and performed a protective sweep for other victims or suspects; no one was inside. The officers secured the scene, and a search warrant was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">{\u00b6 3} Another officer, Roy McGill, pursued a vehicle that fled from Dillard\u2019s residence when the officers arrived. When the vehicle was stopped, McGill observed that the driver, Andre Longstreet, had been shot several times. Longstreet, who was from Chicago, initially told McGill that he had come to Dayton for a vacation, and that he did not have a gun, but in a follow-up interview at the hospital, he told the officer that he had gone to the Kingsford Drive address with a gun, with Lamont Curtis, to buy heroin from \u201cChino.\u201d Curtis was acquainted with Dillard, but Longstreet was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Detective Brad Williams of the Trotwood Police Department stated the following facts in his affidavit in support of the search warrant: \u201cThat on or about October 26th, 2005, officers responded to shots fired at in [sic] the area of Kingsford Drive in the City of Trotwood. Officers attempted to stop a vehicle that fled the area and caught the subject who had been shot several times. Officers were then called to 5113 Kingsford and upon arrival found two gun shot victims on the front porch. One of the victims was pronounced dead at the scene the other was transported to the hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">{\u00b6 5} The search warrant provided that probable cause existed to find that the offenses of aggravated murder and felonious assault had occurred and that \u201cthe following items of property are connected with the commission of said offense(s): weapons, guns, bullets, bullet casings, bullet fragments, video and or surveillance tapes, any and all trace evidence related to the murder or felonious assault, to include but not limited to blood, hair, fibers. Cellular telephones, any telephone recordings, documents related to the crime and any and all illegal possessed items related to the crime of murder or felonious assault or items that may have value to motive or cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">{\u00b6 6} Dillard filed a motion to suppress on April 13, 2006. At the hearing on the motion, Jon Moeggenberg, a Trotwood police officer, testified that he assisted another officer in stopping Longstreet\u2019s vehicle and then proceeded to the Kingsford Drive address. He described how he and two other officers conducted the protective sweep after Anderson fled from the home, and how they then secured the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">{\u00b6 7} Brad Williams also testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress. He stated that the gunshot victims outside the house gave us \u201cprobable cause to believe there were items related to the crime inside the house.\u201d Williams stated officers found heroin in the freezer, in a cereal box, in a canister on the kitchen counter, and in the attic of the garage. According to Williams, in his experience, a large amount of heroin may be a motive for murder. Williams stated that the cereal box, freezer, and other areas where the heroin was found were \u201cof the size and shape that bullets, bullet fragments, evidence of a homicide would have been located in.\u201d Also seized from the residence were gel capsules in baggies, digital scales with residue, a large plastic baggie of marijuana from the kitchen cabinet, and photographs and bills linking Dillard to the address. A hydraulic industrial press with attachments was seized from the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">{If 8} Williams testified that he found Longstreet\u2019s version of events, as relayed to him by another officer who interviewed Longstreet, to be credible. Longstreet took a gun to the Kingsford Drive address because he was carrying a large sum of money and he did not want to be robbed. Williams stated, \u201c[T]hey traveled here a couple of days prior to this incident. That they had stayed in Xenia, Ohio, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>not Dayton. And that while in Xenia, Ohio, they had made contact with the defendant at his house for the purpose of heroin. The defendant had prearranged them to come back on this particular evening to purchase the heroin. That Longstreet knew details that they had gone to a club, they had been gone to someplace to get breakfast and had came home. When they were robbed, he (indiscernible) the situation of having a firearm and purchasing or attempting to purchase what he thought was heroin. All things, if he was going to lie about anything, he definitely wouldn\u2019t put himself in a situation where he would be implicating himself in a criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cOn top of that, he was shot some five, six, seven times with through- and-through holes, didn\u2019t know if he was going to live or not live, knew the specific names, the area, how long they waited for him to come home because it was pre-arranged by the defendant for them to be there. All things he would not have known had he not been carrying on a conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cAgain, just the fact that he\u2019s from Chicago and he knows where 5113 Kingsford is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">{\u00b6 12} Finally, Williams testified that, in completing the affidavit, \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to put that there was heroin in there because I didn\u2019t know that there was heroin in there. I believed they were robbed, just like he said they were.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">{\u00b6 13} In overruling Dillard\u2019s motion to suppress, the court determined that the motion had two components.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe first component as to the warrant was the portion of the search, a search that was conducted without a warrant. The Court finds that the totality of the circumstances including a phone call from inside the house, shooting victims on the front walk and at the time of that warrantless] search a flight of a terrified person from the front door of the house all combined to make it appropriate for the officers to enter to search for victims, perpetrators, children and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cAs to the search which was accomplished with the warrant, the Court finds that the evidence set forth in the affidavit was sufficient to enable both the search and the area search, which was specifically contended by the defendant and that the results of that search are admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b410-13\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cAnd I\u2019ll make a specific finding then that those facts set forth in that affidavit were sufficient for both the search and the area searched.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-14\">{\u00b6 18} At trial, the jury heard evidence from the following witnesses: Longstreet testified about traveling to Dayton from Chicago with Lamont Curtis to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>buy heroin from \u201cChino,\u201d and the events that occurred at the Kingsford address; Robert Cairo, an accident reconstructionist and evidence technician for the Trotwood Police Department, testified regarding photos he took at the Kingsford address pursuant to the search warrant; Detective Kathleen Miller of the Trotwood Police Department testified regarding the process she followed to inventory all the items seized during the execution of the search warrant; Williams testified regarding the search warrant he obtained for the 5113 Kings-ford address; Kenneth Booker, a forensic chemist for the Drug Enforcement Administration, testified regarding his analysis of the drugs seized from Dillard\u2019s residence; Officer John Moeggenberg testified regarding his response to Dillard\u2019s residence; Raymond Dratt, a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration, testified about the common practice of pressing heroin into gel capsules for transportation and sales, as well as the similarity between the shape of the wafers of heroin found at 5113 Kingsford Drive and the press attachments found in the garage there, and he opined that the \u201calmost sterile\u201d press, which was free of grease, had not been used for its intended purpose, \u201cto press such things as bearings, braces and axle seals\u201d; Bill Toney, a detective with the city of Trotwood assigned to the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s task force in Dayton, testified about his role in taking custody of the items seized at the residence along with Agent Dratt; Roy McGill testified about his stop of Longstreet\u2019s vehicle, and Longstreet\u2019s initial statement that he came to Dayton for a vacation and his later remark that he came to Dayton with Lamont Curtis to buy 500 grams of heroin from \u201cChino\u201d; Walter Buchanan Ivy, Dillard\u2019s first cousin, testified that numerous family members and friends of Dillard\u2019s had keys to Dillard\u2019s home and stayed there when Dillard was not present; James Faulkner, a detective with the Trotwood Police Department, testified about his interview of Longstreet at the hospital emergency room, during which Longstreet averred that he came to Dayton for a vacation; Joseph Ramey, an acquaintance of Dillard\u2019s, testified that he often stayed at Dillard\u2019s residence when Dillard was not present and that he was there on October 25, 2005, with a man named Anthony Thomas; Terry Thomas, an acquaintance of Dillard\u2019s, also testified that he often stayed at Dillard\u2019s residence when Dillard was not present; and Sergeant Joseph McCrary, of the Trotwood Police Department, testified that he was present when cars were towed from Dillard\u2019s residence pursuant to the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">{\u00b6 19} Dillard asserted three assignments of error in his initial brief and then, with our leave, he filed a supplemental assignment of error on August 20, 2007. On September 6, 2007, the state of Ohio filed a supplemental brief. Dillard\u2019s first assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant, denying him his Fourth Amendment and Sec. 14, Art. 1 Constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure by failing to suppress evidence seized at his residence in violation of the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Constitution and Sec. 14, Art. 1, Ohio Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cA. The Search Warrant is void on its face as a \u2018general warrant\u2019 or is overly broad and lacking particularity in authorizing search for and seizure of items \u2018illegally possessed\u2019 and \u2018items that may be of value to motive or cause.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(1) General Principles</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(2) Imprecise Description is Invalid</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(3) The \u2018Plain View1 Exception Does not Apply</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(B) Standing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(C) Unconstitutionally Seized Evidence Convicted Defendant, JuWan Dillard</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-11\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c(D) The County Judge had no Probable Cause to Direct a Search for Drugs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">{\u00b6 28} First, we note, \u201c \u2018Appellate courts give great deference to the factual findings of the trier of facts. At a suppression hearing, the trial court serves as the trier of fact, and must judge the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence. The trial court is in the best position to resolve questions of fact and evaluate witness credibility. In reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to suppress, an appellate court accepts the trial court\u2019s factual findings, relies on the trial court\u2019s ability to assess the credibility of witnesses, and independently determines whether the trial court applied the proper legal standard to the facts as found. An appellate court is bound to accept the trial court\u2019s factual findings as long as they are supported by competent, credible evidence.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State v. Purser, </em>Greene App. No. 2006 CA 14, 2007-Ohio-190, 2007 WL 127694, \u00b6 11, quoting <em>State v. Hurt, </em>Montgomery App. No. 21009, 2006-Ohio-990, 2006 WL 522388, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">{\u00b6 29} According to Dillard, \u201c[T]he items seized under the search warrant as \u2018illegally possessed\u2019 or \u2018items that may have value to motive or cause,\u2019 constituted the entire evidence of heroin possession against JuWan Dillard. Without these items, there was no case; there was no other drug evidence. Without the search \u2014 a rummaging through the residence at 5113 Kingsford and the totally discretionary searching in contained cabinets, drawers, canisters, freezer and attic, there was no evidence to support the indictment of possession of heroin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">{\u00b6 30} In response, the state argues that the warrant was valid and the officers did not exceed its scope. The warrant authorized the officers to search the home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>for weapons, bullets, trace evidence, and \u201citems that would among other things explain the motive for the crimes,\u201d and, even if the warrant lacked probable cause, the search of the residence \u201cwould be justified based upon the good faith exception.\u201d Further, the state argues that the warrant was not overbroad or vague. \u201cThe officers were looking for guns, other weapons, bullets, and evidence related to the shooting, including evidence about the motive; they were not rummaging when they looked in small spaces and found heroin.\u201d They \u201cwere looking for bullets or guns, or other weapons, which could [be] hidden in cabinets, canisters, or boxes of cereal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">{\u00b6 31} The state argues that if \u201cevidence is found that is not specifically listed in the warrant it may still be seized if 1) based upon the evidence known to the officers, the item is closely related to the crime being investigated, or 2) the officer has reasonable cause to believe the items seized were instrumentalities of the crime. * * * Furthermore, if while properly executing the search warrant officers inadvertently find an item whose incriminating character is immediately apparent, the item may be seized without further warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c \u2018In determining the sufficiency of probable cause in an affidavit submitted in support of a search warrant, the task <em>of </em>the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common sense decision whether, given all of the circumstances set forth in the affidavit, including the veracity and basis of knowledge of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place. <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 213 [103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527]; <em>State v. George </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 325 [544 N.E.2d 640].</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c \u201cWhen reviewing the sufficiency of probable cause in a search warrant issued by a magistrate, neither a trial court nor an appellate court should substitute its judgment for that of the magistrate by conducting a <em>de novo </em>determination as to whether the affidavit submitted in support of the search warrant establishes probable cause. Rather, the duty of a reviewing court is simply to ensure that the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed. Great deference should be accorded to the magistrate\u2019s probable cause determination, and doubtful or marginal cases should be resolved in favor of the warrant. Id.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cHearsay information may be relied upon by the officer providing an affidavit for a search warrant if the officer reasonably believes the information to be true. * * * The basis of knowledge and the veracity of the person supplying hearsay information are circumstances that must be considered in determining the value of the information and whether probable cause exists.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>State v. Newell, </em>Montgomery App. No. 21567, 2006-Ohio-5980, 2006 WL 3259296, quoting <em>State v. Nathan, </em>Montgomery App. No. 18911, 2001-Ohio-1826, 2001 WL 1468910.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\"> {\u00b6 36} \u201c[I]t is clear that \u2018only the probability, and not a prima facie showing, of criminal activity is the standard of probable cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 325, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527, quoting <em>Spinelli v. United States </em>(1969), 393 U.S. 410, 419, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637. \u201cTo establish probable cause to search a home, the facts must be sufficient to justify a conclusion that the property that is the subject of the search is probably on the premises to be searched. The nexus between the items sought and the place to be searched depends upon all of the circumstances of each individual case, including the type of crime and the nature of the evidence.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State v. Freeman, </em>Highland App. No. 06CA3, 2006-Ohio-5020, 2006 WL 2773451, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cThe Fourth Amendment specifically commands that no warrants shall issue except those particularly describing the things to be seized. \u2018The requirement that warrants shall particularly describe the things to be seized makes general searches under them impossible and prevents the seizure of one thing under a warrant describing another. As to what is to be taken, nothing is left to the discretion of the officer executing the warrant.\u2019 <em>Marron v. United States </em>(1927), 275 U.S. 192, 196 [48 S.Ct. 74, 72 L.Ed. 231]. \u2018[T]he warrant must be sufficiently definite so that the officer executing it can identify the property sought with reasonable certainty.\u2019 <em>State v. Muldowney </em>(1972), [60 N.J. 594] 292 A.2d 26, 29. \u2018[T]he key inquiry is whether the warrants could reasonably have described the items more precisely than they did.\u2019 <em>State v. Benner </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 301, 307 [533 N.E.2d 701].</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cA third purpose underlying the particularity requirement is to prevent the issuance of warrants on loose, vague, or doubtful bases of fact. The requirement of particularity is closely tied to the requirement of probable cause. It must be probable that the described items are connected with criminal activity and that they are to be found in the place to be searched. The less precise the description of the things to be seized, the more likely it will be that either or both of these probabilities has not been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c \u2018[O]bjects falling in the plain view of an officer who has a right to be in the position to have that view are subject to seizure and may be introduced in evidence.\u2019 <em>Harris v. United States </em>(1968), 390 U.S. 234, 236 [88 S.Ct. 992, 19 L.Ed.2d 1067]. The plain view doctrine comes into play when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>police officer discovers evidence while in the course of a search for other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cThe intrusion affording the plain view must be lawful and the incriminating nature of the evidence must be immediately apparent to the seizing authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cThe police officer need not know that the items in plain view are contraband or evidence of a crime. It is sufficient that probable cause exist to associate the property with criminal activity before evidence may be seized under the plain view doctrine.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State v. Powell </em>(Dec. 15, 2000), Montgomery App. Nos. 18095, 99-CR-631, 2000 WL 1838716 (holding that search warrant at issue did not authorize the seizure of a camcorder and a videotape; the evidence contained on the tape of the crimes being investigated was not immediately apparent to the officers under the plain-view doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">{\u00b6 43} A catchall provision in a warrant \u201cmust be read in conjunction with the list of particularly described items which preceded it pertaining to the crimes alleged.\u201d <em>State v. Napier </em>(Apr. 16, 1999), Montgomery App. No. 17326, 1999 WL 249174. The <em>Napier </em>court determined that the following catchall provision in the warrant at issue, \u201c \u2018any other contraband * * *,\u2019 standing alone, is quite broad, perhaps impermissibly so.\u201d The warrant, however, delineated several specific items, such as money, records, and receipts, including computer disks, relating to the illegal sale of alcohol, ahead of the catchall phrase, and the court determined that \u201cthe discretion of the officers executing this search warrant was reasonably guided and limited, and that the search warrant provided sufficient specificity regarding the items sought. Therefore, the catch-all phrase did not invalidate the entire warrant by authorizing a constitutionally overbroad, general exploratory search which permitted officers to rummage through anything and everything and seize whatever they wanted. Rather, the officers executing this warrant could identify the property being sought with reasonable certainty.\u201d Accordingly, when the officers discovered cocaine in a zippered compartment of a gym bag inside a bedroom closet, \u201cthey were searching well within the scope of the search authorized by the warrant. Under these circumstances the officers were permitted to seize the cocaine they discovered pursuant to the plain view doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">{\u00b6 44} The <em>Napier </em>court went on to note, \u201cEven assuming <em>arguendo, </em>however, that the catch-all provision is impermissibly broad, that invalid portion of the warrant is clearly severable from the remaining valid portions.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">{\u00b6 45} Further, \u201c[i]t is well-established that the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule will not be applied so as to bar the use of evidence obtained by officers acting in objectively reasonable reliance on a search warrant issued by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>detached and neutral magistrate but ultimately found to be unsupported by probable cause. <em>George, 45 </em>Ohio St.3d at 330 [544 N.E.2d 640], citing <em>[United States v. Leon </em>(1984), 468 U.S. 897, 918-923, 926, 104 S.Ct. 3430, 82 L.Ed.2d 677]. The <em>George </em>court quoted <em>Leon </em>in explaining that \u2018[t]he deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule necessarily assumes that the police have engaged in willful, or at the least negligent, conduct which has deprived the defendant of some right. Where the official action was pursued in complete good faith however, the deterrence rationale loses much of its force.\u2019 Id. at 331 [544 N.E.2d 640], quoting <em>Leon </em>at 919 [104 S.Ct. 3430, 82 L.Ed.2d 677]. In determining whether the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies, this court may look \u2018beyond the four corners of the affidavit to determine whether the officer executing the search warrant did so in good faith reliance on the magistrate\u2019s issuance of the search warrant.\u2019 <em>[State v.

The catchall phrase, \u201call illegal possessed items * * * that may have value to motive or cause,\u201d when read in conjunction with the list of particularly described items before it, did not authorize a constitutionally overbroad search. In other words, the search of those areas was not a general search but a particular one for precisely described items. As in <em>Napier, </em>even if we were to assume that the catchall provision is overbroad, that invalid portion of the warrant is severable from the rest of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">{\u00b6 47} Further, Williams testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress that he found Longstreet\u2019s version of events, as related to Williams by another officer, to be credible, based, among other things, on Longstreet\u2019s familiarity with the Kingsford address, that Longstreet knew details about the prearranged meeting with \u201cChino,\u201d and that Longstreet implicated himself in criminal activity. We cannot say, from the standpoint of the officers executing the warrant, that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>objectively unreasonable for them to rely on the warrant based on Williams\u2019s information; there is no suggestion that Williams falsified any statements in the affidavit. Accordingly, the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule, coupled with the attendant probable cause, would permit the trial court to deny the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">{\u00b6 48} Since the trial court did not err in overruling Dillard\u2019s motion to suppress, Dillard\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">{\u00b6 49} Dillard\u2019s second assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cThe conviction must be vacated because there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of constructive possession.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cIn reviewing a claim of insufficient evidence, \u2018[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v.

While witnesses for Dillard testified that multiple people often stayed at the house in Dillard\u2019s absence, it was up to the trier of fact to evaluate the credibility of all of the witnesses, and the state did not rely on the fact that Dillard owned or leased the property by itself to establish his possession of the heroin. Andre Longstreet testified that he came to Dayton, Ohio, with Lamont Curtis to meet \u201cChino\u201d to buy heroin. Longstreet did not know \u201cChino\u201d but was directed to his home at 5113 Kingsford Drive by Curtis. Longstreet got a good look at Dillard from a distance of arm\u2019s length, and he identified him in court as a participant in a robbery/drug deal at 5113 Kingsford Drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">{\u00b6 56} Officers seized a cable bill in the name of JuWan Dillard at 5113 Kingsford Drive, as well as correspondence from Dillard\u2019s attorney addressed to him at 5113 Kingsford Drive.

First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable. Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction * * * resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.\u201d Id. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cThe Ohio Supreme Court has enunciated a similar test for determining claims for ineffective assistance of counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">{\u00b6 68} \u201c \u20182. Counsel\u2019s performance will not be deemed ineffective unless and until counsel\u2019s performance is proved to have fallen below an objective standard of reasonable representation and, in addition, prejudice arises from counsel\u2019s performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">{If 69} \u201c \u20183. To show that a defendant has been prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the defendant must prove that there exists a reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u2019 <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraphs two and three of the syllabus.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State v. Lloyd </em>(Mar. 31, 1999), Montgomery App. No. 15927, 1999 WL 173017.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">{\u00b6 70} In <em>Strickland, </em>the United States Supreme Court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">{\u00b6 71} \u201c \u2018Judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential. It is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel\u2019s defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable. Cf. <em>Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 133-134, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 1574-1575, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982). A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time. Because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation, a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u201cmight be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d See <em>Michel v. Louisiana </em>[ (1955), 350 U.S. 91, 101, 76 S.Ct. 158, 100 L.Ed. 83]. There are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case. Even the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way. See Goodpaster, The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 58 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 299, 343 (1983).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cThe availability of intrusive post-trial inquiry into attorney performance or of detailed guidelines for its evaluation would encourage the proliferation of ineffectiveness challenges. Criminal trials resolved unfavorably to the defendant would increasingly come to be followed by a second trial, this one of counsel\u2019s unsuccessful defense. Counsel\u2019s performance and even willingness to serve could be adversely affected. Intensive scrutiny of counsel and rigid requirements for acceptable assistance could dampen the ardor and impair the independence of defense counsel, discourage the acceptance of assigned cases, and undermine the trust between attorney and client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cThus, a court deciding an actual ineffectiveness claim must judge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct. A convicted defendant making a claim of ineffective assistance must identify the acts or omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgment. The court must then determine whether, in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance. In making that determination, the court should keep in mind that counsel\u2019s function, as elaborated in prevailing professional norms, is to make the adversarial testing process work in the particular case. At the same time, the court should recognize that counsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689-690, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">{\u00b6 74} According to Dillard, all of Longstreet\u2019s \u201cknowledge about JuWan Dillard, other than seeing his face, was from an out-of-court declarant, never under oath and never subject to cross examination, Lamont Curtis.\u201d Dillard argues that his counsel should have requested a preliminary examination or \u201cvoir dire\u201d of Longstreet, pursuant to Evid.R. 104(A), prior to his direct testimony, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>establish that \u201call of Longstreet\u2019s knowledge concerning JuWan Dillard was inadmissible hearsay from Lamont Curtis\u201d and not based on Longstreet\u2019s personal knowledge.

That Longstreet was not acquainted with Dillard and did not know his name does not render his identification of him incompetent. We cannot say that defense counsel\u2019s failure to request voir dire of Longstreet, or object to his identification of Dillard, fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation such that, were it not for counsel\u2019s failure, the trial would not have resulted in Dillard\u2019s conviction. In all likelihood, such a requested voir dire would have been appropriately denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">{\u00b6 76} According to Dillard, if we determine that he \u201cfailed to prove standing, it is clear from the record that such a failure is the result of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">{\u00b6 77} \u201cStanding to invoke the protection of the Fourth Amendment depends on whether the person who claims it has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the place invaded by a police search and seizure.\u201d <em>State v.

While the state argued in its opposition to Dillard\u2019s motion to suppress that Dillard failed to show \u201cany expectation of privacy in the area searched,\u201d the trial court did not address the issue, and the state concedes that the \u201cquestion of standing is a non-issue.\u201d We agree. Having ruled on the merits, clearly the court deemed Dillard to have standing to challenge the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">{\u00b6 89} Dillard next argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the testimony of Agent Dratt, whose opinions regarding the hydraulic press were \u201cnot based on facts in the record or facts perceived by Agent Dratt * * * if he had qualified as an expert.\u201d According to Dillard, his counsel failed to \u201cseek to voir dire Agent Dratt outside the presence of the jury where he could have shown the lack of factual basis and potentially had the opinions excluded in advance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">(\u00b6 90} Evid.R. 703 provides that \u201c[t]he facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by him or admitted in evidence at the hearing.\u201d Agent Dratt did not offer expert opinions about the press found in the garage, and Evid.R. 703 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">{\u00b6 91} \u201cIf the witness is not testifying as an expert, his testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d Evid.R. 701. Dratt testified, \u201c[Tjypically when we see heroin and it\u2019s in a compressed form, it\u2019s what\u2019s called a finger. A finger is a compressed tube of heroin that looks like your finger and then they put it in a rubber or latex glove, stretch the glove, tie the finger off and cut it off that\u2019s what is called a finger.\u201d Dratt was asked if the shape of the heroin found at Dillard\u2019s residence had \u201cany significance with anything else that was found at the scene of 5113 Kingsford\u201d He responded, \u201cthe cylindrical wafer, if you will, appears to be the same diameter, shape and size as a \u2014 the press attachment that we found at the location.\u201d Dratt noted that the press was free of grease, and stated, \u201c[T]ypically, when you use them for what they\u2019re designed to be used for, there is grease, and all kinds of, you know, dirty things around it as grease is typically \u2014 axle grease is very dirty and smelly. This particular press is clean, it has been used obviously but not for its designed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>purpose to the best of my knowledge.\u201d Draft went on to state, \u201cNow, the other thing that through my training and experience I would like to mention is the fact that when you see a press, typically there is things that go along with the press like tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">{\u00b6 92} \u201cSomebody who has a press in their home for legitimate use is obviously going to be handy and have the ability to use tools, this particular press was a stand-alone press. I saw no toolbox or anything of that nature to indicate that the press was being used for its intended purpose, which is, you know, in the mechanical field.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">{\u00b6 93} Draft\u2019s testimony falls clearly within the purview of Evid.R. 701; he testified as a layperson about his opinions, which were based on his own perceptions and which were helpful to the factfinder. Dillard\u2019s counsel was not ineffective for failing to seek to have Draft\u2019s opinions stricken, as Dillard alleges. In other words, counsel\u2019s failure to object did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness, and, had counsel objected, the outcome of the trial would not have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">{\u00b6 94} Finally, Dillard argues that \u201cit was a denial of JuWan Dillard\u2019s rights to admit the hearsay evidence from Lamont Curtis through Andre Longstreet, that was necessary to convict JuWan Dillard of possession of the controlled substance. Since this was the only testimony identifying JuWan Dillard as being at the scene and being the person from whom the controlled substance was to be purchased, this admission cannot be classified as harmless. Its admission was \u2018plain error\u2019 that the Court should consider even without objection under Crim.R. 52(B).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">{\u00b6 95} \u201cPlain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\u201d Crim.R. 52(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">{\u00b6 96} As discussed above, Longstreet clearly observed Dillard from an arm\u2019s-length distance at Dillard\u2019s residence and identified him in court as the person from whom he sought to purchase heroin. In other words, Longstreet\u2019s testimony about Curtis was not \u201cthe only testimony identifying JuWan Dillard as being at the scene and being the only person from whom the controlled substance was to be purchased.\u201d Had counsel for Dillard objected to Longstreet\u2019s testimony about Curtis, the outcome of the trial would not have been different, and there is no plain error as Dillard argues. Dillard\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">{\u00b6 97} Dillard\u2019s supplemental assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-11\">{\u00b6 98} \u201cThe trial court violated defendant-appellant\u2019s right to a trial by jury and right to have each element of the offense against him proved beyond a reasonable doubt as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by finding the facts to support a prison sentence of ten (10) years for possession and an enhancement of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>sentence for an additional consecutive eight (8) year term contrary to the guarantees of the Constitution, and based on a statute declared unconstitutional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">{\u00b6 99} The Ohio Supreme Court declared R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(b), pursuant to which Dillard received an additional eight-year term as a major drug offender, unconstitutional, and the court severed the statutory subsection from Ohio\u2019s felony-sentencing scheme in <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470. R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(b) provided, \u201cThe court imposing a prison term on an offender under division (D)(3)(a) of this section may impose an additional prison term of one, two, * * * or ten years\u201d under certain conditions. In other words, due to Dillard\u2019s status as a major drug offender, the excised statutory subsection would have permitted the trial court to make findings and impose an \u201cadd-on\u201d term of one to ten years to Dillard\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">{\u00b6 100} In <em>State v. Adams, </em>Lake App. No.2006-L-114, 2007-Ohio-2434, 2007 WL 1461763, \u00b6 27, the court determined that \u201conly the requirement to make factual findings before imposing \u2018the add-on\u2019 has been severed\u201d from Ohio\u2019s sentencing guidelines, and the sentencing court retains full discretion to impose an enhanced penalty in the absence of judicial fact finding. The dissent in <em>Adams, </em>however, concluded, \u201cTrial courts are not permitted to \u2018add on\u2019 to maximum sentences by making judicial findings. Such a practice clearly emaciates the term \u2018maximum\u2019 and inherently adds to the confusion currently surrounding sentencing in Ohio.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 35. Although we agree with the <em>Adams </em>dissent\u2019s conclusion that the add-on term is improper, we reach this conclusion because an add-on sentence cannot be predicated upon R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(b). R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(b), which provided the only statutory language permitting an enhancement to the underlying ten-year term, has been excised from the statutory scheme. Thus, while Dillard\u2019s ten-year sentence for possession of heroin is a lawful mandatory sentence which still is proper under R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a), the add-on eight-year sentence Dillard received is based upon R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(b), which the Ohio Supreme Court deemed unconstitutional and has been excised. Accordingly, we sustain Dillard\u2019s supplemental assignment of error, vacate the add-on eight-year sentence, and remand the matter for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Sentence vacated and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b424-7\">Fain, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b424-8\">Grady, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Grady, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Azf\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">{\u00b6 101} Ironically, officers had sufficient probable cause to obtain a warrant to search defendant\u2019s residence for drugs, based on what the seriously injured Longstreet had told them about the drug deal that went bad and the two shooting deaths that occurred outside the house. Instead, officers sought and procured a warrant to search inside the house for evidence related to the homicide and assault offenses the shootings involved. Then, acting on the authority of the overly broad concluding clause of the warrant (\u201cand any and all illegal [sic] possessed items related to the crime of murder or felonious assault on items that may have value to motive or cause\u201d), officers conducted a pretextual search for illegal drugs and articles related to drug trafficking, and they seized that evidence when they found it.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">{\u00b6 102} In my view, there is simply no way to reconcile the loose and general concluding language of the warrant with the express particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment. It simply will not do to allow officers to decide for themselves whether evidence may be seized because, in their judgment, it may be probative of a motive for a crime they are investigating. Also, though officers may always seize other evidence which they know to be illegal when it is in plain view, the fact that \u201cillegal\u201d evidence may be present cannot authorize a warrant to go in and find it in plain view. There must be probable cause to believe it is there and a warrant particularly describing it. Otherwise, the judicial authority is transferred to and exercised by officers who perform a search on a pretext the warrant sets up.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">{\u00b6 108} <em>State v. Napier </em>(Apr. 16, 1999), Montgomery App. No. 17326, 1999 WL 249174, involved a warrant containing similarly broad language. However, in <em>Napier, </em>the officers performing the search discovered cocaine inside a gym bag where other articles specifically described in the warrant reasonably might be found. In the present case, officers searched inside a cereal box, a freezer, and other locations, purportedly to find weapons, bullets, etc., as well as \u201cblood, hair, and fibers.\u201d The connection between such articles and the locations that were searched is simply too attenuated to support the search that was performed. After all, the shootings took place outside the house, not in or around those places.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">{\u00b6 104} On this record, I would reverse the trial court\u2019s order denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence and remand the case for a good-faith inquiry pursuant to the rule of <em>United States v. Leon </em>(1984), 468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677. Even though the officers clearly knew that the object of their search was drugs, if they reasonably believed that the concluding clause of the warrant authorized their search for drugs, the court may yet deny the motion to suppress evidence. That is an issue for the trial court to resolve.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
