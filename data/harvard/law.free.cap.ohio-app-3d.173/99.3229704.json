At sentencing, in addition to a fine, the trial court ordered appellant to pay $4,125 as \u201cher proportionate share of the cost of the investigation and prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">{\u00b6 2} On appeal, appellant sets forth the following four assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-16\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cFirst Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-17\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cThe Court has no authority to order [appellant] to pay the costs of investigation and prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-18\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cSecond Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>{\u00b6 6} \u201cIf the trial court had intended that its sentence be a form of restitution, then costs of investigation do fall within the meaning of restitution. However, nowhere in the transcript is there a mention of the word \u2018restitution,\u2019 and therefore the trial court exceeded its authority in ordering the payment of \u2018costs of investigation.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">(\u00b6 7} \u201cThird Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court departed from the plea agreement that had been entered into by ordering the payment of costs of investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cFourth Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe record is devoid of any supporting documentation as to the amount ordered to be paid[.] If the payment of the costs of investigation is to be looked at as a restitution order, the record is totally devoid of any documents supporting the amount contained in the October 5, 2006 Order (Court Docket #4).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">{\u00b6 11} The undisputed facts are as follows. On June 28, 2006, a complaint was filed in the Toledo Municipal Court that charged appellant, Sally Perz, a public official, with filing a financial disclosure form \u201cthat failed to disclose the source of a gift in excess of $75\u201d in violation of R.C. 102.02(D), a first-degree misdemeanor. That same day, appellant signed a written plea agreement, in which she agreed to plead no contest to the charge and pay a $1,000 fine. The charges were brought as a result of an investigation conducted by the Ohio Ethics Commission (\u201cOEC\u201d). The plea agreement stated that \u201c[t]he State of Ohio will not take a position as to expungement if an application is timely filed, but will defer to the direction and judgment of the judge accepting the plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">{\u00b6 12} Immediately thereafter, a hearing was held at which the trial court informed appellant of her constitutional rights before accepting the plea and finding her guilty. The trial court then sentenced appellant to pay a $1,000 fine plus court costs and \u201cthe costs of the investigation and prosecution of this matter.\u201d The hearing was then concluded, and a judgment entry containing the trial court\u2019s judgment and sentencing order was journalized. On October 5, 2006, the trial court filed another judgment entry, in which it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-11\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cAt the sentencing on June 28, 2006 defendant with three other defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was ordered to pay the cost of the investigation and prosecution in this matter. Special Prosecutor Lynn Grimshaw has now forwarded to the court the Ohio Ethics Commission\u2019s Statement of costs incurred. The total costs conservatively calculated and incurred in the investigation and prosecution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>four defendants was $16,498.77. Accordingly this defendant is responsible for $4,125.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cORDERED: The defendant shall submit $4,125.00 to the Clerk of Courts within 80 days for disbursement to the Ohio Ethics Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">{\u00b6 15} On October 19, 2006, appellant filed a \u201cMotion to Vacate Portion of Sentence Ordering Payment of Restitution.\u201d In support, appellant argued that the trial court did not have authority pursuant to R.C. 2929.28 to order her to pay the OEC\u2019s investigative costs. On October 31, 2006, the trial court filed a judgment entry in which it denied appellant\u2019s motion to vacate, after finding that \u201c[n]othing in the sentencing statute R.C. 2929.28 limit[s] this court in assessing the investigation and prosecution costs in this matter.\u201d Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal on November 3, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">{\u00b6 16} We will first consider appellant\u2019s third assignment of error, in which appellant asserts that the trial court\u2019s sentencing order is \u201csubject to being set aside on appeal\u201d because it impermissibly deviates from the terms of the negotiated plea agreement. In support, appellant argues that (1) she agreed only to pay a fine, not the costs of the OEC\u2019s investigation, in exchange for her plea and (2) payment of the OEC\u2019s investigative costs is not authorized by R.C. 2929.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">{\u00b6 17} R.C. 2929.28(A) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(A) In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to section 2947.23 of the Revised Code, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor * * * may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions authorized under this section. * * * [Financial sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(1) * * * [Restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender\u2019s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the victim\u2019s economic loss. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(2) * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(a) A fine in the following amount:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-12\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(i) For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand dollars; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-13\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(3)(a) Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-14\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(i) All or part of the costs of implementing any community control sanction, * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>{\u00b6 25} \u201c(ii) All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other residential facility* * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">{\u00b6 26} The standard of review for sentencing in misdemeanor cases is abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Sims, </em>4th Dist. No. 04CA2779, 2006-Ohio-528, 2006 WL 290293, \u00b6 20, citing <em>In re Slusser </em>(2000), 140 Ohio App.3d 480, 487, 748 N.E.2d 105. On appeal, the trial court\u2019s sentence will not be reversed as an abuse of discretion, even if it deviates from the terms of a negotiated plea, so long as it is within the statutory limit and the trial court considered applicable statutory criteria. <em>State v. Yonis, </em>5th Dist. No. CA-05-21, 2006-Ohio-5993, 2006 WL 3290806, \u00b6 61; <em>State v. Tutt </em>(1988), 44 Ohio App.3d 138, 541 N.E.2d 1090. A finding of abuse of discretion implies that the trial court\u2019s conduct was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">{\u00b6 27} Generally, absent statutory authorization, the costs of a government investigation are not taxable as \u201ccourt costs.\u201d See <em>State v. Fitzpatrick </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 149, 153, 601 N.E.2d 160. See, also, <em>State v. Hill, </em>2d Dist. No. 04CA0047, 2005-Ohio-3877, 2005 WL 1797041, \u00b63 (\u201c[N]o penalty may be imposed upon conviction of a criminal offense which the General Assembly has not by statute prescribed for that purpose.\u201d); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>164 Ohio App.3d 792, 2005-Ohio-6826, 844 N.E.2d 372, \u00b6 24 (The trial court abused its discretion by ordering an offender to reimburse costs of investigation to the Ohio Highway Patrol, where such a sanction was not authorized by statute). It is undisputed that R.C. 2929.28 does not expressly authorize the trial court to impose the costs of an investigation as a financial sanction. Therefore, in resolving the issues raised in appellant\u2019s third assignment of error, we must determine whether the phrase \u201cinclude, but are not limited to\u201d in R.C. 2929.28 indirectly authorizes the trial court to order appellant to pay a pro rata share of the costs incurred by the OEC\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">{\u00b6 28} In matters involving statutory interpretation, \u201c \u2018[i]f the construction and interpretation of statutory language [reveal] the statute to be facially ambiguous, it is the function of the courts to construe the statutory language to effect a just and reasonable result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Meadowwood Manor, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Health, </em>12th Dist. No. 2006-08-010, 2007-Ohio-2067, 2007 WL 1248183, \u00b621, quoting <em>Burdge v. Kerasotes Showplace Theatres, L.L.C., </em>12th Dist. No. CA2006-02-023, 2006-Ohio-4560, 2006 WL 2535762, \u00b6 35. If an ambiguity is found to exist, courts may resolve it by considering statutes on the same or similar subjects. Id. at \u00b6 21; R.C. 149(D). In so doing, \u201ccourts should construe statutes relating to the same subject matter as consistent rather than inconsistent.\u201d Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>citing <em>Northwestern Ohio Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council v. Conrad </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 282, 297-289, 750 N.E.2d 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">{\u00b6 29} As set forth above, immediately preceding the phrase \u201cinclude, but are not limited to,\u201d R.C. 2929.28(A) states that the trial court \u201cmay sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions <em>authorized under this section.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Upon consideration, we find that this phrase is ambiguous as to whether the trial court is authorized to order appellant to pay costs of the OEC\u2019s investigation. To resolve this ambiguity, we must look to the language employed elsewhere in R.C. 2929.28, along with other statutes on the same or similar subjects.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">{\u00b6 30} First, an examination of R.C. 2929.28 reveals that the only specific authorization for disbursement of financial sanctions in misdemeanor cases is found in R.C. 2929.28(C)(1) and (2), which provide that sanctions collected pursuant to R.C. 2929.28(A)(3) are to be paid to the county or city treasurer for deposit into the general fund. As to the nature of such payments, pursuant to R.C. 2929.28(D), \u201ca financial sanction imposed under division (A) * * * is a judgment in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that imposed the financial sanction. * * * A financial sanction of restitution * * * is an order in favor of the victim of the offender\u2019s criminal act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">{\u00b6 31} In contrast, the OEC is an administrative agency, created by the Ohio legislature for the specific purpose of initiating and/or investigating complaints regarding the financial misconduct of public officials. R.C. 102.05. Pursuant to R.C. 102.06, if a complaint is found to be valid, the OEC is authorized to mediate, compromise, and/or settle claims with an accused. Pursuant to R.C. 102.02(G)(2), all money collected from such activities, or from fines and fees pursuant to R.C. 102.02(E) and (F),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is to be deposited into a fund, to be used exclusively \u201cfor expenses related to the operation and statutory functions of the [OEC].\u201d However, the OEC is not authorized by either R.C. 102.02 or 102.06 to receive court-ordered reimbursement for the cost of its investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">{\u00b6 32} Finally, in the Ohio Revised Code, the Ohio legislature has provided express authorization for reimbursement of investigative costs in particular types of cases. For example, R.C. 2923.32(B)(2)(c) provides for payment of the costs of investigation in cases involving violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act; R.C. 2929.71(D) states that in arson cases, the trial court \u201cshall order the offender, as part of the offender\u2019s sentence, to reimburse the [investigating] agencies from the offender\u2019s assets for all or a specified portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>their established costs\u201d; and R.C. 2913.40(F) allows the trial court to order an offender to pay the costs of investigating Medicaid fraud cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">{\u00b6 33} Upon consideration of the foregoing, we resolve the ambiguity in R.C. 2929.28 by holding that while the trial court is not expressly prohibited from ordering appellant to pay the costs of an OEC investigation, the statute does not give direct or implied authorization for the trial court to order appellant to pay such costs. Accordingly, the trial court abused its discretion when it deviated from the terms of the negotiated plea agreement by ordering appellant to pay a pro rata portion of the costs of the OEC\u2019s investigation in this case. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">{\u00b6 34} In her first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by ordering her to pay both the costs of the OEC\u2019s investigation and the costs of prosecution. In support, appellant argues that neither sanction is authorized by R.C. 2929.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">{\u00b6 35} As set forth in our determination as to appellant\u2019s third assignment of error, the trial court abused its discretion by deviating from the terms of the negotiated plea agreement and ordering appellant to pay the OEC\u2019s investigative costs. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first argument is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">{\u00b6 36} As to appellant\u2019s remaining argument, this court has recently held that R.C. 2947.23 requires the trial court to order the defendant to pay the costs of prosecution in all criminal cases, including misdemeanors. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>6th Dist. No. L-04-1221, 2006-Ohio-1406, 2006 WL 751348, \u00b6 54; <em>State v. Rohda, </em>6th Dist. No. F-06-007, 2006-Ohio-6291, \u00b6 13. Because the imposition of prosecutorial costs is mandatory, \u201c \u2018[t]he trial court is not required to hold a hearing or otherwise determine an offender\u2019s ability to pay before ordering him to pay costs.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State v. Riegsecker, </em>6th Dist. No. F-03-022, 2004-Ohio-3808, 2004 WL 1595723, \u00b6 10. However, such costs are limited to \u201cthose [expenses] directly related to the court proceedings * * <em>State v. Christy, </em>3d Dist. No. 16-04-04, 2004-Ohio-6963, 2004 WL 2940888, \u00b6 22.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">{\u00b6 37} Upon consideration of the foregoing, we hold that the trial court did not err or otherwise abuse its discretion by ordering appellant to pay the costs of prosecution in this case. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court abused its discretion by ordering her to pay those costs has no merit, and her first assignment of error is, therefore, not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>{\u00b6 38} In her second assignment of error, appellant asserts that the financial sanctions imposed by the trial court are an improper attempt to order her to pay \u201crestitution\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2929.28(A)(1). In support, appellant argues that the trial court did not follow the statutory prerequisites before making such an award. Similarly, in support of her fourth assignment of error, appellant argues that costs of the OEC\u2019s investigation are outside the scope of an award of restitution as contemplated in R.C. 2929.28(A)(1). In response, the state of Ohio asserts that \u201cthe trial transcript fails to mention the word \u2018restitution,\u2019 making it highly doubtful that the trial court intended any of its financial sanctions to be labeled as restitution.\u201d Because these two assignments of error are related, we will consider them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">{\u00b6 39} Pursuant to R.C. 2929.28(A)(1), financial sanctions imposed in misdemeanor cases may include \u201cRestitution by the offender to the victim of the offender\u2019s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the victim\u2019s economic loss.\u201d The amount to be repaid shall be determined by the trial court based on certain factors, which may include \u201cthe amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or receipts * * *, and other information.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">{\u00b6 40} A review of the record shows that the trial court made no reference to \u201crestitution,\u201d as described in R.C. 2929.28(A)(1), either before or after ordering appellant to pay the costs of investigation and prosecution in this case. In addition, the record contains no documentation to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that appellant\u2019s pro rata portion of such \u201ccosts\u201d amounts to $4,125. Finally, the record contains no evidence that reimbursement to the OEC for the cost of investigating the allegations against appellant would constitute reimbursement of economic loss to any particular victim, as that term has been defined by the General Assembly and applied to this prosecution under this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">{\u00b6 41} On consideration of the foregoing, we hold that the trial court\u2019s order for appellant to pay the costs of investigation and prosecution in this case does not amount to \u201crestitution\u201d as contemplated by R.C. 2929.28(A)(1). Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second and fourth assignments of error are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">{\u00b6 42} The judgment of the Toledo Municipal Court is hereby affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this decision and judgment entry. Because the record contains no documentation as to the actual costs of prosecution in this case, the trial court\u2019s proceedings on remand must include a determination as to what expenses were directly related to the cost of prosecuting this case against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>{\u00b6 43} Appellee, the state of Ohio, is hereby ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24.
