J.C. was placed in a police interview room. His mother waited outside the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">{\u00b6 3} After his mother\u2019s permission had been obtained, J.C. was interviewed by Dayton police detective William Swisher, who advised J.C. and his mother that J.C. was a suspect in a rape case involving an \u201cunknown female.\u201d Swisher asked J.C. if he knew which female Swisher was talking about, and J.C. answered, <em>\u201cYes.\u201d </em>J.C. explained that he encountered the female while he was babysitting his niece or cousin, and that the female was asleep on a couch. When she awoke, they conversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">{\u00b6 4} At that point, Detective Swisher interrupted J.C. and advised J.C. and his mother that he needed to advise J.C. of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. J.C.\u2019s mother consented and left the room. Swisher then read the <em>Miranda </em>rights to J.C. from a printed form. J.C. indicated his understanding of those rights and agreed to waive them, signing at the bottom of the form. The interview continued for an additional 40 minutes, during which J.C. made further statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>{\u00b6 5} J.C. was subsequently charged by a complaint filed in juvenile court with being a delinquent child in violation of R.C. 2152.02(F)(1), the basis of that charge being a violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), sexual conduct with a person who is less than 13 years of age and not the spouse of the offender. J.C. subsequently filed a Juv.R. 22(D)(3) motion to suppress any statements he made.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 6} The juvenile court granted the motion to suppress following a hearing. In its written decision, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe Court finds that the Juvenile was interviewed while in custody. The detective testified that he did not read the Juvenile his <em>Miranda </em>rights before advising the Juvenile that he was a suspect in a rape case and then asking him if he knew which female he was talking about. It is clear to the Court that the detective\u2019s question was not normally attendant to arrest and custody when he asked the Juvenile if he knew of the female victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe Court finds that it is well settled law that an incriminating statement made by a defendant during a \u2018custodial interrogation\u2019 is subject to suppression unless <em>Miranda </em>warnings are given <em>before </em>the statement is solicited. Under these circumstances, the Court concludes that the interview was a custodial interrogation. Accordingly, the Court believes that the Juvenile was entitled to receive the <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to being questioned. Therefore, the Court finds that all of the said Juvenile\u2019s statements were obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and should be suppressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cWith the above determinations, the Court hereby GRANTS the Motion to Suppress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 10} The state filed a timely notice of appeal from the suppression order.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe juvenile court committed error when it suppressed all of J.C.\u2019s statements without considering whether J.C.\u2019s voluntary responses to pre-Miranda questioning rendered his subsequent waiver of Miranda rights and post-Miranda statements involuntary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">{\u00b6 12} The state concedes that J.C. was in custody when he was interviewed by Detective Swisher and that <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>warnings and waivers were therefore required before interrogation commenced. The state does not contend that the statements J.C. made in response to the questions Detective Swisher asked him before <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given are admissible, and we agree with the juvenile court that they are inadmissible for a lack of prior <em>Miranda </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>warnings. Rather, the state argues that the failure did not render J.C.\u2019s subsequent <em>post-Miranda </em>statements likewise inadmissible, absent further findings that the trial court failed to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 13} The rule of <em>Miranda </em>has a prophylactic purpose: to avoid a suggestion of coercion arising from the custodial setting by showing that a defendant who made an inculpatory statement while in custody and in response to police interrogation had previously been made aware of his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, and that he waived those rights voluntarily. The showings create a presumption that the inculpatory statement was voluntary and therefore not a product of coercion prohibited by the Fifth Amendment. The presumption is nevertheless subject to rebuttal on a finding that a subsequent statement was the product of actual coercion or improper inducements. <em>State v. Petitjean </em>(2000), 140 Ohio App.3d 517, 748 N.E.2d 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\"> {\u00b6 14} Failure to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings when required creates a presumption of compulsion that renders any inculpatory statement a defendant made subject to suppression on a motion filed by the defendant. However, when the suspect\u2019s initial inculpatory statement, though technically in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>was voluntary, there is no warrant for presuming a coercive effect with respect to subsequent statements obtained pursuant to a knowing and voluntary waiver following <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Oregon v. Elstad </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 298, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222. In <em>Missouri v. Seibert </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 600, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643, the Supreme Court identified \u201ca series of relevant facts that bear on whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings delivered midstream could be effective enough to accomplish their object: the completeness and detail of the questions and answers in the first round of interrogation, the overlapping content of the two statements, the timing and setting of the first and the second, the continuity of police personnel, and the degree to which the interrogator\u2019s questions treated the second round as continuous with the first.\u201d 542 U.S. at 615, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">{\u00b6 15} On this record, the juvenile court erred when it presumed a coercive effect with respect to J.C.\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>statements arising from the inculpatory statements he made before <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given and J.C. waived the rights explained to him. On remand, the court may suppress J.C.\u2019s post-<em>Miranda </em>statements on account of his <em>pre-Miranda </em>interrogation, but only on findings that factors of the kind that <em>Seibert </em>identified rendered J.C.\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">{\u00b6 16} J.C. concedes that the court failed to make the inquiries <em>Seibert </em>suggests, but argues that the state waived any error because it failed to offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>evidence from which the court could have found that his pr <em>e-Miranda </em>interrogation did not taint J.C.\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">{\u00b6 17} Once the state offered evidence that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given and that J.C. waived the rights concerned, it became J.C.\u2019s burden, as proponent of the suppression remedy, to demonstrate that his waiver was tainted by his pre-<em>Miranda </em>interrogation and therefore was ineffective to waive his rights against self-incrimination. The state was not required to show that the pr <em>e-Miranda </em>interrogation did not taint the warnings or J.C.\u2019s waiver. In any event, there is evidence from which the required findings may be made, and the court\u2019s error in not making them was not waived by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">{\u00b6 18} The assignment of error is sustained. The order from which the appeal is taken is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b439-7\">Donovan and Valen, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b439-8\">Anthony Valen, J., retired, of the Twelfth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-13\">. <em>Miranda v.
