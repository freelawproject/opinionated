Semaan, M.D. and X-Ray, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jeffrey Wisser, D.O., and Lima Memorial Hospital. On appeal, Burden asserts that the trial court erred in granting partial summary judgment on his medical-negligence survivor-ship claim. Finding that Burden\u2019s medical-negligence survivorship claim against appellees was barred by the applicable statute of limitations, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">{\u00b6 2} The following general facts are undisputed. On November 24, 2003, Burden\u2019s former wife, Darlene Burden, underwent a left thyroid lumpectomy performed by Dr. Christopher R. Lucchese. Evaluation of the removed portion of Darlene\u2019s thyroid revealed the presence of cancer. Consequently, on December 15, 2003, Dr. Lucchese removed the remainder of Darlene\u2019s thyroid and authorized her to return home. Two days later Burden took Darlene to the emergency room at Lima Memorial Hospital, because she had difficulty swallowing and had increased swelling in her neck. Testing indicated that Darlene had a pocket of fluid and infection in her neck; thereafter, Darlene was admitted. During the morning of December 18, Dr. Lucchese aspirated Darlene\u2019s neck, removing 70 cc\u2019s of fluid. Subsequently, the build-up of fluid returned, Darlene had difficulty breathing, and she was taken to the radiology department for a CT-guided scan. While attempting to undergo the CT-guided scan, Darlene continued having difficulty breathing, became cyanotic, and went into cardiopulmonary arrest and coded. Responding medical personnel attempted unsuccessfully to intubate Darlene, and Dr. Malaya, a responding surgeon, performed an emergency tracheotomy. Darlene\u2019s pulse was regained, but she suffered brain damage from a lack of oxygen to her brain. On December 21, 2003, Darlene died after experiencing cardiac arrest as a result of the lack of oxygen to her brain and respiratory distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">{\u00b63} On April 1, 2005, Burden instituted medical-negligence survivorship (\u201cnegligence claim\u201d) and wrongful-death claims against Dr. Lucchese, d.b.a. Holistic Surgical Associates, Inc., and Lima Memorial. Subsequently, Burden amended his complaint to include additional information.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">{\u00b6 4} On December 19, 2005, Burden filed a second amended complaint, naming Dr. Wisser, as well as Dr. Semaan and X-Ray, Inc., as additional defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">{\u00b6 5} During his deposition, Burden testified that he did not review any of Darlene\u2019s medical records before the deposition; that Darlene had no troubles after her first thyroid surgery in November 2003; that, on December 15, 2003, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Darlene had a temperature of 101 degrees following her second thyroid surgery, was told she probably had the flu, and was released; that, on December 17, 2003, someone in the Lima Memorial emergency room told him that Dr. Wisser, who was on-call for Dr. Lucchese that evening, had been notified about Darlene\u2019s situation and would take care of it the next morning; that, when he returned to Lima Memorial the next morning, Darlene\u2019s swelling had worsened, she was having trouble breathing, and had to sit up to ease her breathing; that Darlene felt better after Dr. Lucchese drained the fluid from her neck; that the fluid and swelling in Darlene\u2019s neck returned a couple of hours after Dr. Lucchese had drained it; and that a nurse called Dr. Lucchese, who ordered an ultrasound-guided scan on Darlene\u2019s neck.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">{\u00b6 6} Burden continued that his daughter accompanied Darlene to the radiology department while he waited in the lobby; that Dr. Lucchese later arrived and stated that he wanted to do another surgery on Darlene\u2019s neck to see what was going on; that no one told him (Burden) about Darlene coding at that time; that he was later informed that Darlene had coded and had been deprived of oxygen; that his daughter told him Darlene had fought to sit up to get her breath in the radiology department, but medical personnel pushed her down to get her in the CT-scan machine; that he did not discuss the events his daughter described with any medical personnel; and that once Darlene had been stabilized after coding, he spoke with Dr. Malaya about the tracheotomy performed, but Dr. Malaya was not critical of the care rendered by anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">{\u00b6 7} Burden also testified that an infectious-disease doctor involved with Darlene\u2019s care, Dr. Ellis, informed him on December 21, 2003, that there was no excuse for her death because the tracheotomy could have been done earlier; that Dr. Ellis also had a conversation with one of Burden\u2019s sons and expressed criticism regarding the CT-scan procedure; and that he contacted an attorney, who is not his current attorney, because he \u201cjust didn\u2019t think things were right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">{\u00b6 8} In May 2006, June 2006, and August 2006, Dr. Semaan and X-Ray, Inc., Dr. Wisser, and Lima Memorial, respectively, moved for partial summary judgment regarding Burden\u2019s negligence claim, alleging that Burden failed to comply with the applicable statute of limitations, R.C. 2305.113(A). Each appellee attached a copy of Burden\u2019s amended complaint in support of the motion for partial summary judgment. Additionally, Lima Memorial attached affidavits from its director of risk management and its statutory agent, which provided that they did not receive a 180-day letter from Burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>{\u00b6 9} In September 2006, Burden filed his response to appellees\u2019 motions for partial summary judgment and attached his affidavit, in which he provided that he did not have any medical training or a medical background; that \u201cbecause [he] was curious about the treatment by Dr. Lucchese, [he] went to [his current attorney] in December, 2004\u201d; and that in the initial meeting, his attorney did not know whether a cause of action existed against Dr. Lucchese. Burden also included in his affidavit that in early 2005, his attorney indicated a basis existed to pursue a lawsuit against Lima Memorial and Dr. Lucchese; that after his attorney advised him, he believed that Lima Memorial and Dr. Lucchese negligently harmed Darlene; that he went to his attorney to \u201cfind out what to believe\u201d; that no one suggested the possibility of negligent treatment of Darlene within one year of her death; that Darlene was seen by two dozen specialists and medical professionals during November 2003 and December 2003; and that Dr. Wisser\u2019s and Dr. Semaan\u2019s roles were not known until Dr. Lucchese and Lima Memorial staff members were deposed in November 2005 and December 2005. Burden also attached a copy of Darlene\u2019s consent to surgery, which noted that death, bleeding, and infection were complications that could occur with any surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">{\u00b6 10} In September 2006, the trial court granted Dr. Semaan and X-Ray, Inc.\u2019s, Dr. Wisser\u2019s, and Lima Memorial\u2019s motions for partial summary regarding Burden\u2019s negligence claim, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">The Court finds that the \u201ccognizable event\u201d put [Burden] on notice to investigate the facts and circumstances relevant to [decedent\u2019s] claim in order to pursue [decedent\u2019s] remedies. See <em>Allison v. Pike Community Hospital, </em>4th District No. 05CA734, 2006-Ohio-1390[, 2006 WL 751571] and <em>Koerber v. Cuyahoga Falls General Hospital, </em>9th [District] No. 20516, 2001-Ohio-1365[, 2001 WL 1143211]. The \u201ccognizable event\u201d was the death of [decedent] on December 21, 2003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">[Burden] would contend in essence, that the cognizable event didn\u2019t occur until [he] was advised by his attorney after he had completed his investigation and review in 2005. If this logic applied, the statute of limitation would never start running until a potential claimant went to his attorney and the attorney completed his/her investigation. This, the Court finds, is an illogical and absurd result. Doctors/hospitals and other care providers would never know or have any finality as to claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">The Court would further note that the statute of limitations was not even extended as provided by the 180-day letter pursuant to R.C. 2305.113.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>[Burden\u2019s] complaint and amended complaints were therefore untimely and his causes of action are barred as a matter of law as it concerns the medical negligence claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">{\u00b6 11} It is from this judgment that Burden appeals, presenting the following assignment of error for our review:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">The trial court erred in granting partial summary judgment on plaintiffs medical negligence claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">{\u00b6 12} In his sole assignment of error, Burden asserts that the trial court erred when it granted partial summary judgment on his medical-negligence claim. Specifically, Burden contends that appellees failed to set forth sufficient evidence that he should have discovered the negligence cause of action sooner than he did; that death is not a per se cognizable event; and that the cognizable event occurred when his attorney completed his investigation and determined he had a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">{\u00b6 13} An appellate court reviews a summary judgment order de novo. <em>Hillyer v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 131 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 722 N.E.2d 108. Accordingly, a reviewing court will not reverse an otherwise correct judgment merely because the lower court utilized different or erroneous reasons as the basis for its determination. <em>Diamond Wine &amp; Spirits, Inc. v. Dayton Heidelberg Distrib. Co., </em>148 Ohio App.3d 596, 2002-Ohio-3932, 774 N.E.2d 775, at \u00b6 25, citing <em>State ex rel. Cassels v. Dayton City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 217, 222, 631 N.E.2d 150. Summary judgment is appropriate when, looking at the evidence as a whole (1) there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, (2) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, and, therefore, (3) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Civ.R. 56(C); <em>Horton v. Harwick Chem. Corp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 679, 686-687, 653 N.E.2d 1196. If any doubts exist, the issue must be resolved in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Murphy v. Reynoldsburg </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 356, 358-359, 604 N.E.2d 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>{\u00b6 14} The party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of producing some evidence that demonstrates the lack of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. In doing so, the moving party is not required to produce any affirmative evidence, but must identify those portions of the record that affirmatively support its argument. Id. at 292, 662 N.E.2d 264. The nonmoving party must then rebut with specific facts showing the existence of a genuine triable issue; it may not rest on the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings. Id.; Civ.R. 56(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 2305.113(A) provides that an action upon a medical claim \u201cshall be commenced within one year after the cause of action accrued.\u201d In the context of medical-malpractice actions, the Ohio Supreme Court has adopted the discovery rule in determining when a cause of action accrues. <em>Oliver v. Kaiser Community Health Found. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 111, 117, 5 OBR 247, 449 N.E.2d 438. Thus, a cause of action for a medical-malpractice claim does not accrue until either (1) the patient discovers or, in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence should have discovered, the resulting injury or (2) the physician-patient relationship for the condition terminates, whichever occurs later. <em>Akers v. Alonzo </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 422, 425, 605 N.E.2d 1, citing <em>Oliver, </em>5 Ohio St.3d 111, 5 OBR 247, 449 N.E.2d 438, at syllabus, and <em>Frysinger v. Leech </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 38, 512 N.E.2d 337, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>Hershberger v. Akron City Hosp. </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 1, 516 N.E.2d 204, the Ohio Supreme Court set forth a three-prong test to determine the accrual date of a medical-malpractice action under the discovery rule, which consists of the following factors: (1) when the injured party became aware, or should have become aware, of the extent and seriousness of the condition, (2) whether the injured party was aware, or should have been aware, that the condition was related to a specific professional service previously received, and (3) whether such condition would put a reasonable person on notice of the need to inquire into the cause of the condition. Id. at 5-6, 516 N.E.2d 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">{\u00b6 17} The Supreme Court further clarified how to determine the accrual date under the discovery rule by combining the <em>Hershberger </em>prongs and holding that the \u201cextent and seriousness of the condition\u201d used in <em>Hershberger </em>requires an occurrence of a \u201ccognizable event,\u201d which leads, or should lead, the patient to believe that the physical condition or injury complained of is \u201crelated to a medical procedure, treatment, or diagnosis previously rendered to the patient and where the cognizable event does or should place the patient on notice of the need to pursue his possible remedies.\u201d <em>Allenius v. Thomas </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 131, 133, 538 N.E.2d 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>{\u00b6 18} Moreover, there is no requirement that a patient \u201cmust be aware of the <em>full </em>extent of the injury before there is a cognizable event. It is enough that some noteworthy event, the \u2018cognizable event/ has occurred which does or should alert a reasonable person-patient that an improper medical procedure, treatment or diagnosis has taken place.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 133-134, 538 N.E.2d 93. An individual\u2019s belief that a medical professional erred is sufficient to notify the individual of the need to investigate the circumstances and pursue possible remedies. Id. at 134, 538 N.E.2d 93. Upon the occurrence of such a cognizable event, the plaintiff has a duty to (1) determine whether the injury suffered was the proximate result of malpractice and (2) ascertain the identity of the tortfeasors. <em>Flowers v. Walker </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 546, 589 N.E.2d 1284, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 19} Here, Burden argues that the trial court incorrectly found Darlene\u2019s death to be a per se cognizable event and that the true cognizable event occurred when his attorney completed the investigation and determined that he had a cause of action. In the context of medical-malpractice survivorship actions, some appellate courts have held that death is necessarily the cognizable event because a reasonable person is put on notice at that point that an injury has occurred. See <em>Estate of Glenn v. Lake Hosp. Systems, Inc. </em>(May 22, 1998), 11th Dist. No. 96-L-154, 1998 WL 386188; <em>Blakeman v. Condorodis </em>(1991), 75 Ohio App.3d 393, 398, 599 N.E.2d 776; <em>Singleton v. Suhr </em>(May 18, 1989), 8th Dist. No. 55367, 1989 WL 54383; <em>Kimball v. Akron Gen. Med. Ctr. </em>(June 8, 1988), 9th Dist. No. 13358, 1988 WL 61044. However, as the Ohio Supreme Court has explained, the discovery rule applies where \u201c \u2018the application of the general rule that a cause of action exists from the time the negligent act was committed would lead to the unconscionable result that the injured party\u2019s right to recovery can be barred by the statute of limitations before he is even aware of its existence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oliver, </em>5 Ohio St.3d at 113, 5 OBR 247, 449 N.E.2d 438, quoting <em>Wyler v. Tripi </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St.2d 164, 168, 54 O.O.2d 283, 267 N.E.2d 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 20} Accordingly, we decline to adopt a rule establishing death as a per se cognizable event in medical-negligence survivorship actions. Such an approach is consistent with the fairness and policy concerns expressed in <em>Hershberger </em>regarding medical-malpractice statutes of limitations that \u201cany beginning point for the statute of limitations which is based upon the date of an act or omission and/or physical manifestations of an injury * * * would require a claimant to immediately file suit against the physician whether or not the [claimant] had any reason to associate the physical injury with the prior act. Consequently, such standards encourage the filing of unfounded lawsuits.\u201d 34 Ohio St.3d at 5, 516 N.E.2d 204. Although death may well be the cognizable event in many survivorship actions, in some cases a party may not reasonably be aware that the decedent\u2019s death may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>have been the result of wrongful conduct until the occurrence of some event after the decedent\u2019s death, particularly where death is a common risk of the medical procedure undertaken by the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"> {\u00b6 21} However, we believe that Burden\u2019s argument that a cognizable event occurs when an attorney completes the investigation and determines that a cause of action exists goes too far. Indeed, <em>Hershberger </em>explicitly rejected this argument when it clarified the discovery rule, explaining that the \u201cconcept of \u2018legal injury\u2019 as initiating the running of the statute [of limitations] is also not without problems. Legal theories are ordinarily not within the province of the average layman. Furthermore, to utilize \u2018legal injury\u2019 might effectuate a complete undermining of the discovery rule since anyone could allege ignorance of his legal rights. * * * It is therefore the knowledge, actual or inferable, of <em>facts, </em>not legal theories, which initiates the running of the one-year statute of limitations.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) 34 Ohio St.3d at 5, 516 N.E.2d 204. Thus, the statute of limitations begins to run when, based on the factual circumstances, the injured party is put on notice of the need to pursue possible remedies and not when an attorney actually identifies the pertinent legal injury and remedy. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">{\u00b6 22} In the case sub judice, the trial court determined that the cognizable event triggering the accrual of the statute of limitations was Darlene\u2019s death. However, a review of the record indicates that the consent form for Darlene\u2019s surgery identified death, bleeding, and infection as risks of surgery; that Darlene developed an infection on her neck following her surgery, which caused swelling and constriction of her airway; and that the respiratory distress and lack of oxygen to her brain caused her cardiac arrest and death. Construing this evidence in a light most favorable to Burden, as we must, we cannot say that Darlene\u2019s death, by itself, should have put him on notice that malpractice had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">{\u00b6 23} However, we find that the combination of Darlene\u2019s death, Burden\u2019s daughter\u2019s recitation of the events that took place in the radiology department, Dr. Ellis\u2019s criticism of the CT procedure to Burden\u2019s son, as well as Dr. Ellis\u2019s statement, on the date of Darlene\u2019s death, that there was no excuse for her death because the tracheotomy could have been done earlier, constituted the cognizable event that should have put Burden on notice that an improper medical procedure had occurred. Whether Burden knew that the legal injury of \u201cnegligence\u201d might have occurred is not dispositive. Likewise, whether the medical records were accurate is relevant to the issue of negligence and not to whether Burden should have known that Darlene\u2019s death may have been caused by wrongdoing for the purposes of the statute of limitations, particularly considering Burden had not looked at the medical records prior to his deposition. Thus, we agree with the trial court, albeit for different reasons, that the applicable statute of limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>started accruing on the date of Darlene\u2019s death, December 21, 2003. Burden failed to initiate his negligence claim against appellees until 2005, after the one-year period under R.C. 2305.113 had expired. Therefore, we find that Burden\u2019s negligence claim against appellees was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">{\u00b6 24} Alternatively, Burden argues that appellees failed to set forth sufficient evidence that he should have discovered the negligence cause of action sooner than he did. However, as we noted above, the relevant inquiry was not when Burden should have discovered the negligence cause of action, but rather when he should have known to investigate the possibility of wrongdoing related to Darlene\u2019s death. Thus, appellees were not required to point to any evidence regarding Burden\u2019s discovery of a negligence cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">{\u00b6 25} Moreover, the party moving for summary judgment is not required to produce any affirmative evidence, but must identify those portions of the record that it believes affirmatively support its argument. <em>Dresher, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 292, 662 N.E.2d 264. Appellees attached Burden\u2019s complaint, Lima Memorial included affidavits, and Burden\u2019s deposition was submitted to the trial court, all of which are acceptable types of evidence for summary judgment purposes. See id. at 292-293, 662 N.E.2d 264; Civ.R. 56(C). Thus, we find that appellees complied with the requirements in Civ.R. 56(C) when they filed their motions for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">{\u00b6 26} Accordingly, we overrule Burden\u2019s assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">{\u00b627} Having found no error prejudicial to the appellant herein, in the particulars assigned and argued, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b250-10\">Preston and Willamowski JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-9\">. Burden filed suit against both Dr. Semaan individually, and his employer, X-Ray, Inc. However, since the parties refer to them collectively throughout as \"Dr. Semaan and X-Ray, Inc.,\u201d we elect to do the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b244-7\">. Dr. Semaan testified that he later called Dr. Lucchese and decided that a CT-guided scan would be more appropriate because it would be less intrusive to Darlene's wound.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b246-9\">. We note that Dr. Lucchese, d.b.a. Holistic Surgical Associates, Inc., did not file a motion for partial summary judgment prior to the trial court\u2019s September 2006 judgment entry and, accordingly, is not involved in this appeal. Additionally, we note that Dr. Wisser questioned whether the trial court\u2019s September 2006 judgment entry constituted a final appealable order given that Burden\u2019s wrongful-death claim was still pending. We find that the trial court\u2019s September 2006 judgment entry was a final appealable order and that we have jurisdiction over this appeal. See, e.g., <em>Walker v. Firelands Community Hosp., </em>6th Dist. No. E-06-023, 2006-Ohio-2930, 2006 WL 1580038, \u00b6 17-20, discussing <em>State ex rel. Wright </em>v. <em>Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 82, 661 N.E.2d 728 (claims that arise from the same set of facts, but involve different rights and relief, are separate and independent for purposes of determining whether a final appealable order exists).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
