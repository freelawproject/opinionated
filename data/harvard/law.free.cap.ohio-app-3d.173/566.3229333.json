According to the complaint, appellant \u201cbecame very outraged during a scheduled meeting\u201d with the principal of Stewart School, William Keaton. The complaint further alleged that \u201cMs. Bean stated to said principal William Keaton T don\u2019t give a fuck about this building, I\u2019m coming back, ya\u2019ll haven\u2019t heard the last from me yet\u2019 \u201d and that appellant \u201ccontinued to yell obscenities in front of students and office personnel and her behavior was threatening as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-16\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant entered a plea of not guilty and the matter proceeded to a bench trial. William Keaton, principal of Stewart School, an all-girls public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>school, testified that appellant requested a meeting with him, assistant superintendent Bob Clark, and two teachers in order to address her dissatisfaction with administrative and grading decisions for her two daughters, both students at the school. Joyce Brown, a school security officer, and Julie Rodecker, a school secretary, also testified for the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">{\u00b6 3} The meeting was held in an empty classroom on a floor that contained first and second grade classes. Keaton testified that the meeting \u201cwas terminated because of Ms. Bean\u2019s behavior during the meeting. It, it became \u2014 it was, got out of control with her actions, her behavior and her profanity. She got up in the meeting and cursed, said she didn\u2019t give a fuck about this place, slammed the door during school. I had to adjourn the meeting for the safety of the kids and watch out for the well being of the building and our little girls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">{\u00b6 4} After appellant exited the meeting, having slammed the door, she then, according to Keaton, \u201cwalked down the hall using profanity.\u201d Keaton followed appellant down the hallway, closing doors to other classrooms, because \u201cteachers were coming to [their] doors. They didn\u2019t know what was going to happen or what was going on. You could see fear on first and second graders\u2019 faces.\u201d Keaton radioed Browne, the security officer, notified her that appellant was coming her way, and asked her to call the police because \u201cI didn\u2019t know her [appellant\u2019s] next move.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">{\u00b6 5} Browne testified that appellant approached her as she walked down the hallway \u201cyelling and screaming\u201d: \u201cI want to get my kids the fuck out of this school.\u201d Browne told appellant to stop using \u201cprofanity\u201d in the school. She followed appellant into the school office, where several children were sitting; Browne then heard appellant say, in the office, \u201cI\u2019m tired of kids picking on mine in school. I\u2019m getting them the [fuck] out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">{\u00b6 6} Rodecker, the school secretary, testified that she heard appellant coming down the hallway, \u201cvery loud and obscene,\u201d but she could not recall what exact words appellant used. She said that once the police were called, appellant left the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant\u2019s version of events differs: She testified that Bob Clark scheduled the meeting because she \u201cneeded Jesus in her life.\u201d She admitted that she had become extremely upset because, in the meeting, a teacher refused to talk to her; appellant told the attendees that she was leaving and would come back with a lawyer. Someone in the meeting then said, according to appellant, \u201cif you\u2019re so unhappy with where your children are attending school, why don\u2019t you remove them.\u201d Appellant left the meeting, and, as she walked down the hallway, encountered Brown and one \u201cMiss Regan.\u201d She told Browne and Regan that she was transferring her children to another school; then, she \u201cwalked over to the office to look for the secretary where I can get two out of district transfers, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Bob Clark told me to go get and put in.\u201d Appellant denied screaming or yelling \u201cfuck\u201d or any other curse words, although she did admit to being \u201cloud\u201d and walking loudly in the hallway.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court found appellant guilty of violating the Safe School Ordinance and imposed a sentence of 30 days\u2019 incarceration, suspended, a fine of $100, also suspended, and costs. Appellant appealed and now raises three assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c1. Appellant\u2019s profanity did not rise to the level of \u2018fighting words\u2019 and thus was protected speech guaranteed under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and analogous provisions of the Ohio Constitution; the ordinance is unduly vague and overbroad in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and analogous provisions of the Ohio Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c2. The trial court erred when it denied Bean\u2019s motion for a continuance in order to subpoena an eyewitness who would testify for the defense; such a ruling was violative of Bean\u2019s right to compulsory process as guaranteed to her by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and analogous provisions of the Ohio Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c3. There is insufficient evidence in the record to convict Bean for having violated the safe school ordinance; the conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">{\u00b6 12} Toledo Municipal Code 537.16 provides: \u201cAssault upon a teacher; disrupting school activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(a) No person shall * * * disrupt, disturb or interfere with the teaching of any class of students, or disrupt, disturb or interfere with any activity conducted in a school * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(b) Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-12\">{\u00b6 15} Appellant argues that the Safe School Ordinance is vague on its face by analogizing to cases involving disorderly conduct, noting that a person cannot be convicted of disorderly conduct based simply on spoken words. She also argues that since the ordinance does not define \u201cdisrupt, disturb or interfere,\u201d it does not give notice of what conduct is illegal. In response, the city argues that school grounds are unique areas, allowing greater regulation of behavior, and that a person of common intelligence \u201cshould realize\u201d that conduct like appellant\u2019s would \u201cdisturb and disrupt\u201d elementary school activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-13\">{\u00b6 16} The void-for-vagueness doctrine is founded in the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. <em>Buckley v. Wilkins, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 350, 2005-Ohio-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>2166, 826 N.E.2d 811, \u00b6 17. \u201cLaws must \u2018give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly,\u2019 and laws must also \u2018provide explicit standards\u2019 for the police officers, judges, and jurors who enforce and apply them.\u201d Id., quoting <em>Grayned v. Rockford </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 104, 108-109, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222. A municipality has an obligation \u201cto frame its criminal statutes so that those to whom they are addressed may know what standard of conduct is intended to be required.\u201d <em>Cline v. Frink Dairy Co. </em>(1927), 274 U.S. 445, 458, 47 S.Ct. 681, 71 L.Ed. 1146. An ordinance that \u201ceither forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates the first essential of due process of law.\u201d <em>Connally v. Gen. Constr. Co. </em>(1926), 269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 70 L.Ed. 322. It must inform persons what conduct on their part will render them criminally liable. <em>Columbus v. Thompson </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St.2d 26, 30, 54 O.O.2d 162, 266 N.E.2d 571. A criminal law is also vague and violative of due process if it fails to \u201ccontain ascertainable standards of guilt.\u201d <em>State v. McDonald </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 47, 31 O.B.R. 155, 509 N.E.2d 57, citing <em>Winters v. New York </em>(1948), 333 U.S. 507, 515, 68 S.Ct. 665, 92 L.Ed. 840. \u201c \u2018The dividing line between what is lawful and unlawful cannot be left to conjecture.\u2019 \u201d <em>Columbus v. Thompson, </em>25 Ohio St.2d at 30, 54 O.O.2d 162, 266 N.E.2d 571, quoting <em>Connally, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>Euclid v. Moore </em>(Dec. 9, 1999), 8th Dist. No. 75143, 1999 WL 1129580, a mother had repeatedly walked her tardy son into his first-grade classroom instead of reporting to the office and obtaining a visitor\u2019s pass. The mother was told several times to abide by the school policy of signing in at the office during school hours; notices ordering visitors to report to the office were posted on entry doors; a Euclid police officer had previously responded to reports of the mother disturbing class and had given her a verbal warning. The first-grade teacher testified that the interruptions were disruptive, although she kept teaching and did not ask the mother to leave. The mother was charged and convicted of violating Euclid Ordinance 537.24(a), a statute nearly identical in wording to Toledo Municipal Code 537.16. The Euclid statute reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cNo person shall assault, strike, threaten or menace a teacher, instructor, professor, person in charge of a class of students or any employee of any school, college or university while in the performance of their duties, and no person shall disrupt, disturb or interfere with the teaching of any class of students, and no person shall disrupt, disturb or interfere with any activity conducted in a school, college or university building, or upon the campus or grounds thereof, or in any public place * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>{\u00b6 19} In finding the ordinance unconstitutionally vague, the Eighth District Court of Appeals took a different tack. Following <em>Grayned v. Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222, and <em>State v. Schwing </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 295, 71 O.O.2d 288, 328 N.E.2d 379, the court found it could avoid striking down the ordinance by construing it to require a showing of both \u201cwillful conduct\u201d and \u201cconduct which either causes the class to terminate in an untimely manner or substantially impairs the conduct of the classroom.\u201d Applying these requirements to the facts, it concluded that the city had presented insufficient evidence that the mother\u2019s acts were willful and that she caused a substantial impairment in the conduct of the classroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Grayned, </em>a similar municipal ordinance prohibiting disrupting school activity was found constitutional because, although (as appellant argues) the \u201cquantum of disturbance\u201d was not specified, it required that \u201c(1) the \u2018noise or diversion\u2019 be actually incompatible with normal school activity; (2) there be a demonstrated causality between the disruption that occurs and the \u2018noise or diversion\u2019; and (3) the acts be \u2018willfully\u2019 done.\u201d <em>Grayned, </em>408 U.S. at 113, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222. These requirements saved the ordinance from vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">{\u00b6 21} Likewise, in <em>Schwing, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court found former R.C. 3761.11, which prohibited disturbing a lawful meeting, unconstitutionally vague. That statute was repealed and replaced with R.C. 2917.12, which now prohibits acts done \u201cwith purpose to prevent or disrupt a lawful meeting, procession, or gathering * * Following <em>Schwing, </em>R.C. 2917.12 has been construed to require a showing that the disruption was \u201csubstantial,\u201d meaning \u201cmajor, consequential, effective or significant,\u201d \u201cof considerable quantity or dimension, or of solid effect.\u201d <em>State v. Brand </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 460, 2 OBR 556, 442 N.E.2d 805, paragraph two of the syllabus. Only conduct that \u201ceffectively impairs, interferes with or obstructs the due conduct of the meeting in a major, consequential, significant or considerable manner\u201d is prohibited. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">{\u00b6 22} <em>Euclid v. Moore, </em>supra, correctly applied the requirements of <em>Grayned </em>and <em>Schwing </em>because, if at all possible, a court must \u201capply all presumptions and pertinent rules of construction\u201d to uphold the constitutionality of an ordinance. <em>State v. Dorso </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 60, 61, 4 OBR 150, 446 N.E.2d 449. \u201cA legislative body need not define every word it uses in an enactment.\u201d Id., citing <em>Kiefer v. State </em>(1922), 106 Ohio St. 285, 139 N.E. 852. Where the word \u201cdisturb\u201d is used, it must be construed to exclude subjective sensitivities and to use an objective standard. For example, the term \u201cdisturb\u201d in antinoise ordinances requires a showing that the amplification \u201ccould be anticipated to offend the reasonable person, i.e., the individual of common sensibilities.\u201d Id., following <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire </em>(1942), 315 U.S. 568, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>573, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031. Also, the term \u201cdisturb\u201d cannot encompass actions or behavior that is merely \u201cannoying,\u201d as that term runs the risk of suppressing otherwise protected speech and engendering arbitrary enforcement. <em>Dorso, </em>4 Ohio St.3d at 63, 4 OBR 150, 446 N.E.2d 449, citing <em>Coates v. Cincinnati </em>(1971), 402 U.S. 611, 613, 91 S.Ct. 1686, 29 L.Ed.2d 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">{\u00b6 23} Applying these rules, the Safe School Ordinance is not vague for its use of the terms \u201cdisrupt\u201d and \u201cdisturb\u201d as they entail an objective test. <em>State v. Brand </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 460, 2 OBR 556, 442 N.E.2d 805, paragraph two of the syllabus. However, following the reasoning of <em>Euclid v. Moore, </em>supra, we are also required to construe the ordinance as proscribing only \u201cwillful\u201d disturbances. See also <em>State v. Cornwell, </em>149 Ohio App.3d 212, 2002-Ohio-5178, 776 N.E.2d 572, \u00b6 16 (\u201cStatutes that prohibit \u2018disturbing the peace\u2019 are construed, if possible, to apply only to conduct that is actually intended to create a disturbance * * * \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">{\u00b6 24} Since the Safe School Ordinance must be judicially construed to apply only to willful acts done with intent to disturb, disrupt, or interfere with school activity and that actually cause a substantial disruption, disturbance, or interference with school activity, objectively measured, the ordinance is not unduly vague and is constitutionally definite. <em>Dorso, </em>4 Ohio St.3d at 61, 4 OBR 150, 446 N.E.2d 449, citing <em>United States v. Harriss </em>(1954), 347 U.S. 612, 618, 74 S.Ct. 808, 98 L.Ed. 989. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is therefore not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">{\u00b6 25} In appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, appellant contends that the court erred in denying her a continuance so she could subpoena a defense witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">{\u00b6 26} It is well settled that \u201c[t]he grant or denial of a continuance is a matter which is entrusted to the broad, sound discretion of the trial judge. An appellate court must not reverse the denial of a continuance unless there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Unger </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 65, 67, 21 O.O.3d 41, 423 N.E.2d 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">{\u00b6 27} The record shows that on the day of trial, appellant asked for a continuance so she could subpoena Regan, a school employee who was present the day appellant went to the school. The trial court denied appellant\u2019s request. Following appellant\u2019s testimony, her counsel asked that the record reflect that he wanted to subpoena Regan but that the trial court had denied his motion for a continuance so he could do so. The trial court noted that, according to the testimony, Browne was with Regan during the incident and that counsel was able to thoroughly cross-examine her. Nevertheless, the trial court allowed appellant\u2019s counsel to proffer her testimony that she was present the day of the incident and that she did not hear appellant utter any obscenities. Taking into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>consideration the inconvenience a continuance granted during trial would cause and given the fact that the trial court allowed counsel to proffer Regan\u2019s testimony, we do not find that the judge abused her discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">{\u00b6 28} Next, we address the third assignment of error. We must determine whether appellant\u2019s conviction for violating the ordinance was supported by sufficient evidence of a willful intent to substantially disrupt a school activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">{\u00b6 29} When reviewing a sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim, the relevant inquiry is whether any rational factfinder, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the state, could have found all the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Jones </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 417, 739 N.E.2d 300, citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, and <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201cOn review for sufficiency, courts are to assess not whether the state\u2019s evidence is to be believed, but whether, if believed, the evidence against a defendant would support a conviction.\u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 390, 678 N.E.2d 541 (Cook, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">{\u00b6 30} In criminal law, the term \u201cwillful\u201d is synonymous with \u201cpurposeful.\u201d \u201cPurpose is defined in terms of a specific intention either to cause a certain result, or to engage in conduct of a certain nature regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish through that conduct.\u201d R.C. 2901.22(A), 1973 Legislative Service Commission Notes. Absent an admission, proof of a defendant\u2019s purpose or specific intent invariably requires circumstantial evidence. <em>State v. Mundy </em>(1994), 99 Ohio App.3d 275, 288, 650 N.E.2d 502. \u201cCircumstantial evidence is the \u2018proof of facts by direct evidence from which the trier of fact may infer or derive by reasoning other facts in accordance with the common experience of mankind.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Henry, </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-1061, 2005-Ohio-3931, 2005 WL 1806462, at \u00b6 33, quoting <em>State v. Bentz </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 352, 355, 2 OBR 408, 442 N.E.2d 90. Circumstantial evidence and direct evidence inherently possess the same probative value. <em>State v. Jenks, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">{\u00b6 31} The trier of fact in this case heard evidence that after appellant expressed her displeasure at the closed door meeting, she proceeded down a hallway loudly yelling obscenities. The trier of fact heard evidence that appellant continued to walk through the school yelling obscenities even after a school security officer told her to stop. Witnesses testified that as appellant proceeded down the hallway, teachers were hastily forced to close their classroom doors and comfort some of the fearful children. It was no doubt obvious to appellant as she walked through the school that school was in session and that children were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>present. This evidence, if believed, shows that appellant engaged in more than a brief emotional outburst. Rather, this evidence points to a deliberate decision on appellant\u2019s part to disturb the school. Accordingly, we find that there was sufficient evidence of a willful intent to substantially disrupt a school activity from which, when viewed in a light most favorable to the state, a rational trier of fact could have found appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of violating the Safe School Ordinance. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">{\u00b6 32} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Toledo Municipal Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b605-7\">Pietrykowski, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b605-8\">Skow, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
