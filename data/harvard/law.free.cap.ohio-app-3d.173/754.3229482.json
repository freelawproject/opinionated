Bryant, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">{\u00b6 1} Appellant, U.S. Technology Corporation (\u201cUST\u201d), appeals from a judgment of the Environmental Review Appeals Commission (\u201cERAC\u201d) dismissing appellant\u2019s appeal from the September 11, 2006 letter that a district representative of the Division of Hazardous Waste Management, Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cOEPA\u201d), mailed to appellant. Appellant assigns a single error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-12\">The September 11, 2006 correspondence from the Ohio EPA to U.S. Technology Corporation concluding that Ohio law was violated was a final action appealable to the Environmental Review Appeals Commission (\u201cERAC\u201d) pursuant to ORC 3745.04.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">Because the September 11, 2006 correspondence is not an action appealable to ERAC, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">{\u00b6 2} On September 11, 2006, Melody Stewart, a district representative from OEPA\u2019s Division of Hazardous Waste Management, sent a certified-mail letter to UST\u2019s attorney. The\u2019 letter responded to information that UST had provided to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>OEPA in an August 10, 2006 meeting convened to discuss OEPA\u2019s July 10, 2006 letter addressing UST\u2019s disposal of hazardous waste. In the September 11 letter, Stewart advised of her visits to various construction sites and her conclusion that \u201call of the information received during the site visits was accurate and that block was used in a manner constituting disposal as previously discussed in the July 10, 2006 letter[.] * * * Ohio EPA will continue to monitor U.S. Technology for compliance with all of Ohio\u2019s hazardous waste laws and regulations as found under the Ohio Revised Code (ORC) and the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">{\u00b6 3} On October 6, 2006, UST filed an appeal to ERAC. In it, appellant contended that the OEPA, Division of Hazardous Waste Management, had wrongfully determined that UST had violated R.C. 3734.02(E) and (F) and had wrongfully imposed on UST additional responsibilities and obligations that had caused UST great hardship. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, claiming ERAC lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of the appeal because the September 11, 2006 letter from OEPA is not a final, appealable action of the director.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">{\u00b6 4} After allowing appellant to respond, and relying on a body of decisions it has issued, ERAC determined that the letter (1) \u201cevinces details of an interactive process engaged in by the parties to resolve an ongoing matter\u201d and (2) \u201cis clearly not independently enforceable on its face.\u201d As a result, ERAC concluded that Stewart\u2019s letter did not adjudicate \u201cwith finality any legal right or privilege held by UST.\u201d Persuaded that the letter did not constitute a final act or action of the director that was appealable to ERAC, ERAC granted the director\u2019s motion to dismiss. Appellant appeals, contending that the letter is a final action subject to review before ERAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">{\u00b6 5} Pursuant to R.C. 3745.04, \u201c[a]ny person who was a party to a proceeding before the director may participate in an appeal to the environmental review appeals commission for an order vacating or modifying the action of the director * * Ohio R.C. 3745.04 further defines \u201caction\u201d to include (1) \u201cadoption, modification, or repeal of a rule or standard,\u201d (2) \u201cthe issuance, modification or revocation of any lawful order other than an emergency order,\u201d (3) \u201cthe issuance, denial, modification or revocation of a license, permit, lease, variance, or certificate,\u201d or (4) \u201cthe approval or disapproval of plans and specifications pursuant to law or rules adopted thereunder.\u201d In drafting R.C. 3745.04, the General Assembly chose to illustrate rather than define an appealable action and thus gave ERAC jurisdiction over acts beyond those delineated in the statute. <em>Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. v. Schregardus </em>(1997), 123 Ohio App.3d 476, 704 N.E.2d 589, quoting <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Maynard </em>(1984), 22 Ohio App.3d 3, 6, 22 OBR 37, 488 N.E.2d 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>{\u00b6 6} \u201cERAC has recognized that an action of the Ohio EPA may occur even when the action has been taken or triggered by an employee of the Ohio EPA rather than the director.\u201d <em>Dayton Power, </em>123 Ohio App.3d at 478, 704 N.E.2d 589, citing <em>Aristech, Chem. Corp. v. Shank </em>(July 25, 1989), EBR No. 441977. In <em>Aristech, </em>the EBR, now known as ERAC, \u201cfurther noted that the question whether a particular event or a particular document constitutes an action of the agency is a question of fact that must be determined by the board based upon the surrounding circumstances,\u201d including the substance and form of the letter. <em>Dayton Power </em>at 478-479, 704 N.E.2d 589. Quoting from <em>Inorganic Recycling of Ohio, Inc. v. Shank </em>(Nov. 30, 1989), EBR No. 252011, <em>Dayton Power </em>noted that \u201c \u2018[i]n determining whether or not the event or document in question is an appealable action, one of the issues the Board must determine is whether or not the event or document in question determines or adjudicates with finality any legal rights and privileges of the appealing party or parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dayton Power, </em>at 479, 704 N.E.2d 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">{\u00b6 7} Initially, several factors are pertinent in addressing the form of the September 11 letter. As ERAC noted, (1) the OEPA director did not sign the letter, (2) the letter does not identify itself as a final action, (3) the letter does not notify UST of its appeal rights, and (4) the letter does not suggest that it was entered into the director\u2019s journal as a final action. We thus agree with ERAC that the letter, in form, is not a final action. UST rightly notes, however, that the letter nonetheless may constitute final action if in substance it finally adjudicates UST\u2019s legal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">{\u00b6 8} The September 11 letter initially refers to an August 10, 2006 meeting between Ohio EPA and UST \u201cto discuss Ohio EPA\u2019s July 10, 2006 letter.\u201d At that meeting, UST \u201cprovided information to Ohio EPA to address the findings discussed in Ohio EPA\u2019s July 10, 2006 letter.\u201d Having completed her review of the information UST provided, Stewart responded with her September 11 letter, stating that it was \u201cin the same format as [UST\u2019s] August 10, 2006 letter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">{\u00b6 9} According to the September 11 letter, \u201cOhio EPA conducted the construction site visits to verify compliance\u201d with Ohio\u2019s regulations and laws regarding hazardous waste. As the letter explained, \u201cOhio EPA used the monthly reports that U.S. Technology was required to submit per the Director\u2019s Final Findings &amp; Orders dated June 17, 2004 to determine which sites to visit.\u201d From the monthly reports, the Ohio EPA was able to determine the customer name, address, the number of blocks sold and the type of block, either above or below grade. Because the monthly reports were clear about what type of block was used at each construction site, the Ohio EPA visited the sites to confirm the information with the site representative. Based on the site visits, Ohio EPA concluded that \u201cabove-grade-only block was used below grade and was used in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>manner constituting disposal as originally stated in the July 10, 2006 letter.\u201d The letter then sets forth four proposals regarding packing labels, direct sales to customers, distributor training, and product literature that UST was to adopt to rectify the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">{\u00b6 10} The letter concludes by stating, \u201cOhio EPA believes that all of the information received during the site visits was accurate and that block was used in a manner constituting disposal as previously discussed in the July 10, 2006 letter. Ohio Revised Code 3734.02(E) and (F), Prohibitions will not be withdrawn as requested in your August 10, 2006 letter.\u201d In what appears to be a reference to the four proposals, the letter advises that the \u201cviolation was abated\u201d in Ohio EPA\u2019s earlier correspondence that \u201coutlined a proposal which UST should have already implemented.\u201d The letter further advises that \u201cOhio EPA will continue to monitor U.S. Technology for compliance with all of Ohio\u2019s hazardous waste laws and regulations as found under the Ohio Revised Code (ORC) and the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC).\u201d The last sentence of the letter states that \u201c[i]f you should have any questions with this letter, please feel free to contact me,\u201d specifying the number where Stewart could be reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">{\u00b6 11} A number of factors persuade us to conclude that the September 11 letter is not a final action. Initially, the letter refers to an August 10 meeting that not only provided UST and OEPA the opportunity to discuss Ohio EPA\u2019s July 10, 2006 letter and the findings contained in it, but also afforded UST the occasion to provide information to Ohio EPA to address the issues raised in the July 10 letter. Following the August 10, 2006 meeting, Stewart conducted on-site visits to verify the information provided and to determine compliance with Ohio\u2019s applicable environmental laws, advising of her observations in the September 11 letter. The letter was thus the latest in a series of meetings and letters addressing issues between UST and OEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">{\u00b6 12} Based on the visits, Stewart advised that the July 10, 2006 letter accurately concluded that UST was using above-grade only block below-grade and in a manner constituting disposal of hazardous waste. In effect, if not directly, Stewart advised that UST was violating Ohio hazardous-waste-disposal laws, and she followed with four proposals set forth in earlier OEPA correspondence. As a result, the four proposals were nothing new to UST, but a reiteration, following on-site visits, of steps already submitted for UST to undertake in order to correct the deficiencies Stewart noted. Indeed, the preSeptember 11 letters, outlined a <em>proposal </em>that U.S. Technology should have already implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">{\u00b6 13} In the final analysis, the September 11, 2006 letter confirms (1) OEPA\u2019s conclusion that the information conveyed in its July 11, 2006 letter was accurate and (2) the proposed steps that OEPA hoped UST would implement. To further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>support the conclusion that the letter is not meant as a final adjudication, it concludes by advising that OEPA will continue to monitor UST\u2019s compliance with Ohio\u2019s applicable environmental laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">{\u00b6 14} UST nonetheless contends that the letter should be deemed a final adjudication because OEPA advised UST\u2019s clients of UST\u2019s violations, causing UST to be \u201ctaken out of specifications on particular jobs for its products,\u201d to lose \u201cincome as a result of said Ohio Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s * * * advice\u201d and \u201cto change its marketing, labeling, training\u201d of its product to satisfy OEPA. While nothing in the record supports UST\u2019s contention, we note that OEPA\u2019s September 11 letter specifies that UST filed monthly reports providing customer names and addresses, as well as the number and type of block sold through UST\u2019s customers. According to the September 11 letter, the filings were submitted pursuant to the director\u2019s final findings and orders of June 17, 2004. UST cannot be surprised that OEPA knows who UST\u2019s customers are or that OEPA would visit the site of some of UST\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">{\u00b6 15} UST nonetheless contends that OEPA\u2019s actions here replicate the same actions that caused a remand to the board for a hearing in <em>Dayton Power, </em>123 Ohio App.3d 476, 704 N.E.2d 589. In that case, however, the information about Dayton Power was published in an MSL report, a report designed \u201cto provide interested persons with a quick reference to property known or suspected to be contaminated from the management of hazardous waste in Ohio.\u201d Id. at 479, 704 N.E.2d 589. In <em>Dayton Power, </em>no one disputed \u201cthat government officials and businesses rely on the listings in the MSL when evaluating property.\u201d Id. Nothing of such finality occurred here. Rather than publish its conclusions in a widely disseminated annual report, OEPA visited the necessary sites to verify the information UST provided and discussed the matter with various personnel at the sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">{\u00b6 16} In the final analysis, OEPA\u2019s function as a regulatory agency requires it to advise a company if OEPA believes the company is violating Ohio\u2019s environmental laws. To do otherwise would be an abdication of OEPA\u2019s responsibilities under those laws. By notifying a company of OEPA\u2019s observations and discussing the issues, OEPA maintains informal discourse with the company in an effort to determine whether agreement can be reached about potential violations and the remedies to rectify them. If the company disagrees with OEPA\u2019s recommendations, it need not abide by them, but in all likelihood, it can expect a statement of violations. The interim step, however, of advising and investigating does not rise to the level of a final action. Because ERAC properly concluded that the September 11, 2006 letter \u201cevinces details of an interactive process engaged in by the parties to resolve an ongoing matter,\u201d the letter is not a final action under R.C. 3745.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s single assignment of error and affirm the judgment of ERAC dismissing appellant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b790-5\">Sadler, P.J., and T.
