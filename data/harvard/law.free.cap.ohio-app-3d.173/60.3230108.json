For the reasons that follow, we affirm the conviction and modify the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant was found guilty in 1995 of aggravated assault and sentenced to three to five years in prison. He served his time and completed the terms of his probation. In July 2003, the victim of appellant\u2019s assault, Anthony Payne, who had been in a vegetative state since the assault, died. In January 2004, appellant was charged with involuntary manslaughter in violation of R.C. 2903.04. Appellant filed a motion for an expert witness at the state\u2019s expense, which the trial court denied. Appellant thereafter pleaded no contest and the court sentenced him to seven years in prison, with credit for 1,437 days served from the prior assault conviction. Appellant appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment denying him an expert witness at the state\u2019s expense. This court found that the trial court abused its discretion by denying appellant\u2019s motion and remanded for a new trial. <em>State v. Sellers, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 85611, 2005-Ohio-6010, 2005 WL 3030913.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">{\u00b6 3} On remand, the trial court raised appellant\u2019s bond from $25,000 to $200,000. This court granted appellant\u2019s writ of habeas corpus and reinstated the original bond of $25,000. <em>State ex rel. Sellers v. McFaul, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 87866, 2006-Ohio-1936, 2006 WL 1029953.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">{\u00b6 4} Prior to trial, the court granted the state\u2019s motion to apply collateral estoppel so that the jury could be informed that the state had already proven most of the involuntary-manslaughter elements in the 1995 trial and, therefore, did not need to prove all of the elements in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>{\u00b6 5} At trial, defense counsel objected to the state publishing the autopsy photographs of Payne to the jury, prior to their admission into evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The state presented three witnesses on its behalf: Payne\u2019s mother, the investigating detective, and Dr. Erica Armstrong, Chief Deputy Coroner in the Cuyahoga County Coroner\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">{\u00b6 6} Dr. Armstrong testified that a blunt impact to Payne\u2019s head injured his brain and caused him to be in a persistent vegetative state. Dr. Armstrong also testified in regard to the toxicology report prepared in conjunction with the autopsy of Payne, noting that Payne had morphine in his system. She further testified that Payne had pneumonia at the time of his death, and she stated that the cause of death was \u201cacute bronchopneumonia, due to remote blunt impact to head with skull and brain injury.\u201d Dr. Armstrong explained that a series of complications, including infections and the pneumonia, were linked to the head injury Payne suffered and that was the basis of her conclusion as to the manner of death, i.e., homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">{\u00b6 7} Dr. Armstrong testified that she also reviewed two reports from appellant\u2019s expert, Dr. Donald Schaffer. She noted that in Dr. Schaffer\u2019s first report, he agreed with her finding that Payne\u2019s death was caused by \u201cacute bronchopneumonia due to remote blunt impact to head with skull and brain injury.\u201d Dr. Armstrong noted that Dr. Schaffer, however, rendered a second report three months later, in which, as she summarized, he opined that the cause of death was a morphine overdose. Dr. Armstrong testified that in his second report, Dr. Schaffer misstated the level of morphine, finding it to be 117 milligrams per liter. Dr. Armstrong testified, however, that the correct level of morphine was 117 nanograms per liter, a thousand times less than the amount relied on by Dr. Schaffer in his second report. According to Dr. Armstrong, 117 nanograms per liter was not a lethal dose of morphine, but 117 milligrams per liter would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">{\u00b6 8} At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case, the defense made a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal, which was denied. The defense presented the testimony of Dr. Schaffer and appellant. Dr. Schaffer admitted that in his first report he agreed with Dr. Armstrong\u2019s finding as to Payne\u2019s cause and manner of death. Dr. Schaffer testified that after he wrote his first report, he reviewed further records (i.e., the toxicology reports) and admitted that he made an error in reading them. In particular, Dr. Schaffer acknowledged that the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>morphine in- Payne\u2019s system was not in the \u201cmassive dosages\u201d but was \u201ca substantial dosage\u201d that would \u201chave to be listed as contributing cause of death.\u201d The morphine level in Payne\u2019s system was noted as a contributing cause of death in Dr. Schaffer\u2019s second report.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">{\u00b6 9} At the conclusion of its case, the defense renewed its Crim.R. 29 motion, which was again denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">{\u00b6 10} In his first assignment of error, appellant contends that he was denied a fair trial because of the \u201cstructural error\u201d caused by the \u201cbiased judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cStructural error\u201d is an error that \u201c \u2018transcends the criminal process\u2019 by depriving a defendant of those \u2018basic protections [without which] a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence, and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, quoting <em>Rose v. Clark </em>(1986), 478 U.S. 570, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460. Trial by a biased judge has been cited as one of the very limited examples of structural error. Id. Judicial bias is \u201ca hostile feeling or spirit of ill will or undue friendship or favoritism toward one of the litigants or his attorney, with the formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge, as contradistinguished from an open state of mind which will be governed by the law and the facts.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt </em>(1956), 164 Ohio St. 463, 58 O.O. 315, 132 N.E.2d 191, paragraph four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">{\u00b6 12} In support of his bias claim, appellant first cites another claim of bias that was brought against the trial judge. As the claim involves a totally different case, we will not consider it as part of appellant\u2019s claim in this case. Further, in that case, <em>State v. Wilbon, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82934, 2004-Ohio-1784, 2004 WL 743881, this court found the claim unsubstantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant also relies on this court\u2019s reversing the trial judge\u2019s decision denying his motion for an independent expert at the state\u2019s expense and raising his bond. Upon consideration thereof, we do not find that the trial court\u2019s ruling and action on these matters constituted a \u201chostile feeling or spirit of ill will\u201d so as to amount to bias or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">{\u00b6 14} Appellant further argue's that the trial judge\u2019s behavior toward counsel during trial demonstrated her prejudice or bias. First, appellant claims that counsel was \u201cchastised\u201d for introducing himself to a witness. The exchange was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-11\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cQ. Dr. Armstrong, I\u2019m Donald Gallick, I represent Joseph Sellers. I don\u2019t think we have met, but we have spoken on the phone at least once. I don\u2019t know if you remember or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe Court: Was there a question there, or were you asking her to answer a question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cMr. Gallick: No, your Honor, I was just introducing myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe Court: I\u2019ll scratch that from the record then and instruct the jury to disregard it and ask the counsel not to colloquy, but ask a question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">{\u00b6 19} Upon review, we do not find that the above demonstrated a \u201chostile feeling or spirit of ill will\u201d so as to amount to bias or prejudice. The court simply told defense counsel to ask the witness a question rather than \u201ccolloquy with\u201d the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">{\u00b6 20} Appellant next alleges that the judge prevented counsel from asking Dr. Armstrong why she did not correct a numerical mistake involving the toxicology report. Upon review, the transcript does not reflect that counsel was prevented from asking such a question. Counsel was questioning Dr. Armstrong about Dr. Schaffer\u2019s, the defense expert\u2019s, misinterpretation of data in Dr. Armstrong\u2019s report. Counsel asked Dr. Armstrong when she had first learned of the misinterpretation, the assistant prosecuting attorney objected to the form of the question, and the court sustained the objection. Defense counsel then rephrased the question and Dr. Armstrong answered it.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">{\u00b6 21} Appellant further argues that the trial court prevented his witness (Dr. Schaffer) from approaching the state\u2019s dry erase board to comment on numbers Dr. Armstrong put on the board. The record indicates, however, that Dr. Schaffer was able to see the board and testify as to the numbers written on it by Dr. Armstrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">{\u00b6 22} Appellant also contends that the trial court allowed the state to call two witnesses, Harriet Thomas (Payne\u2019s mother) and Detective Johnstone, to testify about the 1995 facts, but he was not allowed to so testify when he took the stand. Thomas did not testify to specifics regarding the 1995 facts. She testified that she was only aware of where Payne was going on the day of the incident (without any details) and the next time she saw him he was in a coma. In regard to Detective Johnstone\u2019s testimony, on direct examination, the state simply elicited testimony that he was assigned to the case the day after the incident and that appellant was arrested in connection with it. It was on cross-examination that defense counsel got into the specific facts of the incident, eliciting testimony from Johnstone that Payne had used a bottle and broomstick as weapons against appellant. When appellant testified, he stated that Detective Johnstone\u2019s testimony about the bottle and broomstick being used against him was accurate. Therefore, it was the defense, not the state, that elicited testimony about the 1995 facts. Moreover, appellant confirmed that Detective Johnstone\u2019s testimony about the facts was accurate and, therefore, there was no prejudice to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>{\u00b6 23} Finally, in this first assignment of error, appellant claims that further evidence of the trial judge\u2019s bias was demonstrated during sentencing, when the court increased his sentence. We address this issue in appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">{\u00b624} Based on the above, we do not find that the trial judge displayed hostility or ill will toward appellant or his counsel, so as to deprive appellant of a fair trial. The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">{\u00b6 25} In his second assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court violated his due process rights by denying defense counsel access to the record to make timely, specific objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">{\u00b6 26} Appellant cites <em>Cleveland v. Buckley </em>(1990), 67 Ohio App.3d 799, 588 N.E.2d 912, in support of his argument. In <em>Buckley, </em>the trial court prevented counsel from making legal arguments and objections on the record from the close of evidence until the jury returned its verdict. The defendant moved for a new trial and wanted to put objections and make legal arguments on the record as to why the motion should have been granted. This court found the trial court\u2019s actions to be an abuse of discretion because it violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial and it hindered this court\u2019s task of determining whether the defendant did in fact receive a fair trial. Id. at 811, 588 N.E.2d 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">{\u00b6 27} Here, the trial court did not deny counsel access to the record; it restricted access to the record during certain times. Specifically, the court did not allow objections to be made during opening statements or the reasons for an objection to be placed on the record at the time the objection was made, unless it determined it necessary. At the close of presentation of evidence, the court then allowed the parties to place any objections and legal argument they wished to make on the record. The court explained its procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cAnd it is also in every trial I preside over the Court\u2019s prerogative to at the side bar conference make a determination whether or not you need a record right at that moment. I always allow counsel to make their record, and I always allow counsel ample opportunity to proffer any exceptions they may have to any of the Court\u2019s rulings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-10\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cThe way it works is this: This Court does not take speaking objections in the presence of the jury. Should the Court need some edification, I\u2019ll ask you to approach. If you\u2019re at the trial table and I need just a little bit of edification, I may state grounds and ask you to briefly do that. If I need further edification I will do that at side bar. If the Court needs to make a record over a ruling, the Court would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-11\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cShould defense counsel or the State of Ohio move to make a record simply because you disagree with the Court\u2019s ruling, that would be called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>proffering an exception, and I do not hold up the jury while we do that. That\u2019s why I gave them extra time for lunch and I allow counsels [sic] to proffer objections and make a full and complete record at that time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">{\u00b6 31} With the exception of objections made during opening statements, the court appeared to have allowed counsel to make timely objections on the record. We do not find that the court erred by generally restricting the time at which counsel could elaborate on objections. In regard to not allowing counsel to object during opening statement, we find that under the circumstances of this case, the trial court did err, however. The record indicates that counsel objected to the assistant prosecuting attorney publishing the autopsy photos to the jury because the defense was going to object to their admissibility. The court explained that it did not entertain defense counsel\u2019s objection because \u201cthey are not actually evidence and admitted into evidence until such time as the Court rules upon their admissibility. If they are admissible, then I send them into the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">{\u00b6 32} The problem with the court\u2019s procedure, given the circumstances of this case, is that it allowed the photos, without being admitted into evidence, to be published to the jury. In essence, this court\u2019s concern is more with the trial court allowing the photos to be shown to the jury prior to their being admitted into evidence than with the fact that the record does not reflect the defense\u2019s objection at the time it occurred (since the record reflects elsewhere that counsel timely objected). The photos ultimately were admitted into evidence, but had they not been, it would have been prejudicial to appellant for the jury to have seen them. However, because we find that the photos were properly admitted, the court\u2019s error was harmless. See Crim.R. 52(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">{\u00b6 33} Based on the above analysis, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">{\u00b6 34} In his third assignment of error, appellant argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of involuntary manslaughter because the length of time between the assault and the death was over eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">{\u00b6 35} Crim.R. 29(A) governs motions for acquittal and provides for a judgment of acquittal \u201cif the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction * * *.\u201d \u201cAn appellate court\u2019s function in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. A verdict will not be disturbed on appeal unless reasonable minds could not reach the conclusion reached by the trier of fact.\u201d <em>State v. Watts, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82601, 2003-Ohio-6480, 2003 WL 22861978, citing <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>574 N.E.2d 492. \u201cSufficiency is a test of adequacy.\u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386-387, 678 N.E.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">{\u00b6 36} Under this standard, an appellate court does not conduct an exhaustive review of the record or a comparative weighing of competing evidence, or speculate as to the credibility of any witnesses. Instead, the appellate court presumptively \u201cview[s] the evidence in light most favorable to the prosecution.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201c[T]he weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of witnesses are primarily for the trier of the facts.\u201d <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">{\u00b6 37} R.C. 2903.04 governs involuntary manslaughter and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c(A) No person shall cause the death of another or the unlawful termination of another\u2019s pregnancy as a proximate result of the offender\u2019s committing or attempting to commit a felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">{\u00b6 39} Appellant was previously convicted of a felony, i.e., aggravated assault, in connection with this incident. The issue, therefore, in this case was whether the state presented sufficient evidence that the injuries inflicted on Payne by appellant were the proximate cause of his death. We are not persuaded by appellant\u2019s argument that the gap in time between the assault and Payne\u2019s death rendered the evidence insufficient to sustain his involuntary-manslaughter conviction. In the case appellant relies on, <em>State v. Bynum </em>(1942), 69 Ohio App. 317, 24 O.O. 86, 43 N.E.2d 636, the medical testimony as to the cause of death of the victim, who died 188 days after the defendant assaulted him, was that the death was a \u201cpossible result\u201d of the assault, or that the death \u201cmight have resulted\u201d or \u201ccould have resulted\u201d from the assault. Here, the testimony was not uncertain. Specifically, Dr. Armstrong testified that Payne died as a result of \u201cacute bronchopneumonia, due to remote blunt impact to head with skull and brain injury.\u201d That testimony alone was sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s involuntary-manslaughter conviction. Moreover, appellant\u2019s expert, Dr. Schaffer, agreed with Dr. Armstrong\u2019s finding as to the cause of death. While Dr. Schaffer claimed that morphine played a \u201ccontributing role\u201d in the death, he did not contest the gap in time or the causal connection between the manner of death and the cause of death. Accordingly, more than sufficient evidence existed to sustain appellant\u2019s involuntary-manslaughter conviction and his third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">{\u00b6 40} For his fourth assignment of error, appellant argues that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence, maintaining that the cause of death was a lethal dose of morphine in 2003, not the 1995 assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>{\u00b6 41} In a manifest-weight analysis, an appellate court \u201creview[s] the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and * * * resolve[s] conflicts in the evidence.\u201d <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541. \u201cA court reviewing questions of weight is not required to view the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, but may consider and weigh all of the evidence produced at trial.\u201d Id. at 390, 678 N.E.2d 541 (Cook, J., concurring). An appellate court may not merely substitute its view for that of the jury, but must find that \u201cthe jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u201d Id. at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541. See, also, id. at 390, 678 N.E.2d 541 (Cook, J., concurring) (stating that the \u201cspecial deference given in a manifest-weight review attaches to the conclusion reached by the trier of fact\u201d). Accordingly, reversal on manifest-weight grounds is reserved for \u201cthe exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u201d Id. at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">{\u00b6 42} We are not persuaded by appellant\u2019s argument that Dr. Schaffer\u2019s testimony regarding the level of morphine in Payne\u2019s system at his time of death demonstrates that the jury clearly lost its way. Dr. Schaffer admitted that in his first report he agreed with Dr. Armstrong\u2019s finding as to Payne\u2019s cause of death. Dr. Schaffer testified that after he wrote his first report, he reviewed further records and made an error in reading them. In particular, Dr. Schaffer acknowledged that the amount of morphine in Payne\u2019s system was not in the \u201cmassive dosages\u201d but was \u201ca substantial dosage\u201d that would \u201chave to be listed as contributing cause of death.\u201d Dr. Schaffer then wrote a second report in which he opined that level of morphine in Payne\u2019s system was a contributing cause of death. Dr. Schaffer never testified that the morphine was a superseding cause of death; he claimed only that it played a \u201ccontributing role\u201d in the death.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">{\u00b6 43} Moreover, Dr. Armstrong testified that a blunt impact to Payne\u2019s head injured his brain and caused him to be in a persistent vegetative state. Dr. Armstrong also testified in regard to the toxicology report prepared in conjunction with the autopsy of Payne, noting that Payne had morphine in his system. She further testified that Payne had pneumonia at the time of his death and stated that the cause of death was \u201cacute bronchopneumonia, due to remote blunt impact to head with skull and brain injury.\u201d Dr. Armstrong explained that a series of complications, including infections and the pneumonia, were linked to the head injury Payne suffered and that was the basis of her conclusion as to the manner of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">{\u00b6 44} Therefore, the conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence, and appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>{\u00b6 45} For his fifth and final assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court improperly sentenced him to a term of incarceration greater than previously imposed as punishment for filing an appeal and exercising his right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">{\u00b6 46} Appellant has been sentenced on three separate occasions for this incident. The first sentence was after the 1995 bench trial for aggravated assault and was for three to five years. Appellant served his sentence and completed parole. Appellant was then sentenced a second time to seven years after the 2003 involuntary-manslaughter indictment and subsequent no-contest plea. He was given 1,437 days (i.e., four years) of credit for time already served. That conviction, however, was reversed by this court in 2005. After the conviction in this case, appellant was sentenced to eight years with credit for time served. Neither the sentencing entry nor transcript indicate whether the credit is for time served for the 1995 sentence or the 2004 sentence. Appellant alleges that based on the record, it is not clear whether he was sentenced to an additional one year or an additional five years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In any event, for the reasons that follow, we modify appellant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">{\u00b6 47} In <em>Alabama v. Smith </em>(1989), 490 U.S. 794, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 104 L.Ed.2d 865, the Unites States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cWhile sentencing discretion permits consideration of a wide range of information relevant to the assessment of punishment, see <em>Williams v. New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 245-249, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949), we have recognized it must not be exercised with the purpose of punishing a successful appeal. <em>[North Carolina </em>v.] <em>Pearce </em>[ (1969) ] 395 U.S. [711, 723-725, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656]. \u2018Due process of law, then, requires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial.\u2019 Id., at 725[, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656]. \u2018In order to assure the absence of such a motivation, we have concluded that whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for him doing so must affirmatively appear.\u2019 Id. at 726[, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656]. Otherwise, a presumption arises that a greater sentence has been imposed for a vindictive purpose \u2014 a presumption that must be rebutted by \u2018objective information * * * justifying the increased sentence.\u2019 <em>Texas v. McCullough, </em>475 U.S. 134, 142[, 106 S.Ct. 976, 89 L.Ed.2d 104] (1986) (quoting <em>United States v. Goodwin, </em>457 U.S. 368, 374[, 102 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>S.Ct. 2485, 73 L.Ed.2d 74] (1982)).\u201d <em>Smith, </em>490 U.S. at 798-799, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 104 L.Ed.2d 865.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">{\u00b6 49} The sentence of seven years issued after appellant\u2019s no-contest plea was imposed after a full sentencing hearing and <em>pre-State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, findings. In view of the lengthy history of this case, and because there are no reasons in the record justifying the increased sentence, we find it prudent to vacate this sentence and simply impose the original sentence pursuant to our authority under R.C. 2953.08(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">{\u00b6 50} The conviction is affirmed; the sentence is modified to seven years with credit for time served for the aggravated assault and this incarceration. The trial court is ordered to issue an entry forthwith reflecting this modification and forward same to the Ohio Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Judgment affirmed as modified.</p>\n<judges id=\"b102-7\">Cooney, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b102-8\">Gallagher, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-12\">. No error was alleged by appellant as to this ruling. This decision does <em>not </em>affirm the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel in this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\">. The trial court did not allow objections made during opening statements to be put on the record at the time the objection was attempted to be made. The record reflects, however, that defense counsel objected during the state\u2019s opening statement because the assistant prosecuting attorney published the photos to the jury. At the close of the state's case, the trial court afforded defense counsel an opportunity to state his objection on the record in regard to the photos.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\">. We take judicial notice that, contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has in fact calculated appellant\u2019s credit, which includes the aggravated assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b102-9\">Sean C. Gallagher, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aoz\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">{\u00b6 51} I concur fully with the judgment and analysis of the majority. Nevertheless, I write separately to address two concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">(\u00b6 52} First, I believe the trial court may have been justified in increasing the sentence, but the record does not offer any explanation as to why the sentence was changed following the previous appeal. Had the trial court explained the increase, the presumption of vindictiveness might well have been overcome. This court recently outlined the standard regarding vindictive sentences in <em>State v. Glover, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 88317, 2007-Ohio-2122, 2007 WL 1290165, when we held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-12\">A trial court violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when it resentences a defendant to a harsher sentence when motivated by vindictive retaliation. <em>North Carolina v. Pearce </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 711, 724, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656. A presumption of vindictiveness arises when the same judge resentences a defendant to a harsher sentence following a successful appeal. Id. However, that presumption does not apply when the resentencing judge is different than the original sentencing judge. <em>State v. Douse, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82008, 2003-Ohio-5238, 2003 WL 22251444, citing <em>State v. Gonzales, </em>151 Ohio App.3d 160, 2002-Ohio-4937, 783 N.E.2d 903, \u00b6 25; <em>Lodi v. McMasters </em>(1986), 31 Ohio App.3d 275, 277, 31 OBR 603, 511 N.E.2d 123.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>{\u00b6 53} Second, I have serious concerns about the practice of appellate courts resentencing offenders following appeals where error is found. I acknowledge that appellate courts have the authority pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(G) to modify a sentence, and in this instance, because of judicial economy, I agree with my colleagues\u2019 decision to modify the sentence imposed as outlined in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">{\u00b6 54} Nevertheless, the fact that appellate courts have the authority to modify a sentence does not mean it is always in the best interest of justice to exercise that authority. I strongly believe that the trial courts are in the best position to correct errors in sentencing. The record in this case can best be described as \u201cmurky,\u201d and while I agree with my colleagues\u2019 decision to modify the sentence to the term originally imposed, a remand would allow the trial court the opportunity to clarify the appellant\u2019s sentence regarding credit for time served and to address the presumption of vindictiveness.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
