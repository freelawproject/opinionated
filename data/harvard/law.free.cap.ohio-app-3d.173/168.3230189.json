Painter, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">{\u00b6 1} In America, people are presumed innocent unless tried and convicted. In this case, the defendant was tried and <em>found not guilty, </em>but continues to suffer punishment in the form of a criminal arrest record. This we cannot allow.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">{\u00b6 2} In October 2002, Brian Garry (known as Brian Crum before a legal name change) was charged with hitting a police horse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a trial spread over parts of four days, he was found not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">{\u00b6 3} Garry applied for expungement of his arrest record in 2005 and again in 2006. Though Garry was clearly eligible for expungement \u2014 and the state did not object \u2014 the trial court both times denied the expungement. From the 2006 denial, Garry appeals, seeking to clear his record.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">{\u00b6 4} Garry is now 42 years old and has no criminal record before or since the 2002 incident. We think it is time to wipe this one arrest clean, so we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">{\u00b6 5} Expungements in cases where there have been not-guilty findings should be freely granted, and the court \u201cshall\u201d grant the sealing of the record unless the \u201clegitimate needs, if any, of the government to maintain those records\u201d outweigh the former defendant\u2019s interest in clearing his record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, the government expressed no need for, or interest in, maintaining the record. Nonetheless, the trial court denied the expungement.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">{\u00b6 6} The state, now seeking to preserve the trial court\u2019s judgment, cites us to <em>State v. Schwartz, </em>in which this court upheld the denial of the expungement of a not-guilty finding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The case is hardly similar \u2014 it involved a not-guilty-by-reason-of-insanity finding, in a case where the defendant had tried to commit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>suicide. The state was understandably seeking to keep that information available to law enforcement. But we fail to see how the finding that Garry did not hit a horse can be of any future benefit to law enforcement. And even if there were some benefit, which there obviously is not, it does not outweigh Garry\u2019s interest in clearing his record of a charge <em>that he was acquitted of.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">{\u00b6 7} When people are found not guilty, they have not lost the presumption of innocence. The government must then make a strong showing to defeat the sealing of a \u201cnot guilty\u201d finding. There was no showing at all here. To deny the sealing of the record in this case, where the government has not expressed or demonstrated any need to maintain it, is unreasonable and thus an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">{\u00b6 8} We reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand this case for the entry of an order sealing Garry\u2019s record.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b200-8\">SUNDERMANN, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b200-9\">Hildebrandt, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-15\">.

Because this court, absent an abuse of discretion, may not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">{\u00b6 10} Here, the trial court determined that keeping a record of these criminal proceedings, which involved a physical assault, would protect officer safety in the future and that this need outweighed Garry\u2019s interest in clearing his record. As the state noted, police officers have contact with individuals under a wide range of circumstances, and if police are permitted to review an individual\u2019s record prior to confronting that person, this will serve to promote officer safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">{\u00b6 11} Even if I would have ruled differently on Garry\u2019s application for expungement, I am unable to say that the trial court abused its discretion, and I would therefore be bound to affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b200-14\">. 1st Dist.
