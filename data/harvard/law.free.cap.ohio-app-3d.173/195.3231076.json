Painter, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b226-20\">{\u00b6 1} While he stood inside the Queen Ann Grill &amp; Bar, Robert Carter was shot several times by another patron. Carter survived and sued. The case turns on whether a shooting is an assault. We hold that it is, and affirm the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\n<em>I. Everybody Sues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">{\u00b6 2} Carter and his family sued the bar\u2019s owner, Wilbar Enterprises, L.L.C., and several of the bar\u2019s employees. The Carters also sued William Waxier, the president and sole shareholder of Wilbar, and two of Waxler\u2019s other business entities, Perfect Printing, Inc., and Wilbar Grille, L.L.C. The shooter, one Jones, was not sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">{\u00b6 3} Wilbar\u2019s insurer, Scottsdale Surplus Lines Insurance Company, refused to defend against the Carters\u2019 action. Wilbar then filed a third-party complaint against Scottsdale, asserting claims of bad faith and breach of contract. Wilbar also sought a declaration that Scottsdale owed it a duty to defend against the allegations in the Carters\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">{\u00b6 4} Scottsdale counterclaimed against Wilbar, seeking a declaration that no coverage existed under its commercial general-liability policy because of the policy\u2019s assault-and-battery exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">{\u00b6 5} Wilbar and Scottsdale both moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment for Scottsdale, holding that Scottsdale had no duty to defend or indemnify Wilbar under the policy\u2019s assault-and-battery exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">{\u00b6 6} In a single assignment of error, Wilbar now argues that the trial court erred in overruling its summary-judgment motion and in granting summary judgment for Scottsdale.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">\n<em>II. Summary-Judyment Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">{\u00b6 7} We review a grant of summary judgment de novo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Summary judgment should be granted only if (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come only to a conclusion adverse to the nonmoving party, when viewing the evidence in favor of the nonmoving party.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">\n<em>III. Review of an Insurance Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">{\u00b6 8} When interpreting an insurance contract, a reviewing court must give effect to the intent of the parties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A court must examine the contract as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>whole and look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the language in the policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the language of the policy is clear, a court must look no further than the policy itself to determine the intent of the parties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Any exclusion within an insurance contract must be interpreted to apply only to what is clearly intended to be excluded.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\n<em>IV. Duty to Defend</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cAn insurer\u2019s duty to defend is broader than and distinct from its duty to indemnify.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> An insurer may bring a declaratory-judgment action to determine its duty to defend or indemnify its insured in an action brought by a third party.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\"> {\u00b6 10} An insurer\u2019s duty to defend may arise solely from the allegations of the underlying complaint.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If the complaint states a claim that is potentially or arguably within the policy coverage, an insurer must assume the defense of the action against its insured.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But if the conduct alleged in the complaint is indisputably outside the scope of coverage, there is no duty to defend.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\n<em>V. The Scottsdale Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">{\u00b6 11} In its policy, Scottsdale agreed that it would \u201cpay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking those damages. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>we will have no duty to defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking damages for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance does not apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">{\u00b6 12} The policy included an \u201cassault and/or battery\u201d exclusion, which specifically excluded from coverage any injury arising from the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c1. Assault and/or Battery committed by any insured, any employee of any insured, or any other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c2. The failure to suppress or prevent Assault and/or Battery by any person in 1. above;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c3. The selling, serving or furnishing of alcoholic beverages which results in an Assault and/or Battery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c4.

Retention by a person for whom any insured is or ever was legally responsible and whose conduct would be excluded by paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 above.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">VI. <em>A Shooting Is An Assault \u201cAndlOr\u201d Battery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-16\">{\u00b6 22} Wilbar concedes that, under the criminal law, assault and battery would encompass the use of a firearm. But Wilbar argues that Carter\u2019s injuries did not arise from an \u201cassault\u201d or \u201cbattery\u201d as a layperson would understand those terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-17\">{\u00b6 23} To give the reader a better understanding of Wilbar\u2019s argument, we quote directly from its brief: \u201cThe plain and ordinary meaning of the term assault and battery to a layperson, however, would encompass a physical attack on another without the use of a firearm. Thus, under the naturally and commonly accepted use of the term assault and battery, the exclusion should not apply insofar as a <em>common </em>usage of the term assault and battery does not encompass the use of a firearm where one individual shoots another individual at a distance of several feet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-18\">{\u00b6 24} According to Wilbar\u2019s reasoning, if Carter\u2019s injuries had resulted from a fistfight, rather than from a close-range multiple shooting, then Carter could be said to have been assaulted or battered \u2014 but the assailant\u2019s use of a firearm instead of his fists meant that he neither \u201cassaulted\u201d nor \u201cbattered\u201d Carter. To so rule would be to indulge in pure pettifoggery.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>{\u00b6 25} In his deposition testimony, Robert Carter testified that he was at the Queen Ann when a man named Jones, standing about six feet away from him, aimed a black handgun and fired two shots at him without warning or provocation. Carter testified, \u201cFired two shots. He fired \u2014 I remember getting hit on the first shot. The first shot in my heart I remember getting hit and I grabbed my chest. I remember getting hit. After that I just heard gun shots. I just remember falling down over there on the table that\u2019s over toward the door.\u201d In all, Carter suffered eight bullet wounds. Under any definition of the words, an \u201cassault\u201d and \u201cbattery\u201d occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">{\u00b6 26} Because the record demonstrates that Carter\u2019s gunshot wounds were the result of an assault and battery, the policy\u2019s assault-and-battery exclusion precluded coverage for any claims arising from the injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\n<em>VIL The Derivative Claims Are Also Barred</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">{\u00b6 27} Wilbar argues that because the allegations in the Carters\u2019 complaint had potentially stated a claim within the policy\u2019s coverage, Scottsdale was obligated to provide a defense. Specifically, Wilbar points to the Carters\u2019 claims that it had negligently (1) failed to warn of the risk of injury; (2) hired, trained, or supervised its security personnel; and (3) provided inadequate security. Wilbar contends that the policy\u2019s assault-and-battery exclusion did not apply to exclude coverage for allegations based upon negligent security, failure to warn, or failure to provide reasonable security measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">{\u00b6 28} But the plain language of the exclusion precluded coverage for injury arising from an assault or battery (\u201cand/or\u201d should never be used<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>), without regard to who committed the assault or battery, or to whether the insured\u2019s service of alcohol contributed to the conduct. The exclusion also barred coverage for injuries sustained as a result of the insured\u2019s failure to suppress or prevent an assault or battery by any person.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">{\u00b6 29} Under the clear language of the policy\u2019s assault-and-battery exclusion, Scottsdale was not liable for injuries arising from an assault or battery, or from the failure to suppress or prevent an assault or battery. Even though the complaint contained allegations of negligent hiring, failure to warn, and failure to provide adequate security, coverage under the policy was barred because the excluded act of assault and battery was the immediate cause of the injuries that gave rise to the allegations of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">{\u00b6 30} We addressed a similar issue in <em>Schneider v. Northland Ins. </em>Co.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In that case, a bar patron\u2019s alleged injuries directly arose from an assault and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>battery by a bar employee. We held that an assault-and-battery exclusion in an insurance policy exempted an insurer from liability for its insured\u2019s alleged negligence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">{\u00b6 31} Other Ohio courts have recognized that an assault-and-battery exclusion operates to bar coverage for a claim that an insured negligently allowed an assault to occur. For example, in <em>Sphere Drake Ins. Co. v. Ross, </em>a bar patron sued the bar for injuries resulting from an assault and battery committed by the bar\u2019s security staff.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Ninth Appellate District held that the clear language of an assault-and-battery exclusion within the bar\u2019s general-liability insurance policy precluded coverage for the patron\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court reasoned that the patron\u2019s claim for negligent hiring and supervision of its employees did not give rise to coverage because the patron\u2019s injuries had resulted directly from an assault and battery by the bar\u2019s staff.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">{\u00b6 32} Similarly, in <em>Essex Ins. Co. v. Mirage on the Water, Inc., </em>the Eighth Appellate District held that an assault-and-battery exclusion obviated any duty on the part of the insurer to defend against or to cover any damages that arose from an altercation at a nightclub.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">{\u00b6 33} In this case, the plain language of the exclusion precluded coverage for any claims arising from the shooting of Carter and for any derivative claims of negligence. Because the conduct alleged in the complaint was indisputably outside the scope of coverage, Scottsdale had no duty to defend or indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">{\u00b6 34} Accordingly, we hold that the trial court properly entered judgment in favor of Scottsdale. We overrule the assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b231-9\">Sundermann and Cunningham, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-14\">.
