She further contends that the trial court erred by failing to consider the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur when determining whether to render summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">{\u00b6 2} Swayze grounded her motion for summary judgment upon the narrow factual predicate that the alleged thief who stole Hurchanik\u2019s identity was not a patient and had never been in Swayze\u2019s medical offices. Hurchanik successfully rebutted this factual contention when she averred that she could identify the person who entered the examining room as she was leaving as the person who, as it was later determined, had stolen her identity. As a result, Swayze failed to establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the trial court erred by rendering summary judgment in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b791-11\">{\u00b6 3} On December 8, 2004, Dottie Hurchanik had a medical appointment with Colleen Swayze, M.D.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hurchanik claims that during her appointment, her personal information was stolen from her medical file by another patient. According to Hurchanik, some days after the appointment, she was alerted by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>anonymous call that \u201ca pregnant girl named Angela\u201d had accessed Hurchanik\u2019s file while at Swayze\u2019s office and that Angela had used the information contained in the file to obtain telephone service in Hurchanik\u2019s name. Hurchanik claims that the anonymous caller gave her Angela\u2019s address as well as the telephone number obtained in Hurchanik\u2019s name. Hurchanik personally confirmed that a telephone account had been set up in her name with Cincinnati Bell. Hurchanik alerted Cincinnati Bell\u2019s fraud department and the Butler County Sheriffs Department. Thereafter, Hurchanik filed suit against Swayze, Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, Inc., and Cincinnati Bell, as well as several other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">{\u00b6 4} During discovery, it was determined that a woman named Angela Johnson had used Hurchanik\u2019s name to set up a telephone account with Cincinnati Bell. Angela Johnson was identified as an African-American, and there was information indicating that she had been pregnant at the time the account was set up.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">{\u00b6 5} Hurchanik requested information from Swayze regarding all patients seen in Swayze\u2019s office that day. Swayze filed a motion for a protective order claiming that this information was private and not subject to disclosure. The trial court entered an order requiring Swayze to \u201cproduce the names of all female pregnant African-American patients who were in Dr. Swayze\u2019s office two hours prior to and two hours after Dottie Hurchanik\u2019s appointment of 10:45 A.M., Wednesday, December 8, 2004.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">{\u00b6 6} Thereafter, Swayze submitted the affidavit of Teresa Hobbs, the office administrator for Obstetrics <em>&amp; </em>Gynecology, Inc. In her affidavit, Hobbs averred that she had conducted a search of patient records and that no pregnant African-American patients were seen in the office at the times in question. Hobbs also averred that there was no patient record for Angela Johnson and no records containing the address or phone numbers listed for Johnson. Counsel for Swayze indicated in his letter that his client had \u201creviewed [her] office records and found no individuals that fit [the court\u2019s] description.\u201d However, the letter also indicated that \u201cthere exist two individuals for which [Swayze] was unable to ascertain the race.\u201d The letter further stated that neither of those persons was named Angela.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">{\u00b6 7} Dottie Hurchanik filed her own affidavit, in which she averred the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c[On the date in question] I was taken out of [Swayze\u2019s] waiting room by an employee or nurse, weighed, and taken to an examination room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cVery soon after I was placed in the examination room, I was taken out and put back into a waiting room so a younger girl who was Black (African-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>American) and pregnant could be put into the examination room that I was taken out of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cI was later seen in the same examination room after the black pregnant girl was gone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">{\u00b6 11} Along with her affidavit, Hurchanik filed a motion for summary judgment seeking a determination that \u201cthe Defendants placed the Plaintiff into an examination room then immediately removed the Plaintiff and put the Plaintiff into a waiting room and another patient, a black female named Angela Johnson was put into the examination room and then later the Plaintiff was placed into the same examination room after the black female named Angela Johnson departed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">{\u00b6 12} Swayze then filed her own motion for summary judgment in which she argued that Hurchanik had failed to establish, by competent evidence, that Angela Johnson had been in Swayze\u2019s office on the date in question, and that she had therefore failed to establish that Johnson obtained her personal information from the medical file.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">{\u00b6 13} Hurchanik filed a second affidavit in which she averred that after she was placed in an examining room at Swayze\u2019s office, she was returned to the waiting area prior to being examined. She also averred that a pregnant, African-American woman replaced her in the examination room. According to Hurchanik, she did not see anyone remove her file from the examining room when she was sent back to the waiting area. Hurchanik averred that when she was returned to the examination room, her medical file was in the room for Swayze to review. Hurchanik also averred that the woman who replaced her in Swayze\u2019s office appeared to be the woman who had been identified as Angela Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">{\u00b6 14} The trial court denied Hurchanik\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted Swayze\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In doing so, the trial court made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThere is evidence that a pregnant black female, possibly named Angela, obtained personal identity information pertaining to the plaintiff and then used that information to order telephone service for herself in plaintiffs name. The critical question is \u2018How did Angela obtain that information?\u2019 The plaintiff contends that Angela was able to obtain the information due to the negligence of the defendants in not properly safeguarding the plaintiffs medical records while both the plaintiff and Angela were on the defendant\u2019s premises awaiting medical treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cAfter examining the evidence we conclude that the plaintiffs argument is simply conjectural. Plaintiff has not been able to present any competent evidence that Angela obtained the identity information while in the defendant\u2019s offices, or that the defendants were negligent in failing to appropriately safe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>guard the information. It should be noted that the information provided to the Court by an affidavit where the information is hearsay to the affiant is not competent evidence and cannot be considered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">(\u00b6 17} \u201cThe plaintiffs evidence, at most, shows that Angela somehow obtained the identity information while on the defendant\u2019s premises. This fact, standing alone, is not evidence that the defendants were negligent. The plaintiff has failed to produce competent evidence sufficient to demonstrate that there is at least a genuine issue of material fact as to the defendants\u2019 negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">{\u00b6 18} From this judgment, Hurchanik appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">{\u00b6 19} Hurchanik\u2019s first and third assignments of error state as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe trial court erred when it found the plaintiffs evidence, at most, shows that Angela Johnson somehow obtained the plaintiffs identity information while on the defendants\u2019 premises and then ruled that that fact standing alone was not evidence of the defendants\u2019 negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe trial court erred in noting that the critical question was \u2018how did the thief obtain the plaintiffs information?\u2019 and concluded that plaintiffs evidence at most shows that the thief \u2018somehow obtained\u2019 the identity information while on the defendants\u2019 premises when that is a factual issue for the jury and not within the province of the judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">{\u00b6 22} In these two assignments of error, Hurchanik contends that the trial court erred in rendering summary judgment against her because she submitted sufficient evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding her claim of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">{\u00b6 23} We employ a de novo review of decisions granting summary judgment. <em>Broadnax v. Greene Credit Serv. </em>(1997), 118 Ohio App.3d 881, 887, 694 N.E.2d 167. Summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact to be litigated, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party. <em>Smith v. Five Rivers MetroParks </em>(1999), 134 Ohio App.3d 754, 760, 732 N.E.2d 422. The burden of demonstrating that there is no genuine issue of material fact is on the moving party. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46. All evidence submitted in connection with a motion for summary judgment must be construed most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is made. <em>Morris v. First Natl. Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St.2d 25, 50 O.O.2d 47, 254 N.E.2d 683. To prevail on a motion for summary judgment, the party moving for summary judgment must be able to point to evidentiary materials that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. The nonmoving party must then present evidence that some issue of material fact remains for the trial court to resolve. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">{\u00b6 24} From our review of the record, there appears to be no dispute that an African-American woman named Angela Johnson illegally obtained Hurchanik\u2019s personal information, which she then used to establish telephone service. The dispute, as noted by the trial court, centers on whether Johnson obtained that information from the medical file kept by Swayze.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">{\u00b6 25} Swayze\u2019s motion for summary judgment was based solely upon the claims that Hurchanik\u2019s evidence consisted of inadmissible hearsay and that she had failed to establish that Angela Johnson was ever in Swayze\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">{\u00b6 26} We agree that some of the evidence submitted by Hurchanik constitutes inadmissible hearsay. However, although Swayze\u2019s motion argued that there was no evidence, and indeed even denied, that any woman fitting the description of Johnson was in the office that day, the record contains evidence that, if believed, would permit a reasonable juror to conclude that Angela Johnson was the woman who replaced Hurchanik in the examination room. Hurchanik, in her affidavit in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, averred that the woman she saw at Swayze\u2019s office is the woman whom she recognized as having been identified in the fraud investigation as Angela Johnson. She further averred that this woman was placed in the same room that Hurchanik had been in. Further, Hurchanik\u2019s affidavit contains evidence upon which a juror could infer that her file was not removed from the examination room while Johnson was in the room. No one from Swayze\u2019s office rebutted her affidavit in that regard. There is also evidence that some of the information in Hurchanik\u2019s medical record, specifically her work telephone number, was incorrect and that this incorrect number was recorded in the records of Cincinnati Bell when the fraudulent account was opened. Given this evidence, we conclude that a reasonable juror could infer that Johnson had had access to Hurchanik\u2019s file while in that room and that she had obtained personal information therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">{\u00b6 27} We tend to agree with the trial court that Hurchanik has failed to present evidence from which a reasonable juror could find negligence on Swayze\u2019s part in the handling of the medical record. We do not know whether it was left in the examining record under lock and key, or under some other circumstances that might constitute reasonable care. But Hurchanik was under no duty to present evidence of negligence in the handling of her medical record, because Swayze did not meet her initial burden of establishing the lack of negligence. Swayze chose to rest her motion for summary judgment upon the narrow factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>predicate that the identity thief, Angela Johnson, had never been in her offices, so that Hurchanik\u2019s personal information could not have been stolen by Johnson as a result of Swayze\u2019s negligence. When Hurchanik rebutted this factual predicate, Hurchanik satisfied her obligation under <em>Dresher v. Burt, 75 </em>Ohio St.3d 280, 662 N.E.2d 264. Hurchanik was not required to rebut factual averments that Swayze had not made in connection with her motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">{\u00b6 28} The first and third assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">{\u00b6 29} Hurchanik\u2019s second assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-8\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cThe trial court erred when it did not apply the principle of res ipsa loquitur to its own findings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">{\u00b6 31} In this assignment of error, Hurchanik argues that the trial court should have applied the doctrine of res ispa loquitur to the issue of whether the evidence was sufficient to permit the inference that Swayze was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">{\u00b6 32} The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur has been previously discussed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-11\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cThe doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is not a substantive rule of recovery, but a rule of evidence that permits, but does not require, an inference of negligence when certain predicate conditions are proven. Ordinarily, the negligence of a defendant must be affirmatively proven. Where the predicate conditions of res ipsa loquitur are established, the plaintiff is not required to offer affirmative evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence, but may urge the finder of fact to infer the defendant\u2019s negligence from the predicate conditions. These include the defendant\u2019s exclusive control over the premises and the fact that the injury or damage occurring would not normally occur absent the defendant\u2019s negligence. The archetypical situation is a routine surgical procedure, in which the plaintiff is unconscious, under the influence of a general anesthetic, the defendant health-care practitioners have the exclusive control over the surgical theater, and it is established that the injury to the plaintiff would not normally occur in the absence of negligence. Under these circumstances, it is reasonable to permit an inference of negligence, but the defendants may present affirmative evidence that they were not negligent, and the finder of fact is never required to draw the inference of negligence, but may find, to the contrary, that the defendants were not negligent.\u201d <em>W. Am. Ins. Co. v. Saleh, </em>Montgomery App. No. 21683, 2007-Ohio-3579, 2007 WL 2019664, \u00b6 18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">{\u00b6 34} Hurchanik\u2019s theory of negligence is that Swayze did not take reasonable care to safeguard Hurchanik\u2019s medical file while Angela Johnson was left alone in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>the examining room. Obviously, neither Swayze nor her agents were in exclusive control of the examining room while Angela Johnson was left alone in the room. Therefore, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">{\u00b6 35} The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">{\u00b6 36} Hurchanik\u2019s first and third assignments of error being sustained, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b797-9\">Wolff and Brogan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b797-10\">Brogan, Wolff, and Fain, JJ., of the Second District Court of Appeals, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-12\">.
