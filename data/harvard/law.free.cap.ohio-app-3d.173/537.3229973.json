Grimes (hereinafter, \u201cLewis\u201d), individually and as the executor of the estate of John H. Grimes Sr. (hereinafter, \u201cSenior\u201d), appeals separate judgments in favor of John H. Grimes Jr. (hereinafter, \u201cJunior\u201d) from different divisions of the Washington County Common Pleas Court, i.e., one judgment from the probate division and another judgment from the general division. On appeal, Lewis contends that the probate court erred when it failed to exercise its exclusive jurisdiction over his three claims that he asserted as executor of Senior\u2019s estate, which involved Senior\u2019s inter vivos transfers of real estate to Junior. Because the three claims were related to the administration of Senior\u2019s estate, we agree. Lewis further contends that the probate court erred when it found that the doctrine of res judicata barred his three claims. Because the summary judgment involving these same three claims in the general division was void ab initio, we agree. Lewis next contends that the trial court in the general division erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Junior for his individual \u201ctortious interference with an expectancy of inheritance\u201d claim. Because Lewis\u2019s individual claim was not ripe for consideration, we agree. Accordingly, we vacate the two judgments and remand these causes to the trial courts for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">{\u00b6 2} Senior had two sons, Lewis and Junior. A couple of months before he died, Senior executed several deeds transferring certain real estate properties to Junior. No money exchanged hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">{\u00b6 3} Lewis was named the executor of his father\u2019s estate in the probate division of the common pleas court. Senior\u2019s will left his entire estate to his two sons.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">{\u00b6 4} Lewis, individually and as executor of his father\u2019s estate, filed a complaint against Junior involving four claims in the general division of the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">{\u00b6 5} In three of the four claims, Lewis, as executor, alleged that at the time of the real estate transfers, Junior had a confidential relationship with Senior. He further alleged that Senior (1) had a deteriorated mental condition; (2) was dependent on Junior for advice; (3) was in poor health; (4) was physically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>incapacitated; (5) was susceptible to undue influence; and (6) was of advanced age. He claimed that Junior took advantage of Senior\u2019s conditions and preyed upon his incompetence in obtaining the transfer of the real estate. He alleged that the deeds were recorded after Senior\u2019s death, and thus, the property described in the deeds vested in Senior\u2019s beneficiaries at the time of his death. In addition, he alleged that the deeds were void for failure of delivery and acceptance. He demanded that the court declare the deeds void and requested the court to declare that Junior held the properties in trust for Senior\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 6} In the remaining claim, Lewis, individually, alleged that Junior had intentionally interfered with his expected inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 7} Junior moved for summary judgment on all four claims. In addition, he moved to dismiss the three claims Lewis filed in his capacity as executor, i.e., claims one, three, and four. He asserted that the general division lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over these declaratory judgment claims and that the probate court held exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 8} Lewis, as executor, did not contest Junior\u2019s motion to dismiss. Instead, he agreed that the probate court had exclusive subject-matter jurisdiction over these three claims. He consented to a dismissal of his three declaratory judgment claims pursuant to Civ.R. 41(B)(4)(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He stated that he would file a complaint in the probate court that restated those three claims. In addition, he asserted that his individual claim for intentional interference with an expected inheritance remained pending in the general division.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">{\u00b6 9} The general division never ruled on the issue of whether it had subject-matter jurisdiction over the three declaratory judgment claims. However, Lewis, as executor, filed a complaint in the probate court asserting the same three claims. Junior then withdrew his motion to dismiss the three claims in the general division for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and filed a motion to dismiss in the probate court on the grounds that the probate court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the three claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">{\u00b6 10} The general division then granted Junior\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all four claims. Again, it did not address the issue of whether it had subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">{\u00b6 11} Junior proceeded to file another motion to dismiss in the probate court, this time on the grounds that the complaint was barred by collateral estoppel. Junior argued that the general division\u2019s grant of summary judgment in his favor on the same claims barred a re-litigation of those claims in the probate action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>The probate court found that it had concurrent jurisdiction with the general division and that the general division exercised its jurisdiction first. It granted Junior\u2019s motion to dismiss, stating, \u201cPlaintiff is estopped by the doctrine of Res Judicata from bringing this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 12} Lewis, as executor, appeals the probate court\u2019s judgment and asserts the following two assignments of error: I. \u201cThe probate court erred in failing to exercise its exclusive jurisdiction.\u201d And II. \u201cThe probate court erred in holding that the general division\u2019s decision granting summary judgment against the plaintiff barred the plaintiffs claims in the probate division under the doctrine of res judicata.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 13} In addition, Lewis, individually and as executor, appeals the general division\u2019s summary judgment and asserts the following four assignments of error: I. \u201cThe trial court erred in failing to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter and under the doctrine of ripeness.\u201d II. \u201cAssuming arguendo that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction, it erred in failing to grant plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment as a matter of law.\u201d III. \u201cAssuming arguendo that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction, the trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d And IV. \u201cAssuming arguendo that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction, the trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs fourth claim of their first amended complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Appeal from Probate Court \u2014 Case No. 06CA73</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">{\u00b6 14} Lewis, as executor of Senior\u2019s estate, contends in his first assignment of error that the probate court erred when it failed to exercise its exclusive jurisdiction over his three claims. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">{\u00b6 15} A court possesses authority to determine its own jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter absent a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction. <em>State ex rel.

Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">{\u00b6 16} Ohio probate courts are courts \u201cof limited jurisdiction,\u201d and proceedings therein \u201care restricted to those actions permitted by statute and by the Constitution.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Lipinski v. Cuyahoga Cty.

R.C. 2101.24(A)(1)(c) provides that \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided by law, the probate court has exclusive jurisdiction * * * [t]o direct and control the conduct and settle the accounts of executors and administrators and order the distribution of estates * * Therefore, any matter \u201crelated to the administration of an estate and the distribution of its assets [is] within the exclusive jurisdiction of the probate court.\u201d <em>Mock v.

Washington, </em>Allen App. No. 1-05-54, 2006-Ohio-1414, 2006 WL 758632, \u00b6 15. Probate courts are therefore vested \u201cwith jurisdiction over declaratory judgment actions upon questions relating to the administration of an estate.\u201d <em>Lipinski, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 22, 655 N.E.2d 1303;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> see, also, <em>Sayer v.

Sagen </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 397, 572 N.E.2d 823; see, also, <em>In re Estate of Morrison </em>(1953), 159 Ohio St. 285, 50 O.O. 291, 112 N.E.2d 13 (holding that matters \u201cas to the title to and the status of certain personal property \u2014 whether it properly belongs to the estate and should be administered as a part thereof or whether the decedent effectually disposed of such property during his lifetime * * *\u201d is \u201cwithin the jurisdiction of the Probate Court and are determinable by that tribunal\u201d); <em>Johnson v. Johnson </em>(June 25, 1999), Vinton App. No. 98CA519, 1999 WL 527753.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>{\u00b6 19} Therefore, \u201c[i]n a case where an <em>administrator </em>of an estate questions the validity of certain inter <em>vivos </em>transfers that involve property which would revert to the estate if the transfers are found invalid, the action is related to the administration of the estate and is within the <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction of the probate court.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Mock, </em>Lucas App. No. L-91-210, 1992 WL 163959, citing <em>Bobko, </em>61 Ohio App.3d at 406-407, 572 N.E.2d 823; see, also, <em>Lamar, </em>2006-Ohio-1414, 2006 WL 758632, at \u00b6 14 (stating that to the extent that an administrator brings an action \u201cseeking a declaration by the trial court setting aside * * * \u2018fraudulent transfers[,]\u2019 [s]uch an action [is] not properly before the [general division of the common pleas court] because the probate court has exclusive jurisdiction over such an action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">{\u00b6 20} Here, Lewis, as executor of the estate of Senior, filed three claims in the probate court, seeking to have the trial court invalidate and rescind Senior\u2019s inter vivos deed transfers to Junior and for the court to declare that those properties are being held by Junior in constructive trust for the estate of Senior. Lewis, as executor, further alleges that Senior executed the deeds at a time when he was incompetent and that Junior exerted undue influence over Senior; that the property described in the deeds vested in the names of the beneficiaries at the time of Senior\u2019s death and before Junior\u2019s recording of the deeds; and that the deeds must fail for lack of delivery and acceptance. Because Lewis, as executor, alleges that Senior was the owner of the property immediately before the transfers to Junior, the property would revert to Senior\u2019s estate should the court declare the deeds invalid. Therefore, Lewis\u2019s three claims, as executor, are related to the administration of Senior\u2019s estate, and consequently, the probate court has exclusive jurisdiction over the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">{\u00b6 21} Accordingly, we sustain the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">{\u00b6 22} Lewis, as executor, contends in his second assignment of error that the probate court erred when it determined that his action was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. He maintains that because the common pleas court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, its judgment is void ab initio, and thus, the probate action cannot be barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Again, our review is de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel preclude relitigation of a point of law or fact that was at issue in a former action between the same parties and was passed upon by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Vectren Energy Delivery of Ohio, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>113 Ohio St.3d 180, 2006-Ohio-1386, 863 N.E.2d 599, \u00b6 30. \u201cIn Ohio, the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>inapplicable on a final judgment rendered by a state court lacking subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Manohar v. Massillon Community Hosp. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 715, 718, 702 N.E.2d 937; see, also, 63 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1979) Judgments, Section 398, citing <em>State ex rel. Rose v. Ohio Dept. of Rehab. &amp; Corr. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 453, 746 N.E.2d 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA judgment rendered by a court lacking subject matter jurisdiction is void <em>ab initio.\u201d Patton v. Diemer </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 68, 518 N.E.2d 941, paragraph three of the syllabus. Appellate courts have inherent power to vacate a judgment that is void ab initio, and it can be challenged at any time. <em>Patton, </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 70, 518 N.E.2d 941; see, also, <em>Wandling v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 368, 371, 604 N.E.2d 825; <em>Gahanna v. Jones-Williams </em>(1997), 117 Ohio App.3d 399, 404, 690 N.E.2d 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">{\u00b6 25} Here, because the probate court had exclusive jurisdiction over Lewis\u2019s claims as executor of Senior\u2019s estate, the general division\u2019s grant of summary judgment on those claims is void ab initio. Thus, the general division\u2019s summary judgment does not bar Lewis\u2019s three claims, as executor, in the probate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">{\u00b6 26} Accordingly, we sustain the second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">{\u00b6 27} In conclusion, we sustain both assignments of error, vacate the probate court\u2019s judgment, and remand this cause to the probate court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">Appeal from the General Division\u2019s Summary Judgment \u2014 Case No. 06CA56</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">{\u00b6 28} Lewis first contends in his first assignment of error that the general division lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to grant summary judgment on his three claims as executor of Senior\u2019s estate. As set forth above, the probate court had exclusive jurisdiction over the three claims, i.e., the first, third, and fourth claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">{\u00b6 29} Lewis also asserts that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment against him on his \u201ctortious interference with an expectancy of inheritance\u201d claim. He asserts that the court should have found that the claim was not ripe for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-15\">{\u00b6 30} Ohio courts do recognize the claim of tortious interference with an expectancy of inheritance. <em>Firestone v. Galbreath </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 87, 88, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>616 N.E.2d 202. To prevail on such a claim, the plaintiff must prove \u201c(1) an existence of an expectancy of inheritance in the plaintiff; (2) an intentional interference by a defendant(s) with that expectancy of inheritance; (3) conduct by the defendant involving the interference that is tortious, such as fraud, duress or undue influence, in nature; (4) a reasonable certainty that the expectancy of inheritance would have been realized, but for the interference by the defendant; and (5) damage resulting from the interference.\u201d Id.; see, also, <em>Roll v. Edwards, </em>156 Ohio App.3d 227, 2004-Ohio-767, 805 N.E.2d 162, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 31} Lewis cites <em>Roll </em>for the assertion that the general division should have dismissed this claim for lack of ripeness. \u201c[A] claim for intentional interference with expectancy of inheritance may not be pursued if adequate relief is available to the plaintiff thorough probate procedures * * <em>Roll </em>at \u00b6 28. Because \u201cno single court has jurisdiction,\u201d if a probate action is unresolved while the tortious interference claim is before another court, \u201cthere is a risk * * * [of] double recovery \u2014 the inheritance they seek to reclaim * * * and money damages equal to the value of the inheritance in the tort action.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 32} Until Lewis, as executor, resolves the declaratory judgment action in probate court, it is not certain whether he suffered damages as a result of Junior\u2019s alleged tortious interference. Thus, Lewis\u2019s individual claim for intentional interference with expectancy of inheritance \u201cis not yet ripe\u201d for judicial review. Id. at \u00b6 31. Where a cause is not ripe for judicial review, a court has no jurisdiction to consider it. <em>Eagle Fireworks v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, State Fire Marshal, </em>Washington App. No. 03CA28, 2004-Ohio-509, 2004 WL 232869, \u00b6 12. Therefore, the general division had no jurisdiction to grant summary judgment in favor of Junior on Lewis\u2019s individual claim of tortious interference with expectancy of inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">{\u00b6 33} Accordingly, we sustain Lewis\u2019s first assignment of error. We find his remaining assignments of error moot. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c). We vacate the trial court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of Junior, and we remand this cause to the trial court with the instruction to dismiss this cause, without prejudice, pursuant to Civ.R. 41(B)(4)(a), i.e., \u201clack of jurisdiction over the person or the subject matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Judgments vacated and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b576-9\">Abele, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b576-10\">McFarland, P.J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-11\">.
