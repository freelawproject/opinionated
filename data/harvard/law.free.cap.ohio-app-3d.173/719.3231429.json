Defendant-appellant, Troy Clark, appeals from the May 16, 2007 judgment entry of the Court of Common Pleas of Van Wert County, Ohio, denying his motion for return of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-18\">{\u00b6 2} On July 7, 2006, a Van Wert County grand jury returned an indictment charging Clark with one count of negligent homicide, a misdemeanor of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2903.05(A). The indictment stated that \u201con or about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>the fifteenth day of January, 2006 at Van Wert County Ohio, Troy R. Clark did negligently cause the death of Trevor J. Ellerbock by means of a deadly weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">{\u00b6 3} On March 14, 2007, Clark entered into a written plea of no contest to the charge of negligent homicide as contained in the indictment. In a judgment entry dated March 19, 2007, the trial court accepted Clark\u2019s plea of no contest, ordered a pre-sentence investigation, and continued the matter for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">{\u00b6 4} On April 25, 2007, the trial court conducted Clark\u2019s sentencing hearing, wherein the court found that Clark had been convicted of negligent homicide, a misdemeanor of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2903.05(A). In its April 27, 2007 judgment entry of sentence, the trial court sentenced Clark to 180 days in the Van Wert County Correctional Facility with credit for eight days already served. Additionally, the trial court imposed a fine of $1,000 and ordered Clark to pay court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">{\u00b6 5} On April 27, 2007, Clark filed a motion for return of firearm, alleging that the state had not moved for forfeiture or destruction of the firearm, and therefore the firearm should be returned to its rightful owner, Clark\u2019s father. In an entry dated April 30, 2007, the trial court granted the parties until May 15, 2007, to present \u201clegal arguments with supporting legal citations to support their respective position why the firearms should or should not be returned to their owners.\u201d The state filed a response in opposition to Clark\u2019s motion on April 30, 2007. On May 16, 2007, Clark filed his argument in support of his motion for return of firearm. Also on May 16, 2007, without conducting a hearing, the trial court issued an entry denying Clark\u2019s motion for return of firearm, wherein the court ordered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">The Division of Wildlife shall retain possession of said firearm until the expiration of the defendant\u2019s right to appeal this decision. If an appeal is taken, the Division of Wildlife shall retain possession of said firearm until the disposition of the appeal. If no appeal is taken, the Division of Wildlife shall dispose of said firearm in accordance with law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">{\u00b6 6} Clark now appeals, asserting one assignment of error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-10\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-11\">The court erred in denying the motion for return of property and ordering forfeiture to the state of the property originally seized as evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">{\u00b6 7} In his sole assignment of error, Clark alleges that the state failed to follow the proper procedure for forfeiture or disposition of the firearm used in the commission of the crime in the present case, and, accordingly, that the trial court erred in denying his motion for return of the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Initially, we note that in Ohio, forfeitures are typically not favored in law or equity. <em>State v. Johns </em>(1993), 90 Ohio App.3d 456, 459, 629 N.E.2d 1069, citing <em>State v. Lilliock </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 23, 25, 24 O.O.3d 64, 434 N.E.2d 723. \u201cWhenever possible, such statutes must be construed as to avoid a forfeiture of property.\u201d <em>Lilliock, </em>70 Ohio St.2d at 26, 24 O.O.3d 64, 434 N.E.2d 723. The Supreme Court of Ohio has cautioned that forfeiture may not be ordered \u201cunless the expression of the law is clear and the intent of the legislature manifest.\u201d Id.; see also <em>Dayton v. Boddie </em>(1984), 19 Ohio App.3d 210, 19 OBR 354, 484 N.E.2d 171. A forfeiture action, while instituted as a criminal penalty, is a civil proceeding. <em>State v. Roberts </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 514, 518, 657 N.E.2d 547, citing <em>State v. Casalicchio </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 178, 181, 569 N.E.2d 916. Accordingly, due process requires that proceedings seeking a disposition of property in forfeiture comply with the Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>State v. Gaines </em>(1990), 64 Ohio App.3d 230, 236, 580 N.E.2d 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">{\u00b6 9} On appeal, the state argues that R.C. 2933.41 permits the trial court to deny Clark\u2019s motion for return of the firearm and order its disposal. Proceedings brought pursuant to R.C. 2933.41 are criminal in nature but civil in form. <em>State v. Selbak, </em>2d Dist. No. CA2002-06-139, 2003-Ohio-2688, 2003 WL 21211490, \u00b6 23, citing <em>Lilliock, </em>70 Ohio St.2d at 25, 24 O.O.3d 64, 434 N.E.2d 723. We also note that the Ohio Supreme Court has expressly held that R.C. 2933.41(C) is not a forfeiture statute. Id. at \u00b6 18, citing <em>Lilliock, </em>70 Ohio St.2d at 25, 24 O.O.3d 64, 434 N.E.2d 723. Instead, R.C. 2933.41 specifically deals with the disposition of property that has been seized and is in the custody of a law-enforcement agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">{\u00b6 10} Additionally, R.C. 2933.41(C) prevents certain individuals from exercising a right to reclaim certain property under certain circumstances. Id., citing <em>In re Forfeiture of $11,250 in U.S. Currency, </em>121 Ohio Misc.2d 111, 2002-Ohio-7452, 782 N.E.2d 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 2933.41 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">(C) A person loses any right he may have to the possession, or the possession and ownership, of property if any of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">(1) The property was the subject, or was used in a conspiracy or attempt to commit, or in the commission, of an offense other than a traffic offense, and the person is a conspirator, accomplice, or offender with respect to the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-10\">(2) A court determines that the property should be forfeited because, in light of the nature of the property or the circumstances of the person, it is unlawful for the person to acquire or possess the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">{\u00b6 12} In the instant case, the trial court\u2019s May 16, 2007 entry does not specifically refer to R.C. 2933.41(C) or any other statute. Rather, the entry simply provides, \u201cThe court finds that said firearm was used in the commission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>a criminal offense.\u201d Moreover, the trial court\u2019s April 27, 2007 judgment entry of sentence does not address the forfeiture of the firearm used by Clark in the commission of his offense except to say that the Division of Wildlife shall retain possession of the weapon pending an appeal and \u201c[i]f no appeal is taken, the Division of Wildlife shall dispose of said firearm in accordance with law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">{\u00b6 13} We note that there is no record on this appeal other than the transcript of the docket entries. There is no transcript of the testimony on Clark\u2019s no-contest plea, no transcript of the testimony at sentencing, and no suggestion of a hearing on Clark\u2019s motion for return of the weapon. Additionally, it appears as if the issue of third-party ownership of the weapon by Clark\u2019s father was not brought to the trial court\u2019s attention until Clark filed his motion for return of firearm on April 27, 2007, and was not addressed further by any party or the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">{\u00b6 14} Although R.C. 2933.41 appears to have been the relevant section at the time the present case was before the trial court, this section has now been repealed and replaced by R.C. 2981.01 through 2981.14. See 2006 Sub.H.B. No. 241 (\u201cH.B. 241\u201d). Like R.C. 2933.41, the provisions of R.C. 2981.01 through 2981.14 also preclude the return of property used in the commission of certain offenses under certain conditions, which may or may not include the defendant in this case. See, e.g., R.C. 2981.02. Additionally, the provisions of R.C. 2981.01 through 2981.14 specifically address the procedural rights and obligations of third parties who claim ownership of such property and the procedural rights and obligations of those seeking forfeiture of such property to the state. See R.C. 2981.03, 2981.04, 2981.05, and 2981.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">{\u00b6 15} Finally, we note that the legislation accompanying R.C. 2981.01 to 2981.14, Section 4 of 2006 H.B. 241, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">Sections 1, 2, and 3 of this act shall take effect on July 1, 2007. If a criminal or civil forfeiture action relating to misconduct under Title XXIX of the Revised Code was or is commenced before July 1, 2007, and is still pending on that date, the court in which the case is pending shall, to the extent practical, apply the provisions of Chapter 2981 of the Revised Code in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">{\u00b6 16} On the state of the foregoing record and pursuant to the directives of Section 4 of 2006 H.B. 241, it is the decision of this court that this matter be remanded with instructions to the trial court to solicit such motions, provide such notices, and conduct such hearings as are necessary to determine the disposition of this weapon in accordance with the provisions of R.C. 2981.01 through 2981.14. Accordingly, and on this basis only, Clark\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained. The May 16, 2007 judgment entry of the Van Wert Court of Common Pleas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>denying Clark\u2019s motion for return of firearm is vacated, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Judgment vacated and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b754-6\">Rogers, P.J., and Preston, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
