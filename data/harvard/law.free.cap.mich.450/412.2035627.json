The homeowner\u2019s insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>anee policy issued by plaintiff does not provide liability coverage for personal injuries arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, loading, or unloading of any motorized vehicle. Therefore, the personal injuries forming the basis of this case, arising out of an automobile accident, are excluded from the scope of the plaintiff\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">i<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">On March 8, 1986, one week before Daniel Hayes\u2019 entry into the United States Air Force, he gave himself a going away party at a friend\u2019s home. He bought two kegs of beer and charged each guest a dollar to cover costs. Eighteen-year-old Scott Koppelberger attended the party and was allegedly intoxicated when he left early the next morning. Susan Keillor was on her way to work that morning when her car was involved in a head-on collision with Koppelberger\u2019s car. Ms. Keillor was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">William Keillor, individually and as personal representative of the estate of his wife, filed an action against Koppelberger, Hayes, and others, alleging negligence, wrongful death, and violations of the dramshop act.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">Hayes, who lived with his father at the time, tendered the defense of the action to his father\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurer, Allstate. Hayes answered the complaint, and, two months later, Allstate sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Hayes a reservation of rights letter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Allstate then filed this action, seeking a declaration that its policy did not provide liability coverage for Hayes\u2019 alleged actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Allstate brought a motion for summary disposition arguing, among other things, that defendant lacked standing to contest coverage and that, even if he did, both the criminal acts and motor vehicle exclusions precluded coverage. The trial court granted the motion, finding that defendant lacked standing and that both the criminal acts and motor vehicle exclusions applied. The Court of Appeals upheld the trial court\u2019s ruling on the standing issue. 190 Mich App 499; 476 NW2d 453 (1991). This Court reversed, holding that defendant did have standing and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals to decide whether the exclusions applied. 442 Mich 56; 499 NW2d 743 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">On remand, the Court of Appeals held that coverage is precluded by both the criminal acts and motor vehicle exclusions. 203 Mich App 36, 40-41; 511 NW2d 702 (1993). It is from that decision that the defendant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Allstate does not dispute coverage, so the only issue before this Court is whether that coverage is precluded by an exclusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This, of course, means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>that the primary issue before this Court is one of policy interpretation. When interpreting insurance policies, a number of well-established rules guide the analysis. Those relevant here are succinctly recounted in <em>Auto-Owners Ins Co v Churchman, </em>440 Mich 560, 566-567; 489 NW2d 431 (1992):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-4\">An insurance policy is much the same as any other contract. It is \u00bfn agreement between the parties in which a court will determine what the agreement was and effectuate the intent of the parties. Accordingly, the court must look at the contract as a whole and give meaning to all terms. Further, \"[a]ny clause in an insurance policy is valid as long as it is clear, unambiguous and not in contravention of public policy.\u201d This Court cannot create ambiguity where none exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">Exclusionary clauses in insurance policies are strictly construed in favor of the insured. However, coverage under a policy is lost if any exclusion within the policy applies to an insured\u2019s particular claims. Clear and specific exclusions must be given effect. It is impossible to hold an insurance company liable for a risk it did not assume. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The inquiry does not necessarily end, however, with the rules of construction. A court may also consider the reasonable expectations of the insured. <em>Vanguard Ins Co v Clarke, </em>438 Mich 463, 472; 475 NW2d 48 (1991). A court must look at the policy language from an objective standpoint and determine whether an insured could have reasonably expected coverage. In <em>Vanguard, </em>we held that the policy unambiguously excluded liability for personal injuries arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading of any motor vehicle owned or operated by, or rented or loaned to, any insured. <em>Id. </em>at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>The Court recognized that the accident was a risk that the insurer did not assume.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-4\">In drafting an insurance policy, the drafters calculate the probability of risk in setting the price paid by the insured. Here, a specific excluded risk comprised part of that calculus. Because the tragic event at issue here clearly \"arose out\u201d of the operation and use of an automobile, and it cannot be said that the insured had been led to reasonably expect coverage under the policy, the exclusion stands. <em>[Vanguard </em>at 475.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Similarly, in <em>Farm Bureau Mut Ins Co of Michigan v </em>Stark, 437 Mich 175; 468 NW2d 498 (1991), we held that the motor vehicle exception was unambiguous and that a moped was a motor vehicle under the terms of the policy. <em>Id. </em>at 185. We also held that allowing injuries resulting from motor vehicle accidents to be compensable under a homeowner\u2019s policy would expand the liability of insurers in ways not anticipated when the policy was drafted.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">Generally speaking, a homeowner\u2019s policy is designed to protect against losses arising out of the ownership or use of a particular residential building and its appurtenant structures, not liability connected to the operation of motor vehicles on public highways. Motor vehicle exclusions, such as the one in the instant case, are commonly included in homeowner\u2019s policies. The basis for the motor vehicle exclusion is evident: using a motor vehicle designed for travel on public roads greatly increases the risk of bodily injury and property damage, and such liability is not within the risk which homeowner\u2019s contracts are designed to cover or for which premiums are charged. The risk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>liability from the use of a motor vehicle is traditionally and properly covered by motor vehicle policies, not by homeowner\u2019s insurance. We conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s policy unambiguously excludes such a motor vehicle, the moped, from its coverage. [Id]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">ill</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The relevant exclusion in this policy provides that Allstate does \"not cover bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of <em>any </em>motorized land vehicle or trailer.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As we held in Churchman, any clause in an insurance policy is valid as long as it is clear, unambiguous, and does not contravene public policy. This Court will not create ambiguity where none exists._</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>We find that this provision is unambiguous.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It plainly states that homeowner\u2019s coverage does not extend to personal injury or property damage arising out of the use or operation of any motor vehicle. .Furthermore, defendant has not shown us how this exclusion contravenes public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Having concluded that there is no ambiguity in this exclusion, it must be enforced as written. Coverage under a policy is lost if any exclusion within the policy applies to a particular claim. \"[A]ny motorized land vehicle\u201d means just that. Koppelberger was operating a \"motorized land vehicle,\u201d more specifically, a car, when he struck and killed Keillor. The exclusion applies, and coverage for Hayes under this homeowner\u2019s policy is correspondingly lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">This holding does not conflict with reasonable expectations of the insured. When viewed objectively, a person reading this unambiguous exclusion would reasonably expect that it means what it says: coverage does not exist for personal injuries arising out of the use of any motor vehicle. Thus, it cannot be said that the insured had been led to reasonably expect coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">The decisions of the trial court and the Court of Appeals are affirmed only insofar as they hold that coverage is precluded by the motor vehicle' exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>sion. Having found that the motor vehicle exclusion precludes coverage, there is no need to discuss the criminal acts exclusion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b691-4\">Brickley, C.J., and Boyle and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b685-10\"> These facts are largely taken from our opinion in <em>Allstate Ins Co v Hayes, </em>442 Mich 56, 58-61; 499 NW2d 743 (1993). Those desiring a more developed factual or procedural background may find it there.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b686-10\"> The defendant makes much of the fact that this reservation of rights letter did not mention plaintiff\u2019s reliance on the motor vehicle exclusion. The defendant claims that because the automobile exclusion was not raised in Allstate\u2019s reservation of rights letter, Allstate should be estopped from raising it. It should be noted, however, that Allstate did assert the exclusion in its second amended complaint. We hold that Allstate is not estopped from raising the motor vehicle exclusion because Allstate did not delay unreasonably in asserting the exclusion and the defendant has suffered no prejudice from the short delay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b686-11\"> See <em>Allstate Ins Co v Freeman, </em>432 Mich 656, 661; 443 NW2d 734 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b689-6\"> In its entirety, the motor vehicle exclusion provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">We do not cover bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of any motorized land vehicle or trailer.

It, therefore, provides a narrower exclusion than the exclusion in this case because this exclusion is not contingent on the ownership or use of the motor vehicle by an insured. It applies to any motor vehicle. We refuse to accept the proposition that the deletion of the language referring to the ownership or use of the insured somehow transforms this unambiguous provision into an ambiguous one.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b691-5\">Riley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AP8M\">(concurring).

See <em>Buczkowski v Allstate Ins Co, </em>447 Mich 669; 526 NW2d 589 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">The majority finds that the motor vehicle exclusion is unambiguous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In my opinion, there are two areas of ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">Motor vehicle exclusions are included in homeowner\u2019s policies because an insured\u2019s driving risks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>are \"traditionally and properly covered by motor vehicle policies, not by homeowner\u2019s insurance.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The motor vehicle exclusion reduces homeowner\u2019s premiums by removing the risks of operating an automobile from coverage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consistent with this purpose, homeowner\u2019s policies generally exclude only motor vehicles owned or operated by or rented or loaned to an insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">The \"most widely used homeowners policy\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides that there is excluded from the liability coverage bodily injury or property damage \"arising out of . . . the ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of motor vehicles or all other motorized land conveyances, including trailers, <em>owned or operated by or rented or loaned to an insured . </em>. . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The motor vehicle exclusion in the Allstate policy differs from the language employed to express this exclusion in the most common homeowner\u2019s policies. Absent an express statement that the exclusion for any motorized vehicle applies without regard to whether the vehicle is owned, maintained, or used by the insured, the exclusion is, I think, ambiguous, reading the exclusion from the standpoint of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">This Court has defined an ambiguous contract as one in which the \" \u2018words may reasonably be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>understood ini different ways.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The rare insured who took the time to read carefully and understand all the language in this policy could find at least two reasonable interpretations of this exclusion. One interpretation is that it aims to streamline the language. Under this reading, the exclusion applies only where the insured has some control over the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit suggested that the exclusionary language might reasonably be read this way. <em>Allstate Ins Co v Mercier, </em>913 F2d 273 (CA 6, 1990), involved facts very similar to those here. The exclusionary language was identical to that in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">Ownership, maintenance, use and loading or unloading all imply some degree of control or right to possession of a vehicle. If the purchaser of a homeowners policy could reasonably assume that [this auto exclusion] applied only to injury involving a vehicle over which the insured homeowner had some measure of control, the question of [this control] would be critical. <em>[Id., </em>p 278 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Other courts have held that the absence of \"owned or operated by the insured\u201d language does not eliminate the need for the insured to have exercised some control over the vehicle for the exclusion to apply.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Another interpretation of the policy language is the one accepted by the majority: that it excludes from coverage liability for <em>all </em>injuries associated with <em>any </em>motor vehicle, regardless of whether the liability would be covered by the insured\u2019s automobile policy. While this is a possible reading, it is not the <em>only </em>reasonable interpretation of this language.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Reading the policy as a whole\u2014\"Losses We Cover\u201d together with \"Exclusions\u2014Losses We Do Not Cover\u201d\u2014the exclusion is subject to a third interpretation: that Allstate . agreed to pay all sums that an insured person becomes legally obligated to pay unless the liability arises out of the ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of any motorized land vehicle.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A5H7\">The insured\u2019s liability arose, if at all, from serv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>ing alcoholic beverages to an eighteen-year-old social guest and not from the use of a motor vehicle. A natural reading of \"Losses We Cover\u201d and \"Exclusions\u2014Losses We Do Not Cover\u201d admits of the construction that the exclusions relate only to liability of the insured. As a result, the motor vehicle exclusion might apply only where the insured\u2019s legal liability arises from the use of a motor vehicle. Construing the ambiguous exclusion against the insured, in accordance with the usual rule of construction, the exclusion does not apply, where, as here, the insured\u2019s legal liability does not arise out of the use of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Even if the exclusionary language in this policy is unambiguous, the majority fails to take the policyholder\u2019s reasonable expectations into account. The majority misunderstands the reasonable expectations doctrine when it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">This holding does not conflict with reasonable exp\u00e9ctations of the insured. When viewed objectively, a person reading this unambiguous exclusion would reasonably expect that it means what it says: coverage does not exist for personal injuries arising out of the use of any motor vehicle. Thus, it cannot be said that the insured had been led to reasonably expect coverage.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">The reasonable expectations of the insured are to be considered when and after it has been determined that the policy language unambiguously favors the construction urged by the insurer. But an insured\u2019s reasonable expectations do not depend on whether he read the policy, or understood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>what he read. As stated in Keeton &amp; Widiss, Insurance Law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-4\">In general, courts will protect the reasonable expectations of applicants, insureds, and intended beneficiaries regarding the coverage afforded by insurance contracts <em>even though a careful examination of the policy provisions indicates that such expectations are contrary to the expressed intention of the </em>insurer.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The holder of a homeowner\u2019s policy may reasonably expect that it complements his automobile insurance policy. He could reasonably expect that the automobile exclusion precludes coverage only of liabilities covered by automobile insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">In <em>United Services Automobile Ass\u2019n v Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co, </em>75 AD2d 1022; 429 NYS2d 508 (1980), New York\u2019s intermediate appellate court considered homeowner\u2019s policy language identical with the language in the Allstate policy<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in a case in which the family of a twelve-year-old boy sought to recover on the basis of negligent supervision for injuries sustained during horseplay with other children in an automobile excursion. The court concluded that the automobile policy did not provide coverage, but that the homeowner\u2019s policy should be construed to avoid a gap in coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">Aetna as the homeowners\u2019 carrier understand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>ably does not want to provide coverage already specifically covered by the auto carrier. However, there is no reason to construe the phrase \"arising out of\u201d any differently for a homeowners\u2019 policy exclusion than for an auto carrier\u2019s coverage clause. To construe these identical phrases differently would leave open the possibility that some occurrences could escape coverage on both policies.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The majority\u2019s interpretation of the automobile exclusion creates just such a gap in coverage.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AxU\">I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-15\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 419.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b693-7\"> <em>Farm Bureau Mut Ins Co of Michigan v Stark, </em>437 Mich 175, 185; 468 NW2d 498 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b693-8\"> <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b693-9\"><em> </em>The Annotations to the Homeowners Policy (2d ed), prepared by the Property Insurance Law Committee, Tort and Insurance Practice Section of the American Bar Association, states in the introduction that the Insurance Services Office and State Farm Homeowner\u2019s Policies \"annotated here are representative of the most widely used homeowners policy, the form 3.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b693-10\"> Insurance Services Office Policy, <em>id., </em>p 19.
