MCL 418.401(1); MSA 17.237(401)(1). We hold that plaintiff has not met his burden of establishing a limitation of wage-earning capacity in work suitable to his qualifications and training and is therefore not compensably disabled within the definition of the statute. We affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Plaintiff began his employment with Morton Salt Company in March, 1968. He was initially employed in the chemical department and remained there until he was transferred to the powerhouse in 1974. During his thirteen years in the powerhouse, plaintiff advanced from a trainee to an assistant operator and finally to an operator. While an assistant operator in the powerhouse, plaintiff was responsible for running the boiler. As a powerhouse operator, plaintiff\u2019s responsibilities shifted to monitoring an electrical turbine to ensure the continuing operation of the powerhouse. In performing both jobs, however, he was responsible for periodically checking a series of gauges and reporting or repairing any potential problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">While in the powerhouse, plaintiff was exposed to significant noise levels, first as an assistant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>operator, where he was exposed to shrill noises from the boiler, and then later as an operator where his work station was located adjacent to the large, noisy turbine. As a result of the prolonged exposure to these noises, he began experiencing a ringing or humming in his ears. He was examined in February, 1988, by an otolaryngologist, Dr. Charles Henry, who later testified by deposition that plaintiff had sustained a hearing loss and related tinnitus as a result of noise exposure. Dr. Henry advised plaintiff not to work in a noisy environment unless adequately protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">In 1987, <em>before </em>learning about plaintiff\u2019s hearing loss, defendant enclosed plaintiff\u2019s work station by installing insulated walls with acoustical ceiling tile in order to reduce the noise levels. Additionally, the company provided the operators with earplugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">During much of his time with Morton Salt, plaintiff was also battling manic depression. He was originally diagnosed with the illness in 1972, and underwent treatment without significant absence from work. The disorder remained under control for many years until 1986 when plaintiff\u2019s symptoms elevated, causing him to miss considerable time from work. His prolonged bouts with depression often prohibited him from working until he ultimately quit on October 23, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">However, on June 9, 1987, more than four months <em>before </em>his last day of work, plaintiff filed an application with the bureau of worker\u2019s disability compensation, alleging a work-aggravated manic-depressive disorder and a noise-induced, high-frequency hearing loss. Plaintiff was <em>not, </em>however, diagnosed or treated for hearing problems until he saw Dr. Henry, approximately 3 Vis months <em>after </em>his last day of work on October 23, 1987. Additionally, plaintiff continued working <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>without change as an operator with Morton Salt for four months, until he was unable to continue work because of his manic depressive illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">After a hearing, the magistrate denied both claims and ruled that \"[wjhile there is no question but that plaintiff is disabled, the proofs fail to support a finding of an employment-related disability within the meaning of the Act.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, with regard to plaintiff\u2019s hearing loss, the magistrate ruled that the proofs failed to establish that the modifications in the powerhouse did not accommodate plaintiff\u2019s acknowledged restrictions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Plaintiff appealed the decision to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission, arguing that notwithstanding the magistrate\u2019s determination that his manic depressive illness was nonworkrelated, he was entitled to benefits for his hearing disability stemming from a noisy environment. He alleged that his potential for favored work, because of his partial disability, was terminated by a supervening, noncompensable total disability, i.e., his manic depressive disorder. The wcac reversed and entered an open award, stating that the hearing loss constituted an impairment of wage-earn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>ing capacity and was therefore a compensable, partial disability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The Court of Appeals granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal and reversed the decision of the wcac. The majority held that there was not competent evidence to support the wcac conclusion that plaintiff suffered a loss in wage-earning capacity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court noted that plaintiff continued to perform his regular job after sustaining the hearing loss. Plaintiff appealed in this Court, and we granted leave.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff no longer contests the finding that his manic-depressive illness is a noncompensable injury within the definition of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Findings of fact by the magistrate are conclusive on review by the wcac if they are supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record. MCL 418.861a(3); MSA 17.237(861a)(3); <em>Holden v Ford Motor Co, </em>439 Mich 257, 261; 484 NW2d 227 (1992). Moreover, review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>by the Court of Appeals or this Court is limited because \"findings of fact made by the wcac are conclusive if there is any competent evidence to support them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263. Finally, this Court has the power to review questions of law of any final order of the wcac. MCL 418.861a(14); MSA 17.237(861a)(14).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The applicable statute in this case is MCL 418.401; MSA 17.237(401), defining disabilities arising out of occupational diseases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The current definition of a compensable disability is the result of a significant modification engendered by 1987 PA 28, \u00a7401(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Even though the revised statute became effective May 14, 1987, it has not to date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>been applied by this Court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under the previous definition, an employee was disabled if there was personal injury or work-related disease that resulted in a \"limitation of an employee\u2019s wage earning capacity in the employee\u2019s <em>general \u00f1eld of employment </em>. . . .\u201d MCL 418.401(1); MSA 17.237(401)(1) (emphasis added). The current definition limits compensable disability to those employees experiencing a limitation of wage-earning capacity in work suitable to the employee\u2019s \"qualifications and training\u201d resulting from a personal injury or work-related disease.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">In accordance with the current definition of disability, plaintiff maintains that he has suffered a limitation of his wage-earning capacity in work suitable to his qualifications and training as a result of his work-related hearing loss. In support, plaintiff alleges that the measures taken by defendant to reduce the noise levels at plaintiff\u2019s work station in the powerhouse essentially rendered his job \"favored work,\u201d which evidences a limitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>of wage-earning capacity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The magistrate determined that plaintiff had not sustained a limitation of his wage-earning c\u00e1pacity and was therefore not disabled.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, the wcac concluded that, as a matter of law, plaintiff\u2019s hearing loss was a compensable injury under either the present or previous statutory definitions of disability. We have reviewed the legal conclusion of the wcac and hold that although plaintiff did suffer a work-related hearing loss, the wcac incorrectly concluded that the injury was a compensable disability under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Favored work entails the modification of an employee\u2019s duties that in some manner accommodates the employee\u2019s injury.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the present case, defendant did not change plaintiff\u2019s duties in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>manner.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In fact, it is uncontested that plaintiff continued to perform his exact job until he left Morton Salt because of manic depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Moreover, in the present case, there is no connection between plaintiff\u2019s injury and defendant\u2019s decision to install sound absorbent walls, nor is there any connection between plaintiff\u2019s injury and the company\u2019s policy of providing its employees with earplugs.. These modifications were an effort to improve the work environment. Such modifications do not transform regular employment into favored work. We, therefore, reject expansion of the favored-work doctrine beyond recognition to include situations in which the employer merely improves the work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The present case is distinguishable from <em>Powell v Casco Nelmor Corp, </em>406 Mich 332; 279 NW2d 769 (1979), in which an employee injured her thumb at work and was unable to resume her job for a two-month period. She returned to work, but could no longer perform her job because of her injury. When the plaintiff finally returned, she was only able to perform work that the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board concluded was favored. The plaintiff continued the favored work until sometime after she was diagnosed with cancer of the larynx.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">The <em>Powell </em>Court stated that \"[tjhere is no dispute that the performance of post-injury work at no wage loss precludes payment of disability benefits while that work continues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347. The wcab determined that the employee was performing \"favored work,\u201d which limited her wage-earning capacity. <em>Id. </em>In reaching this result, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Court stated that \" 'disability\u2019 is defined as the 'inability to perform the work claimant was doing when injured.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350, citing 2 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 57.53, p 10-129.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Additionally, in concluding that the plaintiff had a limitation of wage-earning capacity, the Court relied on the wcab finding that the plaintiff was capable of performing only favored work, which \"conclusively established plaintiff\u2019s disability and right to compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351-352.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">In contrast to Powell, plaintiff was able and was in fact performing the same work postinjury as he was preinjury. We conclude that plaintiff was not engaged in favored work at the time he discontinued his employment with defendant and, therefore, established a wage-earning capacity before leaving Morton because of his nonwork-related manic depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Having concluded that plaintiff was not engaged in favored work, the issue remains whether plaintiff\u2019s hearing loss is nevertheless compensable. In the present case, the magistrate determined that plaintiff failed to establish that working at noise levels existing in the powerhouse were medically inadvisable. The wcac adopted the magistrate\u2019^\" operative findings of fact without establishing any independent findings of fact. Therefore, its holding was merely a different legal conclusion on the basis of the essential facts as determined by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>the magistrate.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because this Court may review questions of law involved with any final order of the wcac pursuant to MCL 418.861a(14); MSA 17.237(861a)(14), we conclude that the wcac improperly held that plaintiff was disabled under the meaning of the act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">It is not sufficient for plaintiff to simply prove a work-related injury, because inherent in the statutory definition of disability is the requirement of a limit\u00e1tion of wage-earning capacity. Therefore, we must determine whether plaintiff has met his burden of proving such a limitation of wage-earning capacity. In order to do so, we must examine the new statutory definition of disability. The statutory change was designed to narrow the scope of employees\u2019 eligibility for worker\u2019s compensation benefits and eliminate anomalous results as illustrated in the following example:<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>A representative of a large employer frequently cited the example of an employee who lost the tip of his little finger. This individual had been an assembly line worker, and this loss did not in any way affect his ability to perform his old job or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>job similar to it, but he was limited in his ability to be a typist, which is within the general field of common labor. Accordingly, under the old law, he had a limitation on his ability to perform work within his field of employment, and he was thus disabled. Under the new law, we will look only at work suitable to this man\u2019s qualifications and training. Since this man was trained and experienced as an assembly line worker, it is most likely that the loss of the tip of one finger will not in any way interfere with his ability to perform work suitable to his qualifications and training. Accordingly, he will not be disabled. [Welch, Worker\u2019s Compensation in Michigan (rev ed), \u00a7 8.11, pp 8-14 to 8-15.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">In the present case, plaintiff\u2019s job was to monitor and check gauges. In doing so, he ensured the proper operation of equipment such as the boiler and the turbine. It is uncontested that he remains able to perform these duties, i.e., work suitable to his qualifications and training. Plaintiff\u2019s ear specialist advised that plaintiff should avoid loud noise exposure to the extent possible. However, we agree with the magistrate that there is no evidence that performance of these duties was medically inadvisable or contraindicated. He is able to perform these duties whether in defendant\u2019s plant or any similar plant, with the protection of earplugs.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is insufficient, as illustrated in the previ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>ous example, that plaintiff may not be able to perform some work in the general field of common labor because of his hearing loss.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Plaintiff continued to perform his regular jobs under the same conditions as all other employees. As such, plaintiff has not met the burden of proving a limitation of wage-earning capacity.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">The wcac based its decision that plaintiff was disabled on the fact that he could no longer work in a noisy environment. This conclusion is improper for two reasons. First, as a factual matter, the magistrate found that plaintiff <em>is </em>able to work in a noisy environment with proper protection, which Dr. Henry indicated was a requirement for any person working in such an environment. Second, even assuming the inability to work in a noisy environment, a person is not compensably disabled within the meaning of the current definition if the employee remains able to perform work suitable to the employee\u2019s qualifications and training without limitation of wage-earning capac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>ity. On the basis of the facts as found by the magistrate and adopted by the wcac, as a matter of law, plaintiff has not sustained a disability because he has not met his burden of establishing that his wage-earning capacity has been limited by his hearing loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Therefore, we note that the present case is distinguishable from the line of cases, holding that a supervening, noncompensable injury does not suspend or bar compensation for an unrelated, preexisting partial disability.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> For example, in <em>Zimmerman v Cadillac Malleable Iron Co, </em>445 Mich 234; 518 NW2d 390 (1994), the plaintiff was determined to be partially dependent when he became totally disabled as a result of a nonworkrelated heart condition. The parties in <em>Zimmerman </em>agreed that the plaintiff was performing favored work. <em>Id. </em>at 241. In contrast, plaintiff was not partially disabled because he had no limitation of wage-earning capacity when his noncompensable manic depression rendered him totally disabled. Therefore, cases such as <em>Sotomayor v Ford Motor Co, </em>300 Mich 107; 1 NW2d 472 (1942), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number><em>Zimmerman, </em>have no application to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">In the present case, neither the magistrate, the wcac, nor the Court of Appeals held that plaintiff\u2019s work was favored or restricted. Defendant\u2019s efforts to reduce noise levels at its plant merely improved the work environment and were <em>not </em>done to accommodate plaintiff\u2019s hearing loss. The changes to the powerhouse do not transform plaintiff\u2019s job into favored work. Moreover, under <em>Powell, supra </em>at 348, plaintiff had \"accepted regular employment with ordinary conditions of permanency,\u201d which further indicates that plaintiff was not engaged in favored work.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Plaintiff has not met his burden of establishing that he sustained a limitation of his wage-earning capacity in work suitable to his qualifications and training. The current definition of disability narrows the scope of an. employee\u2019s eligibility for worker\u2019s compensation benefits. Pursuant to this definition of disability, plaintiff remains able to perform work suitable to his qualifications and training. Indeed, he continued to perform the exact job that he performed before his hearing loss. In light of this, plaintiff has no proven limitation of wage-earning capacity. We therefore hold that plaintiff is not compensably disabled within the current definition of the statute. The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b765-8\">Brickley, C.J., and Boyle, ., Mallett, and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-6\"> Bureau of Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation, December 2, 1988, slip op at 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\"> The magistrate concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">It was the opinion of Dr. Henry that plaintiff has sustained a hearing loss and related tinnitus as the result of noise exposure. He advised that plaintiff avoid loud noise exposure as much as possible in the future. However plaintiff\u2019s own testimony established that there had been a dramatic reduction in noise exposure beginning in 1987 with the construction of a sound proof office and the mandatory wearing of ear plugs. Given these safeguards, the proofs fail to establish that plaintiff\u2019s continued employment in the power house was medically contraindicated. We have no way of determining that the present noise levels exceed the noise restrictions suggested by Dr. Henry. We therefore cannot find that plaintiff was disabled from performing his work activity because of a work related hearing loss. [Id, slip op at 5-6.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\"> The wcac held that plaintiff was excluded from working in a noisy environment by the work-related condition and was therefore limited, where he was not limited before.

Defendant installed a soundproof office and mandated the wearing of ear plugs for the protection of all employees. Dr. Henry stated that plaintiff should not work in a noisy environment without adequate protection. However, he stated that he gave such advice to anyone who worked in a noisy environment. No evidence showed that plaintiff\u2019s return to work was medically contraindicated.

Although factually and procedurally similar, <em>Fraley </em>was decided under the previous definition of disability. The Court stated in pure dicta that under the current definition of disability, the plaintiff would also have suffered a limitation of wage-earning capacity in work suitable to his qualifications and training. Moreover, <em>Fraley </em>is distinguishable because the employer in <em>Fraley </em>did not rehire the plaintiff as a press operator, which was his occupation before his hearing loss. Instead, because of his hearing loss, the plaintiff was rehired as an assembler, which indicates that the work was favored.

Under the old law this was his or her \"field of employment.\u201d Under the new definition it is \"work suitable.to his or her qualifications and training.\u201d For an unskilled worker \"field of employment\u201d meant all unskilled jobs. Now, however, <em>the worker must show a limitation in the more narrow area </em>of \"work suitable to his or her qualifications and training.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-10\">The new definition also makes a substantive improvement in Michigan\u2019s law by closing a serious loophole. As indicated above, under the old law an unskilled worker was considered disabled if he or she had any limitation on his or her wage-earning capacity in the entire field of unskilled employment. <em>Adair v Metropolitan Building Co, </em>38 Mich App 393; 196 NW2d 335 (1972). Now a worker must show a limitation on the capacity to perform work suitable to his or her qualifications and training.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\"> Cf. <em>Hargis, </em>n 6 <em>supra, </em>which was decided under the previous definition of disability. In <em>Hargis, </em>this Court remanded a similar case to the Court of Appeals with instructions to remand to the wcab to address whether the plaintiff\u2019s work-related hearing loss was a compensable occupational disease pursuant to MCL 418.401 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.237(401) <em>et seq. </em>On remand to the wcab, it was held under the previous definition of disability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-8\">Plaintiff suffered no wage loss or impairment of earning capacity due to his hearing loss. Plaintiff\u2019s claimed disability, as revealed by his testimony, relates to his back rather than to his hearing. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony reveals that it was a conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>with Remer, rather than work-related difficulty with hearing, that gave rise to hearing claims. Dr. Waggoner, whose credentials are superior, believes the plaintiff to be able to work in any environment with proper protection and believes the plaintiff\u2019s hearing loss has stabilized and will not grow worse. Both doctors would not recommend work in a noisy environment to anyone, but do not opine that it presents any special hazard, contraindication, or inadvisability to the plaintiff. We again affirm the decision of the [hearing referee]. <em>[Hargis v Letts Drop Forge, </em>1989 WCABO 1677, 1686.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b763-6\"> The relevant inquiry is not whether there is a theoretical job in the employee\u2019s general field of employment that the employee is no longer able to perform. Instead, the question is whether the employee\u2019s wage-earning capacity, i.e., ability to earn wages, has been limited, considering the employee\u2019s qualifications and training.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b763-7\"> While a claimant\u2019s return to his preinjury job is strong evidence of an undiminished wage-earning capacity, such evidence is not necessarily dispositive. See 1C Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 57.22(c), pp 10-188 to 10-192.

The liability to pay compensation for partial disability has been determined by the department of labor and industry and the supervening leprosy and resulting confinement does not relieve defendant from such adjudicated liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">See also <em>Powell, supra, </em>in which this Court held that the inability of a partially disabled employee to continue performing favored work, accommodating the partial disability, does not preclude payment of benefits if a subsequent, supervening, nonwork-related injury outside the control of the employee renders the employee unable to work.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b765-9\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_k\">I concur in the result reached by the majority.

With the loss established, and restrictions imposed to prevent further loss, plaintiff is not in the same position as the individual not yet so impaired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">The record establishes that working around loud noises is what plaintiff did during his long tenure at defendant. It was, therefore, work suitable to his qualifications and training. It is no longer suitable. He thus has a limitation in his wage-earning capacity under either definition of disability. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">It is beside the point that there is work, within restrictions imposed by his work-related hearing loss, that plaintiff can do without risk of increasing that loss. The Magistrate declined to find that the work plaintiff was doing when he left defendant was not in that category: \"We have no way of determining that the present noise levels exceed the noise restrictions suggested by Dr. Henry.\u201d For that reason, as explained earlier, and as a matter of law, a date of injury at some time before plaintiff\u2019s last day worked, but still in 1987, must be assigned, and we proceed on the assumption that the work he did when he left defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>doing him no harm: it accommodated his disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-4\">While plaintiff could do that work, defendant was entitled to credit for wages earned at it pursuant to the provisions of MCL 418.361 [MSA 17.237(361)]. However, so long as the work-related hearing loss remains, entitlement to weekly benefits remains when plaintiff can no longer do that work. <em>[Powell v Casco Nelmor Corp, </em>406 Mich 332; 279 NW2d 769 (1979).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">Nor can plaintiff be considered to have voluntarily removed himself from the work force for having left without good and reasonable cause, the employment defendant was providing him.
