On January 16, 1987, Michael sustained debilitating injuries in an automobile accident, with the most serious being a closed head injury affecting the bilateral hemisphere of his brain. The injuries significantly impaired his physical and cognitive abilities, left him unable to walk or talk, and rendered him dependent on a colostomy for defecation and a gastrostomy tube for nutrition. Petitioner was appointed Michael\u2019s legal guardian and conservator. Michael resided at different nursing homes for the first few years after the accident until July 1990, when he was transferred to the New Medico Neurological Center (nmnc) in Howell, Michigan, where he was still residing at the time of the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">On January 9, 1992, while Michael was being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>treated at Butterworth Hospital for an obstructed bowel, petitioner contacted the hospital\u2019s bioethics committee for the purpose of determining whether Michael\u2019s life-sustaining medical treatment should be withdrawn. On January 15, 1992, after consulting with petitioner, a family friend, a social worker, Michael\u2019s treating physician, and nurses at Butterworth Hospital, the committee issued a report stating that withdrawal of Michael\u2019s nutritive support was both medically and ethically appropriate, but that court authorization would be required before the hospital would assist in the procedure. None of the personnel at the nmnc and no other members of Michael\u2019s family were consulted or notified by the committee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">On March 19, 1992, petitioner filed a petition in the probate court, requesting authorization to withdraw Michael\u2019s nutritive support. Respondents Leeta Martin and Patricia Major, who are Michael\u2019s mother and sister respectively, opposed the petition and also filed a petition of their own asking that Mary Martin be removed as Michael\u2019s guardian and conservator. An evidentiary hearing was held from October 13, 1992, through October 30, 1992, regarding the petition for authority to withdraw Michael\u2019s nutritive support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">Petitioner said that Michael was a private but active person before the accident. She claimed that he was always bothered by, and intolerant of, people who were disabled or dependent on others and often stated that he would rather die than be dependent on people and machines. According to petitioner, Michael would not want to be kept alive in his present condition. Two co-workers of Michael each testified that he had remarked to them before the accident that he would not want to continue living in a vegetative state. The remark was made to one of the co-workers during a casual conversation around the lunch table and to the other while discussing someone else who had been severely injured. Both co-workers testified that Michael\u2019s present condition is not the type Michael was referring to in the conversations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>before his accident. Respondent Patricia Major admitted that Michael once told her that he would not want to be kept alive by a respirator if he were in a coma.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">Conflicting testimony was presented regarding Michael\u2019s current level of physical, sensory, emotional, and cognitive functioning. At one extreme, Dr. Joseph Fischhoff, who is head of the Department of Psychiatry at Wayne State University and the chairman of the bioethics committee at Children\u2019s Hospital in Detroit, testified that Michael has no voluntary control over any of his limbs, or any ability to function on a voluntary level, and therefore lacks any meaningful interaction with his environment. However, Dr. Robert Kreitsch, who is the director of the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Program at the Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Center, testified that Michael demonstrated an ability to carry out some voluntary motor commands on his right side, including the ability to pinch and grasp, as well as the ability to recognize faces, respond emotionally, and communicate with others with head nods. According to Dr. Kreitsch, Michael seemed content with his environment and indicated \"no\u201d with a head nod when asked whether he has been in any pain or discomfort, and also when asked if there were ever any times when he felt that he did not want to go on living. Other medical experts also presented differing opinions regarding Michael\u2019s level of functioning, but generally described it as falling somewhere between that described by Drs. Fischhoff and Kreitsch. All medical experts agreed that Michael was not in a persistent vegetative state or terminally ill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">Petitioner, several therapists from the nmnc, and several lay witnesses all described an apparent limited ability by Michael to interact with others and to respond to simple yes or no questions with head nods; their testimony varied, however, with respect to the consistency and appropriateness of the perceived interaction and responses. The trial judge personally visited and questioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Michael at the nmnc on October 14, 1992. The judge explained on the record how Michael had moved both his right arm and right leg on command, and how he had responded with appropriate head nods to a series of yes or no questions. Witnesses also testified that there are times when Michael becomes completely withdrawn and does not respond to any stimuli.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">In a decision delivered from the bench on October 30, 1992, the trial court ruled that clear and convincing evidence had been presented that Michael did not want to be \"kept a dependent person\u201d and that his present condition \"falls within what Michael did not want to be.\u201d Nonetheless, the court held that Michael\u2019s intentions could not be considered because they were not expressed in writing. The trial court further ruled that withdrawal of nutritive support was in Michael\u2019s best interests, but that, absent being terminally ill, a best interests standard could not be applied as a matter of law. Accordingly, the trial court denied the petition for authority to withdraw Michael\u2019s nutritive support. The trial court then proceeded to also deny respondents\u2019 petition for removal of Mary Martin as Michael\u2019s guardian and conservator. The court concluded that her \"decision-making process\u201d relative to the decision to withdraw life-sustaining medical treatment was not inappropriate. Motions for reconsideration brought by both sides, including a request by respondents for specific factual findings, were thereafter denied. [200 Mich App 703, 706-710; 504 NW2d 917 (1993).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The Court of Appeals remanded the case \"for further and more specific findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding Michael\u2019s decision-making capacity ...[,] present condition or his present level of physical, sensory, emotional, and cognitive functioning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 717-718.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">On remand, additional evidence and medical testimony were presented to the trial court. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Court of Appeals aptly summarized the hearing testimony as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">According to Dr. William Vandenberg, a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist who works extensively with head-injured patients, Michael can understand only very short and very simple questions and cannot accurately comprehend questions that are lengthy, verbose, or that require the retention of multiple thoughts. Similar testimony was provided by Dr. Donald Rutherford, who is the medical director at the Glenwood Christian Nursing Home where Michael resides. Dr. Robert Kreitsch, who was one of respondents\u2019 main experts, likewise described Michael\u2019s levels of cognition and comprehension as being limited to \"very, very simple terms\u201d and \"some simple short phrases.\u201d According to Dr. Kreitsch, given Michael\u2019s memory deficiencies and inability to retain information, Michael is incapable of processing the necessary information to fully understand his condition. Drs. Vandenberg, Rutherford, and Kreitsch uniformly agreed that Michael does not possess the requisite capacity to satisfy the four-part test for evaluating decision-making capacity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">This same conclusion was also reached by Dr. Ronald Cranford, a neurologist, whose testimony was accorded significant weight by the trial court. Dr. Cranford provided detailed testimony describing not only Michael\u2019s condition and level of functioning from a medical standpoint, but also the process involved in assessing Michael\u2019s cognitive capabilities during a recent evaluation. Dr. Cranford\u2019s evaluation demonstrated that, consistent with the testimony of the other medical experts, Michael possesses an ability to understand some simple questions concerning basic and familiar items, although even then his responses are not always consistent, but that he lacks an understanding of more complex items, including his physical capabilities and medical condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">Although one of respondents\u2019 experts, Dr. Walter Zetusky, a neuropsychologist, testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>evaluated Michael in 1990 and determined that he had an intelligence quotient of sixty-three, thus placing him at a higher level of cognitive functioning than that described by the other medical experts, the trial court accorded little probative value to the iq testing. Significantly, the trial court noted that other medical experts questioned the validity of any iq testing of Michael, and, further, that another expert, Dr. David Winstrom, in fact attempted to perform similar testing on Michael in April 1993, but was unable to do so, given Michael\u2019s inability to respond at a sufficient level to permit testing. More importantly, the trial court observed that not even Dr. Zetusky was able to provide unqualified testimony indicating that Michael has sufficient capacity to satisfy the four-part test for evaluating decision-making capacity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">Finally, it was the general consensus among the medical experts that Michael\u2019s condition and cognitive level of functioning will not improve in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">Testimony was received from respondent Major as well as two of Michael\u2019s former co-workers describing statements made by Michael before his accident wherein he expressed a preference not to be maintained in a coma or in a vegetative state. The trial court found . . . that Michael\u2019s present circumstances do not conform to those described by Michael when making those prior statements. However, testimony was also received from petitioner, who described numerous statements that were made to her by Michael before his accident, on different occasions and in different settings and contexts, all expressing a preference not to be maintained under various described circumstances. According to petitioner, Michael was adamant and made it very clear that he did not want to be kept alive in the circumstances described. The trial court found that the statements were sufficient in detail to establish Michael\u2019s previously expressed preference to decline life-sustaining medical treatment under the present circumstances. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Prevalent throughout Michael\u2019s statements is the preference not to be maintained in a condition where he was incapable of performing basic functions such as walking, talking, dressing, bathing, or eating, and, instead, was dependent upon others or machines for his basic needs. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">Michael\u2019s discussions also reveal an express preference not to be maintained by machines in order to be kept alive. [205 Mich App 96, 100-104; 517 NW2d 749 (1994).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">On remand, after evaluating the evidence, the trial court found that the petitioner had demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that, before his injuries, Mr. Martin expressed a medical preference to decline life-sustaining medical treatment under the circumstances presented.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals concluded that, before his injuries, Mr. Martin specifically described circumstances under which he would decline life-sustaining medical treatment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It stated that Mr. Martin\u2019s present condition fit squarely within the parameters that Mr. Martin specifically described.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, it held that the trial court\u2019s determination was not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Although this case essentially concerns whether the appropriate evidentiary burden of proof has been met to support the lower courts\u2019 findings, the evidentiary issue may not be reached without first ascertaining whether the patient has a right to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment, and, if so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>whether a surrogate decisionmaker may exercise that right for a patient who is no longer able to do so for himself. After determining the extent of the right to decline life-sustaining medical treatment, we must decide how the surrogate is to effectuate the incompetent patient\u2019s decision, discern the appropriate evidentiary standard of proof, and determine whether the evidentiary standard has been satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The right to decline life-sustaining treatment has been based on constitutional, common-law, and statutory sources. The Court of Appeals in <em>In re Rosebush, </em>195 Mich App 675, 680; 491 NW2d 633 (1992), delineated the three sources of the right as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">(1) the common-law right to freedom from unwanted interference with bodily integrity,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">(2) the constitutional right to privacy or liberty, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-11\">(3) statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">By deciding that Michigan recognizes \"a right to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining medical treatment as an aspect of the common-law doctrine of informed consent,\u201d the <em>Rosebush </em>Court found it \"unnecessary to decide the validity of the constitutional or statutory bases in Michigan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 680, n 1. As a prominent commentator in this area has noted, \"the legal basis for the right to die is not important because courts have not made the scope of the right depend on whether or not the source is common-law[, statutory,] or constitutional.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Meisel, The Right to Die, \u00a7 3.4, p 50.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the evidentiary and decision-making standards appropriate in a given case do not depend on the source of the right, we need only ground the right in one source.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">We agree with the <em>Rosebush </em>Court that a necessary corollary of the common-law right to informed consent is the right not to consent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Cruzan v Director, Missouri Dep\u2019t of Health, </em>497 US 261, 270; 110 S Ct 2841; 111 L Ed 2d 224 (1990); <em>Werth v Taylor, </em>190 Mich App 141; 475 NW2d 426 (1991); <em>In re Conroy, </em>98 NJ 321, 346-348; 486 A2d 1209 (1985); Meisel, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3.3, p 47, n 20. As noted by the Arizona Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">The purpose underlying the doctrine of informed consent is defeated somewhat if, after receiving all information necessary to make an informed decision, the patient is forced to choose only from alternative methods of treatment and precluded from foregoing all treatment whatsoever. <em>[Rasmussen v Fleming, </em>154 Ariz 207, 216; 741 P2d 667 (1987).]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Thus, because we find that the common-law doctrine of informed consent allows a person to refuse life-sustaining treatment, we also decline the invitation to reach the propriety of the constitutional and statutory issues in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Given that a competent patient may decide to refuse medical treatment, the next inquiry is whether a decision to refuse medical treatment under the particular circumstances, made while competent, should be honored when the patient is incompetent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Other jurisdictions that have addressed this question have unanimously concluded that a decision to refuse medical treatment in future situations, made while competent, is not lost because of incompetency or the inability to communicate. See <em>Rasmussen, supra </em>at 219; <em>In re Eichner v Dillon, </em>73 AD2d 431, 470; 426 NYS2d 517 (1980) (\"To deny the exercise because the patient is unconscious is to deny the right\u201d); <em>Conroy, supra </em>at 359-361. We wish to make clear that we are deciding only that to the extent the right to refuse medical treatment \"refers to decisions already made and communicated by the patient before losing the capacity to make further choices, ... it is true that the patient\u2019s interest in having those choices honored must survive incapacity.\u201d Bopp &amp; Avila, <em>Perspectives on </em>Cruzan: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number><em>The sirens\u2019 lure of invented consent: A critique of autonomy-based surrogate decisionmaking for legally-incapacitated older persons, </em>42 Hastings L J 779, 806 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">A third person must implement an incompetent patient\u2019s previously expressed decisions. Michigan\u2019s patient advocate act, MCL 700.496; MSA 27.5496, supports allowing a third person to execute the decisions of patients who are no longer able to effectuate those decisions for themselves. Pursuant to the patient advocacy act,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a currently competent person designates a surrogate, the patient advocate, to make treatment decisions in the event the patient is incapacitated. A proper designation allows a third person to execute the patient\u2019s treatment decisions, even if the decision will result in death, provided the patient is in the condition delineated in the patient advocate designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Having concluded that a person\u2019s right to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment survives incompetency and may be discharged by a surrogate decisionmaker, we now address how the surrogate effectuates the incompetent patient\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">While the facts of this case present an issue of first impression in Michigan, we find guidance in the decisions of our sister states that have addressed the possible surrogate decision-making standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Courts have created \"two traditional [decision-making] standards for guiding guardians in carry<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ing out their responsibilities: the best interests standard and the substituted judgment standard.\u201d Meisel, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 9.6, p 264.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The best interest standard<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is an objective analysis under which the benefits and burdens to the patient of treatment are assessed by the surrogate in conjunction with any statements made by the patient if such statements are available. <em>Conroy, supra </em>at 360-368. The best interest analysis is generally invoked, if at all, only as a secondary approach when subjective evidence of a particular patient\u2019s decision is lacking because it involves a qualitative assessment of the patient\u2019s condition, a decision the state may legitimately decline to make. <em>Cruzan, supra </em>at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The substituted judgment standard has subjec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>tive and objective components. Through this standard, the surrogate attempts to ascertain, with as much specificity as possible, the decision the incompetent patient would make if he were competent to do so. The surrogate first determines whether the patient, while competent, explicitly stated his intent regarding the type of medical treatment in question. <em>In re Westchester Co Medical Center, </em>72 NY2d 517; 534 NYS2d 886; 531 NE2d 607 (1988). Where there is no explicit evidence of what the patient would choose, the surrogate may still decide to terminate treatment on the basis of evidence of the patient\u2019s \"value system.\u201d <em>In re Longeway Estate, </em>133 Ill 2d 33, 49; 549 NE2d 292 (1989). The surrogate should determine the patient\u2019s \"value system\u201d through an assessment of the patient\u2019s behavior during the time he was competent</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">\"including his or her philosophical, religious and moral views, life goals, values about the purpose of life and the way it should be lived, and attitudes toward sickness, medical procedures, suffering and death . . . .\u201d <em>[In re Jobes, </em>108 NJ 394, 415; 529 A2d 434 (1987), quoting Newman, <em>Treatment refusals for the critically ill: Proposed rules for the family, the physician and the state, </em>III NY LS Human Rights Annual 45-46 (1985).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Courts have generally acknowledged that the substituted judgment standard entails some level of objective analysis. <em>Conroy, supra </em>at 363-364. For this reason, commentators, as well as many judges, have forcefully assailed the substituted judgment standard as a legal fiction that in reality substitutes the surrogate\u2019s decision to withdraw treatment for that of the patient. See Bopp &amp; Avila, <em>supra; Cruzan, supra </em>at 285; <em>DeGrella v Elston, </em>858 SW2d 698, 710-711 (Ky, 1993) (Lambert, J., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>concurring); <em>In re Longeway Estate, supra </em>at 55 (Ward, J., dissenting) at 65 (Clark, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Rather than choose between the best interest standard and the substituted judgment standard, the New Jersey Supreme Court attempted to synthesize these two standards by creating an hierarchical decision-making continuum. <em>Conroy, supra. </em>The starting point on the continuum is anchored by a purely subjective analysis, an approach that requires more definitive evidence of what the patient would choose than the substituted judgment standard. The other end of the continuum is anchored by a purely objective analysis, which is, in essence, a best interest standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">We find that a purely subjective analysis is the most appropriate standard to apply under the circumstances of this case. The pure subjective standard allows the surrogate to withhold life-sustaining treatment from an incompetent patient \"when it is clear that the particular patient would have refused the treatment under the circumstances involved.\u201d <em>Conroy, supra </em>at 360. Given that the right the surrogate is seeking to effectuate is the incompetent patient\u2019s right to control his own life, \"[t]he question is not what a reasonable or average person would have chosen to do under the circumstances but what the particular patient would have done if able to choose for himself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360-361. The patient\u2019s statements, made while competent, must illustrate \"a firm and settled commitment to the termination of life supports under the circumstances like those presented.\u201d <em>In re Westchester, supra </em>at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The subjective and objective standards involve conceptually different bases for allowing the surrogate to make treatment decisions. The subjective standard is based on a patient\u2019s right to self-determination, while the objective standard is grounded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>in the state\u2019s parens patriae power. <em>Conroy, supra, Cruzan v Harmon, </em>760 SW2d 408 (Mo, 1988). An objective, best interest, standard cannot be grounded in the common-law right of informed consent because the right and the decision-making standard inherently conflict. The Illinois Supreme Court recently explained this conflict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">The problem with the best-interests test is that it lets another make a determination of a patient\u2019s quality of life, thereby undermining the foundation of self-determination and inviolability of the person upon which the right to refuse medical treatment stands. [In re <em>Longeway Estate, supra </em>at 49.][<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Thus, while the facts of the present case do not require that we decide whether the state\u2019s parens patriae authority may be expansive enough to encompass a best interest analysis, we do note that such an analysis cannot be based on the common-law right of informed consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Although respondent accurately notes that the Florida Supreme Court in <em>In re Guardianship of Browning, </em>568 So 2d 4, 13 (Fla, 1990), believed that the common-law right of self-determination \"cannot be qualified by the condition of the patient,\u201d any move from a purely subjective standard to an analysis that encompasses objective criteria is grounded in the state\u2019s parens patriae power, not in the common-law right of informed consent or self-determination. Thus, while the clearly expressed wishes of a patient, while competent, should be honored regardless of the patient\u2019s condition, we find nothing that prevents the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>from grounding any objective analysis on a threshold requirement of pain, terminal illness, foreseeable death, a persistent vegetative state, or affliction of a similar genre.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">While the circumstances of some cases have led courts to progress along the decision-making continuum and apply tests that encompass more objective criteria, see <em>Conroy </em>and <em>Rosebush, supra, </em>the facts of this case do not present us with that situation. In the cases that have applied a more objective test or suggested that an objective test would be proper, the patient generally has been comatose or in a persistent vegetative state, <em>In re Jobes, supra; In re Torres, </em>357 NW2d 332 (Minn, 1984) (terminally ill); <em>In re Guardianship of Barry, </em>445 So 2d 365 (Fla App, 1984) (experiencing great pain); <em>Conroy, supra </em>at 365 (very limited life expectancy); <em>In re Rosebush, supra </em>(never been competent or able to express her wishes or desires).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In this case, Michael\u2019s life and health are not threatened by infirmities of this nature. Because he was competent and able to express his wishes and desires, we decline to move along the contin\u00faum from the subjective standard.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>In all cases where the courts have been persuaded that the patient, while competent, made clear and convincing statements that he would reject treatment under the circumstances at issue, the patient\u2019s decision has been honored, regardless of whether the patient is currently competent. The Kentucky Supreme Court recently noted that all but Missouri<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and New York<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> would allow treatment to be withdrawn under a substituted judgment standard even where the express wishes of the patient are unclear. <em>DeGrella, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Missouri and New York only allow treatment to be withheld when it is clear that the particular patient, while competent, expressly decided to reject treatment in the circumstances presented. <em>In re Westchester, supra </em>at 531-532; <em>Cruzan v Harmon, </em>760 SW2d 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The subjective standard has been attacked as possibly creating too stringent a standard, inhu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>manely condemning a patient to a \"prolonged and painful death,\u201d <em>Conroy, supra </em>at 364, however, the facts of this case do not dictate that we progress beyond a purely subjective standard, and we refuse to do so. We cannot stress too strongly that the complexity and ramifications of any decision in this area caution against moving too swiftly or adopting controversial decision-making standards in cases that do not present facts compelling such decision. The right of informed consent extends only to the decisions this particular patient has made. Any objective analysis is not encompassed within the right of informed consent. As we noted at the outset, if we are to err, we must err in preserving life. Our first step in this area must be a careful one.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Having concluded that a surrogate may make treatment decisions for a patient who is unable to do so on the basis of that specific patient\u2019s statements made while competent, we must now decide the evidentiary standard of proof those statements must meet before the surrogate is allowed to effectuate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Proof may be required by a preponderance of the evidence, by clear and convincing evidence, or beyond a reasonable doubt. The predominant evidentiary standard chosen by the courts that have addressed this question, however, is clear and convincing evidence. Meisel, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8.38, p 254. In affirming the Missouri Supreme Court\u2019s choice of the clear and convincing evidence standard, the United States Supreme Court explained why the clear and convincing evidence standard should be chosen over the preponderance standard.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>We think it self-evident that the interests at stake in the instant proceedings are more substantial, both on an individual and societal level, than those involved in a run-of-the-mine civil dispute. <em>[Cruzan, </em>497 US 283.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Because the party who bears the more stringent burden of proof also bears a greater risk of an adverse decision, the Court found it proper to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">place an increased risk of an erroneous decision on those seeking to terminate an incompetent individual\u2019s life-sustaining treatment. An erroneous decision not to terminate results in a maintenance of the status quo; the possibility of subsequent developments such as advancements in medical science, the discovery of new evidence regarding the patient\u2019s intent, changes in the law, or simply the unexpected death of the patient despite the administration of life-sustaining treatment at least create the potential that a wrong decision will eventually be corrected or its impact mitigated. An erroneous decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment, however, is not susceptible of correction. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Litigants also have argued for adoption of the \"beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> although no court has embraced this stringent of a standard. Meisel, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8.38, p 254. Generally, \"the 'beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 standard historically has been reserved for criminal cases,\u201d and the Supreme Court has cautioned against \"applying] it too broadly or casually in noncriminal cases.\u201d <em>Addington v Texas, </em>441 US 418, 428; 99 S Ct 1804; 60 L Ed 2d 323 (1979). Because the decision to refuse life-sustaining treatment is not a punitive exercise of the state\u2019s authority, we agree that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>criminal standard \"is inappropriate in cases where the purpose of granting the relief is to give effect to an individual\u2019s right by carrying out his stated intentions.\u201d <em>In re Storar, </em>52 NY2d 363, 379; 420 NE2d 64 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">We agree that the clear and convincing evidence standard, the most demanding standard applied in civil cases,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> is the proper evidentiary standard for assessing whether a patient\u2019s statements, made while competent, indicate a desire to have treatment withheld.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Evidence is clear and convincing when it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">\"producefs] in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established, evidence so clear, direct and weighty and convincing as to enable [the factfinder] to come to a clear conviction, without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise facts in issue.\u201d . . . Evidence may be uncontroverted, and yet not be \"clear and convincing.\u201d . . . Conversely, evidence may be \"clear and convincing\u201d despite the fact that it has been contradicted. <em>[In re Jobes, supra </em>at 407-408.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Among the factors identified as important in defining clear and convincing evidence, see <em>In re Westchester, supra; Eichner, supra, </em>the predomi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>nant factor is \"a prior directive in which the patient addresses the situations in which the patient would prefer that medical intervention cease.\u201d Cantor, Legal Frontiers of Death and Dying, ch 3, p 64. Optimally, the prior directive would be expressed in a living will, patient advocate designation, or durable power of attorney. While a written directive would provide the most concrete evidence of the patient\u2019s decisions, and we strongly urge all persons to create such a directive, we do not preclude consideration of oral statements, made under the proper circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The amount of weight accorded prior oral statements depends on the remoteness, consistency, specificity, and solemnity of the prior statement. Conroy, <em>supra </em>at 362. The decisionmaker should examine the statement to determine whether it was a well thought out, deliberate pronouncement or a casual remark made in reaction to the plight of another. <em>In re Westchester, supra </em>at 529. Statements made in response to seeing or hearing about another\u2019s prolonged death do not fulfill the clear and convincing standard.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">If such statements were routinely held to be clear and convincing proof of a general intent to decline all medical treatment once incompetency sets in, few nursing home patients would ever receive life-sustaining medical treatment in the future. The aged and infirm would be placed at grave risk if the law uniformly but unrealistically treated the expression of such sentiments as a calm and deliberative resolve to decline all life-sustaining medical assistance once the speaker is silenced by mental disability. <em>[Id. </em>at 532.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">While the degree of similarity between the physical conditions contemplated in the patient\u2019s prior statement and the patient\u2019s current physical sit\u00faa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>tion also partakes of the fiction of substituted judgment, we do not exclude it as a factor to be considered in assessing the probative value of the prior statement. Only when the patient\u2019s prior statements clearly illustrate a serious, well thought out, consistent decision to refuse treatment under these exact circumstances, or circumstances highly similar to the current situation, should treatment be refused or withdrawn. In all events, the proofs in sum must meet the exacting standard of clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">In the present case, appellants claim that Mr. Martin expressed a preaccident statement that he did not want to live like a vegetable. However, our review of the record reveals that virtually all the witnesses agreed that Mr. Martin is not in a vegetative state and is not suffering from the type of incapacitation referenced in his expression of a desire not to continue life-sustaining medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Appellants argue that Mary Martin\u2019s uncorroborated affidavit and trial testimony do not constitute clear and convincing evidence of Mr. Martin\u2019s preinjury desire to refuse hydration and nutritive support. Appellants argue that, assuming Mary Martin\u2019s statements are truthful representations of statements made by Mr. Martin, the remarks,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">if truly made to the Guardian, were remote in time and place from his present circumstances. At the time the remarks were supposedly made, Michael was young and healthy. The remarks were general, vague and casual, because Mr. Martin was not presently experiencing and likely never had experienced the form of \"helplessness\u201d he supposedly disliked, and thus, he could not bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>to bear his specific views about specific circumstances of which he was intimately knowledgeable. Not being informed by his actual experience, Michael\u2019s purported remarks thus were \"no different than those that many of us might make after witnessing an agonizing death of another.\u201d [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Appellee responds that there was no evidence that Mr. Martin\u2019s decision regarding prolonged existence on artificial life support has ever changed. Thus, appellee argues that a competent person\u2019s strongly held and well thought out decisions about treatment, if proven by clear and convincing evidence, should not be superseded without equally clear and convincing evidence that the person, now incompetent, understands his condition and has changed his mind about previously expressed treatment desires.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Our review of the lower court records reveals that, in determining whether clear and convincing evidence was presented to establish that Mr. Martin had previously expressed a preference to decline life-sustaining medical treatment under the present circumstances, the trial court relied on petitioner\u2019s testimony and supporting affidavit in which she stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">4. Discussions between Mike and me regarding what our wishes would be if either of us was ever involved in a serious accident, had a disabling or terminal illness or was dying of old age, began approximately eight years ago. These discussions occurred on many different occasions. As I indicate below, several were triggered by movies which we saw together. Mike\u2019s position was always the same: he did not want to be kept alive on machines and he made me promise that I would never permit it..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">5. Some of the conversations that we had about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>medical care in this context occurred after we watched movies about people who no longer were mentally competent either due to illness, accident, or old age; others involved people who could no longer do anything for themselves, such as persons who lived in a nursing home and could no longer feed or dress themselves and needed to wear diapers or have other measures taken to continue existing. Mike stated to me on several occasions: \"That\u2019s bullshit, I would never want to live like that.\u201d He also said to me, \"Please don\u2019t ever let me exist that way because those people don\u2019t even have their dignity.\u201d I always agreed with Mike because I felt the same way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">6. One movie that always triggered such discussions was \"Brian\u2019s Song\u201d which, I recall, is a movie about a football player with a terminal illness. Mike said to me after we saw it together: \"If I ever get sick don\u2019t put me on any machines to keep me going if there is no hope of getting better.\u201d He also said that if I ever put him on machines to keep him alive: \"I\u2019ll always haunt you, Mary.\u201d Then he would say, \"Do you understand?\u201d I always said \"Yes.\u201d We watched this movie at least two or three times and had virtually the same discussion each time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">7. Some movies that triggered our discussions were about accidents\u2014car accidents, hunting accidents or other accidents near home or in water. Mike was an avid hunter and frequently expressed concerned [sic] about a hunting accident. Mike frequently told me that if he ever had an accident from which he would \"not recover\u201d and \"could not be the same person,\u201d he did \"not want to live that way.\u201d He would say, \"Mary, promise me you wouldn\u2019t let me live like that if I can\u2019t be the person I am right now, because if you do, believe me I\u2019ll haunt you every day of your life.\u201d I stated my promise to him and made him promise me the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">8. Mike also made a lot of comments to me about never wanting to live \"like a vegetable.\u201d He said that if anyone had to live like a vegetable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>\"their families and doctors should be shot for forcing someone to live like that.\u201d He would say, \"I\u2019d be pissed if I had to live that way.\u201d He also told me that he believed it was unfair to the person who had to be kept alive on machines because that person would always be in pain. He told me that \"no one should have to be kept alive if they would never get well again.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">9. December 1986 was the last time that I remember discussing this subject with Mike. I was having surgery on New Years\u2019 Eve Day and we discussed our wishes if either of us was severely incapacitated. The impending surgery prompted me to tell Mike of my wishes not to be maintained artificially. Mike then told me that he would respect my wishes and he expected the same in return if anything ever happened to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">10. I am certain that were Mike able to speak today, he would direct that the artificial life support and antibiotic treatments be withdrawn so that he might die in a dignified manner consistent with his explicit wishes expressed to me prior to the accident. It is time that my husband be freed from the ghastly, demeaning existence which he so strongly opposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">11. I know that Mike spoke with some of his coworkers about his disdain for being maintained by artificial means of life support. One of those coworkers, Warren Hawley, specifically discussed this with me at the time Mike was admitted to the Grand Valley Nursing Home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">This testimony and affidavit cannot be viewed in a vacuum. There was also testimony from two of Mr. Martin\u2019s co-workers, stating that Mr. Martin\u2019s present condition is not the type referred to in conversations with them before his injury. Dr. Kreitsch testified that Mr. Martin seemed content with his environment. Dr. Kreitsch, several therapists, and several lay witnesses testified that Mr. Martin could respond to simple yes or no questions by nodding his head. They also testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>indicated a no response when asked if he ever felt that he did not want to continue living.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">We do not believe that the testimony and affidavit of Mary Martin, Mr. Martin\u2019s wife and guardian, constitute clear and convincing evidence of Mr. Martin\u2019s preinjury statement of his desire to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment under these specific circumstances. We are not satisfied that the evidence is \"so clear, direct and weighty and convincing as to enable [the factfinder] to come to a clear conviction, without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise facts in issue.\u201d <em>Cruzan, </em>497 US 285, n 11. Thus, the clear and convincing evidence standard has not been satisfied.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">In the absence of clear and convincing evidence of Mr. Martin\u2019s preinjury statement expressing his decision to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment under the present circumstances, we will not authorize the removal of life-sustaining medical treatment. Our determination is consistent with the furtherance of this state\u2019s interest in preserving the sanctity of life and does not abridge Mr. Martin\u2019s right to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">We hold that., once it is determined that the individual is conscious and was competent at some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>time before his present injuries were sustained, a surrogate decisionmaker cannot make a decision for or in place of a conscious incapacitated individual regarding his decision to waive the right to continue life-sustaining medical treatment. However, where the surrogate decisionmaker can establish by clear and convincing evidence that the conscious incapacitated individual, while competent, made a statement of his desire to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment under these circumstances, then the surrogate must be allowed to effectuate the incapacitated individual\u2019s expressed preference. In the absence of clear and convincing evidence of the conscious incapacitated individual\u2019s preinjury statement expressing his decision to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment under the present circumstances, courts will not authorize the removal of life-sustaining medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals determination because petitioner\u2019s testimony and affidavit do not constitute clear and convincing evidence of Mr. Martin\u2019s preinjury decision to decline life-sustaining medical treatment in the form of a gastrostomy tube that provides hydration and nutritive support.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b504-7\">Brickley, C.J., and Cavanagh, Boyle, Riley, and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Mallett, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-12\"> 447 Mich 980 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b477-13\"> 205 Mich App 96, 98-99; 517 NW2d 749 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b477-14\"> <em>Id </em>at 112.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b484-9\"> 205 Mich App 98-99.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b484-10\"> <em>Id. </em>at 104.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b484-11\"> <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b484-12\"><em> Id. </em>at 102, 105-106.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b486-8\"> Whether a patient\u2019s prerogative to spurn life-preserving treatment is grounded on constitutional privacy or on the common law doctrine of informed consent, the object remains to honor individual dignity by promoting self-determination and choice.

On the second issue, I do not agree with the majority that, on the facts of this case, life-sustaining medical treatment can only be removed with clear and convincing evidence of the patient\u2019s expressed preinjury wishes. I would not reach the question what showing, other than clear and convincing evidence, would justify withdrawal of life-sustaining medical treatment, because the trial court did not clearly err in finding that clear and convincing evidence was presented that Michael Martin, before his injury, did not want to be kept alive in his current condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The Court of Appeals began by noting that a competent adult has a right to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment, and that an incompetent patient, while not losing this right, must have it exercised by a surrogate decisionmaker.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court explained that if a patient has the capacity to decide whether to accept life-sustaining medical treatment, it is his decision to make. Before the choice can be made by anyone other than the patient, there must be clear and convincing evidence that the patient lacks this capacity and will not regain it in the future. If such evidence is shown, a decisionmaker should then ask whether there is clear and convincing evidence of the patient\u2019s previously expressed desires regarding life support under the conditions in which the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>finds the patient to be. If so, those desires must be effectuated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is a purely subjective inquiry into the patient\u2019s prior wishes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Up to this point, the majority and the Court of Appeals would apply a similar analysis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The majority does not dispute the trial and appellate courts\u2019 conclusion that Michael Martin permanently lacks the capacity to exercise his right to have life-sustaining medical treatment removed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The majority disagrees with the finding that clear and convincing evidence has been presented of Michael Martin\u2019s preinjury wishes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">In ruling that clear and convincing evidence has not been presented, the majority becomes the first disinterested body to examine Michael Martin\u2019s case without being convinced by the ample evidence of his prior wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The bioethics committee of the hospital caring for Michael concluded that the request to remove life-sustaining medical treatment \"was in accord with Mr. Martin\u2019s wishes as expressed . . . prior to his injury.\u201d The court-appointed guardian ad litem\u2014whose role is to represent Michael\u2019s best interests\u2014also recommended the withdrawal of life support. The trial court and Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>agreed that Michael \"clearly and convincingly reveal[ed] his expressed preference to decline life-sustaining medical treatment under the circumstances presented.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Evidence is \"clear and convincing\u201d when it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">\"produce[s] in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established, evidence so clear, direct and weighty and convincing as to enable [the factfinder] to come to a clear conviction, without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise facts in issue.\u201d[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The probative value of a once-competent patient\u2019s past statements about life-sustaining medical treatment varies, \"depending on the[ir] remoteness, consistency, and thoughtfulness,\u201d as well as their specificity and the maturity of the person making the statement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">An appellate court may only reverse a trial court\u2019s findings of fact if they are clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead of respecting the trial court\u2019s role as factfinder, the majority has engaged in a de novo review of the facts. It ignores the admonition that in cases like this an appellate court \"must also be cognizant of the profound responsibility which has been vested in the trial court and should not substitute its judgment for that of a trial court.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">The evidence adduced at trial demonstrated Michael\u2019s deeply felt, consistent, and long-term desire not to be maintained artificially in a helpless condition. Michael\u2019s sister Patricia Major\u2014one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>the appellants seeking to keep him alive\u2014testified that even as a teenager Michael told her seriously that he did not want to be maintained on a respirator while unconscious. He later told friends and co-workers that \"if he ever was in a [sic] accident &amp; was in a vegetable [sic] state, he hoped someone pulled the plug.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The majority dismisses these statements because they referred to a persistent vegetative state, rather than Michael\u2019s current condition.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But the bioethics committee concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">the persistence of [Mr. Martin\u2019s] condition and the level of functioning were equivalent to a persistent vegetative state for purposes-of considering the removal of nutrition support ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">While not vegetative, Michael has minimal cognition and essentially no ability to communicate. Additionally, as one physician testified, when laypersons express a desire not to be a \"vegetable,\u201d they usually are not referring strictly to a persistent vegetative state. Rather, the popular understanding involves a \"spectrum of things, but the commonality of that is, independence of life . . . things in terms of basic needs of [the] human body,\u2014bathing, eating and able to void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Moreover, Michael did not refer only to life as a \"vegetable.\u201d These statements must be viewed in combination with the testimony of Mary Martin. Mary testified about a series of conversations with Michael over a period of years, in which he expressed his desire not to be kept alive artificially if \"he had to be dependent on people and machines . . . .\u201d She testified that his concern was not with being unconscious, but with being dependent on others for the most basic bodily functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>As the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">Prevalent throughout Michael\u2019s statements is the preference not to be maintained in a condition where he was incapable of performing basic functions such as walking, talking, dressing, bathing, or eating, and, instead, was dependent upon others or machines for his basic needs. This is exactly the condition in which Michael now finds himself.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The conversations between Michael and Mary were not merely idle talk or emotional reactions to watching other persons suffer.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Mary testified that the last conversation occurred as she was awaiting surgery for internal hemorrhaging. Michael and Mary each promised not to leave the other dependent on artificial life support, should such a tragedy occur. Mary\u2019s affidavit reported that Michael told her on one occasion that if she left him dependent on machines, \"I\u2019ll always haunt you, Mary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Not even the two appellants seeking to keep Michael alive offer any basis for questioning the veracity of this testimony. Michael\u2019s sister, Patricia Major, conceded she had no reason to doubt that these conversations had occurred.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> His mother, Leeta Martin, also testified that before the accident, Michael \"would not have wanted to be helpless and dependent on others.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AB4\">Other courts have found clear and convincing evidence of prior expressed wishes from similar or less compelling testimony than that in this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>See, e.g., <em>In re Swan, </em>569 A2d 1202, 1205 (Me, 1990), affirming a finding of clear and convincing evidence of a prior expressed decision where a seventeen-year-old patient, after seeing or hearing of others receiving life-sustaining medical treatment, had twice expressed orally a desire not to be maintained artificially, <em>Elbaum v Grace Plaza of Great Neck, </em>148 AD2d 244, 249-254; 544 NYS2d 840 (1989), ruling that oral statements to family members made over a period of years, most of which were in response to observing others receiving life-sustaining medical treatment, constituted clear and convincing evidence of the patient\u2019s prior wishes.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The majority insists that a person\u2019s wishes are not clearly known unless the applicable medical conditions are accurately specified.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In effect, this requirement will force most persons to seek legal assistance to assure that their wishes will be effectuated. By referring to being \"dependent\u201d or a \"vegetable,\u201d Michael was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">\"express[ing] [his] wishes in the only terms familiar to [him], and ... as clearly as a lay person should be asked to express them. To require more is unrealistic, and for all practical purposes, it precludes the right of patients to forego life-sustaining treatment.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>The majority also states that \"[statements made in response to seeing or hearing about another\u2019s prolonged death do not fulfill the clear and convincing standard.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This bright-line rule ignores that many persons only consider their own mortality seriously upon hearing about the end of other people\u2019s lives. Admittedly, the emotional content of such statements must be carefully considered in weighing their probative value. But the majority\u2019s \"categorical exclusion of [this] relevant evidence dispenses with any semblance of accurate factfinding.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The majority\u2019s treatment of the evidence in this case suggests that it would require a highly formal oral or written statement concerning the patient\u2019s specific medical condition. To impose such rules would be unrealistic.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Petitioner presented clear and convincing evidence of her husband\u2019s prior wishes. As a result, I would not decide in this case whether the search for clear and convincing evidence of a patient\u2019s previously expressed wishes needs to be followed by another subjective inquiry, an objective inquiry, or some amalgam of the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Although the trial court found that clear and convincing evidence had been presented, the Court of Appeals outlined additional steps for a decision-maker to take when such evidence is lacking. It stated that in such a case, the decisionmaker, should next apply a \"substituted judgment\u201d standard. This would require some trustworthy evidence of the patient\u2019s preinjury wishes, even if less than clear and convincing evidence. In addition, if this evidence suggests the patient would want treatment withdrawn under the conditions that exist, the court must also decide that the burdens of prolonged life outweigh its benefits before allowing withdrawal.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Finally, if there is no evidence at all of the patient\u2019s prior wishes, the Court of Appeals stated that a pure best interests standard should be applied. This is also referred to as an \"objective\u201d test, because it seeks to determine a patient\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>objective best interests rather than his subjective wishes.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-4\">The logic of this sequential analysis is rooted in the fact that, as we progress from one step to the next, we are moving away from deferring to the wishes of the patient to the point where we allow others (fiduciaries, family members, ethics committees, and courts) to decide whether the patient will live or die without reference to the patient\u2019s wishes. Our premise is that this should not be permitted except as a last resort, given society\u2019s reverence for life and its acknowledgment that patients have an inherent right of self-determination. Nevertheless, we may not eliminate [the pure best interests approach] because to do so would be to hold that where the patient is incompetent, never expressed a preference, and the court cannot determine what the patient would do under existing circumstances, life support may never be withdrawn. That is not the current state of the law.[<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">This approach originated with the New Jersey Supreme Court decision in <em>In re Conroy,</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and has been praised by commentators.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The majority would make Michigan one of a small minority of states to forbid termination of life support unless clear and convincing evidence is presented that the patient has expressly stated his wishes that it be removed under the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>conditions applicable.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Courts have attached differing meanings to terms such as \"clear and convincing\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> or \"substituted judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> But most courts to address this issue have permitted termination of life-sustaining medical treatment on the basis of an objective test, or at least a more lenient subjective standard than the one required by the majority.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> These cases typically seek to respect the patient\u2019s wishes whenever they can be determined without \"foreclos[ing] the possibility of humane actions, which may involve termination of life-sustaining treatment, for persons who never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>clearly expressed their desires about life-sustaining treatment. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The majority first chooses to apply only a purely subjective inquiry in this case. It notes that \"the evidentiary and decision-making standards appropriate in a given case do not depend on the source of the right;\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> yet its analysis rests on its choice of informed consent as the sole basis for the right to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment in this case. The majority rightly points out that the substituted judgment standard, and especially the best interests standard, \"entail[] some level of objective analysis.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> But this has not constrained other courts to look solely at the patient\u2019s prior expressed wishes. Instead, courts have employed their parens patriae authority to allow surrogate decision making with both objective and subjective inquiries.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">But with little discussion, the majority declines to make use of its parens patriae power.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The majority claims that cases adopting an approach with objective elements have generally involved patients in circumstances different than Michael Martin.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The majority offers no convincing expla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>nation why Michael Martin\u2019s condition must be treated differently.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Implicit in the majority\u2019s refusal to inquire into those benefits and burdens seems to be a judgment that the costs of not making that inquiry are less than for patients in other circumstances. The majority seems to assume that life in Michael Martin\u2019s situation is somehow more tolerable for him. This suspicion is heightened by the majority\u2019s suggestion that an objective inquiry into Michael Martin\u2019s best interests would support maintaining him on life-sustaining medical treatment.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> This conclusion, however, is flatly contradicted by the court-appointed guardian ad litem, who concluded that removing life-sustaining medical treatment would be in Michael\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">After limiting the inquiry to the patient\u2019s prior expressed wishes, the majority compounds its error by imposing a heightened standard of proof. The majority recognizes the principle that \"a decision to refuse medical treatment in future situations, made while competent, is not lost because of incompetency or the inability to communicate.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Yet its \"clear and convincing\u201d burden of proof will have that effect in many cases, including this one.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>As one court has recently noted, the patient\u2019s \"right to self determination would not be protected, but rather, might well be negated\u201d if life-sustaining medical treatment withdrawal were forbidden absent clear and convincing evidence of a patient\u2019s prior expressed wishes addressed to the current condition.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Under the majority\u2019s approach, courts inevitably will reject trustworthy evidence concerning a patient\u2019s prior wishes on the ground that it fails to meet the clear and convincing evidence standard. As one comment\u00e1tor stated, \"those few states that require a 'clear and convincing\u2019 standard of evidence will likely fail to honor an incompetent patient\u2019s desires.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">V'</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The majority characterizes its ruling as a cautious approach to a life-or-death decision.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> It suggests that \" '[a]n erroneous decision not to terminate [life-sustaining medical treatment] results in a maintenance of the status quo\u2019 \u201d and that such an error can be corrected in the future.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> But keeping Michael Martin alive is not the neutral, safe solution. As Justice Brennan stated in <em>Cruzan,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">from the point of view of the patient, an erroneous decision in either direction is irrevocable. An erroneous decision to terminate artificial nutrition and hydration, to be sure, will lead to . . . complete brain death. An erroneous decision not to terminate life support, however, robs a patient of the very qualities protected by the right to avoid unwanted medical treatment. His own degraded existence is perpetuated; his family\u2019s suffering is pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>tracted; the memory he leaves behind becomes more and more distorted.[<footnotemark>47</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The majority\u2019s tightly constricted inquiry greatly increases this risk. In this case, it has sentenced Michael Martin to life in a helpless, degraded condition against his prior wishes. To quote the majority\u2019s own opinion, \"to condemn persons to lives from which they cry out for release is nothing short of barbaric.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-9\"> <em>In re Martin (After Remand), </em>205 Mich App 96, 99; 517 NW2d 749 (1994) <em>(Martin II).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-8\"> <em>In re Martin, </em>200 Mich App 703, 713; 504 NW2d 917 (1993) <em>(Martin I).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b506-9\"><em> Id., </em>p 713.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b506-10\"> Meisel, The Right to Die, \u00a7 9.10, p 270.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b506-11\"> As the majority notes, the requirement of clear and convincing evidence is not an entirely different standard.
