These consolidated cases present the question whether a prosecutor may withdraw from a plea bargain that includes a sentence agreement when the court intends to impose a sentence lower than the agreement calls for.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">We hold that a court may not accept a plea bargain containing a sentence agreement but impose a lower sentence than that agreed to. Because such action trespasses on the prosecutor\u2019s charging authority, the people must be given an opportunity to withdraw from the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">We affirm the Court of Appeals in <em>Jefferson </em>and would affirm in <em>Siebert </em>and <em>Oatman </em>insofar as these decisions held that a prosecutor may withdraw in this situation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Codefendants Raymond Oatman and Douglas Siebert were charged, in one information, with delivery of cocaine in an amount exceeding 650 grams,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and conspiracy to deliver cocaine in an amount exceeding 650 grams.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Conviction of either of these offenses carries a mandatory penalty of life imprisonment without parole. In another information, they were charged with conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to deliver. A third information charged defendant Siebert with conspiracy to gamble and gambling or taking bets.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">At the codefendants\u2019 pretrial conferences, they advised the trial court judge that each of them had entered into a plea agreement with the prosecutor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>The nearly identical written agreements, signed by the parties, were incorporated into the record at the prosecution\u2019s request. Each agreement called for the defendant to provide information to law enforcement agencies, to cooperate with them, and to testify truthfully at any court proceedings. The agreements provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-4\">[a]fter the Prosecutor\u2019s Office has satisfied itself with [the defendant\u2019s] compliance . . ., the Prosecutor\u2019s Office agrees to allow [the defendant] to plead guilty to the offenses of Conspiracy to Deliver 225 grams or more but less than 650 grams of cocaine and Delivery of 225 grams or more but less than 650 grams of cocaine, contrary to MCLA 333.7401(2)[(a)](ii) [MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(ii)], with a sentence agreement of twenty (20) to thirty (30) years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Twenty years was the statutory minimum sentence at the time these defendants were charged. The trial court accepted defendants Siebert\u2019s and Oatman\u2019s pleas to these offenses on October 31 and November 1, 1990, respectively. Before defendant Oatman\u2019s plea, the prosecutor specifically raised the sentence agreement with the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\"><em>Mr. Bernier: </em>Your Honor, I also indicate that we had in there a plea agreement of 20 to 30 years. I understand the Court does not enter into plea agreements with the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\"><em>The Court: </em>Well, that\u2019s simply redundant, because that\u2019s the required sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-8\"><em>Mr. Bernier: </em>I understand, your Honor. I just wanted to point out that it is a term of the agreement, but I understand the Court\u2019s philosophy on the matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">Sentencing was deferred to enable the court to obtain presentence reports and to allow Siebert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>and Oatman to perform according to their agreements. The court held a joint presentence conference on October 16, 1991, at which the judge stated that he felt free to impose a minimum sentence below twenty years if he found substantial and compelling reasons to do so, pursuant to MCL 333.7401(4); MSA 14.15(7401)(4). Following this, he asked whether this would influence the prosecutor\u2019s position regarding the plea agreements. The prosecutor responded that, depending on the sentence the court planned to impose, he would withdraw his consent to the plea agreement, pursuant to <em>People v Killebrew.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">At defendant Siebert\u2019s sentencing hearing, law enforcement officers testified that his cooperation and assistance had been extensive and very helpful, and that, in addition to the cooperation necessary to satisfy his plea agreement, the defendant participated in three additional cases. Primarily on this basis, defense counsel argued that the court was presented with substantial and compelling reasons to impose a sentence lower than the statutory minimum. The court announced that it would sentence the defendant to five to thirty years imprisonment. The prosecutor immediately moved to withdraw from the plea agreement. The court noted and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Although defendant Oatman had not assisted law enforcement agencies as had defendant Siebert, the prosecutor acknowledged that \"he was always willing and able to cooperate.\u201d The prosecutor argued that the court should not reduce the sentence further on the basis of the defendant\u2019s willingness to cooperate because the possibility of cooperation was the quid pro quo for the plea bargain. The court sentenced defendant Oatman to three to thirty years imprisonment. As he did at defendant Siebert\u2019s sentencing, the prosecutor im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>mediately moved to withdraw from the agreement. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">The prosecutor appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed. See 201 Mich App 402; 507 NW2d 211 (1993). The Court concluded that the trial court erred in denying the prosecutor\u2019s motions to withdraw from the plea agreements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-5\">When the court sentenced defendants to terms of years less than those set forth in the sentence agreements, the prosecutor then had a right to withdraw from the agreements, subject to defendants\u2019 right\u2014arising from their performance of the provisions of the agreements requiring that they cooperate with state and federal drug investigations by providing information, testimony, and other assistance\u2014to specific performance of the agreements, at their option. [201 Mich App 430-431.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">We granted the defendants\u2019 applications for leave to appeal, and directed that the case be submitted with <em>People v Jefferson. </em>See 446 Mich 865 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Defendant Mary Jefferson was originally charged with delivery of cocaine in an amount exceeding 650 grams. The defendant entered a plea agreement with the prosecutor that called for her to provide \"all information, known to her, concerning the trafficking of controlled substances,\u201d including knowledge about two defendants who had been charged along with her in the same information. The agreement stated that if she satisfied the agreement, the prosecutor would \"agree to a plea of guilty of Delivery of 225 grams or more, but less than 650 grams of a powder containing cocaine,\u201d and that the defendant should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>be \"sentenced to a period of incarceration of Ten (10) to Thirty (30) years, subject to the Court\u2019s approval.\u201d Ten years was the statutory minimum sentence at the time defendant Jefferson was charged. The trial court accepted Jefferson\u2019s plea, noted this provision, and affirmed that he could not deviate from this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Eleven months later at defendant Jefferson\u2019s sentencing hearing, a special agent from the Drug Enforcement Administration testified that his agency was pleased with the defendant\u2019s cooperation. Defense counsel asked the court to impose a minimum sentence below the ten years called for by the agreement. The prosecutor replied that the court should either honor the sentence agreement or else allow the prosecutor to withdraw. The court, however, did not address the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that he wished to withdraw from the agreement, but rather proceeded to announce its sentence of five to thirty years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The prosecutor appealed, and the Court of Appeals peremptorily reversed. We vacated that order and directed that the case be given plenary consideration. 437 Mich 1034 (1991). On remand, the majority stated that, although it disagreed with the decision in <em>People v Siebert, </em>it was bound to follow it under Administrative Order No. 1990-6. 202 Mich App 606 (1993). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal, and ordered that the case be submitted with <em>Siebert </em>and <em>Oatman. </em>446 Mich 865 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The threshold legal issue in these cases is whether, in a case involving a plea bargain that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>contains a sentence agreement,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the prosecution may withdraw its consent to the plea when the court intends to impose a sentence lower than that called for by the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">As a matter of practical reality, bargaining and concessions have become a permanent feature of the judicial landscape. Plea bargains, however, are more than contracts between two parties. As the judicial representative of the public interest, the trial judge is an impartial party whose duties and interests are separate from and independent of the interests of the prosecutor and defendant. The court\u2019s interest is in seeing that justice is done. In the context of plea and sentence agreements, the court\u2019s interest in imposing a just sentence is protected by its right to reject any agreement, except that which invades the prosecutor\u2019s charging authority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A trial court may reject pleas to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>reduced charges, and it may protect its sentencing discretion by rejecting sentence agreements. In this sense, neither the prosecutor nor the defendant can dictate the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">However, it follows from <em>People v Killebrew, supra, </em>416 Mich 189, that a prosecutor, like a defendant, is entitled to learn that the judge does not intend to impose the agreed-upon sentence, to be advised regarding what the sentence would be, and given an opportunity to withdraw from the plea agreement. The procedures outlined in <em>Killebrew </em>provide that the defendant may withdraw his plea when a sentence agreement or recommendation will not be satisfied in order to protect the defendant\u2019s right \"to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to trial and its companion rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210. The prosecution has an equal, though different, constitutional interest at stake insofar as it is constitutionally entrusted with authority to charge defendants. See, generally, <em>Genesee Prosecutor v Genesee Circuit Judge, </em>386 Mich 672, 683-684; 194 NW2d 693 (1972). In a case where the prosecutor has lowered the charges against the defendant\u2014reducing either the number of counts charged or the level of those charges \u2014with the understanding of a certain minimum sentence, the agreement is conditioned upon imposition of the specified sentence. Were a court allowed to maintain its acceptance of the plea over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, it would effectively assume the prosecutor\u2019s constitutional authority to determine the charge or charges a defendant will face. See <em>Genesee Prosecutor v Genesee Circuit Judge, </em>391 Mich 115, 121; 215 NW2d 145 (1974) (\"[a] circuit judge does not enjoy supervisory power over a prosecuting attorney\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Therefore, the trial court\u2019s exclusive authority to impose sentence does not allow it to enforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>only parts of a bargain. A court may not keep the prosecutor\u2019s concession by accepting a guilty plea to reduced charges, and yet impose a lower sentence than the one for which the prosecutor and the defendant bargained. Accepting a plea to a lesser charge over the prosecutor\u2019s objection impermissibly invades the constitutional authority of the prosecutor. <em>Genesee Prosecutor v Genesee Circuit Judge, supra, </em>391 Mich 121. When a court receives information that in its judgment dictates a lower sentence, it must alert the prosecutor of the sentence it intends to impose and allow the prosecutor to withdraw from the plea.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s right to withdraw is recognized under FR Crim P 11(e), which forms the basis for the procedures set forth in <em>Killebrew. </em>See 416 Mich 205, n 8. A district court that keeps a defendant\u2019s guilty plea is prohibited from \"sentencing a defendant to a sentence less severe than that provided for in the plea agreement accepted by the court.\u201d <em>United States v Semler, </em>883 F2d 832, 833 (CA 9, 1989). This rule was applied to facts similar to those at issue here in <em>United States v Mukai, </em>26 F3d 953 (CA 9, 1994). The defendant in <em>Mukai </em>entered into a plea agreement with the government that called for a sentence of \"imprisonment for not less than five (5) years and not more than seven (7) years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 954. The agreement provided that \"if the defendant\u2019s cooperation and truthful testimony is of substantial assistance in the investigation and/or prosecution of others,\u201d the government would file a motion \"permitting the Court to sentence the defendant to less than the otherwise applicable guideline range and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>within the range contemplated by the plea agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 954-955. The district court sentenced the defendant to probation for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">On appeal by the prosecutor, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that a sentencing court that decides it must impose a less severe sentence than called for by an agreement may not keep the guilty plea over the objection of the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-6\">The time for the court to evaluate whether the impact of exceptional circumstances renders the agreement inappropriate is prior to acceptance and, as the court explained in <em>Semler, </em>if the court later finds the disposition in the plea agreement objectionable it \"should not reduce the sentence unilaterally in such cases, but rather should withdraw its acceptance of the plea agreement and permit the parties to renegotiate a more appropriate sentence or opt for trial.\u201d [26 F3d 955-956.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">The court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that under \u00a7 5K1.1, which authorizes a sentencing court to depart from the guidelines, the government has no control over the extent of the departure. The court agreed with previous decisions holding that \"the dictates of Rule 11, which do not authorize the district court to modify a plea agreement, trump the discretion afforded a district court under \u00a7 5K1.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">There is no allegation that defendants and their lawyers did not understand that they had bargained for a specific sentence and no allegation of inadequate advice in taking the pleas. The dispositive question is therefore whether the sentences imposed violated the agreements at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>In <em>Jefferson, </em>the record unquestionably establishes that the parties and the trial judge understood that a sentence agreement existed and that it was a term of the agreement necessary for the prosecution\u2019s consent to the plea. In <em>Oatman, </em>the court, when confronted at the plea proceeding with the sentence agreement, ambiguously remarked \"[w]ell, that\u2019s simply redundant, because that\u2019s the required sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Where it is clear on the record that a party is relying on an agreement regarding the sentence as part of a plea agreement, it is incumbent on the court at the time of accepting the pleas to clarify whether it is accepting or rejecting the entire agreement or taking it under advisement. MCR 6.302(C)(3). Later, before sentencing in <em>Siebert </em>and <em>Oatman, </em>the prosecutor observed that if the court sentenced outside the agreement it \"would be in essence rejecting the agreement that the parties entered into,\u201d and he would have the right to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">A defendant must clearly understand the terms of the agreement to offer a knowing and voluntary plea. We do not, however, agree with the contention that the prosecutor should not be allowed to withdraw in <em>Siebert </em>and <em>Oatman </em>because the agreements \"did not provide that the court could not depart from the mandatory sentence for substantial and compelling reasons.\u201d Levin, J., <em>post </em>at 537, n 41. An agreement that a defendant will receive a specific sentence needs no further elaboration. A defendant who agrees to a specific sentence as part of a guilty plea to a lesser charge and thereby avoids charges that would require life imprisonment in the event of conviction can certainly claim that the trial court has sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>discretion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That is not the same as saying that the prosecutor must consent to the plea. The court rule, MCR 6.301(D), provides that \"[t]he court may not accept a plea to an offense other than the one charged without the consent of the prosecutor,\u201d in recognition of the fact that consent to a reduced plea is an integral part of the prosecution\u2019s charging function. A defendant can merely seek to <em>enforce </em>what the prosecutor promised in the agreement, not something better.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">We also disagree with the implicit assertion that such agreements must negate ambiguity. See Levin, J., <em>post </em>at 537, n 41. Negating ambiguity in agreements when none has been suggested will complicate this area of jurisprudence at the plea-taking and appellate stages with no discernible benefit to defendant\u2019s legitimate expectations or those of the prosecutor, judge, or public. This is not to say that the parties may not agree that the defendant may argue for a departure or that he will not so argue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is to say that when the parties do not claim that they did not understand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>the terms of the bargain, this Court should not impose an analytical framework that requires negation of possible misunderstandings.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">The gloss of contract jurisprudence is here unnecessary and generally unwise. Defendants make no claim that the negotiated terms of the agreement were imprecise or unclear. Further, to the extent we impose this approach on such agreements, we undermine their certainty and their utility. Defendants may be less likely to offer full cooperation when they can fall back on contractual arguments- that will permit escape from a minimum sentence. To the extent that enforcement of the bargained-for sentence becomes more problematic, prosecutors will be more reluctant to offer these bargains. The ultimate effect will be to discourage the very activity most likely to have an effect on the narcotics traffic\u2014prosecution of those higher up the chain of distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">We hold in <em>Jefferson </em>and would hold in <em>Siebert </em>and <em>Oatman </em>that the trial court, having accepted a plea to a lesser charge pursuant to an agreement for sentence, erred when it failed to announce the sentence it intended to impose and then allow the prosecution to withdraw consent to the plea agreement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We would remand each case to the trial court where, after hearing from the parties, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>judge should permit the defendant to affirm the plea and impose the sentence specified in the agreement or permit the prosecution to withdraw. See MCR 6.301(D). If the court decides to reject the agreement, the prosecution should be informed of the intended sentence before it must decide whether to object and withdraw. Nothing precludes the parties from reaching a new agreement or from convincing the judge to impose a sentence that will satisfy the prosecutor and the defendant. We would encourage them to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Because the prosecutor does not seek to set aside these bargains, it is unnecessary to opine whether specific performance is \"ordinarily\u201d the appropriate remedy, Levin, J., <em>post </em>at 535, or to address defendant\u2019s due process arguments. The prosecutor does not contend that defendants should be deprived of the benefits of their bargain, and we do not assume that a judge will refuse to impose the sentence that effectuates the parties\u2019 bargains.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Discussion of specific performance is not necessary to disposition of these cases. Nevertheless, given the discussion of \"specific performance\u201d of plea agreements in the separate opinion, and the Court of Appeals holding that the defendants could elect specific performance, it is necessary to address the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">The essential problem with the separate opinion\u2019s discussion of specific performance is that the defendants would be seeking specific performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>not from the prosecutor, a party to the agreement who made certain promises, but from the trial court, a party independent of the agreement who did not make any promises in <em>Siebert </em>or <em>Oatman </em>and who rejected the agreement in <em>Jefferson. </em>Not only would this remove the sentencing power from the hands of the trial court, but it commands a result that is not required by <em>Santobello v New York, </em>404 US 257; 92 S Ct 495; 30 L Ed 2d 427 (1971). The prosecutor in <em>Santobello </em>promised that if the defendant pleaded guilty of a lesser offense, he would make no recommendation regarding the sentence. A different prosecutor attended the defendant\u2019s sentencing, however, and recommended the maximum sentence on the basis of the defendant\u2019s criminal record and alleged ties to organized crime. The judge, after stating that he was uninfluenced by that recommendation, imposed the maximum sentence. The United States Supreme Court held that the defendant\u2019s conviction should be vacated and remanded to the state court, which would determine whether the defendant should receive specific performance or whether he should be entitled to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">The central holding of the Court\u2019s opinion was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-5\">when a plea rests in any significant degree on a <em>promise or agreement of the prosecutor, </em>so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, <em>such promise </em>must be fulfilled. <em>[Id. </em>at 262 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">The promise at issue in <em>Santobello </em>was the prosecutor\u2019s promise of no recommendation concerning sentence. The possible remedy of specific performance, therefore, involved performance by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>prosecution of its <em>own </em>promise\u2014resentencing the defendant by a different judge without prosecutorial recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">In contrast, the separate opinion and the Court of Appeals apparently envision ordering the sentencing judge\u2014a bystander to the agreement\u2014to specifically perform a promise made by the parties. The Court of Appeals description of <em>Santobello </em>differs from the quotation accordingly. It describes <em>Santobello </em>as not being about requiring the prosecution to keep its own promises, but about requiring trial courts to perform agreements reached by the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-5\">[O]nce <em>a trial court </em>accepts a plea induced by an agreement with a prosecutor, <em>the terms of that agreement </em>must be fulfilled. <em>[Siebert, </em>201 Mich App 427 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">As noted, however, <em>Santobello </em>does not propose specific performance by a trial court or by any actor not making the promise at issue. Under Michigan law, the trial judge is not required to enforce a sentence agreement reached by the parties with which the judge does not agree. Thus, the judge may reject the agreement, i.e., allow the parties to withdraw. In a system increasingly driven by the exigencies of plea bargaining, it is imperative that the trial judge retain this historic discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Public confidence in a system increasingly driven by negotiation can only be preserved by protecting the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, upholding the prosecutor\u2019s executive authority, and preserving the trial court\u2019s independence. The optimum bargained disposition is that result which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>best harmonizes these core interests. Where the negotiations do not produce harmony, care must be taken to ensure the least damage possible to each of these concerns. When the bargain goes awry, the variation of agreements and remedies admit of no hard and fast rule for resolution. In these cases the appropriate remedy is to remand to allow the defendants to affirm their pleas and bargain for further proceedings if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Jefferson </em>and would affirm in <em>Siebert </em>and <em>Oatman </em>to the extent those decisions hold that \"the trial court[s] erred in denying the prosecutor\u2019s motion to withdraw from the plea agreements after the courtfs] accepted the pleas without honoring the sentence agreements.\u201d <em>Siebert, </em>201 Mich App 430.</p>\n<judges id=\"b789-5\">Brickley, C.J., and Riley, J., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b789-6\">Weaver, J., concurred with Boyle, J., only in <em>Jefferson, </em>and took no part in the decision of <em>Siebert </em>and <em>Oatman.</em></judges>\n<author id=\"b789-7\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APqQ\"><em>(separate opinion). </em>I agree with the majority that the Court of Appeals correctly held that when a prosecutor enters into a sentence agreement with a defendant, he may seek to withdraw from the agreement if the court departs below the agreed-upon sentence.

The sentencing judges found such reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Two of the six Court of Appeals judges that have considered this matter were of the opinion, and two of my colleagues are of the opinion, that the sentencing judge may, contrary to the sentence agreements, depart below the minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">While I agree with the Court of Appeals in the instant cases, and the majority in this Court, that the sentence agreements, and the statute providing for departure downward, should not be construed to permit departure below the agreed upon minimum, this is a new rule, which, in light of the records in the instant cases, should be applied prospectively.

Those were the mandatory minimum sentences for delivery and conspiracy to deliver that quantity at the times involved.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The statute provides, however, that the \"court may depart from the minimum term of imprisonment\u201d for delivery of that quantity \"if the court finds on the record that there are substantial and compelling reasons to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A5q\">The cooperation by defendants in drug investigations so impressed the sentencing judges that, over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, Siebert was sentenced to five to thirty years, Oatman to three to thirty years, and Jefferson to five to thirty years, on findings \"that there are substantial and compelling reasons\u201d to \"depart from the minimum term of imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Siebert/Oatman </em>reversed, stating that, when the judge concluded that he could not sentence pursuant to the sentence agreements, he should have provided the prosecutor with an opportunity to withdraw from the agreements, but that, because the defendants had performed pursuant to the agreements, they should be provided an opportunity on remand to obtain specific performance of the agreements pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>viding minimum sentences of twenty to thirty years in <em>Siebert/Oatman;</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in <em>Jefferson, </em>ten to thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">I am in substantial agreement with the Court of Appeals in <em>Siebert/Oatman, </em>but conclude, for reasons set forth in the introduction and in part v of this opinion, that this decision\u2014precluding exercise of the power to depart for substantial and compelling reasons where there is a sentence agreement\u2014should be given prospective effect and should not apply in pending cases in which the defendants have entered into such plea agreements and have been sentenced to terms less than a mandatory minimum agreed-upon sentence on a finding of substantial and compelling reasons to depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The prosecutor has not challenged the findings of substantial and compelling reasons to depart in the instant cases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">The facts and history of proceedings in <em>Siebert/ Oatman </em>are set forth in subpart A, and in <em>Jefferson </em>in subpart b.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">a</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">In October, 1990, Siebert and Oatman entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>into plea agreements with the Wayne County prosecutor\u2019s office providing that they would be permitted to plead guilty of the lesser offenses of delivery and conspiracy to deliver between 225 and 650 grams of cocaine. Siebert and Oatman agreed to cooperate with drug investigations by providing information, testimony, and additional necessary assistance. Sentences of twenty to thirty years were agreed upon<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for the reduced charges. The prosecutor agreed to dismiss other pending charges.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">After the pleas were accepted, sentencing was deferred to enable the court to obtain presentence reports and to allow Siebert and Oatman to perform according to their agreements. During the intervening year, Siebert cooperated extensively with state and federal authorities, often at significant personal risk. Oatman was not called upon to do so.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">In October, 1991, during the course of a presentence conference, the court said that it \"jealously guards its prerogatives with regard to sentencing and has uniformly told parties that it will not be bound by any sentence bargain, agreement, arrangements, or deal,\u201d but had overlooked the language of these agreements and that it was \"not my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>intention then or now to be bound by a sentence agreement, and I did and do feel free to take advantage of\u201d the statutory provision authorizing the court to depart from a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment if it finds on the record that there are substantial and compelling reasons to do so. The prosecutor stated that, if the court chose not to sentence according to the agreements, he would ask the court either to reject the pleas or to permit him to withdraw from the agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">At Siebert\u2019s sentencing hearing, law enforcement officers attested to his extensive cooperation and assistance. His lawyer asked the court to depart from the mandatory sentence for substantial and compelling reasons on the basis of Siebert\u2019s assistance and evidence of his rehabilitation and character. The prosecutor acknowledged that Siebert had complied with the plea agreement and had cooperated fully with authorities. The prosecutor asked the court, nevertheless, to impose the twenty- to thirty-year sentence. The court imposed a sentence of five to thirty years, finding substantial and compelling reasons to depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">At Oatman\u2019s sentencing before the same Recorder\u2019s Court judge, his lawyer presented evidence of Oatman\u2019s comparatively minor role and of his rehabilitation. The prosecutor acknowledged that Oatman had fulfilled his obligation, and again asked the court to impose a twenty- to thirty-year sentence. The court declined to do so, and sentenced Oatman to three to thirty years, again finding reasons to depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">In June, 1989, Jefferson entered into a plea agreement with the Wayne County prosecutor\u2019s office. The agreement provided that Jefferson could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>plead guilty of delivery of over 225 but less than 650 grams of cocaine in exchange for truthful testimony and assistance in other drug prosecutions. The agreement provided that Jefferson would be sentenced to ten to thirty years, \"subject to the Court\u2019s approval.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The court accepted Jefferson\u2019s plea and indicated that the sentencing provision was part of the plea agreement. Over the next eleven months, Jefferson provided extensive assistance to both state and federal law enforcement authorities. At the sentencing hearing, her lawyer asked the court to depart from the sentence set forth in the agreement in light of Jefferson\u2019s comparatively minor participation in the underlying crime and her performance pursuant to the plea agreement. Law enforcement officers testified regarding Jefferson\u2019s participation beyond the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The prosecutor, nevertheless, asked the court to adhere to the sentence agreement or to permit him to withdraw from the agreement. Jefferson\u2019s lawyer argued that the sentence agreement provided for court discretion in sentencing. The prosecutor contended that the court could only approve or disapprove the agreement with the sentence provision, subject to permitting either party to withdraw if the sentence agreement was not adhered to. The court expressed its reluctance to sentence Jefferson to any jail time, in light of the mitigating information, and its displeasure with the prosecutor\u2019s office for insisting that Jefferson be subjected to the mandatory sentence. Jefferson was sentenced to five to thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Siebert </em>reversed in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>full opinion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Court said that neither <em>People v Killebrew, </em>416 Mich 189; 330 NW2d 834 (1982), nor MCR 6.302(C)(3)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> explicitly provided the prosecution with the right to withdraw from a plea agreement when the judge declines to follow its terms.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court found, however, that such an option was implied in <em>Killebrew.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The Court engaged in a thorough analysis of <em>Killebrew, </em>observing that the opinion made substantive distinctions between sentence recommendations and sentence agreements.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Court discussed <em>Killebrew </em>in conjunction with cases con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>cerning prosecutorial charging discretion, <em>Genesee Prosecutor v Genesee Circuit Judge, </em>386 Mich 672; 194 NW2d 693 (1972) <em>(Genesee Prosecutor I), </em>and <em>Genesee Prosecutor v Genesee Circuit Judge, </em>391 Mich 115; 215 NW2d 145 (1974) <em>(Genesee Prosecutor II). </em>The Court looked to contract principles, observing that a prosecutor has the right to obtain the benefit of his bargain with a defendant by receiving \"a specific sentence and no less.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ADz\">The Court said that where the \"prosecutor, in the exercise of the discretion of that office, agrees to a charge reduction if certain conditions are met, that agreement remains conditional until the terms of the agreement are fulfilled,\u201d and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-4\">[t]he court, in accepting a plea to a lesser offense, effectively dismisses the greater offense\u2014a charge respecting which the prosecutor has not relinquished discretion.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">In ruling that the prosecutor should be given the opportunity to withdraw from a plea agreement if the sentence agreement is not followed, the Court decided that this would not infringe on the court\u2019s sentencing discretion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-6\">We agree that a sentencing court has the exclusive authority to determine the appropriate sentence, in that neither a prosecutor nor a defendant can dictate the sentence, either separately or by agreement. Thus, a sentencing court has the right to reject a sentence agreement presented by a prosecutor and a defendant. In a sense, neither a prosecutor nor a defendant has a right to a specific sentence. It does not follow, however, that a defendant has a right to the benefit of a court\u2019s discretion to sentence leniently where the charge sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>tenced upon is a reduced charge offered by a prosecutor in exchange for a particular sentence. In that circumstance, the judicial right to exercise sentencing discretion must be balanced with the charging rights of a prosecutor and the rights of a defendant. A defendant\u2019s right to have a court exercise sentencing discretion can be bargained away in exchange for a reduced charge and a specific sentence.[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The Court then addressed the contention that, in light of the extensive cooperation, it would be contrary to the Due Process Clause and fundamental fairness to permit the prosecutor to withdraw and reinstate the original charges. The Court observed that the defendants\u2019 decision to plead guilty of a lesser offense and cooperate rested on the promise of reduced charges and sentences. The Court concluded that Siebert and Oatman should be provided an opportunity to obtain specific performance of the agreements and receive the agreed-upon sentences before the prosecutor would be permitted to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">A majority of the Court of Appeals panel in <em>Jefferson </em>applied, but criticized, the <em>Siebert/ Oatman </em>panel\u2019s analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-8\">Absent the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Siebert, </em>however, we would be disinclined to agree with the prosecution. To allow the prosecution to withdraw from a plea agreement entered into with full knowledge by the prosecutor that the sentencing function is for the judiciary violates concepts articulated in <em>Killebrew, supra, </em>and more recently in <em>People v Cobbs, </em>443 Mich 276; 505 NW2d 208 (1993). Further, to do so in a fact situation such as this, where defendant has satisfied her part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>bargain by cooperating fully with the authorities at her own personal risk, is fundamentally unfair.[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The Court said that although allowing a prosecutor to withdraw from an unfulfilled sentence agreement may be seen as no different than allowing a defendant to do so, \"such an argument ignores the reality of the power and crime-charging authority of the prosecutor in the criminal law process, as well as constitutional considerations unique to a defendant charged with a crime.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">I agree with the Court of Appeals in <em>Siebert/ Oatman </em>that the prosecutor generally should be permitted to withdraw from a plea agreement for a lesser charge if the court decides not to sentence according to a sentencing provision of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">In <em>Killebrew, </em>this Court announced procedures to be followed when a defendant and the prosecutor choose to engage in plea negotiations. Where there is a sentence agreement, the court must either accept or reject the plea as a complete package according to the options set forth in MCR 6.302(C)(3). This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Killebrew </em>was premised on the following concern:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-11\">A full understanding of the consequences of a plea is impossible where the defendant, believing that he has negotiated a specific length of sentence, tenders his guilty plea, only to find that he is bound by the act of self-conviction, but the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>judge is free to impose any sentence within the statutory range.[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">This Court designed procedures limiting judicial participation to enable the judge to maintain his role as \"neutral arbiter.\u201d The Court preserved the judge\u2019s sentencing discretion, explaining,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-5\">If the judge feels that the agreement reached by the defendant and government attorney will serve the interests of justice, he may accept the agreement or recommendation. If, however, the judge, in an exercise of his discretion, finds that the bargain is not appropriate, he is free to reject the plea. Thus, the judge\u2019s sentencing discretion is unhampered.[<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">As the Court of Appeals observed in <em>Siebert/ Oatman, </em>this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Killebrew </em>should be examined in tandem with cases concerning the principle of prosecutorial charging discretion affirmed in this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Genesee Prosecutor I </em>and <em>Genesee Prosecutor II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">In <em>Killebrew, </em>the Court focused on the exercise of judicial sentencing discretion where it could operate to the detriment of a defendant who had justifiably relied on a plea agreement. The principles enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Santobello v New York, </em>404 US 257; 92 S Ct 495; 30 L Ed 2d 427 (1971), become relevant because the defendant relinquishes constitutional rights by entering a plea of guilty.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Concerns regarding the separation of powers between the court and the prosecutor arise when the prosecutor agrees to reduce a particular charge in exchange for a particular sentence. The exercise of the prosecutor\u2019s charging discretion, and the prosecutor\u2019s reliance on the agreed-upon sentence in exchange for the exercise of his discretion, support recognition of a right to withdraw if the sentence agreement is not followed.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">Where a court is presented with a sentence agreement as part of a guilty plea, the procedures to be followed are those set forth in <em>Killebrew </em>and in MCR 6.302(C)(3). The court retains discretion to accept or reject the plea agreement. If the court is of the opinion that it does not have sufficient information to make an informed decision regarding the sentence \u00e1greement, it has the option of deferring acceptance of the plea until receipt of the presentence report.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Permitting the prosecutor to withdraw from a plea agreement that has been approved by the court, when the court refuses to abide by a sentence agreement included as part of the agreement, does no violence to the court\u2019s exercise of sentencing discretion.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">While the <em>Siebert/Oatman </em>panel held that the prosecutor should be permitted to withdraw from the plea agreements, it also ruled that Siebert and Oatman should be provided an opportunity to obtain specific performance of the agreements. In <em>People v Reagan, </em>395 Mich 306; 235 NW2d 581 (1975), this Court ordered the remedy of specific performance when the prosecutor breached a provision of an agreement with a defendant.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-5\">Law enforcement processes are committed to civilized courses of action. When mistakes of significant proportion are made, it is better that the consequences be suffered than that civilized standards be sacrificed.[<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">In ordering specific performance, the Court relied in part on the reasoning of <em>Santobello </em>regarding the enforcement of plea agreements.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> This Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>While there is precedential reference to the concept of \"consideration\u201d for a bargain in the context of the administration of criminal justice, we feel that here the analogy to contract law is inappropriate. The standards of commerce do not govern, and should not govern, the administration of criminal justice.[<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">In the instant cases, neither the prosecutor nor the defendant breached a term of the plea agreement. It was the court that declined to perform according to the literal terms of the agreement.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The California Supreme Court observed, \"Specific enforcement is appropriate when it will implement the reasonable expectations of the parties without binding the trial judge to a disposition that he or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>she considers unsuitable under all the circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> If a sentencing court refuses to sentence according to an agreement between the prosecutor and the defendant, either or both parties may call for specific performance.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">If the defendant has provided extensive assistance to the prosecutor as part of the plea bargain, considerations of fairness require that, before the prosecutor is permitted to withdraw from the agreement, the defendant first be given the option of specific performance.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In <em>People v Farrar, </em>52 NY2d 302; 437 NYS2d 961; 419 NE2d 864 (1981),<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> New York\u2019s highest court said that the prosecutor\u2019s application t\u00f3 withdraw from a plea agreement need not be granted in all cases, since \"among other things, prejudice to a defendant following a plea may prevent restoration to <em>status quo ante </em>and render vacatur of the plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>inappropriate . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In <em>People v Danny G, </em>61 NY2d 169; 473 NYS2d 131; 461 NE2d 268 (1984), New York\u2019s highest court ordered specific performance when the sentencing court refused to sentence a defendant according to a sentence agreement after he had cooperated as required by the agreement, and said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-5\">Essential to our determination that specific performance is warranted under some circumstances is our concern that a defendant who has performed services for the prosecutor, at risk to himself, be treated fairly [citation omitted]. Once the defendant has been placed in such a \"no-return\u201d position, relegating him to the remedy of vacatur of his plea cannot restore him to the <em>status quo ante, </em>and he should therefore receive the benefit of his bargain, absent compelling reasons requiring a different result.[<footnotemark>37</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">While I agree with the Court of Appeals in <em>Siebert/Oatman </em>that withdrawal or specific performance should ordinarily ensue when the court refuses to abide by a sentence agreement, I conclude on review of the records in the instant cases that fairness requires that the rule announced by the Court of Appeals in <em>Siebert/Oatman, </em>today affirmed by this Court, should be applied prospectively and that the reduced sentences imposed by the Recorder\u2019s Court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">As the Court of Appeals panels in <em>Siebert/ Patman </em>and <em>Jefferson </em>observed, no procedure or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>court rule specifically provides the prosecutor with the right to withdraw from a plea agreement under the circumstances of the instant cases.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> While I agree there is such a right by implication, it was not resolved before the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Siebert </em>that the courts of this state would recognize such an implicit right.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Because recognition of the prosecutor\u2019s right to withdraw from a plea agreement when the court fails to mete out the agreed-upon sentence represents a departure from the practice in the jurisdiction where the plea agreements were entered into, this new rule should not be applied in the instant cases involving the court\u2019s statutory power to depart for substantial and compelling reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">The Recorder\u2019s Court judge in <em>Siebert/Oatman </em>stated during the presentence conference that the practice in his court was not to enforce sentence agreements. The judge said that he had inadvertently failed to inform the parties of his intention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>not to be bound by the sentence agreements when he accepted Siebert\u2019s and Oatman\u2019s pleas.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In <em>Jefferson, </em>the parties and the judge engaged in extensive discussion regarding the discretion of the court to depart from the sentence agreement. While Jefferson's lawyer and the judge acknowledged that the judge\u2019s sentencing discretion was circumscribed, the text of the plea agreement provided for the \"Court\u2019s approval.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In the circumstances, I conclude that the reduced sentence imposed on Siebert, Oatman, and Jefferson should be affirmed.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The decision of the Court of Appeals should be modified to reinstate the reduced sentences of five to thirty years in <em>Siebert, </em>three to thirty years in <em>Oatman, </em>and five to thirty years in <em>Jefferson.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-10\"> For reasons stated herein, we do not approve of the Court of Appeals discussion concerning specific performance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b774-11\"> MCL 333.7401(1), (2)(a)(i); MSA 14.15(7401)(1), (2)(a)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b774-12\"> MCL 750.157a; MSA 28.354(1) and MCL 333.7401(1), (2)(a)(i); MSA 14.15(7401)(1), (2)(a)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b779-5\"> These cases involve sentence agreements. As Justice Levin notes, the Court of Appeals stated that sentence agreements were substantively different from sentence recommendations. See <em>post </em>at 526, n 15 and accompanying text. We disagree. The terms are not mutually exclusiv\u00e9. See i Wright, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure (2d ed), \u00a7 175.1, p 641. For purposes of withdrawing from agreements that include a guilty plea and specify or recommend sentence dispositions, the critical distinction is not whether the arrangement is styled as an agreement or a recommendation, but its terms. It is the nature of the bargain that controls, not the, nomenclature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b779-6\"> These cases are complicated by the fact that trial court discretion has been constrained by the Legislature. If judges reject agreements, they may find themselves in the position of imposing mandatory minimum life sentences which they may believe to be unjust. Obviously, however, a disagreement with the Legislature\u2019s sentencing philosophy does not permit deviation from the legislative will.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Outside the context of mandatory minimum sentences for certain drug offenses, it is much more obvious that a trial court may not accept a guilty plea to a reduced charge, yet impose a sentence lower than the parties agreed on over the objection of the prosecutor. Where a prosecutor allows a defendant charged with first-degree murder, for example, to plead guilty of second-degree murder, which carries no mandatory minimum sentence, for a sentence of twenty to forty years, it seems indisputable that the trial court could not accept the plea to second-degree murder and, over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, sentence the defendant to less than twenty to forty years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b781-6\"> We agree with the Court of Appeals that the constitutional prohibition on double jeopardy, US Const, Ams V, XIV; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15, would not bar reinstatement of the original changes. See 201 Mich App 418-426.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b783-7\"> Although the record does not show that the court became aware of the identical term in codefendant Siebert\u2019s agreement at the time of the plea, there is no reason to believe the court would have responded differently.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b784-6\"> Although it is possible that a defendant might establish that in agreeing to a specific sentence that coincided with the ostensible minimum sentence in MCL 333.7401; MSA 14.15(7401), he was relying on the belief that the trial court could depart below the agreement, that claim is not here made. Even if a defendant established that he relied on incorrect information in deciding to plead guilty, he would only be entitled to withdraw his plea. He would not be entitled to the result proposed in the separate opinion\u2014receipt of a lower sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">Whatever error a defendant might establish would not transcend the prosecutor\u2019s constitutional charging authority. As noted above, unless the court imposes the sentence specified in the agreement, the prosecutor has not consented to the dismissal of other charges or the defendant\u2019s plea to a reduced charge, and there is no plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b784-13\"> There was no ambiguity in the <em>Jefferson </em>agreement. The words \"subject to the Court\u2019s approval\u201d recite no more than the court rule requires: that the sentence is subject to the Court\u2019s approval.
