Wood was slumped forward, with his head resting on the steering wheel. The vehicle\u2019s engine was running, and the automatic transmission was in drive. Wood\u2019s foot, which rested on the brake pedal, kept the vehicle from moving. Wood had a twenty-dollar bill in his hand, and a Budweiser beer between his legs. He smelled of alcohol and, when the police awakened him, appeared confused. Wood was arrested, and the police searched the front seat of the vehicle. They found a cooler containing baggies of marijuana, money, a list of names, and a calculator.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Wood moved to suppress the evidence of the marijuana and of blood-alcohol and field-sobriety tests. The judge granted the motion, ruling that the evidence was the product of an unlawful arrest. The judge reasoned that the police were not justified in arresting Wood because they did not see him committing a misdemeanor by \"operating\u201d the vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge relied on this Court\u2019s decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number><em>People v Pomeroy (Oil Rehearing) </em>and <em>People v Fulcher (On Rehearing), </em>419 Mich 441; 355 NW2d 98 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">A police officer may make an arrest for a misdemeanor without a warrant when the crime is committed in the officer\u2019s presence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the police arrested Wood for ouil, the legality of the arrest depends on whether Wood was \"operating] a vehicle\u201d when the police found him. We conclude that he was.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">A statute provides that an \"operator\u201d is anyone \"in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon a highway.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This Court addressed the definition of \"operate\u201d in <em>Pomeroy </em>and the companion case, <em>Fulcher. </em>We there said that a conscious person in a stationary vehicle might have \"actual physical control,\u201d and thus operate it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We suggested that no particular state of mind is required to operate a motor vehicle. We also said that a person who is sleeping in a moving vehicle might be found to \"operate\u201d it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>But the combination of a stationary vehicle and an unconscious driver in <em>Pomeroy/Fulcher </em>persuaded the Court that the defendants there were not operating their vehicles when found by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">In <em>Pomeroy, </em>the defendant was found asleep in a parked vehicle outside a bar. The engine was running, but the manual transmission was in neutral. Pomeroy testified that he had only entered the vehicle to sleep, and had turned on the engine and heater because he was cold.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> No other evidence was offered that Pomeroy had driven while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In <em>Fulcher, </em>police found Fulcher\u2019s automobile with its rear end in a ditch and the front end in the roadway. Fulcher was asleep in the driver\u2019s seat with the engine idling. Fulcher\u2019s foot was off the accelerator, but the automatic transmission was in drive. The vehicle was motionless. It had furrowed tire tracks into the ground.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In both <em>Pomeroy </em>and <em>Fulcher, </em>this Court found that the driver was not operating a motor vehicle at the time of arrest.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">We conclude that \"operating\u201d should be defined in terms of the danger the ouil statute seeks to prevent: the collision of a vehicle being operated by a person under the influence of intoxicating liquor with other persons or property. Once a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>person using a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle has put the vehicle in motion, or in a position posing a significant risk of causing a collision, such a person continues to operate it until the vehicle is returned to a position posing no such risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The <em>Pomeroy/Fulcher </em>Court stated that \"a person sleeping in a motionless car cannot be held to be presently operating a vehicle while sleeping.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We read that statement as reflecting an assumption that there was no danger of collision in such a case. The facts of this case show that this assumption was an overgeneralization. <em>Pomeroy/Fulcher </em>is overruled to the extent it holds, for purposes of construing what conduct is within the meaning of \"operate a vehicle,\u201d that \"a person sleeping in a motionless car cannot be held to be presently operating a vehicle while sleeping.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Wood had put the vehicle in motion and in a position posing a significant risk of collision. The vehicle had not been returned to a position of safety. Only Wood\u2019s foot resting on the brake pedal kept the vehicle from moving forward. Were Wood, who had then become unconscious, to have slipped to the side, his foot might have moved off the brake, putting the vehicle in motion. Wood had not returned the vehicle to a position posing no risk of collision with other persons or property. W\u00e9 conclude that he continued to operate the vehicle when he was observed by the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Reversed and remanded for trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b675-10\">Brickley, C.J., and Cavanagh and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-12\"> A person, whether licensed or not, shall not operate a vehicle upon a highway or other place open to the general public or generally accessible to motor vehicles, including an area designated for the parking of vehicles, within this state if either of the following applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-13\">(a) The person is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, or a combination of intoxicating liquor and a controlled substance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-14\">(b) The person has an alcohol content of 0.10 grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine.

I join the opinion of the Court on the understanding that our decision today marks the complete demise of <em>People v Fulcher (On Rehearing), </em>419 Mich 441; 355 NW2d 98 (1984). I write separately first to state the basis for that observation and, second, to observe that even if the defendant were not technically \"operating\u201d his vehicle in the presence of the officer, he would not be entitled to suppression of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The majority states that the ouil statute \"seeks to prevent . . . the collision of a vehicle being operated by a person under the influence of intoxicating liquor with other persons or property.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 404. While prevention of imminent collisions, one purpose of the statute, is more than sufficient to explain why this defendant was \"operating\u201d in the officer\u2019s presence, it is clearly not the only purpose of the ouil statute. That statute is a prophylactic measure intended to prevent persons with impaired coordination, judgment, or sensation from being at the wheel of a car, regardless of the immediate risk of collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Even when there is no immediate risk of collision, an intoxicated driver\u2019s loss of consciousness does not render him in compliance with the ouil statute. Loss of consciousness is not a defense to drunk driving; it is symptomatic of the very worst offenders. For that reason, it would be fair to say that an unconscious person behind the wheel of a vehicle is \"operating\u201d the vehicle within the meaning of the statute if he would be considered to be \"operating\u201d were he awake.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Consequently, our decision today is inconsistent not only with the language,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but the result of <em>People v Fulcher.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The defendant in that case was found with his automatic transmission in drive, his front wheels on the road, and his rear wheels in a ditch. Because that is also a \"danger [that] the ouil statute seeks to prevent,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 404, this Court\u2019s decision that the defendant was not operat-. ing his vehicle at the time he was found is no longer viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">In addition, I agree with the amicus curiae that even if the defendant were not technically \"operating\u201d his vehicle in the presence of the officer, he would not be entitled to the remedy he is seeking \u2014suppression of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">It should be clear that the defendant\u2019s arrest does not implicate the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because there appears to be much more than probable cause to believe that defendant operated his vehicle while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Whether suppression is appropriate is a question of statutory interpretation and thus one of legislative intent. At issue here is MCL 764.15; MSA 28.874, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">A peace officer, without a warrant, may arrest a person in the following situations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">(a) When a . . . misdemeanor ... is committed in the peace officer\u2019s presence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">(h) When the peace officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person was, at the time of an accident, the driver of a vehicle involved in the accident and was operating the vehicle upon a public highway or other place open to the general public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Although nothing in the statute alludes to exclusion of evidence, the Court of Appeals held that because the arresting officer did not have a warrant, the evidence must be suppressed if the Court finds that defendant was not committing a misdemeanor in the presence of the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">Even if the defendant did not commit a misdemeanor in the presence of the arresting officer, suppression is not an appropriate remedy. In <em>People v Burdo, </em>56 Mich App 48, 52; 223 NW2d 358 (1974), the Court of Appeals held that it was not error to admit evidence of a Breathalyzer test even though the officer who arrested the defendant never saw him operate his vehicle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-10\">Where, as here, the officer had probable cause to believe that the crime had been committed, and therefore had the constitutionally required basis to search and seize, there would appear to be no need to suppress such evidence, even though the arrest was statutorily illegal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-11\"><em>Burdo </em>appears to have been the only published <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>opinion to squarely address whether a defendant was entitled to suppression of evidence discovered after an officer made an arrest without a warrant for a misdemeanor committed outside his presence. In the eighteen years after <em>Burdo </em>was decided, the Legislature amended this statute four times, each time expanding officers\u2019 authority to make misdemeanor arrests without warrants, without specifying that the remedy should be suppression or otherwise casting doubt on <em>Burdo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The Legislature\u2019s apparent acquiescence<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in the result of <em>Burdo </em>is understandable in light of the statute\u2019s history. Before this statute was enacted, a police officer had authority, under the common law, to make an arrest without a warrant for a misdemeanor committed in his presence only if it involved a breach of the peace. See, e.g., <em>Davis v </em>Burgess, 54 Mich 514; 20 NW 540 (1884); see, generally, <em>People v Dixon, </em>392 Mich 691, 697; 222 NW2d 749 (1974). Thus, the original purpose of the statute, which eliminated the requirement of a breach of the peace, was to expand officers\u2019 authority to arrest. This history does not suggest a legislative intent to require suppression.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Not until 1992 did any published authority hold that suppression is appropriate where an officer makes an arrest without a warrant for a misdemeanor. See <em>People v Spencley, </em>197 Mich App 505, 508; 495 NW2d 824 (1992). The <em>Spencley </em>decision, however, failed to address <em>Burdo. </em>In addition, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>relied on the Fourth Amendment \"fruit of the poisonous tree\u201d rule, even though the arrest of the defendant and the seizure of the evidence did not violate the Fourth Amendment. It is well established that this rule does not apply to nonconstitutional violations. See, e.g., <em>Michigan v Tucker, </em>417 US 433; 94 S Ct 2357; 41 L Ed 2d 182 (1974); <em>United States v Gonzalez-Sandoval, </em>894 F2d 1043, 1048 (CA 9, 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Suppression is particularly inappropriate on the facts of the present case. These facts are far removed from what would be the archetype violation of the statute: a misdemeanor arrest without a warrant on the basis of reports from a non-law-enforcement witness. This officer, who could not be expected to master the intricacies of Michigan appellate case law, could have reasonably believed that a misdemeanor was being committed in her presence. As the United States Supreme Court explained in <em>Michigan v Tucker, supra, </em>417 US 447, threats to suppress evidence cannot be expected to deter reasonable police conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">The deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule necessarily assumes that the police have engaged in willful, or at the very least negligent, conduct which has deprived the -defendant of some right. By refusing to admit evidence gained as a result of such conduct, the courts hope to instill in those particular investigating officers, or in their future counterparts, a greater degree of care toward the rights of an accused. Where the official action was pursued in complete good faith, however, the deterrence rationale loses much of its force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">In cases where suppression serves no purpose, it is far too extreme a remedy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">Application of the rule thus deflects the truth-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>finding process and often frees the guilty. The disparity in particular cases between the error committed by the police officer and the windfall afforded a guilty defendant by application of the rule is contrary to the idea of proportionality that is essential to the concept of justice. Thus, although the rule is thought to deter unlawful police activity in part through the nurturing of respect for Fourth Amendment values, if applied indiscriminately it may well have the opposite effect of generating disrespect for the law and administration of justice. [Stone <em>v Powell, </em>428 US 465, 490-491; 96 S Ct 3037; 49 L Ed 2d 1067 (1976).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">I would hold that suppression of evidence is not the legislatively intended remedy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b681-6\">Riley, J., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Weaver, J., took no part in the decision of this case._</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\"> Numerous states have held that a defendant may be in \"actual physical control\u201d of a stationary vehicle even though asleep or uncon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>soious when found by an officer.

Although the defendant\u2019s car was running, its lights were off and it was parked in front of the bar where the defendant testified that he had been drinking. Unlike the case before us, there was no evidence in <em>Pomeroy </em>that the defendant had driven anywhere while intoxicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b677-11\"><em> </em>See 1 LaFave &amp; Israel, Criminal Procedure, \u00a7 3.5(a), p 242 (\"[i]t appears that the Fourth Amendment presents no barrier to abolition of the felony-misdemeanor distinction so as to permit warrantless arrests on probable cause in all cases\u201d); see also <em>People v Ward, </em>73 Mich App 555, 561, n 4; 252 NW2d 514 (1977) (\"[t]he rule that probable cause is not sufficient to justify a warrantless misdemeanor arrest is a creation of statute, not of the Michigan or United States Constitutions\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b679-7\"> I am cognizant of the difficulties in reaching sound conclusions from legislative inaction.

I draw further support for my conclusion from our Legislature\u2019s history of removing unnecessary obstacles to ouil prosecutions. See <em>People v Keskimaki, </em>446 Mich 240, 259-262; 521 NW2d 241 (1994) (Boyle, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b679-14\"> The traditional remedy appears to have been a civil suit.
