We hold that, in this case, the magistrate failed to make sufficient findings of fact on the causation issue. The magistrate\u2019s failure to provide the reasoning supporting his decision to deny benefits to plaintiff was then exacerbated by errors in the decisions of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission and the Court of Appeals. Accordingly, we reverse the wcac and the Court of Appeals and remand to a magistrate for further fact finding regarding work causation. Because the magistrate failed to make the requisite finding, we need not decide the substantial evidence issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AgR0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">Plaintiff-appellee, Victoria Woody, worked in quality assurance for defendant-appellant, Cello-Foil Products, from September 6, 1977, through March 31, 1987. Plaintiff\u2019s position required her to test various samples for their adhesive and bonding properties, a process that exposed her to a variety of chemical fumes. After a number of years in this position, she began experiencing shortwindedness that would dissipate after she left work in the evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">In 1986, shortly after the symptoms arose, plaintiff quit smoking, but testified that her symptoms continued to worsen to include headaches, dizziness, and a burning sensation in her chest. In January 1987, upon the recommendation of the company doctor, plaintiff visited Dr. Stinar, a pulmonary specialist. Plaintiff told Dr. Stinar that her breathing difficulties seemed to be aggravated by methyl ethyl ketone (mek), an organic solvent she used daily.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Dr. Stinar found that plaintiff had a slight obstruction in her airway, but that her health was basically normal. Recognizing that he could not specifically diagnose plaintiff\u2019s ailment, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-7\">Well, when a person is exposed to different fumes and they experience that type of problem there can be a number of things going on. They can have acute asthma, which would give you the dyspnea, the dizziness, lightheadedness. She could have other types of lung responses .... My diagnosis was that she had a sensitivity to the chemicals in her work environment. And at that point her breathing tests were very slightly abnormal with a normal chest x-ray. There wasn\u2019t an actual disease label to her condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Dr. Stinar advised plaintiff to avoid exposure to chemicals. He later explained his advice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-4\">Well, a person who gives you a very strong and classic history of having bronchial spasm from exposure would be absolutely foolish to continue with exposure to the substance, whether it be a cat, whether it be a perfume or whether it be chemicals at work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-5\">And although she wasn\u2019t disabled when I saw her and probably isn\u2019t disabled now, there is no guarantee that if she continued working around there she wouldn\u2019t become disabled. And so I have to with all my heart tell her not to be exposed to those chemicals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">As a result of Dr. Stinar\u2019s recommendation, plaintiff was transferred to a paperwork position in late January 1987 or early February 1987. Dr. Stinar saw plaintiff again in February and March of 1987, and found that her condition improved when she was not exposed to chemical fumes. On March 31, 1987, plaintiff was fired because defendant company no longer had a paperwork position available for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Plaintiff filed her petition with the Bureau of Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation on April 7, 1987. In December 1987, of her own accord, plaintiff visited Dr. Brush, also a pulmonary specialist. After reviewing Dr. Stinar\u2019s records, Dr. Brush stated that plaintiff had given a \"classic history of 'occupational asthma,\u2019 . . .\u201d although, at that time he found her breathing to be asymptomatic. Dr. Brush agreed with Dr. Stinar\u2019s advice that plaintiff avoid exposure to chemical fumes.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">Also in December 1987, but by request of defendant company, plaintiff visited Dr. Hall. Dr. Hall concluded that plaintiff\u2019s history and physical examination suggested that she suffered from small airways dysfunction, basing his diagnosis on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>breathing tests. He stated that small airways dysfunction is a congenital condition that renders individuals intolerant of odors, fumes, and smoke, but which causes only temporary symptoms, similar to those suffered by plaintiff. When asked whether small airways dysfunction might be caused by exposure to fumes, Dr. Hall responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-4\">Certain fumes are highly suspect in terms of small airways dysfunction. . . . [It] is usually seen in people with an asthmatic tendency or in cigarette smokers. I\u2019m not aware of any reports that organic solvents induce small airways dysfunction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Upon review of the medical depositions provided by both parties and plaintiff\u2019s testimony, the magistrate denied plaintiff benefits. In a two-to-one decision, the wcac reversed and awarded plaintiff continuing disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The Court of Appeals first denied defendant company\u2019s request for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant company then sought leave to appeal in this Court, and at that time, we remanded the case to the Court of Appeals to consider</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-7\">without limitation, the defendant\u2019s contention that, on administrative appellate review, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appellate Commission exceeded its authority in reversing the decision of the magistrate.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">On remand, the Court of Appeals affirmed the wcac and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-9\">We need not decide whether the wcac understood the nature of its review of the magistrate\u2019s fact finding. Because the magistrate made no finding of fact regarding the origin of plaintiff\u2019s sensi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>tivity, the wcac was free to make a factual finding of its own on the issue.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">This Court granted defendant company\u2019s application for leave to consider whether the magistrate made sufficient findings of fact regarding work causation, and, if so, whether the wcac exceeded its review authority. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">II. THE MAGISTRATE\u2019S OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">The Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act requires magistrates to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. MCL 418.847(2); MSA 17.237(847)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-9\">[T]he worker\u2019s compensation magistrate, in addition to a written order, shall file a concise written opinion stating his or her <em>reasoning </em>for the order including any findings of fact and conclusions of law. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">In <em>Kostamo v Marquette Iron Mining Co, </em>405 Mich 105, 136; 274 NW2d 411 (1979), this Court explained that it could not review a decision by the wcac<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> unless its findings of fact</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-11\">are sufficiently detailed so that we can separate the facts it found from the law it applied, and that conclusory findings are inadequate because we need to know the path it has taken through the conflicting evidence, the testimony it has adopted, the standards followed and the reasoning used to reach its conclusion. [Id.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>While <em>Kostamo </em>discussed what level of detail was required of wcac findings, the same requirements also apply to a magistrate\u2019s findings. Additionally, as stated in <em>Powell v Collias, </em>59 Mich App 709, 715; 229 NW2d 897 (1975), quoting 2 Honigman &amp; Hawkins, Michigan Court Rules Annotated (2d ed), p 594:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-5\">\"The findings of fact must include as much of the subsidiary facts as is necessary to disclose the steps by which the [factfinder] reached its ultimate conclusion on each factual issue. The findings should be made at a level of specificity which will disclose to the reviewing [body] the choices made as between competing factual premises at the critical point that controls the ultimate conclusion of fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Although the magistrate was required to sufficiently detail his factual findings to disclose his analytical process, under the heading \"Findings of Fact, Application of Law\u201d in the magistrate\u2019s opinion, he merely provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-7\">Dr. Stinar again examined the plaintiff on March 30, 1987. He found her lungs clear, she was breathing better and demonstrated none of her previous symptoms. Later medical exams by Dr. Hall and Dr. Brush indicate that the plaintiff is fully able to engage in any form of common labor but that she avoid contact with the chemicals she was exposed to at defendant\u2019s plant especially mek. On page 15 of his deposition Dr. John Hall testified that while the plaintiff does have small airways dysfunction that this is a congenital condition and her exposure to a solvent such as mek only causes a temporary irritation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-8\">Based on all the evidence, I find that the plaintiff has failed to prove a compensable disability by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Thomas v Chrysler Corporation, </em>1986 WCABO 3 . . . . [Aff\u2019d 164 Mich App 549; 418 NW2d 96 (1987).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Here, the magistrate included only select portions of Dr. Stinar and Dr. Brush\u2019s testimony, but he neglected to acknowledge that both of these doctors opined that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused by her exposure, to mek at defendant company.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He did not say that he found Dr. Hall more credible than Drs. Stinar and Brush and thus adopted Dr. Hall\u2019s contrary opinion that her injury resulted from a congenital condition rather than from her exposure to mek at defendant company. Further, he did not explain the law that he applied to arrive at his conclusion. He did not say that he found that plaintiff had failed to prove that her injury was caused by her work at defendant company; nor did he provide the holding or the reasoning of the case law that would support his decision to deny benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Although he did cite <em>Thomas, </em>he did not provide the reason for that citation. Nor did he state, as the wcab did in <em>Thomas, </em>that \"[i]n this case, we find as fact that the employment . . . caused at most an exacerbation of symptomatology and did not cause or aggravate the plaintiff\u2019s underlying condition.\u201d 1986 WCABO 5. He could have easily stated that <em>Thomas </em>stood for the proposition that an employer is liable for any disability that stems from the plaintiff\u2019s sensitivity to chemicals if that sensitivity arose out of her employment. <em>Thomas, </em>164 Mich App 555. However, if it did not arise out of her employment but was a congenital condition, the employer would only be liable for benefits for a work injury that causes temporary symptoms during the time the work-induced symptoms caused disability. Id.__</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Although the magistrate could have clearly articulated his findings of fact and the law he applied, he did not do so. In contrast, what he did was present some of the medical testimony and then conclude that \"the plaintiff has failed to prove a compensable disability by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d He did not provide any reasoning whatsoever to support his conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">The opinion\u2019s inadequacy then forced the wcac to speculate regarding the facts and the legal reasoning that the magistrate relied on to reach his conclusion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because we are remanding to a magistrate for further fact finding on causation, we decline to discuss the errors made by the wcac or the Court of Appeals on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">The magistrate did not make findings of fact that were sufficiently detailed for us to separate the facts found from the law applied. Further, the conclusory findings are inadequate because we need to know the path taken through the conflicting evidence, the testimony adopted, the standards followed, and the reasoning used to reach his conclusion. Thus, we reverse the decisions of the wcac and the Court of Appeals, and remand the case to a magistrate for further proceedings and detailed findings of fact regarding whether the plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused by her exposure to mek at defendant company. <em>Kostamo, supra </em>at 138.</p>\n<judges id=\"b867-8\">Brickley, C.J., and Levin and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-10\"> Unpublished order entered May 20, 1992 (Docket No. 141557).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b863-11\"> 441 Mich 910 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b864-12\"> 204 Mich App 259, 262; 514 NW2d 228 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b864-13\"> 448 Mich 851 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b864-14\"> Although <em>Kostamo </em>predated the 1985 amendments of the wdca and thus referred to the wcab rather than the wcac, the principles <em>Kostamo </em>expressed apply equally to findings of fact by magistrates under the 1985 amendments of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b866-7\"> In Dr. Stinar\u2019s deposition of January 11, 1988, he stated on page 9 that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was \"classic for chemical-induced bronchial spasm.\u201d In addition, Dr. Brush determined that the plaintiff had \"occupational asthma that developed as a result of chemical exposures on her job.\u201d Deposition of March 1, 1988 at 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b867-9\"> This speculation was further the result of the magistrate\u2019s failure to accept the parties\u2019 stipulation that the plaintiff was a skilled worker.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b868-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Weaver, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWg\">(dissenting).

Therefore, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">ADMINISTRATIVE APPELLATE REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"ABX\">A. FINDINGS OF FACT</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the wcac\u2019s reversal of the magistrate on the ground that the magistrate failed to make findings of fact regarding the cause of plaintiff\u2019s pulmonary difficulties. The Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act requires magistrates to make findings of fact. MCL 418.847(2); MSA 17.237(847)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-7\">[T]he worker\u2019s compensation magistrate, in addition to a written order, shall file a concise written opinion stating his or her reasoning for the order including any findings of fact and conclusions of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">Findings of fact are \"[determinations from the evidence of a case . . . concerning facts averred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>by one party and denied by another.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Findings of fact are integral to the effective administration of justice. <em>People v Smith, </em>101 Mich App 110, 115; 300 NW2d 470 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The primary purpose of both administrative and judicial fact finding is to facilitate appellate review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \"Findings of fact in a nonjury case serve a function paralleling the judge\u2019s charge in a jury case, that of revealing the law applied by the fact finder.\u201d <em>People v Jackson, </em>390 Mich 621, 627; 212 NW2d 918 (1973). Findings of fact map the path taken by a trial court through conflicting evidence. <em>Powell v Collias, </em>59 Mich App 709, 714; 229 NW2d 897 (1975), citing <em>Braidwood v Harmon, </em>31 Mich App 49, 58-59; 187 NW2d 559 (1971). Brevity in the articulation of factual findings is not fatal, as long as the appellate body is not forced to draw so many inferences that its review becomes merely speculative. <em>Powell v Collias, supra </em>at 714, 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">In this case, plaintiff bore the burden of proving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>by a preponderance of the evidence that her exposure to chemical fumes caused her injury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-4\">In all successful workers\u2019 compensation cases, the claimant must establish by a preponderance of the evidence both a personal injury and a relationship between the injury and the workplace. Where it is only plaintiff\u2019s symptoms, not his underlying condition, which have been aggravated by his employment, plaintiff is entitled to a closed award of benefits only.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">To that end, plaintiff provided the deposition testimony of two pulmonary specialists, Dr. Stinar and Dr. Brush, both of whom attributed the cause of her difficulties, at least in part, to her exposure to chemical fumes. Of his diagnosis Dr. Brush noted, \"[ojbviously this is conjecture on my part since I did not evaluate the patient\u201d when she was working with chemicals. However, defendant\u2019s pulmonary specialist, Dr. Hall, attributed the cause of plaintiff\u2019s difficulties to a congenital condition that was only temporarily aggravated by exposure to chemical fumes.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Because the doctors\u2019 depositions offered conflicting evidence regarding the cause of plaintiff\u2019s difficulties, it was incumbent upon the magistrate to articulate which evidence he found persuasive. The magistrate found:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Dr. Stinar again examined the plaintiff on March 30, 1987.

On page 15 of his deposition Dr. John Hall testified that while the plaintiff does have small airways dysfunction that this is a congenital condition and her exposure to a solvent such as mek only causes a temporary irritation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-5\">Based on all the evidence, I find that the plaintiff has failed to prove a compensable disability by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">The magistrate did not merely review the evidence as concluded by the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor is the magistrate\u2019s discussion of the facts impermissibly selective as suggested by the majority.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather, the magistrate distilled from the testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>mony of each doctor facts relevant to the legal question of compensability. The magistrate was cognizant of the causal link required between plaintiff\u2019s alleged disability and her work and he clearly accepted Dr. Hall\u2019s diagnosis of small airways dysfunction and that small airways dysfunction was a congenital condition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The possible causes proposed by Drs. Stinar and Brush were incompatible with Dr. Hall\u2019s and it was, therefore, unnecessary for the magistrate to specifically reject them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Furthermore, the magistrate\u2019s finding that Drs. Stinar and Brush each advised plaintiff to avoid chemical fumes is not inconsistent with his conclusion that small airways dysfunction caused her symptoms. Even Dr. Hall acknowledged that chemical fumes would temporarily irritate plaintiff\u2019s condition. Appellate review was not hindered by the magistrate\u2019s brevity, nor was it necessary for the wcac to make inferences in order to understand the magistrate\u2019s legal conclusion regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>work causation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore, I would hold that the magistrate adequately stated findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">B. SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">The findings of fact by a worker\u2019s compensation magistrate are conclusive on appellate review by the wcac if supported by \"competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The wcac must defer to the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact if \"a reasonable mind\u201d would accept the evidence on the whole record as \"adequate to justify the conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Magistrates may pass on the credibility of witnesses and draw inferences from the facts they find. <em>Thomas v Chrysler Corp, </em>164 Mich App 549, 557; 418 NW2d 96 (1987). If the wcac finds that a magistrate\u2019s decision regarding witness credibility is not supported by substantial evidence, it must clearly explain why.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The wcac acts beyond the scope of its appellate review powers if it renders its own \"findings of fact in the face of substantial evidence . . . .\u201d <em>Palmer v ITT Hancock, </em>189 Mich App 509, 515; 474 NW2d 136 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">This Court addressed review for \"substantial evidence\u201d in <em>Holden v Ford Motor Co, </em>439 Mich 257, 261-262; 484 NW2d 227 (1992).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>This substantial evidence standard provides for administrative appellate review more deferential to the hearing officer\u2019s decision than de novo review, but for more searching review by the wcac than judicial review under the \"any evidence standard.\u2019[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Quoting <em>MERC v Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Inc, </em>393 Mich 116, 124; 223 NW2d 283 (1974), in <em>Holden </em>this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-6\">\"Although [substantial evidence] . . . review does not attain the status of de novo review, it necessarily entails a degree of qualitative and quantitative evaluation of evidence considered by an agency. Such review must be undertaken with considerable sensitivity in order that the courts accord due deference to administrative expertise and not invade the province of exclusive administrative fact-finding by displacing an agency\u2019s choice between two reasonably differing views.\u201d[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">Correct application of the substantial evidence standard furthers the legislative goal of reducing the number of appeals from magistrate decisions. <em>Holden, supra </em>at 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">The wcac explained its reversal of the magistrate in this case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-9\">In the case before us there is ample medical and lay testimony linking plaintiff\u2019s pulmonary problems to her exposure to chemicals at defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the competent, material, and substantial evidence on the record as a whole, together with the correct application of the relevant law, require a finding that plaintiff has a work-related disability due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>sensitization found to have developed as a result of her chemical exposure at defendant which prevents her from returning to her skilled work as a laboratory. technician. . . . The Magistrate\u2019s findings to the contrary are unsupported by the requisite evidence, and they are legally incorrect.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Although the wcac had no difficulty understanding the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact regarding causation, it failed to accord the magistrate\u2019s findings the requisite deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">The correct appellate review standard was not whether there was \"ample\u201d evidence linking plaintiff\u2019s difficulties to chemical fumes. The correct appellate review standard was whether a reasonable person could accept the magistrate\u2019s findings as adequate to support his conclusion that the plaintiff had failed to prove a compensable disability by the preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Because conflicting conclusions could be drawn from the evidence presented in this case, it was the magistrate\u2019s duty, as the trier of fact, to discern which evidence he found to be credible.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The magistrate\u2019s findings were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-8\">1. As of March 30, 1987, Dr. Stinar found that plaintiff exhibited \"none of her previous symptoms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-9\">2. Subsequent examinations by Drs. Hall and Brush showed plaintiff to be \"fully able to engage in any form of common labor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-10\">3. Plaintiff was advised by all three doctors to avoid \"contact with the chemicals\u201d used at defendant\u2019s plant, especially mek._</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>4.

Her exposure to a \"solvent such as mek only causes a temporary irritation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">The wcac asserted that these findings were \"unsupported by the requisite evidence . . . .\u201d 1991 WCACO 367, 373. The wcac evidently inferred its finding that plaintiff\u2019s difficulties \"developed as a result of her chemical exposure\u201d from Drs. Stinar and Brush\u2019s advice to plaintiff to avoid chemical exposure. However, the wcac failed to explain why such a finding was necessary, given evidence to the contrary. The wcac essentially conducted a de novo review when it substituted its findings for those of the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">Both Dr. Stinar and Dr. Brush appear to have based their advice to plaintiff on plaintiff\u2019s self-described symptoms. Because the magistrate had the opportunity to observe plaintiff\u2019s testimony and to gauge her credibility, it was within his authority to accord Dr. Hall\u2019s diagnosis greater weight. The magistrate\u2019s finding that plaintiff suffered from a congenital condition that was only temporarily aggravated by chemical fumes is reasonably based on evidence from the record and adequate to justify his conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">Therefore, I would hold that the wcac exceeded its appellate review authority by failing to accord the magistrate\u2019s findings the deference required by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">Because the magistrate made findings of fact on the basis of substantial evidence that support his conclusion that plaintiff was not compensably dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>abled, and because the wcac failed to accord the magistrate\u2019s findings and conclusion the deference required by statute, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the opinion of the magistrate.</p>\n<judges id=\"b877-5\">Boyle and Riley, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-9\"> See, e.g., <em>Holden v Ford Motor Co, </em>439 Mich 257; 484 NW2d 227 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b868-10\"> 1985 PA 103.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b869-7\"> Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\"> MCR 2.517(A) sets forth the more inclusive requirements for findings by the court than those required of magistrates by MCL 418.847; MSA 17.237(847).

Ironically, the majority exceeds its review authority and effectively revives de novo review, contrary to the 1985 amendments to the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act. By selectively omitting pertinent details from Dr. Brush\u2019s testimony, the majority fails to match the magistrate\u2019s clarity and thoroughness. Dr. Brush\u2019s diagnosis was equivocal. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-10\">Presently there is no evidence of any lung disease whatsoever in Mrs. Woody. <em>From review of her history and records from Dr. Steiner\u2019s </em>[sic] <em>office, I would, however, suspect </em>that she did indeed [sic] an occupational asthma that developed as a result of chemical exposures on her job. She gives a classic history of \"occupational asthma\u201d and has cleared significantly since she has left the area. The fact that she saw an allergist and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>told that she had other allergies is likewise very consistent with this development of occupational asthma. <em>Obviously this is conjecture on my part since I did not evaluate the patient at that time, but it is all very typical of this pattern. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b872-11\"> This conclusion is supported by the fact that the magistrate relied on <em>Thomas v Chrysler Corp, </em>1986 WCABO 3, 4. In <em>Thomas, </em>an employee claimed that exposure to grease, oil, and hot temperatures caused \"pimpling\u201d all over his body. The wcab denied the claim because the claimant failed to prove that his work caused or aggravated his preexisting condition. The Court of Appeals affirmed citing <em>Carter v General Motors Corp, </em>361 Mich 577, 594; 106 NW2d 105 (1960). \"Where it is only plaintiff\u2019s symptoms, not his underlying condition, which have been aggravated by his employment, plaintiff is entitled to a closed award of benefits only.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>n 6 <em>supra </em>at 555.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b872-12\"> The majority\u2019s misreading of the magistrate\u2019s opinion promises to further confuse this area of law.
