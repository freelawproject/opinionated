Finding no basis for the conclusion that the prosecutor\u2019s questions and comments \"shifted the burden of proof\u201d to the defendant, we reverse the Court of Appeals decision and remand the case for consideration of the issues not addressed in the original appellate decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">During the early morning hours of June 30, 1991, Battle Creek police officers responded to a call and went to the home of defendant\u2019s wife, Ola Fields. When the officers arrived, they found Ms. Fields suffering from four nonfatal gunshot wounds: one to the right temple, one to the back of her head, one to her right shoulder, and one to her right wrist. She was alert and angrily explained that she and her husband were separated and that he had shot her because she would not allow him to move back into her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Ms. Fields told the officers she was sitting in the bathroom when defendant suddenly appeared in the doorway and began firing at her. He shot her three times in the bathroom and once as she fled into the living room. The police verified that there were blood splatters in:, the bathroom and a trail of blood drops through the living room proceeding to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>the house next door where Ms. Fields fled with her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Defendant was arrested about twenty minutes later in downtown Battle Creek. At the time of the arrest, police found a .22 caliber revolver with five spent cartridges in his pocket. Defendant volunteered to the arresting officer that he had shot his wife and that he hoped she was dead. He made a similar statement to the officer who transported him to the police station, and again to the corrections officer who inventoried his possessions. When he was later questioned by an investigating detective, defendant claimed the shooting resulted from an argument he was having with his wife over the paternity of their nine-month-old daughter. Defendant alleged that during the argument, his wife had retrieved a .22 caliber pistol that her father had given her and tried to shoot him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant claimed he was able to take the pistol from his wife, fired at her several times, and hoped \"the bitch was dead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Three and one-half months after the shooting, the prosecutor received an affidavit from Ola Fields and a letter and affidavit from defendant; both affidavits claimed that the shooter was not defendant but was actually Joanne Walker, a woman with whom defendant was allegedly having an affair. Defendant\u2019s letter to the prosecutor gave a Detroit address for Joanne Walker and asked the prosecutor to arrest her to clear his name.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The affidavits stated that Walker appeared at the door of Ms. Fields\u2019 home on the evening of the shooting to talk to defendant, that an argument ensued between Walker and Ms. Fields, and that Walker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>pulled out a pistol and fired several shots at Ms. Fields. Defendant claimed he was able to wrestle the pistol away from Walker, who fled, and that Ms. Fields then began accusing defendant of. responsibility for the shooting because his affair with Walker had brought her to the house. Defendant claims to have left the house at that point and headed toward the police station to explain what had just transpired. He walked past the station, however, because he was not sure what he wanted to report. It was at that point that he was arrested. Defendant claims he decided to take the blame for the shooting because he did not want Walker, who was pregnant with his child, to go to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">At trial, Ola Fields recanted the statements made to the police officers at the time of shooting identifying defendant as the shooter, and testified consistent with her affidavit<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the shooter was actually Joanne Walker.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Defendant took the stand at trial, gave testimony consistent with his affidavit and letter, and recanted or denied the various statements he made following his arrest. Defendant testified that he had been having an affair with Joanne Walker for approximately six months before the shooting. He stated that he had been to Ms. Walker\u2019s Detroit apartment on one occasion and that he had seen her once or twice a week when she came to Battle Creek to visit some friends. Defendant testified that on the day before the shooting, he was supposed to meet Walker but did not, and that on the night of the shooting Walker appeared at Ms. Fields\u2019 home. According to defendant, when his wife asked Walker to leave, an argument ensued during which Walker pulled out a pistol and fired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>several quick shots before defendant could wrest the gun from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">A longtime friend of defendant testified on his behalf and stated that a month or two before the shooting, he had encountered defendant in the area of a local food store. The defendant was driving his car and was accompanied by a woman the defendant introduced as Joanne Walker.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The existence of Joanne Walker was a critical issue at trial. Moreover, because defendant and his wife both testified that they had sent affidavits to the prosecutor asserting Walker\u2019s culpability and asking him to arrest her, a subtext of this issue had been introduced in the form of an inference that the prosecutor\u2019s failure to follow up on Walker\u2019s whereabouts suggested either indifference to the question of the real culprit or a vindictive prosecution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">During the cross-examination of defendant, the prosecutor twice sought to determine what attempts defendant made to locate Walker.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>dant suggested that the prosecution should have located her.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In closing arguments, the prosecutor<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>that Joanne Walker did not exist, and defendant<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>argued that Joanne Walker shot Ola Fields.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The jury found defendant guilty of assault with intent to murder<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial judge sentenced him to twenty-five to fifty years\u2019 imprisonment for the assault and a consecutive two-year term for the felony-firearm.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In the Court of Appeals, defendant argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>among other things that the prosecutor impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant by questioning him about his efforts to produce Joanne Walker and by arguing to the jury that the evidence\u2019 presented by defendant failed to establish that Joanne Walker existed. The Court of Appeals agreed that the prosecutor \"shifted the burden of proof to defendant by allowing the jury to draw improper adverse inferences from defendant\u2019s failure to produce Walker\u201d and, in an unpublished opinion per curiam,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> reversed the trial court\u2019s decision and remanded the case for a new trial.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The prosecutor appealed and we granted leave. 447 Mich 996 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The prosecutor contends that the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the prosecutor\u2019s questions and comments regarding the credibility Of the defense theory shifted the burden of proof to defendant to prove his innocence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Arguments involving claims that the prosecutor\u2019s questions, argument, or instructions \"shifted the burden of proof\u201d often present a confused potpourri of analytically distinct claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">One theory on which a claim that conduct or instruction has \"shifted the burden of proof\u201d is premised, is the body of law partially relied on by defendant and the Court of Appeals<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> dealing with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the propriety of arguments and the instructional inferences that can be drawn from the failure of a witness to testify at trial. As the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Graves v United States, </em>150 US 118, 121; 14 S Ct 40; 37 L Ed 1021 (1893), explained in dictum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">[I]f a party has it peculiarly within his power to produce [evidence or] witnesses whose testimony would elucidate the transaction, the fact that he does not do it creates the presumption that the [evidence or] testimony, if produced, would be unfavorable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The Fifth Amendment does not prohibit instructions on otherwise permissible inferences. <em>Barnes v United States, </em>412 US 837; 93 S Ct 2357; 37 L Ed 2d 380 (1973). Thus, the missing witness rule allows comment by counsel and an adverse inference instruction<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to be given if certain conditions are fulfilled. 2 McCormick, Evidence (4th ed), \u00a7 264, pp 184-189. The inference is permissive and comment and instruction is allowed only when the connection between the circumstances of the case and the inference that the evidence would be adverse is so logical that the factfinder is permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>ted to make that connection, typically when production of the witness is peculiarly within the power of the party against whom the inference of adverse testimony is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">We need not address the requirements of the doctrine, however, because that rule is inapplicable to the present case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The prosecutor did not argue and the jury was not instructed that it could find that Walker\u2019s testimony would have been adverse to the defense. Rather, the prosecutor\u2019s questions and comments were directed toward impeaching the defense version of the shooting by focusing the jury\u2019s attention on defendant\u2019s failure to search for Walker beyond notifying the prosecutor that she existed and asking the prosecution to locate her. Arguing that a witness or evidence does not exist attacks the credibility of the theory presented. It is not a request that the jury infer that an absent witness\u2019 testimony would have been unfavorable to the defendant. There is a significant difference between urging jurors to accept that the absent witness\u2019 testimony would have been adverse to the defendant \"and asking them to infer from the evidence that a person whose conduct as described would have exonerated the accused from commission of the charged crime was merely a product of the defendant\u2019s imagination.\u201d <em>Alston v United States, </em>552 A2d 526, 528 (DC App, 1989). Where the prosecutor\u2019s argument does not invite the jury to infer that the absent witness\u2019 testimony would be unfavorable, the missing witness cases are inapposite. <em>United States v Martin, </em>696 F2d 49 (CA 6, 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Questioning the credibility of the evidence pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>sented, however, does not entail the risk associated with the missing witness rule.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Arguments regarding the weight and credibility of the witnesses and evidence presented by defendant do not shift the burden to the defendant to prove his innocence, but rather question the reliability of the testimony and evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v Pitts, </em>286 US App DC 392; 918 F2d 197 (1990), a missing witness case, is therefore misplaced. The question presented in <em>Pitts, </em>and the cases cited therein, was whether an \"inference of testimony adverse to the accused may be drawn from the absence\u201d of an actual witness who would in all likelihood invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination if called as a witness. <em>Id. </em>at 395. While concluding \"that the trial court erred in allowing the missing witness argument and in giving the related instruction,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 396, the <em>Pitts </em>court specifically did \"not decide the extent to which a prosecutor, in commenting on the evidence or lack thereof, may suggest that a witness\u2019s absence should weigh against the defense in some other way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395. Whtere a witness\u2019 testimony would be privileged under the Fifth Amendment, the witness is deemed unavailable, and thus the jury may not be instructed or asked to infer that the witness would provide testimony damaging to the defendant. Stated otherwise, the absence of the witness is not relevant to the party\u2019s belief in the strength or weight of his evidence. No inference can be drawn because there is no evidentiary basis from which to draw one. By contrast, argument regarding the absence of a witness, who is injected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>into the case by one of the parties, illustrates the lack of believability of the events in question.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Here, as in <em>Alston, supra </em>at 528, \"the prosecutor did not argue that the witness, had [sjhe been produced, would have testified unfavorably, nor did he argue that the witness was conspicuously absent, leaving the jury to draw their own conclusions.\u201d Rather, the prosecutor argued that Joanne Walker did not exist, an inference reasonably drawn from the fact that defendant sought to rely on his request to the prosecutor to arrest Walker, and a legitimate attack on the credibility of the defense theory. His comments were merely an argument that the jury need not believe defendant\u2019s version of how Ms. Fields was shot because of the weakness of the effort made to locate her, i.e., asking the prosecutor to do so. Where a defendant\u2019s testimony alludes to the possibility that an absent \"witness\u201d would exculpate the defendant, the prosecutor is entitled to explore the credibility of such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">A second argument advanced under the umbrella of \"burden shifting\u201d is an allegation of improper comment under the Fifth Amendment. A defendant in a criminal case has a constitutional right against compelled self-incrimination and may elect to rely on the \"presumption of innocence.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> US Const, Am V; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15. To effectuate this right, no reference or comment may be made regarding defendant\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>testify. <em>Griffin v California, </em>380 US 609; 85 S Ct 1229; 14 L Ed 2d 106 (1965); MCL 600.2159; MSA 27A.2159.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Because defendant testified at trial, the prosecutor\u2019s comments did not, and could not, impinge on defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right not to testify. Defendant did not elect to rely on the presumption of innocence but, rather, testified in great detail how Ms. Fields was shot. As LaFave and Israel note, \"[t]he prohibition upon comment extends no farther than the reach of the Fifth Amendment privilege . ...\u201d 3 LaFave &amp; Israel, Criminal Procedure, \u00a7 23.4, p 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">In taking the stand, defendant waived his Fifth Amendment rights. If, \"after weighing the advantage of the privilege against self-incrimination against the advantage of putting forward his version of the facts and his reliability as a witness,\u201d a defendant decides to testify,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">[h]e cannot reasonably claim that the Fifth Amendment gives him not only this choice but ... an immunity from cross-examination on the matters he has himself put in dispute. It would make of the Fifth Amendment not only a humane safeguard against judicially coerced self-disclosure but a positive invitation to mutilate the truth a party offers to tell. <em>[Brown v United States, </em>356 US 148, 155-156; 78 S Ct 622; 2 L Ed 2d 589 (1958).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">\"[T]he protective shield of the Fifth Amendment should [not] be converted into a sword that cuts back on the area of legitimate comment by the prosecutor on the weaknesses in the defense case.\u201d <em>United States v Hastings, </em>461 US 499, 515; 103 S Ct 1974; 76 L Ed 2d 96 (1983) (Stevens, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>In general,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> where a defendant \"takes the stand and testifies in his own defense, his credibility may be impeached and his testimony assailed like that of any other witness . . . <em>Brown, supra </em>at 154. Because defendant elected to testify at trial, the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination and argument did not burden the Fifth Amendment privilege not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Moreover, since it is well established that <em>Griffin, supra, </em>protects only the privilege against compelled self-incrimination, fair comment does not violate the Fifth Amendment, even where the defendant does not take the stand. In <em>United States v Robinson, </em>485 US 25, 30; 108 S Ct 864; 99 L Ed 2d 23 (1988), where the defendant did not testify and his lawyer argued in closing that the government had unfairly denied him the opportunity to explain his side of the story, the Court found \"no constitutional error at all\u201d in the prosecutor\u2019s statement in rebuttal that the defendant \"could have taken the stand and explained it to you . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29. The Court squarely rejected the claim that any \" 'direct\u2019 reference by the prosecutor to the failure of the defendant to testify violates the Fifth Amendment as construed in <em>Griffin.\u201d Id. </em>at 31. Stressing that contextual analysis is the proper approach to such a claim, the Court concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was a fair response to an issue raised by the defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">\"[The] central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence . . . .\u201d To this end it is important that both the defendant and the prosecutor have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the opportunity to meet fairly the evidence and arguments of one another. The broad dicta in <em>Griffin </em>to the effect that the Fifth Amendment \"forbids . . . comment by the prosecution on the accused\u2019s silence,\u201d must be taken in light of the facts of that case. It is one thing to hold, as we did in <em>Griffin, </em>that the prosecutor may not treat a defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to remain silent at trial as substantive evidence of guilt; it is quite another to urge, as defendant does here, that the same reasoning would prohibit the prosecutor from fairly responding to an argument of the defendant by adverting to that silence. There may be some \"cost\u201d to the defendant in having remained silent in each situation, but we decline to expand <em>Griffin </em>to preclude a fair response by the prosecutor in situations such as the present one. <em>[Id. </em>at 33-34 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Like the comments in <em>Robinson, </em>the prosecutor\u2019s comments in this case were a \"fair response\u201d to defendant\u2019s argument that Walker was the shooter.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Our Court of Appeals has addressed on many occasions the claim that prosecutorial comment on the failure of the defendant to call corroborating witnesses \"shifted the burden of proof.\u201d See <em>People v Spivey, </em>202 Mich App 719; 509 NW2d 908 (1993); <em>People v Holland, </em>179 Mich App 184; 445 NW2d 206 (1989); <em>People v Shannon, </em>88 Mich App 138, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>145; 276 NW2d 546 (1979). These published opinions of the Court of Appeals have consistently held that when a defendant advances an alternate theory or alibi, \"the prosecution, by commenting on the nonproduction of corroborating alibi witnesses, is merely pointing out the weakness in defendant\u2019s case\u201d and not \"improperly shifting the burden of proof to the defendant.\u201d <em>Shannon, supra </em>at 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">In <em>People v Gant, </em>48 Mich App 5; 209 NW2d 874 (1973), the Court of Appeals explained why such comment does not. shift the burden of proof.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">This approach [comment by the prosecutor on the defendant\u2019s failure to call witnesses to support his defense] does not cast the burden upon defendant to prove his innocence since defendant cannot be convicted upon the basis that he failed to affirmatively prove his defense. The circumstantial evidence resulting from defendant\u2019s failure to offer evidence and witnesses to support a proffered defense is no substitute for the prosecutor\u2019s burden to prove defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In spite of this failure, defendant cannot be convicted unless the prosecution has carried its burden of proof on every element of the crime charged. While defendant is free to offer to the jury a defense supported only by his testimony, the nonproduction of other evidence, known and available to defendant, provides the jury with yet another fact for use to test his credibility. <em>[Id. </em>at 9-10.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Stated otherwise, if the prosecutor\u2019s comments do not burden a defendant\u2019s right not to testify, commenting on a defendant\u2019s failure to call a witness does not shift the burden of proof. <em>United States v Dahdah, </em>864 F2d 55 (CA 7, 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Nor is such comment violative of due process under another form of the burden shifting argument, which traces its lineage to the constitution\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>preclusion of a presumption on an element of the offense that shifts the burden of disproving that element to the defense. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 US 358; 90 S Ct 1068; 25 L Ed 2d 368 (1970). A permissive presumption allows, but does not require, the jury to find proof of an element of the crime from proof of a basic fact, and \"affects the application of the 'beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 standard only if, under the facts of the case, there is no rational way the trier could make the connection permitted by the inference.\u201d <em>Ulster Co Court </em>v <em>Allen, </em>442 US 140, 157; 99 S Ct 2213; 60 L Ed 2d 777 (1979). Instructions on mandatory presumptions may shift the burden of production or persuasion, and shifting the burden of proof or persuasion on an element of the crime charged violates due process. <em>Ulster Co v Allen, supra; Sandstrom v Montana, </em>442 US 510; 99 S Ct 2450; 61 L Ed 2d 39 (1979); <em>Francis v Franklin, </em>471 US 307; 105 S Ct 1965; 85 L Ed 2d 344 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The instant case involves neither a permissive inference about an element of the charge, nor a mandatory presumption that shifts the burden of production or the burden of persuasion on an element of the offense. There is no suggestion that the jury was required to find the elements of the offense from the defendant\u2019s failure to advance evidence, nor did the state allocate any burden to the defendant to disprove an element of the offense.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \"No presumptions\u2014'[g]iven the common definition of \"presume\u201d as \"to suppose to be true without proof,\u201d \u2019 <em>Sandstrom [supra </em>at 517] (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary </em>[1974])\u2014were ever presented to them.\u201d <em>United States v Gotchis, </em>803 F2d 74, 80 (CA 2, 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Judge Easterbrook\u2019s analysis of the imprecision of burden shifting arguments based on prosecutorial comment is typically insightful and merits extensive quotation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-3\">A prosecutor who comments on a defendant\u2019s failure to call a witness may mean one of three things: (1) the case stands unrebutted, which influences the weight jurors should give to the evidence; (2) each side can call witnesses, implying that neither side\u2019s failure to call a witness supports an adverse inference; (3) the defendants\u2019 failure to call the witness supports an inference that the witness would not have supported the defendants\u2019 version of events. The defendants, who complain that the prosecutor\u2019s comments here \"shifted the burden of proof,\u201d apparently believe that any of these three meanings is forbidden ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\">Now none of these meanings actually changes the burden; the district judge correctly instructed the jury that the prosecutor bears the burden at all times. An inference is a way to carry the burden, and no more changes it than does damning evidence. The defendants\u2019 real complaint is that a given argument may adversely affect the exercise (or value of) a constitutional right, such as the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. Thus the. defendants\u2019 arguments about burden-shifting are offshoots of <em>Griffin v California </em>. . . . <em>[United States v Sblendorio, </em>830 F2d 1382, 1391 (CA 7, 1987).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In rejecting the defendant\u2019s burden shifting argument, Judge Easterbrook explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">The defendant\u2019s decisions about evidence other than his own testimony do not implicate the privilege [against self-incrimination], and a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to call a witness does not tax the exercise of the privilege. It simply asks the jury to assess the value of the existing evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>dence in light of the countermeasures that were (or were not) taken. The inferences come from the evidence before the court. . . . Unless the prosecutor or judge implies that the defendant\u2019s failure to testify is itself evidence (or a basis for an adverse inference), Griffin is inapplicable. <em>[Id.][</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In sum, prosecutorial comment that infringes on a defendant\u2019s right not to testify may constitute error. However, where a defendant testifies at trial or advances, either explicitly or implicitly, an alternate theory of the case that, if true, would exonerate the defendant, comment on the validity of the alternate theory cannot be said to shift the burden of proving innocence to the defendant. Although a defendant has no burden to produce any evidence, once the defendant advances evidence or a theory, argument on the inferences created does not shift the burden of proof.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Thus, the Court of Appeals has correctly concluded that the prosecutor may comment on the weakness of defendant\u2019s alibi, <em>Spivey </em>and <em>Shannon, supra, </em>and may observe that the evidence against the defendant is \"uncontroverted\u201d or \"undisputed,\u201d <em>People v Earl, </em>299 Mich 579; 300 NW 890 (1941), even if defendant is the only one who could have contradicted the evidence, <em>People v Cummings, </em>139 Mich App 286; 362 NW2d 252 (1984), or has failed to call corroborating witnesses, <em>People v Jackson, </em>108 Mich App 346, 352; 310 NW2d 238 (1981), or proved what it said it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>would in its opening statement, <em>People v White, </em>401 Mich 482; 257 NW2d 912 (1977), and that the defendant has failed to \"take advantage of available opportunities to pursue matters relevant to his alibi defense.\u201d <em>People v Lyles, </em>148 Mich App 583, 593; 385 NW2d 676 (1986).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The nature and type of comment allowed is dictated by the defense asserted, and the defendant\u2019s decision regarding whether to testify. When a defense makes an issue legally relevant, the prosecutor is not prohibited from commenting on the improbability of the defendant\u2019s theory or evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s comments in this case were proper. His comments did not require an improper adverse inference, did not infringe on defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right, and did not shift the burden of proof. The state was not absolved from proving each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>The prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination was directed to the weaknesses inherent in the defense theory. The argument presented the factfinder with the logical inference that defendant\u2019s and Ms. Fields\u2019 testimony that Walker had done the shooting was false. The prosecutor did not suggest that defendant had a duty to produce Walker, nor did he argue that Joanne Walker\u2019s testimony would have been adverse to defendant. Rather, the argument asked the factfinder to assess the existing evidence in light of the efforts that were not taken. The prosecutor was not commenting on defendant\u2019s failure to produce evidence, but on the evidence defendant did produce\u2014defendant\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s argument in this case was not that the defendant had a burden to prove his innocence, but that the testimony of defendant and his wife was not credible because, if Walker did exist, defendant would have made a greater effort to substantiate that fact than sending one letter to the prosecutor\u2019s office. Likewise, defendant alluded to friends that Walker would stay with when she came to Battle Creek, yet defendant did not call any of these friends to establish Walker\u2019s existence. The prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding the absence of these witnesses at trial was entirely appropriate and simply illustrated the incredulity of the proffered defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">It would be inconsistent to allow comment on the failure of defendant to call a verifiable witness, peculiarly available to the defendant and not called, see <em>People v Hunter, </em>218 Mich 525; 188 NW 346 (1922), but to deny the opportunity to test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>the likelihood that the alleged witness is a fictional character. More importantly, such an approach would encourage fabrication of missing witnesses because the claim would be immunized from exploration on cross-examination or argument. Where, as here, a defense theory is explicitly advanced by the defendant, the factfinder is to evaluate the reliability of the claim through traditional means.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Defendant chose to offer a defense that was contingent on the credibility of both Ms. Fields and himself. In electing to assert this defense, defendant invited cross-examination and argument by the prosecutor about the validity and weight of the evidence in support of his theory. Finding no error, constitutional or otherwise, we reverse and remand this case to the Court of Appeals to consider the remaining issues not considered in its previous decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b388-7\">Brickley, C.J., and Levin, Cavanagh, Riley, Mallett, and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\"> During the trial, Ms. Fields\u2019 father denied ever giving his daughter a pistol. ......</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b367-8\"> During the trial, the investigating \u201cofficer testified that he was unable to locate \"Joanne Walker\u201d or her whereabouts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\"> Neither the defendant\u2019s nor Ola field\u2019s affidavit was introduced as evidence at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\"><em> </em>Ms. Fields testified on direct examination that she did not know why the police would let Walker get away with shooting someone.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\"><em>Q.

What the fight was about is immaterial. He shot her.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\"> During her closing argument, defense counsel Ms. Mladenoff commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">Mr. Jenkins would have you believe that Joanne Walker doesn\u2019t exist. And yet Richard Belemor [defendant\u2019s old-time friend] came in and said yes, he was introduced to her by Carl Fields sometime in the spring of 1991. He remembers it because Mr. Fields was driving a red and white Thunderbird. And Mr. Fields testified he got that car in March or April of 1991. She exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">Certainly she was a bone of contention, if nothing else, between Carl Fields and his wife. The Prosecutor made a great deal about the fact that Joanne Walker is not here.

I didn\u2019t have to put Mr. Fields on the stand. I didn\u2019t have to call any witnesses at all. I certainly do not have to produce another person, who has every reason in the world to stay in hiding, and that is because she, in fact, is guilty of this offense and not Carl Fields. What if he didn\u2019t do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-14\">There were only two people here who could testify as to what happened in that house. Ola Fields and Carl Fields. There was a third person, Joanne Walker, who was not available to come into court and testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-15\">And even if we could find her, [she] would be unlikely to say anything on the stand to incriminate herself. Of the two out of the three people who would have knowledge of what happened, two of them have come and under oath told us that Carl Fields did not do the shooting.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\"> In rebuttal argument, the prosecutor responded by commenting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">Now, the defense makes much of the fact that he\u2014Prosecutor\u2014didn\u2019t rustle up, go out and find this Joanne Walker. Well, you have heard Officer Parker testify he did investigations and couldn\u2019t find her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">You then ask yourself, well you can say to yourself, I agree with the defense counsel\u2019s argument that it\u2019s unlikely that Joanne Walker would come up here and admit on the witness stand that she shot Ola Fields.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">Well, that is not all the evidence that defense could have found. The defense could have found, in fact, found the house where she lived. Brought other witnesses in to say sure, I know a Joanne Walker. I went to school with her. She is my lifelong friend, whatever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-11\">Speaking of lifelong friends, of course, we have Mr. Belemor who says I have known Mr. Fields for 20 or 25 years. He is my good buddy, and yet I saw a woman that he introduced to me as Joanne Walker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-12\">Boy, how convenient that three months before this shooting, he had this ready-built character to take the rap for him today. Who wants to rat on then; good friend?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-13\">Secondly, how do we know Carl Fields introduced him to anybody, or anybody by the name of Joanne Walker? But to expect the Prosecuting attorney to find a major component of your defense, is that reasonable? Does your common sense and general knowledge tell you that is what a defense, Defendant is relying upon and expect [sic] the Prosecutor . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-14\"><em>Ms. Mladenoff: </em>Again, for the record, I will object to the Prosecutor shifting the burden.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-15\"><em>The Court: </em>All right.
