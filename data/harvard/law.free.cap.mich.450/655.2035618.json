We conclude that although the University of Michigan is a constitutionally created entity, plaintiff is entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">In May of 1989, the University of Michigan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>decided to renovate buildings at its Dearborn campus. In order to facilitate this project, it hired A. Z. Shmina &amp; Sons, a general contracting firm. Shmina secured its work by providing a labor and materials payment bond which it obtained through Cadillac Insurance Company. Cadillac, however, went into receivership in January of 1990. The Michigan Commissioner of Insurance responded by assigning the bond to defendant Mid-State Surety Corporation. Defendant assumed all the rightful liabilities that Cadillac had under the bond. Specifically, the bond provided that Shmina and Cadillac were liable only to the parties who contracted directly with Shmina.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-3\">Shmina retained several different subcontractors to perform the renovations. One of the subcontractors was the Marino Mechanical Contractor Company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Marino in turn contracted with plaintiff, the W. T. Andrew Company, to provide plumbing, heating, and air conditioning materials. During the construction period, Marino experienced financial difficulties. Consequently, it defaulted on its obligations to Shmina and plaintiff. Shmina was able to recover the amount of credit Marino had posted. However, plaintiff, as a supplier of materials to Marino, remained unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\">On March 24, 1992, plaintiff brought this action against defendant and Marino in Wayne Circuit Court, claiming approximately $70,000 as the unpaid balance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although admitting that it had no direct contact with Shmina, plaintiff argued that it was entitled to recover from defendant under the public works bond statute, MCL 129.201 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.2321(1) <em>et seq. </em>The Wayne Circuit Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>granted summary disposition for plaintiff and a judgment was entered against defendant in the amount of $78,645.63. Defendant subsequently appealed, and, on October 20, 1994, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals directed the trial court to enter an order of summary disposition on behalf of Mid-State. Plaintiff petitioned this Court for leave to appeal, and leave was granted on September 20, 1995.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">MCL 129.201; MSA 5.2321(1) states that a performance and payment bond must be provided by a principal contractor before construction can begin on any public building project exceeding $50,000 in value.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-7\">Before any contract, <em>exceeding $50,000.00 for the construction, </em>alteration, or repair of any public building or public work or improvement of the state or a county, city, village, township, school district, public educational institution, other political subdivision, public authority, or public agency hereinafter referred to as the <em>\"governmental unit,\u201d </em>is awarded, the proposed contractor, hereinafter referred to as the \"principal contractor,\u201d shall furnish at his or her own cost to the governmental unit a <em>performance bond </em>and a <em>payment bond </em>which shall become binding upon the award of the contract to the principal contractor. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">MCL 129.202; MSA 5.2321(2) and MCL 129.203; MSA 5.2321(3) go on to enumerate the purpose behind the performance and payment bonds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-9\">The <em>performance bond </em>shall be in an amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>fixed by the governmental unit but not less than 25% of the contract amount, conditioned upon the faithful performance of the contract in accordance with the plans, specifications and terms thereof. <em>The bond shall be solely for the protection of the governmental unit awarding the contract. </em>[MCL 129.202; MSA 5.2321(2).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-3\">The <em>payment bond </em>shall be in an amount fixed by the governmental unit but not less than 25% of the contract amount solely <em>for the protection of claimants, as de\u00f1ned in section 6, supplying labor or materials to the principal contractor or his subcontractors in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract.[</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>[MCL 129.203; MSA 5.2321(3) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">MCL 129.201; MSA 5.2321(1) is designed to be \"remedial in nature and, therefore, should be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Adamo Equipment Rental Co v Mack Development Co, Inc, </em>122 Mich App 233, 236; 333 NW2d 40 (1982), citing <em>Wallich Lumber Co v Golds, </em>375 Mich 323; 134 NW2d 722 (1965). The Legislature adopted MCL 129.201; MSA 5.2321(1) to protect contractors and materialmen in the public sector to ensure that they do not suffer injury when other contractors default on their obligations. Without this legislation the contractors and materialmen \"were denied the security afforded when the identical work or materials were provided to the private sector.\u201d <em>Adamo Equipment, supra </em>at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">In the present case, Shmina, as the principal contractor, provided a bond that defined a \"claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>ant\u201d as an individual or entity having a direct contract with the principal contractor.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-3\">A claimant is defined as one having a direct contract with the Principal, for labor, material, or both, used in the performance of the Contract; labor and material does not include water, gas, power, light, heat, oil, gasoline, telephone service or rental of equipment directly applicable to the Contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Under the language of this bond, plaintiff could not meet the definition of a claimant because it never entered into a direct contract with the principal, Shmina. The only contract that plaintiff had was with Marino, a subcontractor. Plaintiff, however, maintains that it is entitled to recovery because it meets the definition of a claimant under MCL 129.206; MSA 5.2321(6) of the public works bond statute. (See n 5.) This entire argument hinges on whether MCL 129.201; MSA 5.2321(1), which sets out the bond requirement under the public works bond statute, is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">The Court of Appeals examined this issue and found that MCL 129.201; MSA 5.2321(1) was not applicable. In order to support this conclusion the Court of Appeals relied on <em>Weinberg v Univ of Michigan </em>Regents, 97 Mich 246; 56 NW 605 (1893). In <em>Weinberg, </em>the plaintiff brought suit against the Regents of the University of Michigan in order to recover the value of materials furnished to one of the subcontractors during the construction of the university\u2019s hospital. The basis of plaintiff\u2019s claim was that the regents were negligent in not requiring a bond for the project. This Court found that the University of Michigan was a constitutionally created entity and, as such, could not have its property affected without the consent of the regents. Hence, the action could not be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>The Court of Appeals analysis also relied on <em>William C Reichenbach Co v Michigan, </em>94 Mich App 323; 288 NW2d 622 (1979), for support. In <em>Reichenbach, </em>Michigan State University entered into a construction contract with the Ackerman Construction Company, who subcontracted a portion of the project to Reichenbach. Reichenbach, however, was never fully compensated for its services. Consequently, Reichenbach brought an action, against the State of Michigan and the Michigan State University Board of Trustees, seeking recovery of the amount owed. Reichenbach alleged that Michigan State University\u2019s failure to compel Ackerman to provide a performance and payment bond constituted negligence. Defendant argued that even though 1963 PA 213 required that a performance and payment bond be obtained before construction, the act was not applicable to it. The Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-3\">Thus we hold that the term \"public educational institution,\u201d as. that term is used in the performance bonding statute, applies to only those colleges and universities whose governing boards are not created in the constitution. Hence, the lower court erred in holding the performance bonding statute applicable to defendants. The defendant board of trustees had no obligation to secure a performance bond from the principal contractor and, thus, plaintiff cannot maintain this action in negligence for their failure to do so. <em>[Id. </em>at 336.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">This decision was based on the fact that the Michigan Constitution, under article 8, \u00a7 5, gave complete control and management ability over the university\u2019s affairs to the trustees.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-5\">These constitutional provisions have been interpreted by Michigan appellate courts to give to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>trustees entire control and management over University affairs; including the management of property and expenditure of funds to the exclusion of all other departments of the state. <em>[Reichenbach, supra </em>at 335.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">The University of Michigan is constitutionally created and its board of regents possesses complete power over financial decisions affecting the university.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, we conclude that MCL 129.201; MSA 5.2321(1) does not affect the University of Michigan financially, nor does it interfere with its educational autonomy. Instead, it serves as an exercise of the Legislature\u2019s police power to protect the interests of contractors and materialmen in the public sector. See <em>Adamo Equipment, supra </em>at 236. Consequently, the statute and its definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>of \"claimant\u201d applies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We reverse the Court of Appeals decision that plaintiff is not entitled to a remedy as a claimant under MCL 129.201; MSA 5.2321(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-3\">In order to support this conclusion, we examine <em>Univ of Michigan Regents v Employment Relations Comm, </em>389 Mich 96; 204 NW2d 218 (1973). In <em>Regents, </em>this Court was presented with a group of interns, residents, and postdoctoral fellows connected with the University of Michigan Hospital. These individuals formed an association that attempted to bargain with the university over compensation. The university refused to recognize the association, arguing th\u00e1t it had a right to determine compensation unilaterally. This Court noted that even though the framers of the constitution intended to provide autonomy to the university it was not immune from all laws:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-4\">The desires of the framers of the 1850 and subsequent constitutions to provide autonomy to the Board of Regents in the educational sphere have been protected by our Court for over a century. This concern for the educational process to be controlled by the Regents does not and cannot mean that they are exempt from all the laws of the state. <em>[Id. </em>at 107.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">This Court, then, unanimously concluded that the interns and residents did have a right to organize.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-6\">We hold that interns, residents and post-doctoral fellows may be employees and have rights to organize under the provisions of pera [public employees relations act, MCL 423.201 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>17.455(1) <em>et seq.] </em>without infringing on the constitutional autonomy of the Board of Regents. <em>[Id. </em>at 108.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Although the association could bargain with the university in regard to compensation, this Court noted that other categories would be off limits.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-6\">For example, the Association clearly can bargain with the Regents on the salary that their members receive since it is not within the educational sphere. While normally employees can bargain to discontinue a certain aspect of a particular job, the Association does not have the same latitude as other public employees. For example, interns could not negotiate working in the pathology department because they found such work distasteful. If the administrators of medical schools felt that a certain number of hours devoted to pathology was necessary to the education of the intern, our Court would not interfere since this does fall within the autonomy of the Regents under Article 8, \u00a7 5. <em>[Id. </em>at 109.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">This decision closely parallels the facts presented here. Much as in <em>Regents, </em>this Court is asked to impose a legislative constraint on the university. However, this constraint, which requires that bonds be posted before construction begins on university projects, imposes a lesser intrusion than the decision in <em>Regents. </em>The Court\u2019s decision in <em>Regents </em>imposed a potentially far-reaching financial effect on the university because the association represented a large number of interns and residents who were paid by the university. In the present case, however, the application of MCL 129.201; MSA 5.2321(1) does not impose the same form of financial burden on the university. Because the principal contractor is the entity saddled with the obligation to provide a bond, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>university suffers little financial effect. The simple reality is that the facts presented in this case are less onerous on the university. As a result, we find that <em>Regents </em>is directly relevant and. controlling on the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-3\">Furthermore, we find that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Regents </em>demonstrates that <em>Weinberg </em>has been displaced. In <em>Regents, supra </em>at 108, this Court unanimously relied on <em>Branum v Univ of Michigan Bd of Regents, </em>5 Mich App 134, 138-139; 145 NW2d 860 (1966), quoting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-4\">It is the opinion of this Court that the legislature can validly exercise its police power for the welfare of the people of this State, and a constitutional corporation such as the board of regents of the University of Michigan can lawfully be affected thereby. The University of Michigan is an independent branch of the government of the State of Michigan, but it is not an island. Within the confines of the operation and the allocation of funds of the University, it is supreme. Without these confines, however, there is no reason to allow the regents to use their independence to thwart the clearly established public policy of the people of Michigan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">It is our opinion that this language implicitly overruled the decision in <em>Weinberg.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">We also note that <em>Branum, </em>cited in <em>Regents, </em>relied on <em>Peters v Michigan State College, </em>320 Mich 243; 30 NW2d 854 (1948). We find the reasoning offered by Justice Reid in this opinion persuasive. Plaintiff Robert W. Peters filed an application for benefits arising out of an injury that he suffered during the course of his employment with Michigan State College. The defendant contended that as a constitutional corporation it was not subject to the provisions of the Michigan worker\u2019s compensation act, MCL 418.101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>17.237(101) <em>et seq. </em>In the lead opinion of an evenly divided Court, Justice Reid concluded that although the constitution gave the State Board of Agriculture sole control of the college\u2019s funds, it did not exempt it from the general laws of the state.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-5\">However, the provision of the Constitution giving the State board of agriculture sole control of the funds of the college does not generally exempt the said board from the great body of general laws of this State. <em>[Id. </em>at 248.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">Justice Reid went on to note that the worker\u2019s compensation act was designed to promote the welfare of the people of the state.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-7\">We find that the workmen\u2019s compensation act is a valid constitutional exercise of the power of the legislature even when it makes necessary the expenditure of agricultural college funds in the compensation of employees under the terms and within the provisions of the workmen\u2019s compensation act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-8\">The act is approved as a piece of legislation aimed not at the defendant alone, nor against any of the activities of the defendant of a nature peculiar to defendant. The act is of a broad scope addressed to the subject of the liability of employers in broad fields of employment. The workmen\u2019s compensation act does not undertake to change or disturb the educational activities of the defendant board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-9\">The control of State college funds must be considered as given to defendant for the purposes of the particular and peculiar educational activities of the State college, not for the purpose of disturb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>ing the general relationship in this State of employer and employee, nor evading laws enacted to promote the general welfare of the people of this State. <em>Article 11, \u00a78 . . . is not to be construed as withholding from the legislature the authority to make the defendant board liable and subject to the entire workmen\u2019s compensation act in question. [Id. </em>at 250-251 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-4\"><em>Peters </em>is instructive regarding the issue offered in the present matter. Here, as in <em>Peters, </em>this Court is asked to impose an overarching law on a constitutionally created university that has been granted complete power over its finances and curricula by the constitution. Interestingly, the facts in the present matter actually amount to less of an imposition on the university than the situation presented in <em>Peters. </em>In <em>Peters, </em>the application of the worker\u2019s compensation act obviously posed a large financial obligation on Michigan State University. It, along with the University of Michigan, employs hundreds of people who are all candidates to file worker\u2019s compensation claims, which could invoke thousands of dollars of liability. However, in the present matter, MCL 129.201; MSA 5.2321(1) does not impose any form of financial liability. Instead, it merely states that bonds must be provided in order for construction to begin. Because the principal contractors provide these bonds, this requirement essentially costs the university nothing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Consequently, the university\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>financial autonomy is preserved. The university\u2019s educational autonomy is also preserved because MCL 129.201; MSA 5.2321(1) does not affect its nonfinancial administrative decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">In the present case, we are presented with an overarching law. By requiring that bonds be provided when a governmental unit awards a construction contract in excess of $50,000, MCL 129.201; MSA 5.2321(1) protects the university and any subcontractor involved in the project. If a general contractor or a subcontractor defaults on the project, the governmental unit will have economic recourse to guarantee that the project is completed. Furthermore, if a subcontractor provides materials or services and is not paid, it, too, will have economic recourse. It is clear, therefore, that applying MCL 129.201 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.2321(1) <em>et seq. </em>to constitutionally autonomous entities such as the University of Michigan promotes the state\u2019s general welfare and, accordingly, is a valid exercise of the Legislature\u2019s police power.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s entire action depends on whether the public works bond statute, MCL 129.201 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.2321(1) <em>et seq., </em>is applicable against the University of Michigan. We are persuaded that the answer to this question is yes. Although the University of Michigan is a constitutionally created corporation, the Legislature can impose regulations on it that are designed to provide for the general welfare of society. In this instance, MCL 129.201; MSA 5.2321(1) provides for the welfare of society by guaranteeing that governmental units and people who have furnished services are not injured when contractors default on their obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>tions. Because MCL 129.201; MSA 5.2321(1) is designed for the benefit of society as a whole, it can be imposed on the University of Michigan through the Legislature\u2019s police power where this imposition poses no direct threat to the university\u2019s financial autonomy. In this instance, it costs the university nothing to require that those bidding on construction projects with it provide bonds before the contract is awarded. In accordance with this reasoning, we hold that the decisions in <em>Weinberg </em>and <em>Reichenbach, supra, </em>are expressly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-3\">We also hold that plaintiff is a claimant under the public works bond statute. Therefore, the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed in its entirety. Furthermore, because the issue whether plaintiff provided defendant with timely notice of its claim has not been addressed, we remand the case to the Court of Appeals for resolution of this issue.</p>\n<judges id=\"b939-4\">Brickley, C.J., and Levin, Cavanagh, Boyle, Mallett, and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b927-5\"> Marino posted a letter of credit equal to $100,000 to secure its work on the project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b927-6\"> On March 27, 1991, plaintiff sent a notice to Cadillac Insurance (the surety), stating that it had supplied materials to Marino.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b928-10\"> 209 Mich App 308; 529 NW2d 658.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b928-11\"> 450 Mich 866.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b929-6\"> A \"claimant.\u201d means a person having furnished labor, material, or both, used or reasonably required for use in the performance of the contract. \"Labor and material\u201d includes that part of water, gas, power, light, heat, oil, gasoline, telephone service or rental of equipment directly applicable to the contract.

Moreover, even if it does result in a higher project price for the university plaintiff still does not lose. In both <em>Regents </em>and <em>Peters, </em>high potential fiscal liability was imposed on the university. In this case, such extensive liability will not be incurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
