He testified rather that he was sitting on his porch a block away from the crime scene when he heard shots and saw a crowd gather.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The prosecutor asked Pennington whether he had seen Jenkins on the day of the shooting before he heard the gunshots. He responded, \"[a]bout an hour before that,\u201d \"[d]own on Oakland.\u201d Jenkins drives a grey truck. He had seen him in a gold Sunbird on a number of occasions. He did not see the gold Sunbird going past his house before he heard the shots. Asked whether he saw Jenkins in the gold Sunbird that day, he responded, \"I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">When cross-examined concerning his prior statement, Pennington became evasive. He acknowledged giving a statement to Sergeant Ronald D. Gale, but denied seeing \"him,\u201d presumably Jenkins, in \"a gold Sunbird just before [he] heard the shots.\u201d He was given an opportunity to read the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>signed memorandum of the statement, but claimed it did not refresh his \"memory at all as to having seen Steven Jenkins in a gold Sunbird shortly before the gunshots were heard.\u201d Over defense objections, the prosecutor impeached Pennington by asking whether he made various statements incriminating of Jenkins set forth in the memorandum. He was asked whether he told Sergeant Gale that he saw Jenkins in the passenger seat in the gold Sunbird, and responded \"I don\u2019t think so.\u201d He acknowledged reading the statement before signing it. He did not remember telling Gale that he saw Jenkins in the front passenger seat. Nor did he remember telling Gale that he heard about eleven shots. He suggested that he \"probably was intoxicated on drugs on that day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">He remembered giving the statement and signing his name, and, in response to the question \"now, today, you remember nothing?\u201d he responded, \"right.\u201d He said that drugs caused his memory to fade.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Over defense objections, the prosecutor questioned Sergeant Gale, the police officer who took Pennington\u2019s statement. The prosecutor had Gale read much of Pennington\u2019s statement. Gale quoted Pennington as saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">\"At about 6 p.m., I\u2019m sitting on the porch of 102 Leicester. A gold Sunbird rode past the house, and as soon as it got out of my eyesight, I heard the shooting. <em>One of my friends came around there where I was at and told me that Steve </em>[Jenkins] <em>had shot [the </em>victim] <em>Demowens in the head. </em>Steve [Jenkins] is the one that drives the gold Sunbird.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">The foregoing quoted words were read word for word from the memorandum of the statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>given by Pennington to Gale. The prosecutor led Gale through the memorandum of the statement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Gale was permitted to read word for word from the memorandum, \"I saw the driver of the car and the passenger. I didn\u2019t see who was in the back seat of the car.\u201d He recognized in the car \"Steven Jenkins and this guy named Spanky.\u201d Jenkins was \"[ijn the front passenger side.\u201d Spanky \"was the driver of the car.\u201d He heard \"[a]bout 11\u201d shots fired. Gale also asked Pennington whether he had ever seen Jenkins with a gun before, and Pennington responded, \"Yes, a .45 automatic, nickel-plated.\u201d \"Every time [Jenkins] gets out of the car to go in that building, he has the gun in his hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Gale further testified that Pennington did not appear intoxicated when giving the statement, and that Pennington had signed the memorandum of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The trial judge did not err in allowing the prosecutor to impeach Pennington, although he so ruled for the wrong reason. The judge permitted the impeachment under the mistaken impression that the prosecutor was obliged to call him as a res gestae witness. The Court of Appeals recognized that the statute,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> had been amended by 1986 PA 46 and no longer requires a prosecutor to produce res gestae witnesses at trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Appeals affirmed the decision as a valid exercise of discretion under the amended version of the statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">At the time of trial,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> MRE 607 barred the prosecution from impeaching its own witness unless (a) the prosecutor was obliged to call the witness, or (b) the witness\u2019 testimony was unexpected and \"actually injurious\u201d to the prosecution\u2019s case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Pennington\u2019s testimony that he saw nothing important was \"actually injurious\u201d to the prosecution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It cost the prosecution eyewitness testimony placing Jenkins at the scene of the crime. Further, there is no indication that the prosecution expected Pennington to change his story.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"Aio\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The prosecutor properly laid the foundation to impeach Pennington with extrinsic evidence\u2014Sergeant Gale\u2019s testimony\u2014by' showing Pennington the signed memorandum of his statement and asking him if he remembered making it.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Pennington admitted making the statement, but claimed not to remember telling the police he had seen Jenkins in the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">When a witness claims not to remember making a prior inconsistent statement, he may be impeached by extrinsic evidence of that statement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The purpose of extrinsic impeachment evidence is to prove that a witness made a prior inconsistent statement\u2014not to prove the contents of the statement.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Because a written memorandum of an oral statement is itself hearsay, allowing the impeaching witness to read from the written memorandum of the statement constitutes the admission of hearsay, unless a proper foundation is laid for admission as past recollection recorded.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As stated in <em>People v Rodgers, </em>388 Mich 513, 519; 201 NW2d 621 (1972), the impeaching witness is not relating what he heard, but offering \"an extrajudicial statement ... to prove the truth of the thing said (that [the impeached witness] had spoken the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>words imputed to him).\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Gale\u2019s reading of the statement was such hearsay.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">The dissent would distinguish <em>People v Rodgers </em>on the basis that Pennington signed the statement in contrast with witness King, in <em>Rodgers, </em>who did not, and would overrule <em>Rodgers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">If a question were to have arisen whether Gale accurately recorded Pennington\u2019s responses to the officer\u2019s questions, Pennington\u2019s signature would have been probative that the questions and responses were accurately recorded. But the written statement signed by Pennington was not admissible in evidence simply because it was signed. Appropriate portions would have become admissible on the testimony of Gale, and then <em>only </em>as past recollection recorded, and the people acknowledge that they did not seek to have it admitted on that basis.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">As set forth in <em>Rodgers, </em>Gale could have testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>from memory about what Pennington told him. If he \"could not recall the conversation, he could have been shown the memorandum to refresh his memory. If he could not then testify without the aid of the memorandum, [appropriate portions of] the written memorandum might <em>then </em>have been introduced in evidence [as past recollection recorded] and read to the jury provided a proper foundation was laid.\u201d <em>People v Rodgers, supra, </em>p 519. (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Be that as it may, Pennington testified at the trial that he had seen the gold Sunbird on prior occasions more than once, that he had not seen the gold Sunbird going past the house on the day of the shooting before he heard the shots, and that he did not remember seeing Jenkins in the gold Sunbird that day. That testimony justified the prosecutor having the officer testify either from memory, or from refreshed memory, or, if \"a proper foundation was laid,\u201d <em>and it was not, </em>from past recollection recorded, that Pennington had given the officer an inconsistent statement, shortly after the killing, that he had seen Jenkins in the gold Sunbird that day._</p>\n<p id=\"AXn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\">The dissent argues that the verbatim memorandum of Pennington\u2019s statement is relevant and admissible to impeach \"if properly authenticated\u201d pursuant to MRE 901.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Gale\u2019s testimony that Pennington signed the memorandum of the statement Gale had in his hands when testifying authenticated the memorandum as the statement signed by Pennington.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Gale\u2019s testimony that Pennington signed the memorandum Gale had in his hands when testifying did not establish that the contents of the statement accurately reported Gale\u2019s questions and Pennington\u2019s responses, and did not obviate hearsay objections to Gale\u2019s report of what Pennington said.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The dissent confuses two distinct inquiries. Authentication is the process of determining that the piece of paper offered as evidence is <em>what Gale wrote down </em>when interviewing Pennington. In contrast, the hearsay problem arises because the memorandum is Gale\u2019s out-of-court statement that <em>he wrote what Pennington actually said.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The accuracy of the report contained in the memorandum and a hearsay exception could only have been established by Gale having testified from memory, refreshed memory, or, if a proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>foundation had been laid, on the basis of past recollection recorded. Absent such a foundation, the word for word recital of Pennington\u2019s responses was hearsay, even though Pennington acknowledged making the statement and having signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">As set forth in Graham, Handbook of Federal Evidence (3d ed), \u00a7 901.0, p 1011, authentication does not eliminate the need to show that the content of the writing is admissible despite the hearsay bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">Documents and real evidence once properly authenticated must be offered into evidence. Compliance with the requirement of Rule 901 of course does not guarantee that the documentary, real, demonstrative or testimonial evidence subsequently offered is admissible, for the offered evidence may still be excluded because of some other bar to admission, <em>such as the rule against hearsay, </em>lack of relevancy, or Rule 403. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">But even if the reading of the written memorandum did not represent an independent level of hearsay,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the court abused its discretion in permitting Gale to read from the memorandum of Pennington\u2019s statement under circumstances creating an unacceptable risk that the jury would accept the contents of the memorandum as substantive evidence. Moreover, the memorandum contained prejudicial statements serving no proper impeachment purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">Pennington did not provide testimony tending in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>any way to exculpate Jenkins. He, rather, disappointed the prosecutor in failing to provide inculpatory testimony. Pennington\u2019s inconsistent statement is, I believe we all agree, admissible only to show that Pennington made the inconsistent statement, and not as substantive evidence that Jenkins was in the Sunbird, driving to the scene of the killing shortly before the shots were heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Since the inconsistent statement is not substantive evidence, it could only be used for impeachment: to cause the jury to disbelieve Pennington\u2019s claim that he did not remember seeing Jenkins in the gold Sunbird on the day of the shooting. The admission of the entire statement, and that is what in effect occurred, was unnecessary to achieve this end. It served only one purpose\u2014to impermissibly provide inculpatory testimony to bolster the relatively weak identification testimony of but one witness, whose integrity was put in question by another witness.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">This Court has recognized the danger \"that not the sworn testimony given in court, but the unsworn, extrajudicial statements made by witnesses will be used to convict a respondent.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AUx\">As the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">We must be mindful of the fact that prior unsworn statements of a witness are mere hearsay and are, as such, generally inadmissible as affirmative proof. The introduction of such testimony, even where limited to impeachment, necessarily increases the possibility that a defendant may be convicted on the basis of unsworn evidence, for despite proper instructions to the jury, it is often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>difficult for them to distinguish between impeachment and substantive evidence.[<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">In this case, where the prosecution presented to the jury a verbatim recitation of damning out-of-court statements by Pennington, special care should have been taken to ensure that \"impeachment by prior inconsistent statement may not be permitted where employed as a mere subterfuge to get before the jury evidence not otherwise admissible.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Casting doubt on Pennington\u2019s testimony by showing that he had made inconsistent statements in the past did not justify Gale reading Pennington\u2019s prior statement word for word to the jury. Proper impeachment could have been accomplished by asking Gale to testify from memory whether Pennington reported seeing defendant in the car at that time, and whether he thought Pennington was intoxicated when he made the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The closing arguments further indicate that the prior statement was used as substantive evidence. The prosecutor\u2019s initial closing argument did not mention Pennington. In her rebuttal argument, the prosecutor contended that Pennington had lied, and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">I think this is one of those situations where, yes, it\u2019s becoming apparent that things somehow have changed. The passage of time has suddenly changed the way Reginald Pennington saw things. Three hours after the shooting, he knows [defendant]. He knows this man to carry a big gun. Although he won\u2019t tell us now, he told it to the sergeant back on February 20th. He knows this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>man goes by in a gold Sunbird, in the passenger seat. Within minutes, he\u2019s hearing shots. As soon as it\u2019s out of eyesight, he\u2019s hearing shots. . . . [H]e tells the sergeant he sees the gold car go by, this man is the passenger, and then he hears shots. That\u2019s what he originally says. And he talks about this big gun, and he says he heard about 11 shots.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Our concern that the jury accepted the prior statement as substantive evidence is heightened by the lack of a limiting instruction to the jury when Gale read the statement. The court should have told the jury at the time of Gale\u2019s testimony that it was only to consider it for impeachment purposes.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> But the judge did not do so until after the conclusion of the proofs, when he instructed generally. That belated instruction did not refer to Pennington or Gale by name. This omission of a timely limiting instruction reinforces our conclusion that error occurred.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">During the reading of the statement, Gale quoted Pennington as reporting that \"[o]ne of my friends . . . told me that [Jenkins] had shot [the victim] in the head.\u201d He also quoted Pennington as saying that Jenkins carried a .45 caliber automatic pistol.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> These statements posed the same hearsay risk as the rest of Gale\u2019s testimony. But they also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>were irrelevant to the impeachment, and prejudicial to Jenkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Where an inconsistent statement contained in a writing contains other prejudicial information, \"only so much thereof as contains the inconsistent statements should be admitted into evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"><em>While testifying, Pennington had not mentioned either the gun or the friend\u2019s comment. </em>Gale\u2019s testimony in that regard went beyond the proper scope of impeachment.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> When the prosecutor cross-examined Pennington about his statement, she read him the relevant passage, but omitted the reference to the friend\u2019s comment. The prosecutor alluded to this omission when Jenkins\u2019 lawyer objected to the cross-examination. Similarly, the prosecutor asked Gale about the gun, even though Pennington had not mentioned it when testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The errors were not harmless. Apart from the inadmissible evidence that Pennington had given a statement that he had seen Jenkins riding in an automobile toward the crime scene and gunfire erupted immediately afterwards, and that one of his friends told him that Jenkins had shot Harris, the only other evidence identifying Jenkins was Pride\u2019s testimony that Jenkins was the gunman. Brunner was unable to identify the gunman or Jenkins as an occupant of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">There were inconsistencies in Brunner\u2019s and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Pride\u2019s testimony that could cause a jury to doubt their testimony. Pride\u2019s story on the color of the automobile kept changing from brown to \"light gold.\u201d Brunner said it was purple, or something similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Pride\u2019s testimony that Jenkins was leaning out of the automobile to fire the gun might be seen as contradicting Brunner\u2019s testimony that he saw just a gun, not a person leaning out of the automobile. Moreover, Brunner testified that the victim had pointed a gun first at the passing automobile. Brunner also reported that, as . the victim lay on the ground, Pride removed the victim\u2019s gun and jewelry.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Pride could not consistently identify the color of the automobile. The dissent\u2019s reliance on the trial testimony of Pride also omits several elements of Brunner\u2019s testimony that cast doubt on Pride\u2019s veracity. Unlike Pride, Brunner testified that the victim had pointed a gun first at the passing automobile. Brunner also reported that, as the victim lay on the ground, Pride removed the victim\u2019s gun and jewelry. Pride was not asked, and never specifically stated, that the victim had <em>not </em>pointed a gun at the passing automobile. Pride similarly did not state that he had <em>not </em>removed the victim\u2019s gun and jewelry. But these details might, but for the errors respecting Pennington\u2019s out-of-court statements, have led the jury to view Pride in an unfavorable light and question the value of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The error in admitting Gale\u2019s testimony repeating hearsay statements was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand for a new trial. On retrial, the prosecutor may impeach Pennington. If he testifies as he did at the earlier trial, the statement made to Gale may not be read word for word into evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>and may be read only to show that Pennington made inconsistent statements on a showing that Gale cannot testify from memory or memory refreshed and a proper foundation has been laid for reading appropriate portions of the memorandum of the statement as past recollection recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">If Gale is called to impeach Pennington\u2019s testimony, the jury must be instructed at that time that Gale\u2019s testimony is only to be considered for impeachment purposes. The statements attributed to Pennington\u2019s friend, and the reference to Jenkins\u2019 gun are not admissible as part of the impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b536-7\">Brickley, C.J., and Cavanagh and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-11\"> MCL 750.83; MSA 28.278.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">Jenkins was acquitted of a charge of first-degree murder.

At issue in this appeal is whether the trial court erred by permitting the impeachment of witness Pennington and by permitting the testimony of officer Gale. The majority concludes that it was proper to allow the impeachment, but that it was error to allow officer Gale\u2019s testimony regarding Pennington\u2019s prior statement because all written memoranda of oral statements are hearsay per se. <em>Ante </em>at 257-258.1 agree that it was proper to allow the impeachment, but I disagree that it was error to admit the testimony because Pennington\u2019s prior statement, signed and adopted by Pennington when given to officer Gale, was used solely to impeach Pennington\u2019s trial testimony and therefore was not hearsay. Pennington\u2019s in-court testimony contradicted his earlier statement and, as a result, was unanticipated and injurious to the prosecution. Consequently, the prosecution could properly impeach him with his statement under the then-existing version of MRE 607(2)(C). Thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The majority properly concluded that \"[t]he trial judge did not err in allowing the prosecutor to impeach Pennington . . . <em>Ante </em>at 254.

Instead, Pennington testified that he did not see the car or Jenkins.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-12\"><em>Q. </em>So you\u2019ve seen him in this gold Sunbird more than once?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-13\"><em>A. </em>Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-14\"><em>Q. </em>Did you see that gold Sunbird going past your house before you saw the shots\u2014or heard the shots?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-15\"><em>A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-16\"><em>Q. </em>Did you see Mr. Jenkins in that gold Sunbird that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-17\"><em>A. </em>I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-18\"><em>Q. </em>You don\u2019t remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-19\"><em>A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>This testimony was contrary to Pennington\u2019s original statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\">\"At about 6 p.m., I\u2019m sitting on the porch of 102 Leicester.

One of my friends came around there where I was at and told me that Steve had shot Demowens in the head. Steve is the one that drives the gold Sunbird.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Because Pennington\u2019s testimony at trial was completely unanticipated and injurious to the prosecution\u2019s case, the prosecutor could impeach him under MRE 607(2X0.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Regardless of whether the prosecutor, at the time of trial, had a right to impeach Pennington, he would have a right in a new trial under the current version of MRE 607. Today, MRE 607 provides that \"[t]he credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party, including the party calling the witness.\u201d Consequently, if a new trial were to be ordered, the prosecution could freely impeach Pennington about this matter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">It is my opinion that the trial court properly allowed Pennington to be impeached. His testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>mony at trial was directly contrary to his prior statement and injured the prosecution\u2019s case. As a result, the prosecutor had every right to use it for impeachment purposes. Moreover, MRE 607 has been changed to allow any party to impeach any witness at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The trial court did not commit error requiring reversal by allowing officer Gale to testify regarding Pennington\u2019s earlier statement. As stated before, MRE 607(2)(C), at the time of trial, allowed the prosecutor to impeach Pennington since his testimony was unanticipated and injurious. The next question is whether officer Gale\u2019s testimony regarding Pennington\u2019s prior statement was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Although Pennington\u2019s prior statement constituted extrinsic evidence it was still admissible for purposes of impeachment under MRE 613(b).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible unless the witness is afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the same and the opposite party is afforded an opportunity to interrogate the witness thereon, or the interests of justice otherwise require. This provision does not apply to admissions of a party-opponent as defined in Rule 801(d)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Here, Pennington was offered an opportunity to explain the difference between his prior and present statement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\"><em>Q. (By Ms. Neff): </em>Sir, was your memory better back on February 20th, or today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-11\"><em>A. </em>I don\u2019t know. I probably was intoxicated on drugs on that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number><em>Q. </em>Now, you were on drugs. Did you ever tell the sergeant that you were on drugs that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\"><em>A. </em>He never asked me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\"><em>Q. </em>But you never thought it was important to tell him that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\"><em>A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\"><em>Q. </em>You just gave him the statement and signed your name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\"><em>A. </em>Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\"><em>Q. </em>And, now, today, you remember nothing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\"><em>A. </em>Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">Furthermore, Jenkins was also offered a chance to question Pennington about this discrepancy. Consequently, all the requirements for the admission of extrinsic evidence under MRE 613(b) were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">The majority, however, argues that \"a written memorandum of an oral statement is itself hearsay, allowing the impeaching witness to read from the written memorandum of the statement constitutes the admission of hearsay, unless a proper foundation is laid for admission as past recollection recorded.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 256. In order to support this statement, the majority looks to <em>People v Rodgers, </em>388 Mich 513, 519; 201 NW2d 621 (1972). In <em>Rodgers, </em>this Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-13\">The written memorandum was read to the jury. This constituted its admission in evidence. This was error. The writing was prepared by the Detective Taylor, out of court and was not signed by the witness King. The writing was hearsay. It was an extrajudicial statement (by Taylor) offered to prove the truth of the thing said (that King had spoken the words imputed to him).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">The majority\u2019s reliance on this case, however, is misplaced. In <em>Rodgers, </em>the witness did not sign his statement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number><em>Q. </em>Did Mr. King sign that statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\"><em>A. </em>No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\"><em>Q. </em>And whose handwriting is that statement in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\"><em>A. </em>This is my handwriting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">Q. Did you ask Mr. King to sign that statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\"><em>A. </em>Yes, sir, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-11\"><em>Q. </em>And he refused?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-12\"><em>A. </em>Yes, sir. <em>[Id. </em>at 518.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">However, the officer who took the statement testified that he took it verbatim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-14\"><em>Q. . . . </em>Did you take a written statement from Mr. King?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-15\"><em>A. </em>I wrote it down and Mr. King was talking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-16\"><em>Q. </em>As Mr. King was talking to you, you wrote it down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-17\"><em>A. </em>Yes, exactly word for word what he said. <em>[Id. </em>at 516.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-18\">The fact that this statement was taken verbatim is crucial. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stated in <em>United States v Almonte, </em>956 F2d 27, 29 (CA 2, 1992):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-19\">If a third party\u2019s notes reflect only that note-taker\u2019s summary characterization of a witness\u2019s prior statement, then the notes are irrelevant as an impeaching prior inconsistent statement, and thus inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-20\">In <em>Rodgers, </em>we do not have a summary characterization of a witness\u2019 prior statement. Instead, we have a verbatim word-for-word copy of the witness\u2019 statement; therefore, it is relevant and admissible to impeach if properly authenticated.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-21\">The manner in which to authenticate evidence is set out in MRE 901. Specifically, evidence can be authenticated by someone with knowledge.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>(a) . . . The requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">(b) ... By way of illustration only, and not by way of limitation, the following are examples of authentication or identification conforming with the requirements of this rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">(1) <em>Testimony of witness with knowledge. </em>Testimony that a matter is what it is claimed to be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In <em>Rodgers, </em>the officer on the stand had knowledge that the statement was authentic and he testified about that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">One could argue that the officer\u2019s testimony was not sufficient to authenticate the document. However, preliminary questions regarding the admissibility of evidence are to be reserved to the trial judge.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">Preliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness, the existence of a privilege, or the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court, subject to the provisions of subdivision (b). In making its determination it is not bound by the Rules of Evidence except those with respect to privileges. [MRE 104.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Because the statement in <em>Rodgers </em>was authenticated, it could be used to properly impeach the witness\u2019 testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently, the Court al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>lowed its admission for impeachment purposes. Furthermore, because the statement was used to impeach and not to prove the truth of the matter asserted, hearsay was not an issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, this Court was mistaken in concluding that the statement constituted hearsay and was improperly admitted. As a result, the majority\u2019s reliance on this case is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement can be used to impeach but it cannot be used to prove the truth of the matter asserted, unless, of course, it falls within a hearsay exception.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this case, Pennington\u2019s statement was only used for its proper purpose of impeachment. Although defendant claims that the prosecutor was actually offering this statement not to impeach, but to prove the truth of the matter asserted, the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">law does not ask the judge, either at trial or upon appellate review, to crawl inside the prosecutor\u2019s head to divine his or her true motivation.

Pennington did so and even admitted at trial that he signed the statement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\"><em>Q. (By Ms. Neff): </em>Sir, did you tell Sergeant Ronald Gale of the homicide section, on February 20th, 1989, at approximately 9:20 in the evening that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\"At 6:00 p.m., I was standing on the porch at 102 Leicester. A gold Sunbird rode past the house and as soon as it got out of my eyesight, I heard the shooting. Steve is the one that drives the gold Sunbird. I ran around there. By the time I got there, the police were already there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">Then you were asked:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">When you saw the gold Sunbird go past, did you see who was either driving or who was in the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">And you answered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">\"I saw the driver of the car and the passenger, but I didn\u2019t see who was in the back seat.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-11\">Now, did you or did you not tell Sergeant Gale that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-12\"><em>A. </em>Yes, I did, and I told him there were several other cars that rode right behind this car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-13\"><em>Q. </em>Did you say that on here, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyZ\"><em>A. </em>I told him that. I remember that much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-15\"><em>Q. </em>Now, you signed this, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-16\"><em>A. </em>Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-17\">Because Pennington\u2019s statement and its acquisi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>tion so closely parallels Graham\u2019s example, it becomes easy to conclude that the statement was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">One portion of this statement has come under particular attack by the majority: where Pennington states, \" 'One of my friends came around there where I was at and told me that Steve had shot Demowens in the head.\u2019 \u201d The majority firmly contends that this constitutes hearsay. This contention, however, is erroneous. This portion of Pennington\u2019s statement was relevant for impeachment purposes and as such could not constitute hearsay. Under MRE 401, relevant evidence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">means evidence having <em>any </em>tendency to make the existence of <em>any </em>fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. [Emphasis provided.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Grubaugh v St Johns, </em>82 Mich App 282, 286; 266 NW2d 791 (1978), addressed this very issue and found \"[t]estimony is relevant if it has a legitimate tendency to establish or disprove a material fact.\u201d At trial, Pennington indicated that he was not aware of Jenkins or this vehicle. In his prior statement, however, he stated that a friend told him Jenkins was involved. Consequently, that portion of his statement is directly relevant to impeach his testimony professing a lack of knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Furthermore, this portion of Pennington\u2019s statement is not substantially more prejudicial than probative under MRE 403:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-10\">Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">MRE 403 requires a balancing to be performed between the probative nature of the evidence and its prejudicial effect. Generally, substantial discretion is granted to the trial judge in performing this balancing test.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">The trial judge, not the appellate judge, is iii the best position to assess the extent of the prejudice caused a party by a piece of evidence. The appellate judge works with a cold record, whereas the trial judge is there in the courtroom. <em>[United States v Long, </em>574 F2d 761, 767 (CA 3, 1978).][<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">In this instance, Pennington\u2019s statement is probative because it serves to impeach his in-court claim of a lack of knowledge and it is not prejudicial because another witness, Emanuel Pride, testified that Jenkins committed the crime.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\"><em>Q. </em>I want to direct your attention, now back to February 20th of 1989. Were you with Demowens Harris and Carlos Brunner on that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\"><em>Q. </em>Did something happen to Mr. Harris?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-11\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-12\"><em>Q. </em>What happened to Mr. Harris?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-13\"><em>A. </em>He was shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-14\"><em>Q. </em>Were you there when he was shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-15\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-16\"><em>Q. </em>Did you see who shot him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-17\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-18\"><em>Q. </em>Is he in the courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\"><em>Q. </em>Can you point him out for the jury, please? Pointing at Steven Jenkins?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\"><em>A. </em>Steven Jenkins.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Because Emanuel Pride testified that he saw Jenkins fire the gun, Pennington\u2019s statement that a friend told him that Jenkins shot Demowens was merely redundant. Consequently, its admission could not have been prejudicial. When the balancing is done under MRE 403 the admission of the portion of Pennington\u2019s statement was not substantially more prejudicial than probative. Moreover, even if it was error to admit this portion of the statement the error was harmless because what was disclosed had already been revealed by Emanuel Pride.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Given that Emanuel Pride testified unwaveringly that defendant gunned down the person standing next to him, any error in admitting Pennington\u2019s prior inconsistent statement was harmless. Although the majority attempts to portray Pride\u2019s testimony as inconsistent with that of another witness, Carlos Brunner, the truth is that their trial testimony was not inconsistent. Simply because Pride was able to testify with greater specificity about what occurred in those crucial seconds does not mean that his testimony was inconsistent with the more general testimony of Brunner.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">The trial court did not commit error requiring reversal by allowing Pennington to be impeached. His testimony at trial was unanticipated and injurious to the prosecution\u2019s case. It is my belief that under the then-existing MRE 607(2)(C) as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>under the present version of MRE 607, impeachment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">It is also my belief that officer Gale\u2019s testimony was properly admitted. The prosecution used officer Gale to further impeach Pennington\u2019s in-court testimony. Although officer Gale read part of Pennington\u2019s statement, this statement could not be considered hearsay because it was not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but merely to impeach Pennington\u2019s prior testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">I would affirm the Court of Appeals decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b550-6\">Boyle and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-8\"> This very issue was addressed in a dissent I wrote in <em>People v Dunn, </em>446 Mich 409, 433; 521 NW2d 255 (1994).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-9\">Furthermore, a remand of this case is an empty gesture because recent amendments of MRE 410 permit the evidence at issue to be presented at trial. MRE 410 now.bars statements made during plea negotiations only if the statements are made to attorneys. In the instant case, the officers in question were obviously not attorneys, and they disavowed any pretense of possessing the authority of a government attorney. The evidence at issue, therefore, is admissible on remand. <em>United States v Bernal, </em>719 F2d 1475, 1478 (CA 9, 1983); <em>Rachlin [v United States, </em>723 F2d 1373, 1376 (CA 8, 1983)]. Hence, the granting of a new trial is simply \"an empty gesture.\u201d <em>People v Sanford, </em>402 Mich 460, 498; 265 NW2d 1 (1978) (Ryan, J., concurring).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b542-11\"> This use of properly authenticated prior written statements for impeachment is not uncommon. In <em>People v Taylor, </em>159 Mich App 468, 474-475, n 8; 406 NW2d 859 (1987), the prosecution used a prior letter written and signed by the defendant to impeach his testimony. The Court found that the letter was properly authenticated under MRE 901 even though the defendant would not admit writing it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-12\">While defendant would not admit writing the letter, he also said that he would not deny writing it. He acknowledged that the letter was in his handwriting and that it bore his signature. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>He then went on to explain the letter by saying that it was written because he \"wanted to get out of it.\u201d That constitutes \"evidence sufficient to support a finding\u201d of authenticity under MRE 901(a).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b543-8\">\" 'Hearsay\u2019 is a statement, other than the one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, <em>offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d </em>MRE 801 (emphasis added).
