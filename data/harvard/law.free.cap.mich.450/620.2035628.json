We are asked to decide whether plaintiff\u2019s unemployment compensation benefits should be deducted from his breach of contract damage award. In accordance with accepted principles of contract law, we hold that plaintiff\u2019s unemployment compensation benefits must be deducted from his subsequent damage award. Moreover, we conclude that this result best effectuates the intent of the Legislature by preventing the duplication of an employee\u2019s wage loss replacement. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court for entry of an award consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Plaintiff William Corl was employed by defendant Huron Castings in July 1981. He remained an employee until he was terminated in May 1988. After his termination, he filed a wrongful discharge claim pursuant to <em>Toussaint, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Before trial, the parties stipulated that plaintiff\u2019s damages were $16,500. This figure reflected a $6,200 deduction for unemployment compensation benefits plaintiff had already received. The parties also agreed that, in the event the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff, the trial judge would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>determine whether the award could be enhanced by $6,200.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The case was tried before Judge Knoblock in the Huron Circuit Court. The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff, and, as stipulated, a judgment for $16,500 was entered. Plaintiff then petitioned the court to enhance the award by $6,200. Plaintiff argued that the unemployment compensation benefits were a collateral source and should be added to the contract damage award. On the basis of <em>Pennington v Whiting Tubular Products, Inc, </em>370 Mich 590; 122 NW2d 692 (1963), the trial judge agreed and added the unemployment compensation benefits to the judgment. The judge conceded that the result was illogical, but felt obligated to follow <em>Pennington.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Defendant appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in an unpublished memorandum opinion, explaining that although defendant\u2019s argument had some merit, it was likewise constrained to follow <em>Pennington.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Defendant filed an application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>for leave to appeal. We granted leave<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and now reverse the opinion of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">We are required to assess plaintiff\u2019s damages in this wrongful discharge action. Plaintiff pleaded and proved his case on the basis of <em>Toussaint. </em>In Toussaint, <em>supra </em>at 610, this Court stated: \"We hold only that an employer\u2019s express agreement to terminate only for cause, or statements of company policy and procedure to that effect, can give rise to <em>rights enforceable in </em>contract.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The remedy for breach of contract is to place the nonbreaching party in as good a position as if the contract had been fully performed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, the goal in contract law is not to punish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>the breaching party, but to make the nonbreaching party whole.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Cognizant of these principles, we evaluate plaintiff\u2019s assertion that the collateral source rule allows full recovery from defendant notwithstanding the unemployment compensation benefits he received. The collateral source rule is a concept of tort law which provides \"that the recovery of damages from a <em>tortfeasor </em>is not reduced by the plaintiff\u2019s receipt of money in compensation for his injuries from other sources.\u201d <em>Tebo v Havlik, </em>418 Mich 350, 366; 343 NW2d 181 (1984) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">In a unanimous decision by this Court in <em>Ferrett v General Motors Corp, </em>438 Mich 235; 475 NW2d 243 (1991), we reaffirmed <em>Toussaint, supra, </em>holding that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was not in tort.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Ferrett, supra </em>at 239, the defendant brought an action for breach of contract and negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>gent evaluation after he was terminated for \"excessive absenteeism.\u201d We declined \"to recognize an action in tort for negligent evaluation,\u201d stating that an action could \"be maintained, if at all, only for breach of a contractual obligation to evaluate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242. Of importance to the present case, we then announced the underlying theory for refusal to recognize a claim in tort:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-5\">\"We have simply the violation of a promise to perform the agreement. The only duty, other than that voluntarily assumed in the contract to which the defendant was subject, was his duty to perform his promise in a careful and skillful manner without risk of harm to others, the violation of which is not alleged. <em>What we are left with is defendant\u2019s failure to complete his contracted-for performance. This is not a duty imposed by the law upon all, the violation of which gives rise to a tort action, but a duty arising out of the intentions of the parties themselves and owed only to those speci\u00f1c individuals to whom the promise runs. A tort action will not lie.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.] <em>[Id. </em>at 243, citing <em>Hart v Ludwig, </em>347 Mich 559, 565-566; 79 NW2d 895 (1956).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Similarly, in the present case, we are confronted with an employer who impliedly contracted to terminate his employee for just cause.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The jury held that defendant failed to fulfill his duty. This duty, however, was not imposed upon \"all,\u201d but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>only upon plaintiff, who impliedly contracted with defendant. Therefore, we conclude that defendant\u2019s liability does not arise in tort.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">In order for plaintiff to prevail, we must extend the collateral source rule to principles of contract law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Significantly, however, plaintiff does not cite (nor have we been able to find) a single case involving breach of contract implementing the collateral source rule. Further, plaintiff\u2019s request is in direct conflict with the fundamental precept that the remedy for breach of contract focuses on making the nonbreaching party whole.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Consequently, cases relied on by plaintiff, such as <em>Motts v Michigan Cab Co, </em>274 Mich 437; 264 NW 855 (1936),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> involving tort liability, have no applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>tion whatsoever to this case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, in the face of this Court\u2019s reluctance to extend tort remedies to cases pleaded and proven in contract, we elect to continue to distinguish between tort and contract remedies.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The present case is also distinguishable from the federal cases on which plaintiif relies. In <em>NLRB v Gullett Gin Co, </em>340 US 361; 71 S Ct 337; 95 L Ed 337 (1951), the United States Supreme Court refused to deduct unemployment compensation benefits from a breach of employment contract damage award. <em>Gullett </em>involved employees who were discharged in violation of the Labor Management Relations Act. Cognizant of its limited power to review, the Court upheld the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s refusal to deduct unemployment compensation benefits from the award.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>The nlra requires that upon a finding of unfair labor practice, the nlrb must \" 'take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this Act Gullett, <em>supra </em>at 362. In <em>Gullett, supra </em>at 364, the Court explained that allowing the employee to collect unemployment compensation from the State of Louisiana \"may reasonably be considered to effectuate the policies of the Act.\u201d <em>Gullett </em>is distinguishable because it involved employees who were discriminatorily discharged. Thus, the Court merely held that it was within the nlrb\u2019s discretion to allow the discharged employees to collect unemployment compensation because it would effectuate the policies of that specific act.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">The goals of and the policies surrounding the nlra distinguish <em>Gullett </em>from the present case. In fact, upon finding an unfair labor practice, the board was obligated to \"issue a cease and desist order requiring the <em>guilty party </em>'to take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of [the] Act ....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362 (emphasis added). However, here we address a case of wrongful discharge that gives rise to an action for breach of contract only. As such, we are unable to attribute \"guilt\u201d to one of the parties in the same manner as in <em>Gullett.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">We are persuaded that <em>Gullett </em>is more accurately analyzed in conjunction with <em>United Protective Workers of America v Ford Motor Co, </em>223 F2d 49 (CA 7, 1955). In <em>Ford, </em>the United States Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that Ford Motor Company improperly required an employee to retire. The trial judge reduced the employee\u2019s damages by the amount of social security and annuity payments he received between the period in which he was wrongfully retired and the date on which he was required to retire. The court distinguished <em>Gullett, </em>stating that it <em>did not require </em>a deduction of unemployment compensation benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-5\">The cases speak only of the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s power to award back pay under the Act without deductions of any amounts other than for wages or earnings received during the period. They are not decisive as to the propriety of deductions which should be made in determining the amount of damages in a common law action for damages for the breach of an employment contract. <em>[Ford, supra </em>at 53.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">The court correctly narrowed the focus of its decision to the proper amount of damages for breach of contract. The court noted that if the employee had not been improperly required to retire, he would not have received the social security or annuity payments, and, therefore, if they were not deducted, the employee would receive \"more than he would have if the contract had not been breached.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Perhaps more persuasive, the case was distinguished from an action sounding in tort that would be subject to the collateral source rule. In this regard the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-8\">We have been unable to find a single case in which this rule has been carried over to contract damages. In the absence of any binding precedent to the contrary we prefer to follow here the ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>nary contract measure of damages rather than the rule in tort cases. <em>[Id. </em>at 54.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Similarly, the present case is governed by principles of common-law contract. <em>Toussaint, supra. </em>Thus, in contrast to <em>Gullett, </em>plaintiff\u2019s claim is not governed by statute.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">Plaintiff, relying on <em>Pennington, supra, </em>argues that unemployment compensation benefits may not be deducted from a contract damage award. For this reason, a careful reevaluation of the applicability and underlying integrity of <em>Pennington </em>is necessary. We cautiously review this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pennington </em>mindful of stare decisis principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At7\">The rule of <em>stare decisis </em>establishes uniformity, certainty, and stability in the law, but it was never intended to perpetuate error or to prevent the consideration of rules of law to be applied to the ever-changing business, economic, and political life of a community. Only in the rare case when it is clearly apparent that an error has been made, or changing considerations result in injustice by the application of an outmoded rule, should we deviate from following the established rule. <em>[Parker v Port Huron Hosp, </em>361 Mich 1, 10; 105 NW2d 1 (1960).][<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>In Pennington, employees of a manufacturing company brought an action for breach of an employment contract. Whiting Tubular Products went out of business and was offered for sale. Two newly organized companies purchased Whiting, transferred Whiting\u2019s machinery to a new plant, and began operations shortly after Whiting shut down its operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">The employees alleged that the two newly formed entities were organized in order to take over the business of Whiting, and that both companies were wholly controlled by Whiting who acted as a sales representative. The plaintiffs alleged that the reorganization was executed so that Whiting could avoid its obligations under its employment contracts.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">The primary issue on appeal involved the sufficiency of proof with regard to each claim.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> However, the Court further held, in what may be characterized as dicta,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> that it was error for the trial judge to instruct the jury that payments received by the employee under the Employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Security Act, MCL 421.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.501 <em>et seq., </em>must be deducted from a damage award for breach of employment contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-6\">We conclude . . . that the trial judge was in error in his direction to the jury. The purpose of the employment security act as set forth by the legislature in section 2 thereof indicates the object sought to be attained was the promotion of the public good and general welfare of the people of the State. There is nothing in the act to suggest that the payment of unemployment compensation is to be construed as in lieu of wages. <em>[Id. </em>at 600-601. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">This language in <em>Pennington </em>was premised on the fact that the Legislature gave no indication whether unemployment compensation replaced wage loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">However, the Legislature has subsequently manifested its intent to construe unemployment compensation as redress for wage loss.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In 1980, the Legislature enacted MCL 418.358; MSA 17.237(358),<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> which requires a worker\u2019s compensation award to \"be reduced by 100% of the amount of benefits paid or payable to the injured employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>under the Michigan employment security act . . .\u25a0 for identical periods of time and chargeable to the same employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">It is clear that the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act compensates for wage loss.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Cognizant that MCL 418.358; MSA 17.237(358) prevents duplication of worker\u2019s compensation awards and unemployment compensation benefits, a clear legislative intent to also characterize unemployment compensation as a wage-loss benefit emerges.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>this basis, it appears that the Legislature\u2019s enactment of MCL 418.358; MSA 17.237(358) alone undermines <em>Pennington.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We, therefore, find the present case to be squarely within the <em>Parker </em>decision justifying deviation from stare decisis.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Our conclusion is supported by our most recent pronouncement on this issue in <em>Drouillard v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>449 Mich 293, 299; 536 NW2d 530 (1995): \"Worker\u2019s compensation is one unit in a loosely connected system of wage-loss protection that also includes unemployment compensation \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>Finally, even assuming that <em>Pennington\u2019s </em>holding in this regard is binding rather than mere dicta, its underpinnings remain suspect. In <em>Pennington, </em>the Court stated that an analogous issue was decided in <em>Kurta v Probelske, </em>324 Mich 179, 188; 36 NW2d 889 (1949). <em>Kurta, </em>however, involved an action for personal injuries arising out of a pedestrian-vehicle collision. The Court upheld the plaintiff\u2019s damage award, concluding that it was not made excessive by the unemployment benefits the plaintiff received because it \"in no way serve[d] to mitigate damages.\u201d In contrast, <em>Pennington </em>involved a breach of a collective bargaining agreement, which cannot be analogized to a tort action for personal injuries. We are persuaded that the relevant holding in <em>Pennington </em>is dicta and that in any event its underlying premise is no longer supported with regard to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Finally, plaintiff urges that allowing a setoff for unemployment compensation benefits will result in a windfall for defendant. Review of MCL 421.19; MSA 17.520 assuages this concern. The Legislature</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>has developed a complex formula for the funding of unemployment compensation benefits. In general terms, an employer\u2019s \"contribution rate\u201d is derived from three distinct sources: \"a chargeable benefits component . . ., an account building component . . ., and a nonchargeable benefits component . . . .\u201d MCL 421.19(2); MSA 17.520(2). The chargeable benefits component is a percentage derived by dividing \"the total amount of benefits charged to the employer\u2019s experience account ... by the amount of wages, subject to contributions, paid by the employer within the same period.\u201d MCL 421.19(3)0); MSA 17.520(3)0). Therefore, an employer\u2019s liability arises, in part, in proportion to the amount its former employees receive in unemployment compensation benefits. MCL 421.19; MSA 17.520. In this manner an employer is ultimately responsible for its employees\u2019 unemployment compensation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Plaintiff disagrees with this analysis, arguing that the employer\u2019s costs are merely passed to the public through price increases and wage reductions.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Therefore, in order to avoid a windfall for defendant, plaintiff maintains that defendant should not be allowed to deduct unemployment compensation benefits. Plaintiff fails, however, to extend his assumption to its logical conclusion. According to plaintiff\u2019s analysis, we must also assume that any saving realized from deducting unemployment compensation benefits would be passed to consumers and employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Further, assuming that the public, in essence, subsidizes the unemployment compensation fund, a similar argument may be made that allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>the employee the benefit of unemployment compensation and full damage recovery places the additional burden on the public. In other words, as an employer\u2019s responsibility to pay benefits increases, so does its contribution rate. In turn, the costs are passed to consumers and employees, i.e., to the public in proportion to the employer\u2019s liability. If anything, plaintiff\u2019s analysis persuades us that it will be the public, i.e., consumers and wage earners, who will ultimately be responsible for the enhancement of unemployment compensation benefits to plaintiff\u2019s damage award. Therefore, we are not persuaded by plaintiff\u2019s argument that our decision will negatively affect the public generally. Similarly, we are not convinced that extension of the collateral source rule to the area of contract law serves any public policy goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Thus, we conclude that plaintiff\u2019s damage award should be reduced by the amount he received in unemployment compensation benefits. This is a wrongful discharge action, and as such plaintiff\u2019s rights are enforceable in contract. <em>Toussaint, supra. </em>The collateral source rule does not apply in cases of common-law contract. The award to plaintiff should be in an amount equal to his total damages, reduced by any payments already received from the unemployment commission. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case remanded for entry of an award consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b909-7\">Brickley, C.J., and Mallett and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b893-7\"> Plaintiff claimed that he had a legitimate expectation that he and defendant had an employment contract that could only be terminated for good cause.

However, defendant asserted that allowing recovery in that amount from the company would duplicate a portion of plaintiff\u2019s wage loss because he received unemployment compensation benefits. The parties disputed this issue, and it was, therefore, reserved for the trial judge to decide as a matter of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b894-7\"> Issued October 15,1993 (Docket No. 140650).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b894-8\"><em> </em>The Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-9\">We find some merit to defendant\u2019s position that the unemployment benefits should be deducted from plaintiff\u2019s award of damages as wage loss benefits already received, especially in light of the Legislature\u2019s enactment of MCL 418.358; MSA 17.237(358), which indicates the Legislature\u2019s treatment of unemployment compensation as wage loss replacement.

Otherwise, the result may often be the anomalous situation of public agencies providing the employee as much income, and on occasions more, during a period of idleness than he could earn if he were fully employed, so that it becomes to his advantage to remain away from work.

However, both benefits in that case were statutory. Therefore, the proper remedy should have been left to the Legislature. In the present case, however, plaintiff\u2019s breach of contract damage award is a judicially created benefit. Accordingly, the remedy lies with the judiciary. It is wholly unnecessary for the Legislature to revise the unemployment compensation act to support this Court\u2019s holding. Reliance on the Legislature\u2019s coordination of worker\u2019s compensation and unemployment compensation benefits merely demonstrates that both are now construed as wage loss and are awarded \"in lieu of wages.\u201d In this manner, the rule in <em>Pennington, </em>which was based on the opposite conclusion, is no longer supportable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b906-8\"> See also <em>Sheppard v Michigan Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>348 Mich 577, 597; 83 NW2d 614 (1957), in which this Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-9\">[CJommon sense and sound judicial discretion (i.e. adherence to precedent) should not be transformed into an implacable tenet. . . .

Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">The doctrine of legislative acquiescence is well established in our jurisprudence. See <em>McEvoy v City of Sault Ste Marie, </em>136 Mich 172, 182-183; 98 NW 1006 (1904). We have characterized it as \"a wisely self-imposed limitation of the appellate process.\u201d <em>Magreta v Ambassador Steel Co, </em>380 Mich 513, 518; 158 NW2d 473 (1968). The doctrine is grounded in our \"duty ... to ascertain and give effect to the legislative intent\u201d and the presumption that, when revising or amending a statute, the Legislature is aware of previous interpretations of that statute by the appellate judiciary. <em>Gwitt v Foss, </em>230 Mich 8, 12; 203 NW 151 (1925); <em>Magreta, supra </em>at 519-520. The controlling precept of the doctrine is that when the Legislature amends or otherwise revises a statute, failure to revise provisions of that statute previously construed by the appellate judiciary compels our \"assumption] that it was content with the construction which had been placed on th[ose] . . . provisions . . . .\u201d <em>Gwitt, supra </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">The majority attempts to undermine the authoritative effect of the <em>Pennington </em>decision by opining that the Court \"held, in what may be characterized as dicta, that it was error for the trial judge to instruct the jury that payments received by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>employee under the Employment Security Act, MCL 421.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.501 <em>et seq., </em>must be deducted from a damage award for breach of employment contract . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 633-634 (citing <em>Pennington, supra </em>at 600-601).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Dictum is defined as \"an observation or remark . . . concerning some rule, principle, or application of law, or the solution of a question suggested by the case at bar, but not necessarily involved in the case or essential to its determination; any statement of the law enunciated by the court merely by way of illustration, argument, analogy, or suggestion.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have previously taken notice of the sage counsel of Justice Cardozo with regard to obiter dicta:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-6\">\"There is the constant need, as every law student knows, to separate the accidental and the non-essential from the essential and inherent.\u201d <em>[Breckon v Franklin Fuel Co, </em>383 Mich 251, 270; 174 NW2d 836 (1970) (quoting Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, pp 29, 30).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Justice Cardozo\u2019s pragmatic standard is more logical and realistic than the distinction between holding and dictum employed by the majority, especially under the specific circumstances of the <em>Pennington </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">The majority opines that the <em>Pennington </em>Court\u2019s conclusion of law \"that the trial judge was in error in his direction to the jury [that any unemployment compensation benefits received by the plaintiffs should be deducted from any damages award],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 600, \"was unnecessary . . . because the Court held that the verdict could not stand.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 633-634, n 24. In my opinion, the majority ignores the true procedural context of the <em>Pen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number><em>nington </em>decision, which, briefly, is as follows: Upon conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiffs and awarded damages in an aggregate amount. The plaintiffs\u2019 subsequent motion for entry of judgment on the jury verdict was denied because the damages were not proved with respect to each plaintiff. Consequently, the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was granted, and judgment was entered in the defendant\u2019s favor. <em>Pennington, supra </em>at 597-598. On appeal, this Court held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-5\">Judgment may not properly be entered on the verdict of the jury for the reasons stated. It is equally apparent that the judgment entered in circuit court in favor of defendants may result in injustice to at least some of these plaintiffs. With the thought in mind that such a result should be avoided if possible, this Court will exercise its inherent authority to grant the right to a new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-6\">The case is remanded with directions to set aside the judgment entered in defendants\u2019 favor, and for further proceedings in the trial court. <em>[Id. </em>at 603.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Considered in its true context, then, it is obvious that the <em>Pennington </em>Court\u2019s legal conclusion with regard to the propriety of deducting unemployment benefits from the ultimate damages awards was stated in anticipation of the remand for further proceedings. The majority\u2019s narrow definition of that holding denies us the authority to decide legal questions that necessarily will be at issue in the subsequent proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">The majority\u2019s assertion that the <em>Pennington </em>opinion \"acknowledged\u201d that it was unnecessary to reach the issue whether unemployment benefits should be deducted evidences a misapprehension of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>that opinion. The majority relies on the following sentence, taken out of context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-5\">\" 'Whether such course should be pursued under proper circumstances does not call for discussion at this time.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Ante </em>at 634, n 24 (quoting <em>Pennington, supra </em>at 600).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">The \"course\u201d of action referred to was the plaintiffs\u2019 argument \"that in the event of a decision by this Court that judgment should be entered on the verdict of the jury, the amount of such deductions should be added and this Court should order the entry of judgment in the increased amount.\u201d <em>Pennington, supra </em>at 600. The reason the <em>Pennington </em>Court did not need to discuss that suggested course of action was because \"the report by the jury with reference to the awards of damages made to the individual plaintiffs receiving such made no mention of deductions, but it may be presumed that the direction of the court was followed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As demonstrated above, the <em>Pennington </em>Court\u2019s legal determination that unemployment benefits need not be deducted from the ultimate damages awards was stated with the intent that it be heeded by the trial court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">The majority further supports its attack on <em>Pennington </em>with defendant\u2019s argument that the Legislature\u2019s enactment of a setoff provision in the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> evinces \"a clear legislative intent to also characterize unemployment compensation as a wage-loss benefit .... On this basis, it appears that the Legislature\u2019s enactment of MCL 418.358; MSA 17.237(358) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>alone undermines <em>Pennington\u201d Ante </em>at 635-636. I strongly disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">This setoff provision provides that any benefits payable under the relevant provisions of the wdca \"shall be reduced by 100% of the amount of benefits paid or payable to the injured employee under the Michigan employment security act <em>. . . \u201d </em>MCL 418.358; MSA 17.237(358). The superficial appeal of the majority\u2019s reliance on this provision, however, does not survive close analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">In <em>Bartels v Ford Motor Co, </em>292 Mich 40; 289 NW 322 (1939), this Court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that it should not be required to make disability payments to the claimant for the period during which the claimant was also receiving unemployment compensation benefits. In rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim, this Court noted that \"[t]he legislative intent was to set up two independent organizations for the administration of two kinds of compensation, payable from different funds or sources. . . . The contingency which has arisen in this case has come about by reason of the passage of the unemployment compensation act. <em>The remedy lies with the Legislature.\u201d Id. </em>at 46 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <em>Bartels </em>opinion also cited this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Henry v Ford Motor Co, </em>291 Mich 535; 289 NW 244 (1939), with regard to the issue of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>simultaneous receipt of unemployment benefits and worker\u2019s compensation, benefits: \"Both awards are purely statutory and, while there is no question about some incongruity in the provisions, nevertheless we are bound by the wording of the statutes. <em>The remedy is with the' legislature </em>who alone can provide for deductions or denial of compensation under one act or the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541 (emphasis added). After these two decisions, the Legislature passed the setoff provision of the wdca, which obviously resulted in <em>Bartels </em>and <em>Henry </em>no longer being good law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Just as obviously, however, the Legislature has not taken similar action with regard to <em>Pennington, </em>even though that decision has been on the books for over thirty years. This conscious failure to express any disagreement with <em>Pennington </em>in any of . the numerous revisions<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Employment Security Act gives rise to a paradigmatic situation for application of the legislativ\u00e9 acquiescence doctrine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">The Employment Security Act also contains a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>setoff provision, MCL 421.62(a); MSA 17.566(a), which, in relevant part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-4\">If the commission determines that a person has obtained benefits to which the person is not entitled, the commission may recover a sum equal to the amount so received ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">This provision applies only in cases in which the beneficiary was not entitled to unemployment benefits in the first place, a situation clearly inapplicable to the case at bar. Even defendant concedes that this provision is inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">In general, these two setoff provisions weigh heavily against judicial imposition of such a setoff in the case at bar because they provide unequivocal evidence that the Legislature is aware of the possibility of arguably overlapping benefits and knows how to correct those situations it feels are improper or unwise. And in light of this Court\u2019s recent affirmation of \"the distinct character and objectives\u201d of the worker\u2019s compensation and unemployment compensation systems, see <em>Paschke v Retool Industries, </em>445 Mich 502, 511-512; 519 NW2d 441 (1994), the setoff provision of the wdca is particularly persuasive evidence that the Legislature sees no need to reduce damage awards in wrongful discharge cases by the amount of unemployment compensation benefits received.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">The majority\u2019s final attempt to discredit <em>Pennington </em>is the assertion that \"its underpinnings remain suspect. In <em>Pennington, </em>the Court stated that an analogous issue was decided in <em>Kurta v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number><em>Probelske, </em>324 Mich 179, 188; 36 NW2d 889 (1949). <em>Kurta, </em>however, involved an action for personal injuries arising out of a pedestrian-vehicle collision. ... In contrast, <em>Pennington </em>involved a breach of a collective bargaining agreement, which cannot be analogized to a tort action for personal injuries.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">The majority apparently believes that the <em>Pennington </em>Court\u2019s reference to <em>Kurta </em>was inadvertent, that all eight members of this Court who joined the <em>Pennington </em>opinion were unaware that <em>Kurta </em>dealt with a personal injury claim. This belief, however, is gainsaid by the actual language of <em>Pennington: </em>\"An analogous question was decided in <em>Kurta v Probelske, </em>324 Mich 179, an action for damages for personal injuries . . . .\u201d <em>Pennington </em>at 601. The <em>Pennington </em>Court\u2019s analogy to <em>Kurta </em>was conscious and deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">The majority\u2019s substantive disagreement with this analogy must be based on the assumption that all contracts are fungible for purposes of fashioning a remedy for breach, that commercial contracts between merchants are representative of all contracts, and that tort and contract are totally discrete bodies of doctrine with no overlap whatsoever. This assumption is not supported by our case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">In <em>Kewin v Massachusetts Mut Life Ins Co, </em>409 Mich 401, 420; 295 NW2d 50 (1980), we expressly recognized the distinction between commercial contracts and marriage contracts and noted that \"[t]here are exceptions to the general rule limiting the recovery for breach of contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415 (citing, inter alia, 5 Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7 1076, p 427). We also referred to \"an exception recognized in <em>Stewart v Rudner, </em>349 Mich 459; 84 NW2d 816 (1957),\u201d which involved a contract between a doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>tor and a patient.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Kewin </em>at 415. I would not hold that an employment contract, even a just-cause employment contract, is identical to marriage contracts or doctor-patient contracts. But I would hold \u2014indeed, I believe we could take judicial notice of the fact\u2014that just-cause employment contracts entail greater expectations<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> by the parties, especially employees, than do run-of-the-mill commercial contracts between merchants.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">In my opinion, the <em>Pennington </em>Court purposefully established another exception, and did so in accord with the previously established principle that there are exceptions to the general, but not immutable, rule of recovery in breach-of-contract actions. Therefore, because of the clear evidence of legislative acquiescence in that decision, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">As a general consideration, the evidence of legislative acquiescence alone is sufficient to compel our continued application of the rule established in <em>Pennington. </em>However, the specific facts in this case also argue against the result reached by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">The majority correctly notes that a breach-of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>employment-contract claim sounds in contract, as opposed to tort, and then notes the basic principle that the \"remedy for breach of contract is to place the nonbreaching party in as good a position as if the contract had been fully performed.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 625, n 7 (citing <em>Kewin, supra, </em>409 Mich 415). Proper application of this principle, however, requires a proper determination of exactly what will place the nonbreaching party in as good a position as if the contract had been fully performed. The majority\u2019s analysis is premised on its mistaken belief that payment of wages is the sole consideration an employee receives from an employer pursuant to an employment contract.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">The legislative purpose of the Employment Security Act is to combat the \"[economic insecurity due to unemployment [that] is a serious menace to the health, morals, and welfare of the people of this state.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The majority apparently adopts defendant\u2019s express argument that \"[l]oss of wages <em>is </em>the 'economic insecurity\u2019 created by unemployment.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) There are, however, other benefits provided to employees (e.g., life and health insurance, paid sick leave, pension contributions, etc.) that are part of the total employment package in addition to wages.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The economic insecurity resulting from unemployment manifests itself \"in terms of lost wages [and] other possible incidents of a layoff which may affect a worker at an earlier or later point in time.\u201d <em>General Motors </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number><em>Corp v Erves, </em>47 Mich App 591, 595; 209 NW2d 713 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">My colleagues in the majority apparently agree with the view of the circuit court and the Court of Appeals that the <em>Pennington </em>rule seems illogical, but, unlike those courts, feel they are not bound to accede to policy determinations made by the Legislature. Because of the unequivocal evidence that the Legislature knowingly has chosen not to require the setoff mandated by the majority, and because recouping wages alone does not put plaintiff in as good a position as he would have been had the employment contract been fully performed, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b920-6\">Levin, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-9\"> Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed), p 454.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b913-9\"> MCL 418.358; MSA 17.237(358).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b914-6\"> The majority characterizes my reliance on <em>Bartels </em>as \"misleading\u201d because <em>Bartels </em>dealt with two statutory benefits (unemployment and disability), whereas one of the benefits in the case at bar (damages for breach of contract) \"is a judicially created benefit.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 636, n 29.

I agree with the conclusion that the Legislature\u2019s failure to provide for a setoff of unemployment benefits requires application of the collateral source rule. Although I agree with Justice Cavanagh\u2019s result, I write separately to state my reasons for joining in that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">As. the majority recognizes, we have limited damages for the claim created in <em>Toussaint v Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan, </em>408 Mich 579; 292 NW2d 880 (1980), to those recoverable in contract. <em>Ante </em>at 625. However, I disagree that that limitation requires offset of the benefits in question. <em>Ante </em>at 630-631. The doctrinal foundation of the <em>Toussaint </em>claim is neither fish nor fowl, neither wholly contractual nor wholly fault-based. Thus, the answer to the question before us cannot be found in' rote application of the distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>between contract and tort.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fundamentally, <em>Toussaint </em>is a fault-based doctrine. Indeed, we have now explicitly recognized that the \"legitimate expectations\u201d prong of the <em>Toussaint </em>doctrine is an equitable principle \"not based on traditional contract analysis.\u201d <em>Rood v General Dynamics Corp, </em>444 Mich 107, 137; 507 NW2d 591 (1993); <em>Bullock v Automobile Club of Michigan, </em>432 Mich 472, 480; 444 NW2d 114 (1989); <em>In re Certified Question, </em>432 Mich 438, 447-448; 443 NW2d 112 (1989). Likewise, principles that are not grounded in traditional contract law have been associated with Toussaint\u2019s \"implied contract\u201d prong. <em>Valentine v General American Credit, Inc, </em>420 Mich 256, 263; 362 NW2d 628 (1984). While <em>Valentine </em>held that a <em>Toussaint </em>claim is an action for breach of contract and not a tort action, 420 Mich 259, it also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-5\">An employment contract will indeed often have a personal element. Employment is an important aspect of most persons\u2019 lives, and the breach of an employment contract may result in emotional distress. The primary purpose in forming such contracts, however, is economic and not to secure the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>protection of personal interests. The psychic satisfaction of the employment is secondary. [420 Mich 263.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">At common law, employers could dismiss their employees at will \"for good cause, for no cause or even for cause morally wrong, without being thereby guilty of legal wrong.\u201d <em>Payne v Western &amp; A R Co, </em>81 Tenn 507, 519-520 (1884). <em>Toussaint </em>changed the common law, holding that personnel policies and practices could create a just-cause employment contract, even when no preemployment negotiations take place and there is no mutual assent on the subject of job security. 408 Mich 613. <em>Toussaint </em>imposes a duty on employers to \"adhere[] to stated company policies and goals\u201d and entitles plaintiffs to pursue a cause of action when employers breach this duty. 408 Mich 615. Although we have characterized <em>Toussaint </em>as a contract action for some purposes, we distort history if we fail to recognize that Toussaint\u2019,s sole ratio decidendi is that, in some circumstances, termination at will is unfair. Thus, rejection of the collateral source rule in this context cannot rest on a semantic distinction between fault-based causes of action and <em>Toussaint </em>claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">Secondly, <em>Toussaint </em>claims involve a contract for labor that may be fairly characterized as a judicially created cousin to an unfair labor practice in which the principle item of recovery is lost earnings, <em>Valentine, supra. </em>While based on statute, it has been recognized that unemployment benefits are not earnings under the National Labor Relations Act, <em>Marshall Field &amp; Co v NLRB, </em>318 US 253; 63 S Ct 585; 87 L Ed 744 (1943), or under title VII, which traces its damage roots to the labor act. <em>Ford Motor Co v EEOC, </em>458 US 219, 228-230; 102 S Ct 3057; 73 L Ed 2d 721 (1982). These remedies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>are \"make whole,\u201d not punitive. However, because no consideration is given to collateral losses, \"manifestly no consideration need be given to collateral benefits which employees may have received.\u201d <em>NLRB v Gullett Gin Co, </em>340 US 361, 364; 71 S Ct 337; 95 L Ed 337 (1951). Benefits paid by a third party are collateral benefits. <em>Id. </em>See, e.g., <em>Craig v Y &amp; Y Snacks, </em>721 F2d 77, 83 (CA 3, 1983) (title VII case); <em>Hayes v Trulock, </em>51 Wash App 795, 804-805; 755 P2d 830 (1988) (wrongful discharge case).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Thirdly, allowing a setoff of the entire amount of unemployment benefits received by plaintiff is an overcredit. <em>Ante </em>at 637. Michigan employers do not pay into the unemployment benefits fund dollar for dollar what the employee takes out. As the majority accurately observes, \"[t]he Legislature has developed a <em>complex formula </em>for the funding of unemployment compensation benefits.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 637-638 (emphasis added). In addition, although in some sense paid for by the employer in the form of a tax, the unemployment benefits were not paid by the employer to the plaintiff, but, rather, were paid by the state out of state funds. To judicially approve a full deduction to the employer is to grant more credit than is due and to preclude reimbursement of the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Finally, and most importantly, we have not been provided any information that would permit a satisfactory formulation of the true amount paid by the employer or appellate review of that finding. Thus, the amount deducted would be essentially arbitrary, a factor that has influenced courts denying the claimed offset. <em>Brown v A J Gerrard Mfg Co, </em>715 F2d 1549, 1551 (CA 11, 1983) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">These observations do not suggest that the Legislature could not provide for a full or partial credit or for recoupment by the state. They do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>suggest that the nature of the claim does not dictate offset by the judiciary and support my colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the Legislature\u2019s failure to do so indicates that it does not disapprove of <em>Pennington v Whiting Tubular Products, Inc, </em>370 Mich 590; 122 NW2d 692 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">The failure to amend the Employment Security Act, while amending the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to require offset, may indicate a legislative conclusion that Michigan\u2019s rating formula for unemployment benefits is not readily translatable to the judicial forum. It may indicate that the Legislature has balanced the loss as a result of overpayment in the relatively rare instances of <em>Toussaint </em>recovery against the transitional costs to the administrative scheme and determined that the cost of recoupment by the fund<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is not justified. In all events, the value of the credit and the entity to whom credit is due are questions peculiarly within the legislative sphere. The Legislature has not provided a setoff although it has corrected those overlapping benefits it perceives to be a problem. We are faced with a simple question: whether to permit a wronged party to retain recovery from a collateral source, or allow the party in the wrong a credit greater than that paid. I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals._</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-6\"> Writing before the days of judicial expansion of protection against arbitrary discharge, McCormick recognized that a fundamental change may be impending and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-7\">[t]his might be worked out conceivably through the recognition of the willful and unjustifiable discharge of an employee, even though employed for an indefinite term, upon false charges or from inadequate reason, as a <em>tort, </em>for which emotional and punitive damages might be given. Short of that, the courts might expand their measure of compensation for breach of the employment <em>contract </em>by recognizing that deprivation of a job, if more than a casual one, not only affects usually a man\u2019s reputation and prestige, but ordinarily may so shake his sense of security as to inspire, even in men of firmness, deep fear and distress.
