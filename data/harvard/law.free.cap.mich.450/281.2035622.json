About six weeks before the trial, on March 6, 1991, the trial court entered an order requiring the endorsement of witnesses within fourteen days. The prosecutor provided a list on April 8, 1991, with six names.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The prosecutor indicated during jury voir dire that he would rely on circumstantial evidence linking Burwick to the break-in. The testimony would be that Burwick was familiar with Green\u2019s house, and that he was in possession of the stolen property. In his opening statement, the prosecutor stated that he would call the following witnesses: Renee Green to testify regarding her relationship with Burwick, and regarding events on the day of the incident; Darrial Goss to describe the guns and to testify that he identified the guns at the home of a family friend; Randy Evans, a family friend, to testify that he purchased guns from Burwick and then telephoned Kenneth Blunk, the boyfriend of Green\u2019s sister Rebecca Timmons, about his purchase; and David Holloway, the owner of a local appliance store and former boyfriend of one of Green\u2019s other sisters, to testify that someone had tried to sell him a television set on the evening of the break-in. Burwick\u2019s lawyer made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>brief opening statement that the question was who did what and why.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">On the second day of trial, the prosecutor moved to endorse Rebecca Timmons, Green\u2019s sister, as an additional witness. The prosecutor said that he was unaware that Timmons had evidence until he talked to Green the previous afternoon. The prosecutor said that Timmons had not been named in the police reports because the last report was dated December 19, 1990. Timmons would testify that Burwick confessed to her that he broke into Green\u2019s home. Burwick\u2019s lawyer opposed the endorsement, stating that he would need to investigate Burwick\u2019s whereabouts at the time Timmons claims Burwick spoke to her in an effort to establish an \"alibi.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The judge granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion on the basis that Timmons\u2019 testimony was relevant and material. He conditioned the endorsement on Burwick\u2019s lawyer being provided an opportunity to speak with Timmons before she testified. The judge recessed to provide Burwick\u2019s lawyer with an opportunity to interview Timmons.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">After a brief recess, the judge inquired whether the length of the recess had been sufficient. Bur-wick\u2019s lawyer responded that it had. Before the trial resumed, Burwick\u2019s lawyer reiterated his objection to the endorsement of Timmons, citing the need for time to investigate Burwick\u2019s whereabouts at the time of the purported confession; he did not request a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Green testified that at about 5 p.m. on the day of the break-in she took Burwick, who had stayed overnight at her home, to his mother\u2019s home and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>then continued on with her children to the Timmons home in Battle Creek to bake Christmas cookies. Burwick had inquired whether Green\u2019s children would accompany her on the visit to her sister\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">When Green returned home about 9:30 p.m., she found the knob of the front door broken and discovered her television and two shotguns missing. Green testified that she had received a telephone call from her sister four days after the break-in, reporting that another former boyfriend and Goss had seen the stolen guns at the home of a family friend, Randy Evans. Green then mentioned, for the first time, that Burwick had telephoned her before Christmas and confessed to having stolen the property, saying that he did not know why he did it, and that he was sorry but he had been hurt by Green. Green acknowledged that she had not told the police about the conversation, even when a police officer followed up with her two weeks later early in January.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Timmons testified that she had a telephone conversation with Burwick sometime on or after December 16, but before Christmas, and that Bur-wick said he was sorry and, in response to her question, admitted breaking into Green\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Testimony of the other witnesses was generally evasive and all failed to identify Burwick.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">The jury convicted Burwick, and the trial court sentenced him to a seven- to fifteen-year term.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals affirmed Burwick\u2019s conviction in an unpublished opinion<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and we granted leave to appeal. Finding no error, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"AOP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\">The issue is one of statutory construction. Our primary obligation is to determine the intent of the Legislature and to effectuate it. The statute in question, MCL 767.40a; MSA 28.980(1), does not impose an obligation on the prosecutor to discover and produce unknown witnesses, either by the exercise of due diligence or some lesser burden the dissent would engraft upon it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Before its amendment in 1986, MCL 767.40; MSA 28.980 was interpreted to require the prosecutor to use due diligence to endorse and produce all res gestae witnesses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The amended statute creates four classes of witnesses: 1) witnesses <em>known </em>at the time of filing of the information who might be called at trial, 2) res gestae witnesses <em>known </em>to the prosecution or law enforcement officials at the time of filing of the information, 3) res gestae witnesses whose names later become known, and 4) witnesses the prosecutor determines he intends to call at trial. In pertinent part, the statute unambiguously provides first that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8d\">[t]he prosecuting attorney shall attach to the filed information a list of all witnesses <em>known </em>to the prosecuting attorney who might be called at trial and all res gestae witnesses <em>known </em>to the prosecuting attorney or investigating law enforcement officers. [MCL 767.40a(1); MSA 28.980(1)(1) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The statute then provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">The prosecuting attorney shall be under a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>tinuing duty to disclose the names of any further res gestae witnesses as they become <em>known. </em>[MCL 767.40a(2); MSA 28.980(1)(2) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The statute next provides that the prosecutor shall send to the defendant not less than thirty days before trial</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">a list of the witnesses the prosecuting attorney intends to call at trial. [MCL 767.40a(3); MSA 28.980(1)(3).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">It further provides that the list of witnesses the prosecutor intends to call at trial may be amended as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">The prosecuting attorney may add or delete from the list of witnesses he or she intends to call at trial at any time upon leave of the court and for good cause shown or by stipulation of the parties. [MCL 767.40a(4); MSA 28.980(1)(4).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Finally, to assist the defendant in locating and serving witnesses, and without a showing of demonstrated need or unsuccessful efforts on the part of the defense, the statute provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">[t]he prosecuting attorney or investigative law enforcement agency shall provide to the defendant or defense counsel, upon request, reasonable assistance, including investigative assistance, as may be necessary to locate \u00e1nd serve process upon a witness. [MCL 767.40a(5); MSA 28.980(1)(5).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">The prosecutor\u2019s former obligation to use due diligence to produce any individual who might have any knowledge, favorable or unfavorable, to either side,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> has been replaced by a scheme that 1) con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>templates notice at the time of filing the information of known witnesses who might be called and all other known res gestae witnesses, 2) imposes on the prosecution a continuing duty to advise the defense of all res gestae witnesses as they become known, and 3) directs that that list be refined before trial to advise the defendant of the witnesses the prosecutor intends to produce at trial. The prosecutor\u2019s duty to produce res gestae witnesses has been replaced with an obligation to provide notice of known witnesses and reasonable assistance to locate witnesses on defendant\u2019s request.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The Legislature has thus eliminated the prosecutor\u2019s burden to locate, endorse, and produce unknown persons who might be res gestae witnesses and has addressed defense concerns to require the prosecution to give initial and continuing notice of all known res gestae witnesses, identify witnesses the prosecutor intends to produce, and provide law enforcement assistance to investigate and produce witnesses the defense requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The witness, Timmons, was not known to the prosecutor, or to the police. The prosecutor had no legal duty to discover, endorse, or produce her. Her belated discovery was for good cause shown. There being no prejudice to the defendant, the Court of Appeals decision must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Alx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In 1986, the Legislature amended MCL 767.40; MSA 28.980 to clarify and correct a considerable body of law unique \"in the country, if not the world\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that had placed the burden on the prosecution to use due diligence to find, endorse and produce \"res gestae\u201d witnesses. The rationale of the amendment was to abolish the former approach, which \"actually impedes, rather than contributes to, a fair trial, and that . . . serves no purpose except in defense counsel 'gamesmanship\u2019 to get a case dismissed or to lay the basis for a reversal.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Thus, as Justice Griffin recently observed on behalf of a majority of this Court in <em>People v Hana, Gallina, Rode, </em>447 Mich 325, 358, n 10; 524 NW2d 682 (1994), MCL 767.40a(4); MSA 28.980(1)(4), as amended, in pertinent part allows the prosecution to add to the list of witnesses it intends to call at trial \"at any time upon leave of the court and for good cause shown.\u201d The dissent\u2019s premise that the endorsement of witness Timmons was \"late\u201d because the prosecution should have discovered her earlier is thus legally incorrect. Timmons\u2019 endorsement was not \"late\u201d unless the prosecution had a duty to learn about her at an earlier time.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">As amended, the statute contemplates that the prosecutor will give advance notice of all <em>known </em>res gestae witnesses and specify before trial which <em>known </em>witnesses it intends to call. Having advised the defendant of all known witnesses and who among that list the prosecutor will produce at trial, the defense determines which known wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>nesses the prosecutor will not call and, upon request, the government must provide reasonable assistance \"as may be necessary to locate and serve process . . . MCL 767.40a(5); MSA 28.980(1)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Having thus fully addressed all known witnesses and provided for notice of their existence and a designation of who will be produced, the statute contemplates that the defense will seek production of the witnesses it desires and allows the prosecutor to delete from or add to the list of witnesses it will produce \"at any time\u201d as long as the good-cause requirement of MCL 767.40a(1); MSA 28.980(1)(1) is satisfied. The advance notice required by the statute is advance notice of witnesses <em>known </em>to the prosecution. Thus, strain as the dissent will, it can find no principled basis in the statute for an obligation to discover unknown witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Endorsement or deletion from this list is within the discretion of the trial court, reversible only for abuse.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">After concluding that the statute imposes a duty to discover witnesses, the dissent would apply the five-part test of the alibi-witness statute construed in <em>People v Travis, </em>443 Mich 668; 505 NW2d 563 (1993), and conclude that defendant was deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>of a fair trial. The notice-of-alibi witness statute,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which we construed in <em>Travis, </em>and the \"list of all witnesses\u201d and \"res gestae witnesses\u201d statute,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> deal with witnesses called at different stages in a trial, employ distinct language regarding the parties\u2019 obligations, and serve different policy goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">First, as previously noted, the list-of-witness statute in plain language imposes no discovery requirement. The prosecutor\u2019s only burden of production is to produce those witnesses it intends to call, a list that can be amended on good cause shown, <em>at any time. </em>While the prosecutor has a continuing duty to give notice of all known res gestae witnesses and to advise the defendant of the witnesses it will produce,, it is the defendant\u2019s responsibility to determine which witnesses it wants produced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The Legislature could have, but did not, condition the addition or deletion of the witnesses the prosecution would produce on a showing of prior due diligence. It could have, but did not, condition investigative assistance to the defense on defense counsel\u2019s due diligence in locating defense witnesses. Thus, the Legislature apparently intended to eliminate distortions to the truth-finding process at this stage of the proofs whether due diligence hurdles were advanced by the defense or the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">By contrast, the alibi-witness statute contains a section that specifically conditions endorsement of additional alibi witnesses on rebuttal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">[A] showing by the moving party that the name of an additional witness was not available when the notice required by subsections (1) or (2) was filed and could not have been available by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>exercise of due diligence . . . . [MCL 768.20(3); MSA 28.1043(3).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The Legislature apparently determined that the belated endorsement of alibi and rebuttal witnesses is much more likely to prejudice the prosecution or the defense than would the addition of non-alibi witnesses. Hence, the Legislature deemed that with respect to additional witnesses called to establish and rebut an alibi, each party must show due diligence as a condition for belated endorsement. Thus while rejecting the argument that the \"due diligence\u201d standard alone should be adopted as the controlling test for abuse of discretion in the addition of alibi or rebuttal witnesses, we recognized in <em>Travis </em>that diligence was part of the inquiry. <em>Id. </em>at 680-681.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The dissent suggests that <em>Travis </em>is appropriately applied here because <em>Travis </em>adopted the five-part test of <em>Myers,</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Myers </em>construed language identical to the good-cause language of MCL 767.40a; MSA 28.980(1). The observation perpetuates the selective omission of the words \"at any time\u201d appearing in MCL 767.40a(4); MSA 28.980(1)(4), thus obscuring the fact that both our notice-of-alibi statute and the federal rule impose an obligation to learn of alibi witnesses and implying that a similar obligation exists under the list-of-witness statute. There is no requirement to exercise due diligence under MCL 767.40a; MSA 28.980(1) to discover the names of witnesses, and we have neither authority nor reason to create one.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">This is not to say that in a different situation the failure to grant a continuance upon discovery of a previously unknown witness could not constitute an abuse of discretion, <em>People v Charles O </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number><em>Williams, </em>386 Mich 565; 194 NW2d 337 (1972), or that in certain circumstances the failure to declare a mistrial at defendant\u2019s request because of prejudice to a defendant from production of such a witness would not justify reversal. Cf. <em>United States v Myers, </em>550 F2d 1036, 1041 (CA 5, 1977). However, we have recognized in an analogous context that precluding evidence is an \"extremely severe\u201d sanction limited to an egregious case. <em>People v Merritt, </em>396 Mich 67, 82; 238 NW2d 31 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The trial court accepted the representation of counsel that witness Timmons was not known to the prosecution until the day before the motion, that the name of the witness was not in the police report, and that Timmons had never spoken to the police. At this point in the trial, defense counsel had done no more than make a two paragraph opening statement that did not commit him to any particular defense. After an adjournment to speak to the witness, defense counsel said the interview was \"sufficient.\u201d Although observing that he would have to investigate his client\u2019s whereabouts on two Thursdays, defense counsel did not request a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The statute allows the prosecutor to add to the list of witnesses \"at any time\u201d on good cause shown. The trial court determined there was good cause. Defendant did not request a continuance of the trial and acknowledged that there was no sandbagging.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">Assuming that the five factors considered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>People v Travis, supra, </em>are the appropriate standard to review the addition of witnesses to be called in the case in chief, defendant was not deprived of a fair trial. First, and. most importantly, the prosecutor did not violate any statutory duty. Thus, unlike the prosecutor in <em>Travis, </em>who did not endorse known rebuttal witnesses before trial because he had lost their names, the defendant does not dispute that the prosecutor had no indication that Timmons existed until after the first day of trial. Indeed, Green, the complainant, testified that she had failed to tell the officer who interviewed her about defendant\u2019s admissions to her and her sister because of ambivalent feelings regarding the defendant.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Second, the defendant has not shown that his case was severely prejudiced by the untimely disclosure. <em>Id. </em>at 683. In fact, there is no colorable claim that defendant would have proceeded any differently had advance notice been given.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> A telephone call can be made at any time from anywhere and does not lend itself to an alibi. Third, assuming unlawful damage was caused, it was mitigated when the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>court allowed the defendant to interview the witness before taking the stand. After doing so, defense counsel indicated that his interview had been sufficient to understand the nature of the testimony. While the defendant preserved his appellate claim by objecting to admission of the testimony, he did not request a continuance and still has not shown that a continuance would have produced any evidence to rebut the witnesses\u2019 testimony. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s speculation, defense counsel does not claim he was hampered in his efforts to cross-examine Timmons with respect to her credibility. Given that defense counsel requested and received information regarding the criminal convictions of prosecution witnesses, it is reasonable to conclude such potential specific impeachment of Timmons was nonexistent. In any event, appellant does not make this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Finally, the amount of other evidence admitted against the defendant was compelling. In addition to circumstantial proof that the defendant committed the offense, there is no dispute that the entirety of complainant Green\u2019s testimony was properly admitted.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Green testified that the defendant called her and confessed that he had broken into her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Rules of discovery are intended both to enhance the fairness of the adversary system, <em>Wardius v Oregon, </em>412 US 470; 93 S Ct 2208; 37 L Ed 2d 82 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>(1973), and to vindicate the principle that the \"ends of criminal justice would be defeated if judgments were to be founded on a partial or speculative presentation of the facts.\u201d <em>Taylor v Illinois, </em>484 US 400, 411; 108 S Ct 646; 98 L Ed 2d 798 (1988), quoting <em>United States v Nixon, </em>418 US 683, 709; 94 S Ct 3090; 41 L Ed 2d 1309 (1974). Where there is a potential conflict between these interests, the trial court must balance the interests in fairness within \"the broader public interest in a full and truthful disclosure of critical facts.\u201d 484 US 412. Where, as here, there is no cognizable prejudice to defendant in allowing endorsement, excluding the testimony would convert the salutary purpose of discovery into a weapon against the truth-determining function of the trial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The res gestae witness rule was abolished precisely because the notion of due diligence to produce at trial ail \"res gestae\u201d witnesses had become a vehicle for claims that failure to use due diligence to locate, endorse, and produce witnesses required an adverse inference instruction or reversal on appeal. The prosecution must disclose material evidence favorable to the defense\u2014even without a request<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>\u2014must advise defendant of all known witnesses and those it discovers, must indicate which witnesses it will call at trial, and must provide reasonable assistance to produce witnesses it does not intend to call. The dissent\u2019s attempt to resurrect \"the fat lady\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> from the legislative bone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>yard serves neither fair play nor truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">A primary purpose of discovery is to enhance the reliability of the fact-finding process by eliminating distortions attributable to gamesmanship. Assuming a statutory violation, the court must weigh this paramount interest against the opposing parties\u2019 interests in an adequate opportunity to meet the proofs. Where a continuance can accomplish both objectives, it serves administrative efficiency and is the remedy of choice. In other circumstances, other methods of addressing the problem may be appropriate. In all events, the remedy is confided to the discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Given that there is no duty to discover res gestae witness, there was no statutory violation. In this case there is not even a colorable claim of abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b568-7\">Brickley, C.J., and Riley and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-10\"> MCL 750.110; MSA 28.305.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b553-11\"> Unpublished memorandum opinion, issued November 5, 1993 (Docket No. 140851).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b554-8\"> 446 Mich 868 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b555-9\"> The judge said that he would be willing to hear from Burwick\u2019s lawyer if he needed additional time after the interview.

The duty owed, however, is imposed by the oath of office and is owed to the client, the public. Likewise, defense counsel owes a duty to the client, imposed by the Sixth Amendment, to provide the defendant with effective assistance of counsel. Neither the prosecution nor the defense has an affirmative duty to search for evidence to aid the other\u2019s case. The duty created by this statute is not to investigate for the benefit of the adversary, but to share the evidence that is discovered in fulfilling the prosecutor\u2019s and defense counsel\u2019s duties to their respective clients (subject of course to the provisions of the Fifth Amendment and the attorney-client privilege).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b560-8\"> Senate Analysis, SB 119 (1986 PA 46), March 26,1986.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b560-9\"> The prosecutor has a constitutional obligation to disclose exculpatory material and to exercise due diligence before using prior testimony of a missing witness.

About six weeks before the trial, on March 6, 1991, the trial court entered an order requiring the endorsement of witnesses within fourteen days. The prosecutor provided a list on April 8, 1991, with six names.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The prosecutor indicated during jury voir dire that he would rely on circumstantial evidence linking Burwick to the break-in. The testimony would be that Burwick was familiar with Green\u2019s house, and that he was in possession of the stolen property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Burwick\u2019s lawyer made a brief opening statement that the question was who did what and why. The lawyer concluded that the jury would come to the conclusion that Burwick \"had been extremely wrongly treated or that the Prosecution has totally and completely failed to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">On the second day of trial, the prosecutor moved to endorse Rebecca Timmons, Green\u2019s sister, as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>additional witness. The prosecutor said that he was unaware that Timmons had evidence until he talked to Green the previous afternoon. The prosecutor said that Timmons had not been named in the police reports because the last report was dated December 19, 1990. Timmons would testify that Burwick confessed to her that he broke into Green\u2019s home. Burwick\u2019s lawyer opposed the late endorsement, stating that he would need to investigate Burwick\u2019s whereabouts at the time Timmons claims Burwick spoke to her in an effort to establish an alibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The judge granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion on the basis that Timmons\u2019 testimony was relevant and material. He conditioned the endorsement on Burwick\u2019s lawyer being provided an opportunity to speak with Timmons before she testified. The judge recessed for eleven minutes to provide Bur-wick\u2019s lawyer with an opportunity to interview Timmons.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">After the recess, the judge inquired whether the time had been sufficient. Burwick\u2019s lawyer responded that it had. Before the trial resumed, Burwick\u2019s lawyer reiterated his objection to the endorsement of Timmons, citing the need for time to investigate Burwick\u2019s whereabouts at the time of the purported confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Green testified that at about 5 p.m. on the day of the break-in she drove Burwick, who had stayed overnight at her home, to his mother\u2019s home and then continued on with her children to the Timmons home in Battle Creek to bake Christmas cookies. Burwick had inquired whether Green\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>children would accompany her on the visit to her sister\u2019s house.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">When Green returned home about 9:30 p.m., she found the knob of the front door broken and discovered her television and two shotguns missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Green also testified that she had received a telephone call from her sister four days after the break-in, reporting that another former boyfriend and Goss had seen the stolen guns at the home of a family friend, Randy Evans. Green then reported, for the first time, that Burwick had telephoned her before Christmas and confessed to having stolen the property, saying that he did not know why he did it, and that he was sorry but he had been hurt by Green.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Green acknowledged that she had not told the police about the conversation, even when a police officer followed up with her two weeks later early in January.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">David Holloway, a local appliance store owner, testified that a man entered the store on the evening of the break-in and had tried to sell him a television set resembling Green\u2019s. Holloway did not purchase the set, but he overheard another man in the store discuss purchasing it and mention a name resembling Burwick\u2019s. Holloway did not recognize Burwick as one of the men who was in his store.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Goss testified that he identified the stolen guns at the home of a relative, Randy Evans. Evans testified that he had bought the guns from Clifford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>McLiechey<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> after someone at a bar had told him that guns were for sale. Evans claimed that Mc-Liechey indicated that he obtained them from a man who identified himself as Burwick. Evans could not identify Burwick in court. McLiechey was not Called to testify.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The late-endorsed witness, Timmons, testified that she had a telephone conversation with Bur-wick sometime on or after December 16 before Christmas. She said that she told Burwick that she had spoken with his mother and that he should call her because she was concerned about him. She then said that Burwick asked her whether she thought Randy would \"drop it\u201d if he got his money back. Timmons assumed Burwick was referring to the stolen guns. She said that, while they were talking about Evans, Burwick said that he did not know that Evans was related to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Timmons then testified that Burwick said he was sorry and, in response to her question, admitted having broken into Green\u2019s house. Timmons conceded that she had not reported the confession to the police, although she and Green both testified that she told Green about it well before Christmas. She said that her mother was present listening to her end of the conversation when she spoke with Burwick. Her mother was not called to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The jurors deliberated for a day; they asked that the testimony regarding Burwick\u2019s purported confessions be read back, which was done. The jury convicted Burwick, and the trial court sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>him to a seven- to fifteen-year term.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In affirming the conviction, the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the late endorsement of the prosecution\u2019s witness. <em>People v Canter, </em>197 Mich App 550, 563; 496 NW2d 336 (1992).

It tends to protect the prosecution in cases where the defendant is at fault or where the defendant suffers little or no prejudice. At the same time, it tends to protect the defendant when the conduct of the prosecution unfairly limits the defendant\u2019s choice of trial strategy. . . .[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Although there are differences between the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>utory obligations under the notice-of-alibi statute<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and the statutory obligations under the statute here at issue,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the considerations that led this</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Court in <em>Travis </em>to adopt the <em>Myers </em>five-part standard are also relevant in the context of the late endorsement of witnesses who are not alibi witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The majority\u2019s reading of \"for good cause shown\u201d would transform that standard to a \"for any cause shown\u201d standard. The \"good cause\u201d standard does not provide a trial judge with unfettered discretion to permit endorsement. The multifactored approach adopted in <em>Travis </em>provides a means of reviewing a trial judge\u2019s decision in light of the factual circumstances of a particular case. That approach is preferable to the essentially standardless approach offered by the majority, since \"whether the trial court has abused its discretion 'varies with the facts of each case, and must inevitably involve a weighing of the competing interests involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Travis </em>at 681 quoting <em>People v </em>Merritt, 396 Mich 67, 82; 238 NW2d 31 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">We agree with the majority that there is no longer a \"due diligence\u201d requirement on the prosecution to locate unknown witnesses. The Legislature did away with this requirement by adopting the \"good cause\u201d standard. Using the majority\u2019s metaphor,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the fat lady has already sung and we have no thought of bringing her back for an encore.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Nevertheless, as the majority observes, the statute \"contemplates that the prosecutor will give <em>advance notice </em>of all known res gestae witnesses and specify before trial which known witnesses it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>intends to call.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Providing \"advance notice\u201d requires the prosecutor to exercise some minimal level of diligence to comply with his statutory disclosure obligations. As the United States Supreme Court observed, \"Routine preparation involves location and interrogation of potential witnesses and the serving of subpoenas on those whose testimony will be offered at trial. The burden of identifying them in advance of trial adds little to these routine demands of trial preparation.\u201d <em>Taylor v Illinois, </em>484 US 400, 415-416; 108 S Ct 646; 98 L Ed 2d 798 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Under the standards this Court adopted in <em>Travis, </em>the reason for witness nondisclosure is but one factor to be considered in determining whether the trial judge correctly concluded that good cause had been shown. The majority seeks to cast doubt on our conclusion that Timmons\u2019 endorsement deprived Burwick of a fair trial by focusing on only one of the five <em>Travis </em>factors and by mischaracterizing the application of <em>Travis </em>in this opinion. It incorrectly asserts that this opinion would resurrect the due diligence requirement eliminated by the amendatory legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Reviewing the record in the instant case in light of the <em>Travis </em>standard, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the late endorsement of Rebecca Timmons.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">There is potential for prejudice to a defendant\u2019s trial strategy whenever there is late endorsement of a witness by the prosecution, particularly when, as here, the defendant has already locked himself into a defense theory in an opening statement. Before the second day of trial, Burwick\u2019s lawyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>was unaware of Burwick\u2019s purported confessions to Green and Timmons. Until then, the prosecutor\u2019s statements to the jury were that the evidence was circumstantial and would be used to link Burwick to the burglary. In his opening statement, Bur-wick\u2019s lawyer appeared to pursue a simple strategy to the effect that the evidence was insufficient and not worthy of belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">In response to the prosecution\u2019s motion to endorse Timmons, Burwick\u2019s lawyer suggested that Burwick might be able to establish an alibi at the time Timmons would testify she spoke with him. Whether such an alibi could have been established, the introduction of a witness testifying that Burwick confessed presented a significantly different factual scenario from that originally envisioned by Burwick\u2019s lawyer. The damaging nature of the testimony, combined with the late timing of disclosure, left Burwick\u2019s counsel fewer options. Since the late endorsement occurred after opening statements, Burwick\u2019s lawyer was foreclosed from presenting alternative defense theories before the jury heard the testimony of the newly endorsed prosecution witness.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Turning to the reason for nondisclosure, the prosecutor said that he had only learned , of Timmons and of her conversation with Burwick in the afternoon of the first day of trial. Green testified that Burwick confessed to her that he had burgled her home, and that Timmons had reported to Green the confession to her, within a week after the burglary, around December 20. No police report was filed after December 19, 1990. Between that time and the first day of trial, April 16, 1991, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>there had been at least one police visit to Green on December 27, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">These facts suggest inadvertence on the part of the prosecutor, although we note that, the interview between the prosecutor and Green that elicited the information that Burwick had confessed to Green and Timmons could have, occurred at almost any time during the four-month interval between the confessions and the date of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">To be sure, Green was not the prosecutor\u2019s client, but she was the complaining witness.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> If the mutual obligations of the parties to disclose the names of witnesses before trial<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> are to serve the purpose of mutual discovery of the names of witnesses who may be called, counsel for both parties, the prosecutor as well as the defendant, should make some minimal attempt to learn the names of witnesses known to the protagonists.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In reviewing the extent of mitigation, we recognize that the trial court permitted Burwick\u2019s lawyer to interview Timmons and that Burwick\u2019s lawyer initially said that the allotted time had been sufficient. In <em>State v Wilson, </em>91 Ohio App 3d 611, 616-617; 632 NE2d 1384 (1993), the court observed that \u201d[e]ffective representation generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>requires more than an interview in a courthouse hallway; it may require a more lengthy investigation to determine not only what evidence the witness would offer, but also the facts relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">While falling short of moving for a continuance, Burwick\u2019s lawyer communicated to the trial judge that more time was necessary to prepare to defend against Timmons\u2019 testimony. It was the responsibility of the trial judge, in deciding whether to permit the late endorsement in the exercise of discretion, to consider, given the significance of the proposed testimony, the extent to which Burwick\u2019s lawyer could have prepared to meet the testimony in the time allotted. As this Court observed in Travis, <em>supra </em>at 684, merely allowing the opportunity to interview a witness before testifying does not necessarily mitigate prejudice, especially where the defense has already announced a strategy in its opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Turning to an assessment of the weight of the properly admitted evidence, the prosecution\u2019s evidence was circumstantial and weak. There was no direct evidence of Burwick\u2019s involvement in the crime, no forensic evidence such as fingerprints. Each of the witnesses who testified, except for the police witnesses, were related in some way to Green. Neither Evans nor Holloway could identify Burwick as the person who offered to sell stolen goods. Without the confessions, the evidence only slightly linked Burwick to the crime.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>The effect of the testimony concerning confessions is underscored by the jury\u2019s request that Green\u2019s and Timmons\u2019 testimony be read back. Green\u2019s report that Burwick had confessed might very well have been discounted by the jury because of her prior relationship with Burwick and her interest. Although Timmons was Green\u2019s sister, the jurors may have seen her testimony as more credible. The belated endorsement of Timmons may very well have turned the scales of justice against Burwick.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">\"A confession is like no other evidence. Indeed, 'the defendant\u2019s own confession is probably the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against him. . . .\u2019 <em>Bruton v United States, </em>391 US [123, 139-140; 88 S Ct 1620; 20 L Ed 2d 476 (1968)] (White, J., dissenting). . . . While some statements by a defendant may concern isolated aspects of the crime or may be incriminating only when linked to other evidence, a full confession in which the defendant discloses the motive for and means of the crime may tempt the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>jury to rely upon that evidence alone in reaching its decision.\u201d[<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>] <em>[People v </em>Dunn, 446 Mich 409, 423; 521 NW2d 255 (1994).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">We agree with the following statement by the majority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">A primary purpose of discovery is to enhance the reliability of the fact-finding process by eliminating distortions attributable to gamesmanship. Assuming a statutory violation, the court must weigh this paramount interest against the opposing parties\u2019 interests in an adequate opportunity to meet the proofs. Where a continuance can accomplish both objectives, it serves administrative efficiency and is the remedy of choice. In other circumstances, other methods of addressing the problem may be appropriate. In all events, the remedy is confided to the discretion of the trial court. [Ante at 298.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">In reviewing a claim by a defendant that preclusion is not an appropriate sanction for violation of a discovery rule providing for witness disclosure, the United States Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">It may well be true that alternative sanctions are adequate and appropriate in most cases, but it is equally clear that they would be less effective than the preclusion sanction and that there are instances in which they would perpetuate rather than limit the prejudice to the State and the harm to the adversary process. One of the purposes of the discovery rule itself is to minimize the risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>that fabricated testimony will be believed. <em>[Taylor </em>at 413.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We see no reason why this principle should not apply when <em>either </em>party seeks belatedly timed endorsement of a witness. The trial judge had the discretion to fashion a remedy to mitigate any potential unfairness resulting from the timing of endorsement. Depending on the circumstances, a continuance may or may not be appropriate. In some cases, preclusion remains a potential remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">To be sure, preclusion is a harsh sanction that should be used sparingly. In the instant case, the parties argued extreme positions. The prosecution requested endorsement, and the defense called for preclusion.

This Court found that the court had abused its discretion, not because of the decision to grant the late endorsement, but because of the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a reasonable continuance. This Court concluded that the failure to grant a continuance infringed on the defendant\u2019s due process rights, that the defendant had a legitimate reason for asking for a continuance, that the defendant was not negligent, that there was no evidence of prior adjournments, and that the defendant demonstrated prejudice because he lost the ability to assert a possible defense by his inability to adequately cross-examine the chemist. <em>Id. </em>at 82-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Although our holding in <em>Wilson </em>was premised on the failure to grant a continuance, it is instructive with respect to the potential pitfalls of last-minute endorsement. First, late endorsement of a witness may violate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights in the absence of an effective remedy enabling the defendant to adequately prepare his case. Further, a defendant may establish prejudice on the basis of loss of a possible defense resulting from inadequacies in defense counsel\u2019s ability to cross-examine the newly endorsed witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b575-10\"> MCL 768.20; MSA 28.1043.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b575-11\"> Id. at 679.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b576-10\"> Id</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b576-11\"> <em>Id. </em>at 683.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b577-5\">MCL 768.20; MSA 28.1043.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b577-6\"> The majority contends that the notice-of-alibi statute was designed to serve different policy goals from the witness notification statute at issue here. It so reasons because of linguistic differences between the statutes and opines that \"[t]he Legislature apparently determined that the belated endorsement of alibi and rebuttal witnesses is much more likely to prejudice the prosecution or the defense than would the addition of non-alibi witnesses.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The United States Supreme Court found a similarity between the purposes of alibi notification and witness discovery statutes. <em>Taylor v Illinois, </em>484 US 400, 410-412; 108 S Ct 646; 98 L Ed 2d 798 (1988). The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">Rules that provide for pretrial discovery of an opponent\u2019s witnesses serve the same high purpose [as the accused\u2019s right to compulsory process]. Discovery, like cross-examination, minimizes the risk that a judgment will be predicated on incomplete, misleading, or even deliberately fabricated testimony. The \"State\u2019s interest in protecting itself against an eleventh hour defense\u201d is merely one component of the broader public interest in full and truthful disclosure of critical facts. <em>[Id. </em>at 411-412.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">The Court also observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">[t]he adversary process could not function effectively without adherence to rules of procedure that govern the orderly presentation of facts and arguments to provide each party with a fair opportunity to assemble and submit evidence to contradict or explain the opponent\u2019s case. [Id. at 410-411.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">The majority further contends that application of the <em>Travis </em>standard is inappropriate because the text of MCL 767.40a(4); MSA 28.980(1)(4) permits late endorsement \"for good cause shown,\u201d unlike MCL 768.20(3); MSA 28.1043(3), respecting notice-of-alibi, which requires \"due diligence\u201d on the part of the party seeking belated endorsement. <em>Ante </em>at 291-294.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">This Court adopted the five-part <em>Myers </em>test in <em>Travis, </em>despite linguistic differences between MCL 768.20(3); MSA 28.1043(3) and FR Crim P 12.1(e), which permits a court to grant an exception from the alibi witness disclosure requirements \"for good cause shown.\u201d The <em>Travis </em>Court stated that it was \"[m]indful of the linguistic differences between our statute and the federal rule,\u201d but nevertheless thought that \"the <em>Myers </em>test provides an appropriate standard by which to judge the exercise of discretion vested in the trial court by our notice-of-alibi statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 682-683.

Although she testified that Burwick became defensive, this information was not provided to the police. In her conversations with the investigating officer, Green first said that she believed her house had been entered through a broken basement window, and then, later, through a door to the garage.
