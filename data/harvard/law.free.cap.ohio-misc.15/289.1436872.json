The plaintiff, Hyman R. Weiner (hereinafter called the plaintiff), brings this suit as a taxpayer\u2019s action against Cuyahoga County Community College and its trustees (hereinafter called the \u201cCollege\u201d), alleging that what defendants have done, in the situation narrated below, \u201camounts to a gross abuse of discretion conferred upon them by statute <em>* * </em>*, illegality in its bidding process, and that the College\u2019s * # * bid specifications were insufficient and therefore contrary to law, since they did not set forth specific and definite standards.\u201d Plaintiff seeks to enjoin the College from awarding the construction contract to anyone but the alleged \u201clowest and best bidder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">2. The College admits many of the plaintiff\u2019s factual allegations of the course of events between the parties before suit. It denies, however, plaintiff\u2019s conclusions that charge the College with gross abuse of discretion, acts in violation of the very laws on which the College bases its defense, and lack of sufficiency of its bid specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">3. The plaintiff is a principal officer of Reliance Mechanical Contractors, Inc., hereafter called \u201cReliance.\u201d It is Reliance\u2019s dispute with the College that is the chief concern of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">4. Reliance was among the bidders on the ventilating, air conditioning and heating work on Phase III of constructing the College\u2019s metropolitan campus. Reliance\u2019s bid, on the mechanical part of the job, proved to be the lowest and best bid, at least monetarily, and it was for the time being accepted, subject to approval as required by federal law. (Minutes of meeting, April 11,1968, of trustees of the College, plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 16, page 62.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">5. The evidence shows that the College bought from the city of Cleveland the land on which the building will stand, under an agreement anticipating that the College would redevelop the land under the requirements of the proper agencies of the federal government. This made the College amenable to federal laws setting up bidding practices and providing for affirmative action to assure equal opportunity in employment. The College\u2019s obligation springs from the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title 42, Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>2000e, U. S. Code. (For Title VII of the Act, see plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 4.) The College\u2019s obligation also springs from Executive Order No. 11246 (30 Fed. Reg. 12319; plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">6. Federal law likewise imposes on Reliance the duty to \u201ctake affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed # * * without regard to their race, creed, color or national origin # * *\u201d (See: Executive Order 11246.) An Executive Order has the force of statute. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Local 189, United Papermakers &amp; Paperworkers, </em>282 F. Supp. 39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">7. There was duly held a pre-award conference including low bidders, federal officials and others. Other meetings followed. The stress was on \u201ccommitment to a program of equal opportunity and merit employment practices.\u201d (Plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 17.) There was discussion of a so-called \u201cmanning table,\u201d with testimony that it had not been mentioned by name before the bidding. (For manning table, see plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 17, under VII, and plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 18, a form in use in June, 1968.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">8. The College tentatively accepted Reliance\u2019s bid on April 11, 1968 as will be more fully commented on in paragraph 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">9. April 19, 1968, Reliance submitted an affirmative action plan to the College. Reliance made equality in hiring <em>subject to availability, </em>and dependent on referral of all labor from Pipefitters Local No. 120, an outfit which has some 1500 to 1600 white journeymen and 6 Negro apprentices.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">10. It should be emphasized that the so-called manning table was just one of many documents submitted by Reliance to demonstrate Reliance\u2019s commendable interest in affirmative action plans. At this and subsequent times the plaintiff did not orally or in writing object to submitting a manning table.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">11. April 25, 1968, Reliance was notified that its bid was rejected because the language used \u2014 \u201cif available,\u201d negated the government\u2019s provision to assure non-discrimination against minorities, including Negroes. Several other efforts at agreement were fruitless. The city and fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>eral authorities disapproved Reliance\u2019s bid, the College could <em>not </em>under the law accept it, so therefore rejected it, and on May 27, 1968 the College awarded the contract to Smylie Bros., Inc., the second lowest bidder, which company demonstrated to the government\u2019s agencies that it would satisfy the federal government\u2019s basic policy of non-discrimination as set forth in Executive Order No. 11246.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">12. Turning now to the legal questions here to be answered, the court observes that the College does not contend that plaintiff could not bring a taxpayer\u2019s suit because Reliance, his company, would stand to benefit by the court\u2019s granting his prayer for an injunction. The law of Ohio is summed up in the article on Taxpayer\u2019s actions, 52 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d, Section 3. The court therefore holds that plaintiff has a right to bring this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">13. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 (previously cited), deals with \u201cEqual Employment Opportunities.\u201d Executive Order No. 11246 elaborates on and defines the rights and duties of parties affected by the Act. The order declares in Section 101:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">\u201cIt is the policy of the Government of the United States to provide equal opportunity in Federal employment for all qualified persons, to prohibit discrimination in employment because of race, creed, color, or national origin, and to promote the full realization of equal employment opportunity through a positive, continuing program in each executive department and agency. The policy of equal opportunity applies to every aspect of Federal employment policy and practice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">14. This order has been in effect since October 24, 1965 and the plaintiff must have had due notice of it since then, although plaintiff alleged in argument that prior to the contract there was no evidence of what federal requirements were. Notably, however, such procedures were referred to and explained in the College\u2019s specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">15. In the College\u2019s bid specifications (Plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 1, 6404.3-S.S.G.C. 1) is found what is labeled \u201cSpecial Supplement to the General Conditions \u2014 Executive Order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>11246.\u201d This general reference alone puts Reliance on notice to look to Executive Order No. 11246 with all of its requirements to assure non-discrimination. The terms of this part of the College\u2019s specifications are clear and strong and they leave no doubt that, under federal overseeing, they had to be enforced to assure that equal employment opportunities guaranteed by Title VII of The Civil Rights Act of 1964 were observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">16. Now the specifications also told the bidder, Reliance (plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 1, 6404.3-S.S.G.C. 2) that by its contractual obligation it \u201cassumes whatever affirmative actions are necessary to assure equal employment opportunity in <em>all aspects </em>of employment, irrespective of race, color, creed or national origin.\u201d (Paragraph 1, above.) (Emphasis added.) In paragraph 2 it says: \u201cTo do this the contractor must have a <em>program </em>of affirmative action * * * tailored to the particular circumstances # * * which apply * * Later the specifications say: \u201cThe actions listed under these principles in the following pages are <em>furnished only as suggestions, and are not intended to limit the hinds of actions which may be tahen.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In the paragraphs which follow in the specifications there are many suggestions of the bidder\u2019s duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">17. Further, the College\u2019s specifications deal with the \u201cPre-award meeting and affirmative action plan.\u201d (Same reference to plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 1, page S.S.G.C.-3.) A time and place is set for such meeting. In D 2 (same reference) it says: \u201cA written affirmative action plan by each such <em>apparent </em>low bidder must be approved by the federal government prior to the contract execution.\u201d (Emphasis, added.) Purpose: to assure that \u201cThere is a minority group representation in all trades on the job and in all phases of the work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">18. The specifications of the College also call for an <em>unequivocal </em>statement by the contractor (here Reliance) assuring equal employment opportunity. (See: same, pages S.S.G.C.-4, 5, 6, 7, 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">19. The plaintiff has emphasized what it calls the College\u2019s abuse of discretion in rejecting the apparent lowest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>bid because of Reliance\u2019s \u201crefusal to submit a \u2018manning table \u2019 as part of the affirmative action plan required in the bid specifications.\u201d (Plaintiff\u2019s trial brief, page 5.) This, plaintiff says, was \u201cunlawful\u201d and \u201ca <em>clear and gross abuse of </em>discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">20. This and other passages in the amended petition and brief make it clear that plaintiff\u2019s theory is that the College violated the Civil Rights Act and other laws and is the culprit. Obviously the College\u2019s defense is that full blame for violating the law is on the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">21. Now it well may be that the words \u201cmanning table\u201d were first used in the pre-award conference as being a required inclusion in plaintiff\u2019s affirmative action plan. The testimony on this point differs. In the judgment of the court a manning table (plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 17, Section VII) is simply a list of the proposed total number of pipe-fitters for the College\u2019s job, listed by month and year, and showing the number of Negroes who would be on the job. It could just as well be called a \u201chiring list\u201d or a \u201cnumber of men on the job table.\u201d It comes close to being the \u201cPeriodic Progress Report\u201d found in plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 1, 6404-3, S.S.G.C.-9, where employees are classified to show total numbers on the job and those in the \u201cminority group.\u201d In the end, what material difference is there between the two tables?</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">22. In view of the matters discussed in paragraphs 13-21, the court is \u00e1t a loss to understand the testimony of Reliance\u2019s Vice President to the effect that he was surprised when he first heard about the manning table requirement. This was April 4th, according to his testimony. He knew from the College\u2019s bid specifications that the preaward meeting of apparent low bidders was necessary before the contract could be finally closed. He knew minority representation was discussed; he knew of the affirmative action program. In his brief (pg. 23), plaintiff states: \u201cDefendants forced Reliance to \u2018negotiate matters <em>mentioned only vaguely </em>before bidding.\u2019 \u201d The court construes this an admission by plaintiff that <em>before bidding </em>the manning table had been mentioned and was at least \u201cvaguely\u201d known to Reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>23. Reliance\u2019s bid was tentatively accepted by the College\u2019s trustees on April 11th (plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 16, page 61). This proviso accompanied the award:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\">\u201c* * # provided, however, such award shall <em>not </em>be final until said Reliance Mechanical Contractors, Inc., is notified in writing by the Treasurer of the College District that the appropriate officials of the United States of America concur and approve the awarding and letting of the contract; <em>* * *\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">By his own testimony, therefore, Reliance\u2019s officer knew of the manning table a week before the conditional award of the contract. Above all, Reliance knew that its award of the contract was strictly conditioned on and subject to federal approval. Under all the circumstances, the court believes that Reliance was properly apprised of the manning table before the contract was fully cleared for acceptance, and had reason to know that the table was merely one means of helping assure Reliance\u2019s good faith. All bidders were treated with impartiality in the same way as Reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">24. The manning table cannot be lifted out of context. Neither can the pre-award meeting be overlooked. The full explanation given plaintiff in the specifications as to all phases of non-discrimination to be observed by the plaintiff makes it clear that it is <em>affirmative action </em>which is the central requirement. The manning table was merely one way of manifesting what affirmative action Reliance proposed; but it was vital when plaintiff put in it language that vitiated the rest of the plaintiff\u2019s plan. Plaintiff prepared an excellent affirmative action plan. It contains 14 separate sections and at least 100 pages. One of these contains the proposed manning table. The fly in the ointment came when plaintiff put these words over the columns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\"><em>\u201cSubject to availability and Referral to Reliance Mechanical Contractors, Inc., of Qualified Journeymen and Apprentices from Pipefitters Local No. 120.\u201d </em>(Plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 17-VII).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">25. That poisoned the very purpose of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII, \u201cEqual Employment Opportunity.\u201d Later other forms of wording were tried, but were also re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>jected. Under the statutes the College was bound by the provisions of the law. Clearly the federal government was bound to enforce equal employment by the College. The College also had to follow the federal directive and reject Reliance\u2019s bid because Reliance had equivocated and tried to pass the buck to Pipefitters Local No. 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">26. It is unfortunate that the College and Reliance are caught in the middle. However, when Reliance bid it knew the law and that it would have to obey the law. This knowledge came to it from the statute and Executive Order No. 11246 and from the College\u2019s specifications. The plaintiff cannot use the manning table as a serious excuse for believing that Reliance may deliberately flout the clear purpose of the law and get away with it. This might well bring down the whole structure of equal opportunity enforcement on this construction job. Central in this disputed point is not the manning table per se. It is the requirement that Reliance give assurance in positive form that it would abide by its affirmative action plan. It knew this before submitting its bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">27. On pages 3-4 of the amended petition plaintiff alleges \u201cthat the sole basis for defendant\u2019s rejection, or threatened rejection of said lowest and best bid * * * was that the lowest and best bidder (Reliance) declined to provide such unlawful \u2018manning table\u2019 to defendants.\u201d This, in the court\u2019s view, is not sustained by the evidence. Reliance <em>did </em>furnish the manning table. But Reliance went beyond the law when it volunteered to include at the head of it the language found in paragraph 24 above. That was what nullified the enforcement provisions of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">28. The College\u2019s bid specifications and course of action to be followed after designating the lowest and best bidder were clear and concise. The College had to follow them. The court cannot find anything vague and indefinite about them. If Reliance did not choose to follow them, then, to escape the federal penalty, it cannot saddle them on the College by calling it the law violator.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">29. Concerning <em>abuse of discretion </em>alleged as to the College, the court observes that Ohio courts are reluctant to disturb the exercise of discretion by a public board un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>less there is some evidence of unreasonable and completely unjustified action. (See quotation in <em>Alliance </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>49 Ohio St. 7, at 22.) Here the court cannot find evidence that the College did abuse its discretion in rejecting Reliance\u2019s bid. After all, the College did so in compliance with city and federal orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">30. In the court\u2019s view, the plaintiff is trying to look two ways at the same time. His amended petition alleges that what the College has done (in not accepting Reliance\u2019s effort to avoid obedience to the requirements of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and allied Executive Order No. 11246 as to non-discrimination) \u201camounts to a gross abuse of discretion <em>conferred upon them by statute * </em>* (Emphasis added.) Here the plaintiff seems to strike directly at the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Order No. 11246. If one says that a statute confers the ability to commit a \u201cgross abuse of discretion,\u201d must a person not conclude that that part of the statute is a nullity and must be put aside by a court of law? But later the plaintiff wraps the same law about him, proclaims that it is he who is defending it and in closing arguments admits that the situation does not reach the issue of unconstitutionality so far as federal law goes.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">31. The court is satisfied that the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII, is constitutional. The Act provides a remedy for a long-continued denial of vital rights of minorities and of every American \u2014 the right to equality before the law \u2014 the right in every walk of life in a land whose philosophy is that \u201call men are created equal,\u201d to an equal chance of employment in keeping with his ability. To assure obedience to the law is a duty inherent in the government. It may reasonably instruct its agencies how to proceed toward enforcement. There has, as the evidence here shows, come a time when firmness must be used against <em>all </em>who do not feel able or inclined to cooperate in the equal employment effort. The statute and the Executive Order implementing it are in the court\u2019s opinion in full keeping with the constitutional guarantees of the rights of all citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">32. In the court\u2019s judgment the evidence does not show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>that the College set up any ratio between Caucasian and any minority group or that it required the low bidder to guarantee to maintain such thing \u2014 a ratio quota system. The plaintiff, under the circumstances, cannot so interpret the evidence and then accuse the College of \u201cuntrammeled discrimination.\u201d In pursuing this thought, plaintiff relies on Title VII of the Act, Order No. 11246, and Sections 153.59, 153.60 and 4112.02, Revised Code. The court believes that in this case the federal statutes amply protect both the plaintiff\u2019s and the College\u2019s rights and that it will serve no useful purpose to pursue further state law. The court recognizes that Ohio law as to equal employment is in full effect, that it does not deprive the plaintiff of any constitutional rights and is valid and binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">33. Plaintiff has offered able and challenging arguments in support of his theory of the case. The court has reviewed these, but is not convinced that the College has violated the federal or state laws as plaintiff suggests. The court cannot consider it likely that the federal government, by its insistence that Reliance has not complied with the laws on equal employment opportunity, has deliberately brought down on the College\u2019s head such a debacle of illegality as plaintiff proposes. The plaintiff states nothing but his built-up conclusion of law and there is not a fact alleged, just a belief which in the court\u2019s view was not proven orally or in the many documents in evidence, all of which the court has reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">34. In this case, the evidence fails to show that the College or any federal official has required \u201cpreferential treatment for any individual or any group for the purpose of achieving racial balance.\u201d (Congressional Record, April 8, 1964, page 6986.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">35. The court seriously questions the fact of \u201ca waste of public funds\u201d alleged in the petition. No oral or documentary evidence of this was offered. It could only' be considered established by accepting plaintiff\u2019s theory of the case, <em>ipso facto. </em>As to \u201cirreparable damage\u201d to plaintiff and other taxpayers, no evidence was offered to prove the same. Plaintiff implies that such damage would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>to be assumed because Reliance, tbe lowest bidder monetarily (but not necessarily the \u201cbest\u201d), lost the contract and <em>ipso facto </em>plaintiff and others suffered irreparable loss. The court cannot accept such an implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">36. The plaintiff\u2019s amended petition does not rely on any conflict between Reliance\u2019s bargaining to hire men exclusively from a union, and its duty to abide by the equality of opportunity effort required of it under state or federal statutes. However he raises this point on page 16 <em>et seq., </em>of his brief. The court is of the opinion, heretofore expressed, that Section 153.591, Revised Code, and the Executive Order of the Governor, dated June 5, 1967, do not violate the United States Constitution, Article VI, Clause 2, but rather support federal law. Reference is made to <em>Quarles </em>v. <em>Philip Morris, Inc. </em>(District Court of Virginia, 1968), 279 F. Supp. 505, and to <em>United States </em>v. <em>Local 109, United Papermakers and Paperworkers </em>(District Court of Louisiana, 1968), 282 F. Supp. 39. The latter case at pages 44-45 says:</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u201cWe cannot accept the Union\u2019s contention that such discrimination is not prohibited by Title VII [1964 Civil Rights Act] and that Title VII cannot be used in any way to alter or affect seniority systems. Where a seniority system has the effect of perpetrating discrimination, and concentrating or \u2018telescoping\u2019 the effect of past years of discrimination against Negro employees into the present placement of Negroes in an inferior position for promotion and other purposes, that present result is prohibited, and a seniority system which operates to produce that present result must be replaced with another system. We agree wholeheartedly with the conclusion in <em>Quarles </em>v. <em>Philip Morris, Inc. </em>(E. D. Va. 1968), 279 F. Supp. 505, that present discrimination cannot be justified under Title VII simply because Title VII refers to an effective date and because present discrimination is caused by conditions in the past. \u2018Congress did not intend to freeze an entire generation of Negro employees into discriminatory patterns that existed before the act.\u2019 <em>Quarles, supra, </em>at 516.\u201d (Pages 44-45)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>37. The court cannot interpret the law as exempting a contractor or labor union from the requirements of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or its expanding Executive Orders, or from state statutes which fight discrimination, because they bargained, say, under the National Labor Relations Act, before the non-discrimination statutes were enacted. The purpose to assure equal employment opportunities is paramount.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">In summary, the court holds that the College did not abuse its discretion. The bid specifications were sufficient, they set up definite standards, and were fair to all bidders. The rejection of Reliance\u2019s bid was legal and justified because of Reliance\u2019s refusal to comply with federal statutes compelling a positive assurance of equal employment opportunities. For the reason given the court dismisses plaintiff\u2019s prayer for a restraining order and renders judgment for the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
