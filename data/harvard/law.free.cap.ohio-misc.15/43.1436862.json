Growing out of an automobile accident of December 14, 1965, Elmer Copeland and Ardell Copeland have filed their complaint against defendants (Smith companies) and their truck driver, in which damages are claimed due to defendants\u2019 negligence. In the first cause of action plaintiff, Elmer Copeland, claims that he sustained personal injuries, including a permanent loss of a portion of his sexual capacity. In the second cause of action, while making no claim of personal injuries, plaintiff Ardell Copeland, his wife, asserts that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-14\">\u201cshe has been deprived of the services, help, aid, assistance, and of the marital consortium of and with her husband, Elmer Copeland, which, previous to December 14, 1965, he had done for and rendered to her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-15\">Urging dismissal on the ground that the second cause of action does not state a claim, defendants state that under the law of Ohio the wife has no cause of action for the loss of her husband\u2019s services, aid, assistance, and consortium. Defendants say that the controlling law of Ohio is stated in the syllabus of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Nicholas Building Co. </em>(1915), 93 Ohio St. 101. This reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>\u201cA wife has no right of action against a person for the loss of the consortium of her husband caused by personal injuries sustained by him through the negligence of such person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Plaintiffs urge that <em>Erie R. Co. </em>v. <em>Tompkins </em>(1938), 304 U. S. 64, while recognizing the pre-eminence of \u201cthe unwritten law of the state as declared by its highest court,\u201d makes an exception \u201cwhere the Constitution, treaties, or statutes [of the United States] otherwise require or provide.\u201d It is contended that the plaintiff-wife has a constitutionally protected federal right to claim damages for loss of her husband\u2019s consortium caused by a tort-feasor\u2019s negligence. Entitled to equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment the wife, it is argued, similarly should be permitted to recover for the loss of her husband\u2019s consortium when caused by a tort-feasor\u2019s negligence. Supporting this argument plaintiff cites <em>Clem </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(Paulding Cy. C. P. 1965), 3 Ohio Misc. 167, and <em>Umpleby </em>v. <em>Dorsey </em>(Stark Cy., C. P. 1967), 10 Ohio Misc. 288. As Judge Hitchcock put it in <em>Clem, supra, </em>at 173:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">\u201cI must conclude that if negligent injury to the wife raises a cause of action in consortium to the husband, equal protection requires a similar cause of action to the wife for negligent injury to her husband.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The validity of this premise of <em>Clem, supra, </em>and <em>Umpleby, supra, </em>needs to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Underlying <em>Smith v. Nicholas Building, supra, </em>and <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Board of Commissioners of Franklin County </em>(1939), 135 Ohio St. 435, is the point, recently reiterated in <em>Crowe </em>v. <em>Bumford </em>(Marion Cy., 1968), 13 Ohio App. 2d 208, that a husband has no right to recover for loss of his wife\u2019s consortium in a negligence action independent of a right of recovery for his wife\u2019s loss of services. Thus, in <em>Crowe, supra, </em>at 211, it was determined that \u201cthere being no evidence- of any compensable loss of services upon the part of the husband, there can be no recovery for loss of consortium.\u201d Since a husband in Ohio does not have an independent right of action for the loss of his wife\u2019s consortium, manifestly equal protection of the laws would not in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>event require \u201ca similar cause of action to the wife for negligent injury to her husband,\u201d <em>Clem, supra, </em>at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint in the present action speaks of the wife\u2019s deprivation of the \u201cservices of her husband.\u201d A further question arises as to the legal sufficiency of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Both <em>Clem, supra, </em>and <em>Umpleby, supra, </em>speak only of a wife\u2019s claimed right of loss of her husband\u2019s consortium \u2014not loss of his services. Indeed, <em>Clem, supra, </em>struck the word \u201cservices,\u201d noting that \u201cthe husband is suing for his own loss of earnings.\u201d Similarly, 28 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d, Husband and Wife, Section 142, at 267-68, makes it clear that the Ohio rule is that a wife:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">\u201ccannot recover for loss of his services, because the husband himself is entitled to recover full compensation for the diminution of his earning capacity and subsequent ability to support her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The viability of this principle continues. The husband\u2019s right to claim loss of earnings and impairment of his earning capacity due to the negligence of another is not limited to his employment away from home. This right to damages also may reflect impairment of his physical ability to continue to mow the lawn, to replace a faucet washer, or to do other work about the home. As part of his damages he is entitled also to reimbursement for his own medical expenses. The \u201crights of man\u201d would not be furthered if these claims of the husband were to be split off to give the wife the right to claim loss of her husband\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">It may be that the time is at hand when Ohio should consider whether Ohio\u2019s Married Women\u2019s Act, Section 3103.05, Revised Code, freshly construed, should eliminate or at least restrict the anachronism of the husband\u2019s right to claim loss of his wife\u2019s services. A wife is entitled to her earnings lost from job impairment, negligently caused, when she works away from home. See <em>Hrvatin </em>v. <em>Cleveland Ry. Co. </em>(Cuy. Co. 1942), 69 Ohio App. 499. Should she not also be entitled to incorporate in her elements of damages monies she expended in hiring others to perform her domestic services, and for her medical expenses?</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Whether apart from loss of services the Supreme Court of Ohio should reconsider its long standing conclusion that there is no independent right for negligent interference with the martial relation (consortium), is a question for that court. Should it do so a constitutional claim of unequal protection of laws would only then arise should the right of interference with the marital function be accorded only to the husband, rather than jointly to the husband and wife as in <em>Deems </em>v. <em>Western Maryland Ry. Co. </em>(Md. 1967), 231 A. 2d 514. Deciding the federal question now presented it is determined that Ohio law as pronounced in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Nicholas Building Go., supra, </em>does not offend the Fourteenth Amendment. This decision rather than <em>Clem, supra, </em>is still recognized as the law of Ohio, see <em>Ganoe </em>v. <em>Stoner, </em>Civ. No. 837 (Lake Co. Ct. App.), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\">\u201cThe request on the part of the appellant, Doris Ann Ganoe, is that this court determine that <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Nicholas Building Company, </em>93 Ohio St. 101, is no longer the law of Ohio. In that case the court determined that: \u2018A wife has no right of action against a person for the loss of the consortium of her husband caused by personal injuries sustained by him through the negligence of such person.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">\u201cThis court does not believe that a subordinate court should decide so important a policy matter. We must, on the authority of the above named case, sustain the judgment of the trial court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">This court must apply the law of the forum state in accordance with <em>Erie R. </em>v. <em>Tompkins, supra. </em>This court, like the Lake County Court of Appeals, recognizes and follows the Ohio Supreme Court decision of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Nicholas Building Co., supra. </em>Accordingly, the second cause of action, applicable only to plaintiff Ardell Copeland, is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
