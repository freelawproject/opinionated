Following his indictment by a federal grand jury, Joseph pleaded guilty to 41 of the 46 counts with which he was charged: one count of conspiring to defraud the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>United States government, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 286; twenty-four counts of filing false claims against the government, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287; one count of conspiring to commit mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 1349; and fifteen counts of theft of government property, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641. The counts to which Joseph pleaded guilty involved $173,016-in false refund claims, of which the IRS actually disbursed $37,196.27. Before sentencing, the district court entered a preliminary order of forfeiture under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461 for $29,514.91 in currency seized by government officials, which were the proceeds of Joseph\u2019s fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">Joseph\u2019s presentence investigation report (PSR) calculated a sentencing guidelines range of 51 to 63 months imprisonment and concluded that the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act of 1996 (MVRA), -18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A, required Joseph to pay $37,196.27 in restitution to the IRS. He objected to the PSR on numerous grounds, including the restitution amount not being reduced by the value of the funds forfeited to the government. The government countered that it was entitled to obtain the full amount of restitution and also the full amount of forfeiture because-they are both mandatory and serve distinct purposes\u2014 punishment in the case of forfeiture, compensation in the case of restitution. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-5\">At sentencing, Joseph reiterated his request that the $37,196.27 in restitution owed to the IRS be offset by the $29,514.91 subject to the preliminary order of forfeiture. The government again responded that Joseph was not- entitled to that offset 'because forfeiture and restitution are \u201c[t]wo separate matters.\u201d The district court initially seemed to agree with the government\u2019s position; it orally sentenced Joseph to 63 months imprisonment and ordered him to pay $37,196.27 in restitution to the IRS. At the end of the sentence hearing, however, the court stated that Joseph\u2019s restitution obligation would be offset by the $29,514.91 in funds already forfeited to the government, leaving a restitution balance of $7,681.36. The government objected to the court\u2019s ruling that the amount of forfeited funds be applied to partially satisfy Joseph\u2019s restitution obligation, reiterating its contention that forfeiture and restitution are \u201ctwo separate things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-7\">After the sentence hearing, the government submitted a \u201cNotice of Filing\u201d expressing \u201cconcern regarding the clarity of the record on the issue of forfeiture and restitution ordered at the time of sentencing.\u201d It asserted that, under the statutes governing restitution and forfeiture, the district court had no authority to offset the restitution amount by the value of forfeited funds; instead, the decision of what should be. done with the forfeited funds was left to the discretion of the United States Attorney General. The government asked the court to clarify its ruling regarding restitution in its written judgment. The district court, without explicitly addressing the government\u2019s objection or filing, later entered its written judgment, ordering Joseph to pay $37,196.27 in restitution to the IRS and directing the forfeiture of the $29,514.91 seized by government officials with no mention of the restitution amount being offset by the forfeited funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-8\">Joseph then filed a motion to clarify and amend the written judgment, noting that it did not conform to the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement at sentencing that the forfeited funds would be credited toward his restitution obligation. The district court denied the motion, stating that the judgment was \u201ccorrect as written\u201d and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>forfeited funds \u201cshall not be applied to [Joseph\u2019s] restitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-6\">Joseph contends that- we should direct the district court to amend the written judgment to conform to its oral pronouncement at sentencing that the $29,514.91 in forfeited funds would be applied toward his restitution obligation. He- asserts that the district court not only- had the authority to offset the restitution amount by the amount of the forfeited funds, but that it properly did so in its oral pronouncements at sentencing because the aim of restitution is to make the victim, whole, and, without the forfeiture offset, it is unlikely that he will ever be able to satisfy the full restitution amount.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1373-7\">Joseph relies on the rule, which we inherited from our predecessor court, that when an oral pronouncement of a sentence unambiguously conflicts with a written judgment, the oral pronouncement controls. <em>See United States v. Bonilla, </em>579 F.3d 1233, 1245 (11th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Bates, </em>213 F.3d 1336, 1340 (11th Cir.2000); <em>Patterson v. United States, </em>386 F.2d 142, 142-43 (5th Cir.1967).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although we have sometimes stated this rule, in categorical terms, as if it were an inexorable command, there is a longstanding exception to it when an oral pronouncement is contrary to law. For example, in <em>Walker v. United States Parole Commission, </em>592 F.2d 905, 906-07 (5th Cir.1979), we refused to give effect to the district court\u2019s oral directive, which was not contained in its written judgment, that the def\u00e9ndant\u2019s term of special parole would \u201ccommence upon the defendant\u2019s release from confinement\u201d despite the general rule that \u201cdiscrepancies in sentencing are to be resolved in favor of unambiguous oral pronouncements.\u201d We did so because that oral directive was inconsistent with the plain language of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(c), which mandated a special parole term \u201cin addition to, not in lieu of,\u201d the defendant\u2019s general parole term. <em>Id. </em>at 906. And in <em>Scott v. United States, </em>434 F.2d 11, 20 (5th Cir.1970), we similarly explained that \u201cregardless of what the federal judge either said or wrote as to when the [defendant\u2019s] federal sentence would begin, Congress itself has legislated on that precise subject. It is beyoiid'the power of any judge ... to vary the terms of that statute.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-10\">That exception applies in this case be.cause under the plain language of the MVRA and the applicable forfeiture provisions, the district court had no authority to offset the amount of restitution owed to the IRS by the amount of the funds Joseph forfeited to the government. For designated offenses, including those involving fraud or where an identifiable victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>has sustained a pecuniary loss, the MVRA requires a district court to \u201corder restitution to each victim in the <em>full amount of each victim\u2019s losses </em>as determined by the court and without consideration of-the economic circumstances of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A) (emphasis, added); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 3668A(a)(l), (c)(1). The court must order full restitution \u201cin addition to ... any other penalty authorized by law,\u201d id. \u00a7 3663A(a)(l), and \u201c[i]n no case shall the fact that a victim has received or is entitled to receive compensation with respect to a loss from insurance <em>or any other source </em>be considered in determining the amount of restitution,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3664(f)(1)(B) (emphasis added). ' The MVR\u00c1 permits a reduction in a restitution order only for an \u201camount later recovered as compensatory damages for the same loss by the victim in\u201d a federal or state civil proceeding. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3664(j)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-4\">In addition to the restitution mandated by the MVRA, federal law also requires a district court to order the forfeiture of any property traceable to certain criminal offenses. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 981(a)(1) (providing that property traceable to certain criminal violations is \u201csubject to forfeiture to the United States\u201d); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461(c) (providing that if a defendant is convicted of an offense for which civil or criminal forfeiture of- property is authorized, \u201cthe court shall order the forfeiture of the property as part of the sentence in the criminal case\u201d). Once property has been ordered forfeited, \u201c[t]he Attorney General shall have sole responsibility for disposing of petitions for remission or mitigation with respect to [the] property,\u201d and is authorized to either \u201cretain [the] property forfeited ... or to transfer such property on such terms'and conditions as he may determine,\u201d including \u201cas restoration to any victim- of the offense giving rise to the forfeiture.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(d), (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-5\">We have held that a defendant is not entitled to offset the amount of restitution owed to a victim by the value of property forfeited to the government, or vice versa, because restitution and forfeiture serve distinct purposes. <em>See United States v. Bane, </em>720 F.3d- 818, 827 n. 8 (11th Cir.2013) (rejecting a defendant\u2019s argument that his restitution order should have been offset by the amount forfeited to the government); <em>United States v. Hoffman-Vaile, 5</em>68 F.3d 1335, 1344 (11th Cir.2009) (rejecting a defendant\u2019s <em>argument </em>that her forfeiture amount should have been reduced by the amount of restitution paid). While restitution seeks to make victims whole by reimbursing them for their losses, forfeiture is meant to punish the defendant by transferring his ill-gotten gains to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). <em>See United States v. Browne, </em>505 F.3d 1229, 1281 (11th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Venturella, </em>585 F.3d 1013, 1019-20 (7th Cir.2009); <em>see also Libretti v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 29, 39, 116 S.Ct. 356, 363, 133 L.Ed.2d 271 (1995) (\u201cCongress conceived of forfeiture as punishment for the commission of [certain] crimes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-6\">In light of the statutory framework governing restitution and forfeiture, we hold that a district court generally has no authority to offset a defendant\u2019s restitution obligation by the value of forfeited property held by the government, which is consistent with the approach taken by the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>610 F.3d 1216, 1232 (10th Cir.2010) (concluding that \u201cthe plain language of the MVRA ... prohibits a district court from considering the value of defendant\u2019s forfeited property in initially determining- the full amount of restitution,\u201d and further explaining that the MVRA makes \u201cclear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>that funds the victims have <em>not </em>received cannot reduce or offset the amount of losses the defendant is required to repay\u201d) (quotation marks omitted); <em>United States v. McCracken, </em>487 F.3d 1125, 1128-29 (8th Cir.2007) (\u201c[T]he district court has no discretion to adjust the total restitution due to the victim based on funds held by law enforcement.\u201d); <em>United States v. Bright, </em>353 F.3d 1114, 1120 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201c[UJn-der the MVRA the district court could not have reduced or offset Bright\u2019s [restitution] obligation \u2014 certainly not for forfeited funds not paid over to his victims.... \u201d); <em>United States v. Alalade, </em>204 F.3d 536, 540 (4th Cir.2000) (\u201c[T]he plain language of the MVRA [does] not grant the district court discretion to reduce the amount of restitution required to be ordered by an amount equal to the value of the property seized ... and retained by the government in administrative forfeiture.\u201d); <em>United States v. Emerson, </em>128 F.3d 557, 566-67 (7th Cir.1997) (declaring that a sentencing court has the statutory authority to impose both restitution and forfeiture, and that there is no legal authority to offset one from the other).</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">As we have already noted, the MVRA expressly requires a district court to order restitution in the full amount of a victim\u2019s losses and specifically prohibits the court from reducing that amount by the value of any other compensation received by the victim before entry of the restitution order. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1). Given that, \u201cit would be nonsensical for the district court to have discretion to reduce the amount of restitution by the value of property seized from the defendant and retained by the government in [ ] forfeiture.\u201d <em>Alalade, </em>204 F.3d at 540. The plain language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(d) and (e) also makes clear that the Attorney General alone- has discretion to determine whether to retain forfeited property or apply it toward the restitution owed to the victims of a defendant\u2019s offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-8\">While the MVRA does permit a reduction in a restitution order for amounts \u201clater recovered as, compensatory damages for the same loss by the victim in\u201d a federal or .state civil proceeding, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(j)(2), that provision has no application in this case for two reasons. First, \u00a7 3664(j)(2) applies only \u201cto compensatory damages recovered by a victim in a .civil proceeding <em>after </em>a court enters a restitution order,\u201d <em>United States v. Ruff, </em>420 F.3d 772, 775 (8th Cir.2005) (emphasis added), not when the court is initially ordering restitution for the victim\u2019s losses. <em>See Alalade, </em>204 F.3d at 540 n. 4 (explaining that \u00a7 3664(j)(2) \u201conly comes into play after the district court has already ordered restitution in the full amount of the victim\u2019s loss\u201d). Second, even assuming that the forfeiture of ..Joseph\u2019s funds could be construed as \u201ccompensatory damages,\u201d which we seriously doubt given the punitive nature of forfeiture, the Attorney General has not exercised his discretion to transfer those funds to the IRS, the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>of Joseph\u2019s fraud. <em>See Bright, </em>353 F.3d at 1122-23 (\u201c[W]hatever offsets might be due when a defendant\u2019s funds have been forfeited and paid to the victims .. the MVRA provisions [ ] make clear that funds the victims have <em>not </em>received cannot reduce or offset-the amount of losses the defendant. is required to repay.\u201d). Although the Attorney General and the IRS are both part of the federal government, they are distinct entities: . <em>Cf. United States v. Taylor, </em>582 F.3d 558, 566 (5th Cir.2009) (holding that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the victim of the defendant\u2019s fraud, \u201cis a distinct entity from the Department of Justice,\u201d which is headed by the Attorney General); <em>Emerson, </em>128 F.3d at 567^68 (holding that the United States Postal Service is \u201can entity distinct\u201d from the Department of Justice because it is \u201can independent establishment of the executive branch\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">Because the district court had no authority to offset Joseph\u2019s restitution obligation by the amount of funds forfeited to the. government, its oral pronouncement directing such an offset was contrary to law. For that reason, Joseph cannot avail himself of the general rule that a discrepancy between an oral pronouncement at sentencing and a written judgment is to be resolved in favor of- the oral pronouncement. <em>See Walker, </em>592 F.2d at 906. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s written judgment, which properly declined to offset the-amount of restitution owed to the IRS by the funds Joseph forfeited to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1373-8\">. Joseph also contends that the government has' waived any challenge to the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement-at sentencing because it purportedly failed to contemporaneously object to the court\u2019s directive that the forfeited funds would be applied toward the restitution amount. That contention. is unfounded. The government persistently argued \u2014 before, during, and immediately after sentencing \u2014 that the district court could not offset Joseph\u2019s restitution obligation by the amount of the forfeited funds. And the government is not challenging the oral pronouncement in this appeal; Joseph, the appellant, is challenging the written judgment\u2019s failure to offset his restitution obligation by the amount of the forfeited funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1373-12\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1375-6\">. In support of his contention that the district court had the authority to order the offset, Joseph relies on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(c), which provides that \"[plroperty taken or detained under this section . .. shall be deemed to be in the custody of the Attorney General ... <em>subject only to the orders and decrees of the court </em>or the official having jurisdiction thereof.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(c) (emphasis added). That provision, however, refers to property seiz\u00e9d before a forfeiture order has been entered. Subsections (d) and (e) of that same statute make it apparent that after a district court orders seized property forfeited, the Attorney General has sole authority to determine whether that property will be transferred \u201cas restoration to any victim of the offense.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 981(d), (e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1376-15\">. We need not decide whether a defendant would be entitled to a credit against his restitution obligation when the victim of his offense has received the value of forfeited property from the DOJ. While the MVRA does not specifically contemplate a reduction in restitution in such instances, at least one circuit has concluded -that an offset would be required to prevent the victim from receiving a double, recovery for a single loss. <em>See Ruff, </em>420 F.3d at 775 (holding that while it , is doubtful that forfeiture proceeds actually recovered by a victim could be credited against the defendant\u2019s restitution obligation under \u00a7 3663(j)(2), the \"bar against double recovery should operate [in such a case] to preclude the [victim] from recovering an amount greater\u201d than his or her loss); <em>see also United States v. Huff, </em>609 F.3d 1240, 1249 (11th Cir.2010) (\"Restitution is not intended to provide a windfall for crime victims but rather to ensure that victims, to the- greatest extent possible, are made whole for their losses.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). In this case, the victim of Joseph\u2019s fraud \u2014 the IRS \u2014 has yet to recoup any of its losses from the forfeited funds held by the DOJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
