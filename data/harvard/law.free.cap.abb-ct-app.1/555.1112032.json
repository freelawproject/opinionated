That section is intended of notices which fix the time for an act to be done by or against the party to whom the notice has been given. It is also applied to the case of service of pleadings, &amp;c., where the statute allows a certain time thereafter to amend. Evans v. Lichtenstein, 9 <em>Abb. Pr, N. S. </em>141.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b566-13\"> As to the application of this rule to several actions, see Richardson v. White, 27 <em>How. Pr. </em>155, and cases cited. Adams <em>v. </em>Bush, 2 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>N. S. 112; Davis <em>v. </em>Duffie, 3 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b566-7\">Bronson, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhRf\">As the notice of justifying was served by mail, it should have been double tim\u00e9, or ten days. If the appellant had not sufficient time to give regular notice by mail, he should either have caused personal service to be made, or should have obtained a judge\u2019s order enlarging the time. As the notice was irregular, the justification amounts to nothing. But there is ground for granting relief, and the appeal will not be dismissed if the sureties justify within thirty days, and the appellant pays the costs of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">If the sureties justify, all further proceedings on the appeal should be stayed until the costs of the former appeal are paid. Two successive appeals in the same case, like two actions for the same cause, tend to <em>vexation; </em>and we think this branch of .the motion should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
