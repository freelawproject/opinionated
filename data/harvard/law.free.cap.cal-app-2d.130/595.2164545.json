CITY OF LOS ANGELES, Appellant.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b615-9\">Roger Arnebergh, City Attorney, Bourke Jones, Assistant City Attorney, Edwin F.

The motion was \u201cgranted upon the ground of insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict and judgment.\u201d It is the city\u2019s position that \u201cthere is no evidence from which any inference may be drawn that there was any negligence in the operation of the police car\u201d involved in this accident. The record does not sustain the city\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">Plaintiff, while a passenger on a westbound Transit Lines bus, occupied the first space near the front door on a seat running lengthwise. She was on the right or north side <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>of the bus facing south. Because of a sudden stop, plaintiff struck the right side of her forehead against a metal post adjacent to her seat and received injuries for which she seeks damages from the city. She executed and delivered to the Transit Lines a covenant not to sue, for which she received $810.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The accident occurred at approximately 7 p. m. on December 12, 1950. The bus in which plaintiff was riding was traveling west on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. It stopped at the intersection of Madison Avenue and Melrose to load and unload passengers. When the bus started up it proceeded westward on Melrose in the lane of traffic \u201cnearest the curb.\u201d When the bus was some 50 to 100 feet beyond Madison Avenue, witness Meyer, who was seated alongside the plaintiff, facing south, observed an automobile \u201ccut quite sharply in front of the bus; that is, moving from left to right . . . Towards the north curb.\u201d The collision took place an instant later \u201cin the lane closest to the north curb,\u201d which was \u201cthe lane the bus had been proceeding along from the very beginning.\u201d The witness left the bus in a moment or two and saw the car in front of the bus. That this was the car that cut in front of the bus is made clear from the following questions and answers on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As7\">\u201cQ. Did you see the car which you saw cut in front of the bus at any time prior to the time the bus driver applied the brakes on the bus? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">\u201cQ. Where was the car when you had seen it prior to the time the bus driver applied the- brakes ? A. It was in the process of passing the bus on its left lane and cutting in front of the bus towards the north curb; that is, toward the lane on the inside, near the north curb . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">\u201cQ. Did you see any other automobile besides the one that was stopped in front of the bus that you saw after the collision ? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">\u201cQ. The only automobile you saw, to your best recollection, now, was the bus in which you were riding as a passenger and the automobile which was stopped in front of the bus after the collision; is that correct? A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">On redirect the following transpired:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\">\u201cQ. Mr. Meyer, did you look at any time after the bus started out from this stop out the window directly across from you, that is, in the direction you were facing? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-10\">\u201cQ. Did you observe at any time between the time the bus started on and the time of the collision any cars coming from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>a general southerly direction onto Melrose Avenue? A. I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">\u201cQ. That is, coining from the south and heading north? A. I couldn\u2019t say that I noticed any. I did not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The plaintiff, after testifying that she was \u201csitting up near the front of the bus on the right side directly behind the door . . . facing the opposite side of the bus,\u201d stated that after the bus crossed Madison Avenue and proceeded on westward on Melrose she observed a car which \u201cseemed . . . to come from the rear of the bus.\u201d It seemed to her \u201cto be dangerously close to the bus.\u201d That is what caused her \u201cattention to focus on it.\u201d She could see the top of the ear through the window on the left side of the bus. She watched the car because \u201cit seemed to be getting closer to the bus, and . . . that it was much too close\u2014about a foot away.\u201d She observed the car until the front of its top was up where the bus driver was sitting\u2014opposite him. The car then disappeared from her view. The collision happened \u201calmost immediately\u201d after she last saw the automobile. \u201cThe impact and the application of the brakes seemed to be almost simultaneous.\u201d The stop was sudden, throwing her forward against a metal upright post and causing her injury. When plaintiff got out of the bus the passenger car was \u201cdirectly in front of\u201d and \u201cvery close\u201d to the bus. While it appeared there had been contact between the two vehicles, they were not then touching.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The passenger car was owned by the city of Los Angeles and was occupied by two police officers in civilian clothes, one of whom was driving. It was equipped with a stoplight of the type approved by the California Highway Patrol. The officers were not on any emergency duty. The city is liable, however, for any damage caused by the negligent operation of one of its motor vehicles by an officer, agent or employee\u2014when acting within the scope of his office, agency or employment. (Yeh. Code, \u00a7 400.) This section is the basis for the asserted liability of the city in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">It is unnecessary, of course, to recite defendant\u2019s version of this collision since the action of the trial court in granting plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial must be sustained if there is any evidence from which a reasonable inference may be drawn that the police officers were negligent in the operation of the city\u2019s automobile, and that such negligence was a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury. <em>(Ballard </em>v. <em>Pacific Greyhound Lines, </em>28 Cal.2d 357, 358 [170 P.2d 465].)</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>We must accept as true the foregoing testimony for, the purpose of testing the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling. It thus appears that as the city\u2019s vehicle passed the center of the bus it was dangerously close and seemed to get nearer as it reached the front of the bus; that it cut quite sharply in front of the bus moving toward the north curb; that the collision took place an instant later in the traffic lane nearest the curb in which the bus had been traveling since it stopped to load and unload passengers at the intersection of Madison and Melrose Avenues; and that no other motor vehicles were seen in the immediate vicinity by these witnesses.  From this evidence the trier of the facts could reasonably draw an inference that the driver of the city\u2019s automobile negligently cut in front of the bus and that such negligence was a proximate cause of the accident and plaintiff\u2019s injuries. It was not, therefore, an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion to grant plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial. <em>(Ballard </em>v. <em>Pacific Greyhound Lines, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Moore, P. J., and McComb, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
