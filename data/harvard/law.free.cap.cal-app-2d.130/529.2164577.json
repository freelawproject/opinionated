On that day, the three defendants entered pleas of \u201cnot guilty\u201d and date for trial was set. On the trial date on motion of defendants, count II of the information was amended to charge statutory rape. Each defendant then withdrew his plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d and entered a plea of \u201cguilty as charged in Count 2 of Information A, as amended.\u201d The cause of each defendant was referred to the probation department for report and hearing thereon set for August 11, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">On that date present counsel of record was substituted into the case for defendant Hunt. The motion of said defendant for change of plea was denied; probation was denied, and he was sentenced to state prison as to count II. Count I was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">Defendant Hunt here appeals from the judgment of conviction and from the denial of his motion to set aside his plea of guilty.' He urges error by the trial court in denying such motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">\u201cA defendant who desires to have his plea of guilty set aside must show good cause therefor. The granting or denial of such an application is a matter resting in the sound discretion of the trial judge whose decision will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse thereof. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tidwell, 108 </em>Cal.App.2d 60, 63 [238 P.2d 21]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Price, </em>51 Cal.App.2d 716, 718 [125 P.2d 529]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Grif</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number><em>fin, </em>100 Cal.App.2d 546 [224 P.2d 47].)\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Broady, </em>120 Cal.App.2d 901, 903 [262 P.2d 669].</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Also, as stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>123 Cal.App.2d 353, 355, 356 [266 P.2d 566]: \u201cHe (defendant) was attended by his counsel when he changed his plea to \u2018guilty.\u2019 He was catechised by the deputy district attorney in the presence of the court as to his reasons, and he assured the court he did so because he was guilty and that he made the change voluntarily. . . . Such a plea is an admission of every element of the offense charged, and constitutes a conclusive admission of defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>(Ibid; People </em>v. <em>Tidwell, </em>108 Cal.App.2d 60, 63 [238 P.2d 21]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>100 Cal.App.2d 546, 548 [224 P.2d 47]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>70 Cal.App.2d 553, 561 [161 P.2d 401]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>140 Cal.App. 616 [36 P.2d 194].)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\u201cWhile a plea of guilty may be withdrawn pursuant to Penal Code section 1018 by reason of the mistake, ignorance, inadvertence or any factor that overcame the defendant\u2019s exercise of a free judgment, the basis of the motion for relief \u2018must be established bv clear and convincing evidence.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Moreover, the reviewing court is justified in concluding that the motion was properly denied where it is shown that the accused \u2018acted with knowledge of the facts and on advice of his counsel.\u2019 In any event, the granting of such a motion rests in the sound discretion of the court. <em>(Ibid.)\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">The record discloses the following proceeding at the time appellant changed Ms plea from \u201cnot guilty\u201d to \u201cguilty\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">\u201cMr. Gerecht: The defendant, Eoy James Hunt, requests permission to withdraw Ms plea to Count II of the Information and plead guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-11\">\u2018 \u2018 The Court: That is your desire, Mr. Hunt ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-12\">\u201cDefendant Hunt: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-13\">\u2018 \u2018 The Court: If I were to ask you the same questions that I asked your first co-defendant, you would answer in the same way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-14\">\u201cDefendant Hunt: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-15\">\u201cThe Court: You are doing this freely and willingly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-16\">\u201cDefendant Hunt: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-17\">\u201cThe Court: No one has made you any promise about probation, have they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-18\">\u201cDefendant Hunt: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-19\">\u201cThe Court: Leave is granted. The plea heretofore entered is withdrawn. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>\u201cMr. Howard (Deputy District Attorney): Roy James Hunt, is that your true name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">\u201cDefendant Hunt: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">\u201cMr. Howard: In Information No. 164325-A, as amended, Count II, you are charged with a felony, that of statutory rape. To that charge, how do you plead?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">\u201cDefendant Hunt: Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">\u201cThe Court: All right, probation and sentence August 11, 1954 at 9 :30 a.m. The Defendant is remanded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">The questions asked of appellant\u2019s first codefendant and his answers thereto, above referred to by the trial court, are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-10\">\u201cQ. By the Court: You have talked this over very carefully and fully with your counsel and decided to withdraw your plea of not guilty and plead guilty to the statutory rape charge? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-11\">\u201cQ. No one has made you any promise about any sentence or probation? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-12\">\u201cQ. You fully realize what you are doing? A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">In the circumstances presented, no abuse of discretion appears on the part of the trial court in denying appellant\u2019s motion to set aside his plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">The order denying the motion of appellant for a change of plea having been made before judgment may be reviewed on an appeal therefrom. It is not an appealable order. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ottenstror, </em>127 Cal.App.2d 105, 111 [273 P.2d 289].)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-15\">The attempted appeal from the order denying appellant\u2019s motion to set aside his plea of guilty is dismissed. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-16\">White, P. J., and Doran, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-17\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 3, 1955.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
