The record shows that while the two were seated on the side of their bed appellant fired five shots at his wife thereby killing her. He then fired one bullet into his own head. An officer testified at the preliminary hearing that appellant stated to him that before shooting \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any quarrel. She just wasn\u2019t treating him right. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Appellant\u2019s first contention is that by reason of the self-inflicted wound in his head he was not able to understand the proceedings, or as he puts it \u201cwas mentally absent from the entire proceeding.\u201d The record shows that appellant was examined by two court-appointed psychiatrists who found that he \u201cunderstands the nature of the charges against him and the possible punishments therefor. . . . Accused was oriented for time, place and person. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Appellant\u2019s claim that there was no sworn complaint charging him with murder is contrary to the record. The record shows a sworn complaint, a full preliminary hearing, a holding to answer, an information, an original plea of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity, the withdrawal of those pleas and a plea of guilty. Appellant was at all times represented by the public defender.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Appellant claims that he was not allowed a trial by jury, the production of witnesses or the right to prove that the killing was in self-defense. His plea of guilty to the charge of murder is an answer to all of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">In fixing the degree the court had before it the testimony taken at the preliminary hearing from which the court concluded that he \u201cis of the opinion that the murder is murder of the first degree.\u201d The record supports this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Appellant\u2019s statement that he was denied the right to counsel is answered by the record. He was represented by the public defender and made no objection to that representation before the trial court. His claim that he was denied the right of appeal is futile in view of his plea of guilty and the support in the record for the order fixing the degree of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Appellant appears in propria persona and his arguments are quite confused. We have examined the record in the light of this fact and find nothing therein to entitle him to the relief sought. We have thought it advisable to treat appellant\u2019s contentions on their merits without regard to whether <em>coram nobis </em>is the proper remedy. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Adamson, </em>34 Cal.2d 320 [210 P.2d 13].)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">Nourse, P. J., and Kaufman, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 16, 1955.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
