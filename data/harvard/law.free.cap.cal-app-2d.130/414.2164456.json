No reporter\u2019s transcript having been furnished, the recitals in the judgment and the findings of fact must be deemed true, and are binding upon this court <em>(Rinker </em>v. <em>McKinley, </em>65 Cal.App.2d 109 [149 P.2d 859]).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">The facts are as follows: Petitioner obtained a judgment against the real party in interest in this case, who claimed to be his wife. She will hereafter be referred to as \u201cdefendant. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">Writ of execution on the judgment was given to the sheriff of Los Angeles County, with instructions to levy upon and to sell a one-half interest in real property owned by defendant. The other half interest was owned by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">Defendant advised the sheriff that she had a homestead upon the property. In her declaration of homestead she alleged that she was the wife of petitioner, that she was the head of a family, that she claimed the homestead for her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>benefit and for her husband, and that he had not declared a homestead upon the property. Prior to that defendant had recorded another declaration of homestead upon the same property, containing substantially the same recitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">When the sheriff was so advised he refused to proceed with the sale of the property. Petitioner brought this action for a writ of mandate directing the sheriff to sell the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The court found and adjudged that defendant was not, and never had been married to petitioner, that a marriage ceremony between the parties in Mexico was invalid, and that petitioner was entitled to a peremptory writ of mandate, directing the sheriff to sell the property under the writ of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Petitioner contends that this case comes squarely within the rule declared in <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Ervin, </em>86 Cal.App.2d 386 [194 P.2d 809]. In that case it was held that although a liberal construction should be given, when a declaration of homestead contains a statement as to an essential requirement that the declarant knew to be false it is not good.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Defendant relies upon the case of <em>Feintech </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>50 Cal.App.2d 181 [122 P.2d 606]. In that case a mother who was living with an adult son upon the premises to be homesteaded filled in blanks in a printed form for the head of a family. Disregarding the recital that the declarant was the head of a family, sufficient recitals appeared in the declaration to make a good claim for homestead by one not the head of a family.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">In this case the declaration is made by the wife as head of the family for the benefit of herself and her husband. It has uniformly been held that such a declaration by a wife which fails to state every requirement specified in the code is fatally defective. <em>(Crenshaw </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>74 Cal.App.2d 255 [168 P.2d 752]; <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Union Savings Bank, </em>148 Cal. 157 [82 P. 768]; <em>Cunha </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>122 Cal. 111 [54 P. 535, 68 Am.St.Rep. 27].)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">To hold that the declaration in this case is sufficient to claim a homestead by one not the head of a family would be to carry the doctrine of liberality applied in the Feintech case too far.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">There is nothing in the record to support defendant\u2019s further contention that an appeal from petitioner\u2019s judgment stayed the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-14\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-15\">White, P. J., and Doran, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
