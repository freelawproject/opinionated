Sixty days had elapsed, the information having been filed March 4 of that year. But, as the record shows, continuances from March 8 to March 10 and to April 7 were made \u201cwith consent of counsel\u201d; thereafter, from April 7 to May 7, to May 26, to June 7, \u201cwith consent of respective counsel.\u201d The continuances from March 8 through March 10 to April 7 were presumably with consent of counsel for each party, because the minutes show that both counsel were present upon each of those occasions. Even if it be not so presumed, the period from March 4 to April 7 was well within the 60 days, and the remainder of the period was definitely covered by defendant\u2019s consent.  \u201c The defendant\u2019s consent to the postponement of his trial is equivalent to a postponement on his application and is sufficient cause for the delay. <em>(Ray </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>208 Cal. 357 [281 P. 391]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>134 Cal.App. 736, 744 [26 P.2d 522].) \u201d <em>(In re Lopez, </em>39 Cal.2d 118, 120 [245 P.2d 1].)  Consent of counsel is, of course, consent of the party. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Santos, supra, </em>at p. 744.) It necessarily follows that the dismissal statute here invoked did not come into play. There was no further postponement. The trial commenced and was completed on June 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Defendant also cites section 1050 of the Penal Code which reads in part as follows: \u201cThe court shall set all criminal cases for trial for a date not later than thirty (30) days after the date of entry of the plea of the defendant. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>continuance of the trial shall be granted except upon affirmative proof in open court, upon reasonable notice, that the ends of justice require a continuance. . . . Whenever any continuance is granted, the court shall enter in its minutes the facts proved which require the continuance. ...\u201d Here, the defendant\u2019s plea was entered March 10 and the cause, \u201cwith consent of counsel\u201d was \u201ccontinued for trial to April 7.\u201d That was a setting \u201cfor trial for a date not later than thirty (30) days.\u201d All continuances from April 7 to and including the holding of the trial were made with defendant\u2019s consent. He, therefore, is in no position to complain. \u201cNot having objected to a continuance, an accused person is presumed to have consented <em>(Ray </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>208 Cal. 357, 358 [281 P. 391]), but where he himself has requested it, he will not be heard to complain. <em>(People </em>v. <em>George, </em>91 Cal.App.2d 537, 540 [205 P.2d 461].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fude, </em>117 Cal.App.2d 186, 189 [255 P.2d 23].)</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Defendant complains of the lapse of several months after the commission of the offense (June, 1953) until his arrest (February, 1954). This is of no legal significance because well within the three year period of the statute of limitations. (See Health and Saf. Code, \u00a7 11713, and Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 17 and 800.) Incidentally, the prosecution witness, a state narcotic investigator, testified that an immediate arrest was not made lest other potential offenders he was investigating be alerted.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict but cites no specific lack in that regard. We have read the entire record and find that the evidence amply supports the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">He refers to each sale as <em>nudum, pactum, </em>asserting that for a \u201ccontract\u201d to be valid the parties must exist and be identifiable, citing Civil Code, section 1558. He apparently refers to the evidence that upon the occasion of each sale the officer contacted the defendant through an unnamed informer, through whom the officer paid the money to defendant and to whom defendant delivered the heroin. The answer is that we are here dealing with an executed contract whereas section 1558 deals primarily with executory contracts. Also, there is no doubt as to the existence of the parties to this executed contract (defendant as seller and the informer as buyer) and that each of those parties is identifiable even though the name of one of them was not .given in evidence herein. Moreover, each sale occurred in the presence of the officer, who furnished the' informer with the purchase price money, circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>which would allow an inference that the officer was the buyer and that the informer acted as a go-between. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Grijalva, </em>48 Cal.App.2d 690, 691-693 [121 P.2d 32].) Whether the informer or the officer be deemed the buyer, a sale took place within the meaning of section 11500 of the Health and Safety Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Defendant further claims that the oral statements of the informer, narrated in the officer\u2019s testimony, constituted hearsay and that the admission thereof into evidence violated defendant\u2019s right to be confronted by the witness. Much, if not all of it, consisted of acts done and statements made by the informer in defendant\u2019s presence, hence not hearsay. In addition, no objection was interposed to this testimony.  So, if any of it was hearsay, it became competent evidence for lack of an objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Peters, P. J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b627-12\">That section declares that, \u201cunless good cause is shown,\u2019\u2019 the court must order dismissal if a defendant, <em>\u2018 \u2018 whose trial has not teen postponed upon his application, </em>is not brought to trial within sixty days after . . . the filing of the information.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
