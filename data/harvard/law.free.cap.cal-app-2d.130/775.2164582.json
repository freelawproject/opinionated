Respondents Livingston and Evans wrote and composed the words and music of a song, \u201cButtons and Bows,\u201d in 1947 which was used in the motion picture \u201cThe Paleface,\u201d also produced by Paramount Pictures. The action herein is for alleged plagiarism.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">It is contended on appeal that,</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">\u201cI.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in limiting the owner of a musical composition to testifying <em>as an expert </em>and then instructing the jury that it may reject the testimony of <em>any expert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">\u201cII.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">\u201cThe evidence shows that the music of Freddie Rich was plagiarized by the music of \u2018Buttons and Bows\u2019 as a matter of law. \"There is no conflict that the music is \u2018basically similar.\u2019 That Rich\u2019s music was written and produced first, and both were distributed by the same studio. The judgment should, therefore, be reversed as a matter of law and the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">\u201cIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">\u201cIt was prejudicial error to allow the defense that the music of plaintiff and defendants came from the public domain where the defense failed to plead it affirmatively as required by Section 437 O.C.P. and Livingston and Evans did not contend that \u2018Buttons and Bows\u2019 came from the public domain. This testimony was improper and misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">\u201cIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-15\">\u201cThe Superior Court erred in overruling the objections to the manner of cross-examination of Freddie Rich by playing a number of melodies and asking Freddie Rich about them, which had no foundation in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>\u201cV.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">\u201cThe testimony of Sigmund Spaeth that the music came from the public domain, under the pleadings herein, was prejudicially erroneous and <em>entirely incompetent. </em>It invaded the province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">\u201cVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in instructing the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-8\">\u201c (A) After permitting the plaintiff to testify only as an \u2018expert\u2019 in identifying his own music as having been stolen, the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could disregard the testimony of any expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-9\">\u201c(B) The court gave a misleading instruction that the eight tone and five tone scales, the major and minor chords, the basic patterns of combinations of notes and basic rhythms are \u2018all a part of the public store house\u2019 of musical materials available to everyone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-10\">\u201c(C) The court erred in instructing the jury that there is no evidence of copyright by the plaintiff or that defendants copyrighted plaintiff's music.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-11\">\u201c(D) The court erred in failing to give the jury several offered instructions by the defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-12\">\u201c(a) Instructions offered on the question of access:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-13\">\u201c(b) Questions offered on the method of determining access;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-14\">\u201c(c) On the elements which the jury itself was to determine the questions involved from plaintiff\u2019s proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-15\">\u201cVII.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-16\">\u201cThe court erred in failing to direct the verdict and in failing to grant the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-17\">It is argued by appellant that the court erred in refusing to permit plaintiff to \u201cidentify the music as his property, but only permitted him to give an \u2018opinion\u2019 as an expert, and so told the jury. \u2019 \u2019 This was not error. Whether the time or music was plaintiff\u2019s \u201cproperty\u201d was the question of law before the court, which obviously was to be determined by the facts. Appellant makes much of the incident which actually was unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-18\">It is further argued by appellant that, \u201cThe unity and proportion of Rich\u2019s music in the picture \u2018Wildcat\u2019 and that of \u2018Buttons and Bows\u2019 is identical. The principal mi it and the lesser units of \u2018Wildcat\u2019 are repeated.over and over again in \u2018Buttons and Bows.\u2019 To hear the two numbers is to be convinced that one was taken from the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>\u201cThe principal defense in this case was not that they were not identical, but a claim not pleaded affirmatively that they both came from the public domain.\u201d Respondent, on the other hand, argues that, \u201cThe only similarity between the accusing and the accused compositions lies in the \u2018sol-do-la-do\u2019 sequence of the notes. This sequence is basic material used in all sorts of music, particularly in folk music. In our Statement of the Case, we pointed out that this basic pattern had been used in at least 33 compositions which preceded both the accusing and the accused works. It has been used in works of the Old Masters and in modern popular songs, musical comedies, folk music, children\u2019s music and instrumental exercises (Bxs. B to S and X-l to X-17).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">\u201cActually, as will hereinafter be demonstrated, this basic pattern is not protectible property; it is a part of the public storehouse or common stock of basic materials used in the composition of music and is available to everybody. But assuming, for purposes of argument, that it constitutes proteetible property, it is so commonplace and has been used so often that its appearance in both appellant\u2019s and respondents\u2019 compositions does not give rise to any inference that respondents copied it from appellant. If respondents copied it at all, it is much more reasonable to infer that they copied it from, \u2018Turkey in the Straw\u2019 or \u2018I Love Coffee, I Love Tea,\u2019 or some of the other earlier compositions familiar to everybody than to infer that they copied it from appellant\u2019s obscure composition.\u201d And that, \u201cAppellant had no protectible property right in the musical pattern which he claims that respondents copied because that pattern is a part of the public storehouse of material available to everybody.\u201d  In the light of the record it was not error for the trial court to permit respondent to offer evidence on this issue and it was unnecessary, as a matter of law, to plead it as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Appellant argues, with reference to expert testimony, that \u201cThe trial court erred in permitting Sigmund Spaeth to give opinions as to the music in question, and as to whether Freddie Rich\u2019s music came from old Irish tunes (Public Domain). This testimony was highly prejudicial and invaded the province of the jury. \u2019 \u2019 There is no merit to the argument. The testimony of the expert covered the subject of music and melodies and was not only unprejudicial but, in the light of the questions involved was important and helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Appellant also assigns as error the fact that plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>was denied the right to examine the expert on <em>voir dire. </em>However, no prejudice appears to have resulted from the ruling for, as pointed out by respondent, \u201cafter the close of Dr. Spaeth\u2019s direct testimony, appellant was permitted to and did cross-examine him at length as to his qualifications. Appellant did not at the time, nor does he now, point to anything developed in that cross-examination which raises even the slightest question as to the witness\u2019s expert qualifications. Therefore, if the court had not made the ruling now complained of and had permitted appellant to cross-examine the witness on <em>voir dire </em>before he gave expert testimony, it is obvious that such cross-examination would have developed nothing to prevent the witness from giving the expert testimony he gave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">As recited in respondent\u2019s brief, \u201cThe jury heard the accusing and accused compositions played on the piano and on phonograph records. It saw the motion pictures \u2018The Wildcat\u2019 and \u2018The Paleface\u2019 in which the compositions were used. It heard the other compositions which use this \u2018sol-do-la-do \u2019 passage played on the piano. It observed the witnesses and weighed their testimony. It returned a verdict for respondents upon which judgment was entered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">A careful reading of the instructions given as well as those offered and refused reveals no prejudicial errors relating thereto nor does it appear to have been error on the part of the trial judge in \u201cfailing to grant the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied April 13, 1955. Carter, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
