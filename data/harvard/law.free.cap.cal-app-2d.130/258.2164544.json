J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2rO\">This is an appeal-from the decree determining heirship, which provides that \u201cincome accumulated during the period of five years after the date of the decedent\u2019s death be added to the corpus\u201d and distributed to respondents, a university and several religious corporations, after the death of the last of appellants, the sister and brother of testator, who are to be paid \u201cthe income from the augmented corpus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The matter was heard by the superior court upon the petition for determination of heirship filed by Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association, as executor of the last will and testament of said decedent, and the answer thereto filed by appellants as persons interested .in said estate. No evidence was given or offered, and the only question involved is the interpretation of the testamentary writings of decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Testator had never married. He was an experienced and successful businessman, lawyer and federal judge, and a former Comptroller of the Currency of the United States. He died September 28, 1949, leaving a will dated October 17, 1937, and two codicils dated May 10, 1946, all of which were entirely written, dated and signed in his own handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">By decedent\u2019s holographic will and codicils, after directing payment of his funeral expenses, debts and obligations, and making specific bequests, including $5,000 each to respondents and appellants, he provided in Paragraph Nineteenth as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u201cNineteenth I direct that the residue of my estate shall be kept intact for a period of five years after my death the income during the sixth year and each year thereafter shall be paid to my sister, Minnie L. Trepanier, my brothers Thomas J. O\u2019Connor, L. E. O\u2019Connor, Charles A. O\u2019Connor and my cousin Annie Enright share and share alike, during the lifetime of each. At death of any one his or her interest shall pass to the survivors named in this paragraph. Upon the decease of the last remaining beneficiary named in this paragraph, the remainder of my estate both real and personal shall be divided equally share and share alike among the University of North Dakota, St. James, St. Michaels and St. Mary\u2019s Schools provided that each institution shall raise a sum of money equal to the share under this paragraph provided which total sum shall be held by each institution in trust the income to be used for scholarship awards. The failure of one or more of the institutions named to comply with this provision within one year after such institution is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>entitled to the benefits named then such share shall pass to the institutions complying with these terms. If no institution is found entitled to the benefits of this section the residue of my estate shall be distributed to St. Michael\u2019s Hospital at Grand Porks, No Dak.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">The names of Thomas J. O\u2019Connor and Annie Enright were stricken from said Paragraph Nineteenth by the provisions of one of the codicils. Charles A. O\u2019Connor, one of the beneficiaries of the income mentioned in Paragraph Nineteenth, died on October 11,1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Briefs on appeal have been filed by Minnie L. Trepanier and L. E. O\u2019Connor, testator\u2019s sister and brother, hereafter referred to as \u201cAppellants,\u201d by respondent University of North Dakota, hereafter referred to as \u201cRespondent University,\u201d and by respondents St. Mary\u2019s Catholic Church, St. Michael\u2019s Catholic Church, and Academy of St. James, hereafter referred to as \u201cRespondent Religious Institutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Appellants suggest that punctuation be added to make the first sentence of said Paragraph Nineteenth read thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">\u201cI direct that the residue of my estate be kept intact for a period of five years after my deatlr_ The income^ during the sixth year and each year thereafter^shall be paid to . . . my sister Minnie L. Trepanier . . . and brother(s) '. . . L. E. O\u2019Connor . . . share and share alike during the lifetime of each.\u201d (The period, capital, and two commas underlined have been added.) Respondents concede that if said portion of Paragraph Nineteenth were so punctuated, the phrase \u201cduring the sixth year and each year thereafter\u201d would be an adverbial phrase designating the times for payments of the income to be made to appellants. However, respondents insist that the plain words of said Paragraph Nineteenth \u201cwithout the addition of punctuation, show a clear and consistent plan of testamentary disposition and show beyond question that it was the intention of the testator that the income for the first five years after his death should be accumulated and added to the principal ...\u201d and distributed to respondents after the death of the last of appellants; and respondents argue that \u201cthe addition of this punctuation does violence to the expressed intention of the testator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">In the first 18 paragraphs of said will, some sentences have been commenced with small letters and some have not been closed by periods, although there is no doubt that such sentences are complete and are not a part of preceding or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>succeeding sentences or phrases. While respondent university urges that \u201cThere is no legal authority . . . which would support a repunctuation of the will in question . . . and the copy of said Paragraph Nineteenth appended to its brief discloses no punctuation in the portion which gives rise to this controversy, in the remainder of the so-called copy of said Paragraph Nineteenth we find one period and seven commas which do not appear in the photostatie copy of the holographic will in the clerk\u2019s transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Under the circumstances of this proceeding, the construction of the will is a question of law, and its purpose is to ascertain, if possible, the testator\u2019s intent as expressed by his own language used in his will. <em>(Estate of Ottoveggio, </em>64 Cal.App.2d 388, 391 [148 P.2d 878].)  It is therefore the duty of this court to interpret the will independently and without presumption as to the correctness or error of the decree determining heirship, from which this appeal was taken. <em>(Estate of Platt, </em>21 Cal.2d 343, 352 [131 P.2d 825]; <em>Estate of Norris, </em>78 Cal.App.2d 152, 159 [177 P.2d 299]; <em>Estate of Sahlender, </em>89 Cal.App.2d 329, 347 [201 P.2d 69].)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">As a lawyer and judge, testator must be presumed to have known and intended the usual meanings of the words used by him. <em>(Estate of Welsh, </em>89 Cal.App.2d 43, 50 [200 P.2d 139]; <em>Estate of Rutan, </em>119 Cal.App.2d 592, 598 [260 P.2d 111].)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">First, we will consider what was intended by testator when he used the word \u201cresidue.\u201d Appellants contend that by \u201cresidue\u201d testator refers to the balance of the corpus of the estate (as of the date of death) remaining after payment therefrom of the funeral expenses, debts, expenses of administration, and specific bequests in accordance with paragraphs First to Eighteenth of the will. Respondents urge that testator intended all such debts, expenses of administration and specific bequests to be paid out of the first five years\u2019 income, and the remainder, if any, of said five years\u2019 income to become a part of the residue to be distributed to respondents, and the income for the sixth and subsequent years only to be distributed to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">Words occurring more than once in a will are presumed to be used in the same sense. In the will now being construed the word \u201cresidue\u201d appears only twice, and about midway between the two uses of the word \u201cresidue,\u201d testator has used the word \u201cremainder\u201d to designate the same portion of his estate, all in said Paragraph Nineteenth, as follows: \u201cI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>direct that the <em>residue </em>of my estate he kept intact for a period of five years after my death . . . Upon the death of the last remaining beneficiary named in this paragraph (appellants), the <em>remainder </em>of my estate . . . shall be divided equally between\u201d respondents, upon certain conditions, or \u201cthe <em>residue . </em>. . shall be distributed\u201d to the hospital. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Webster\u2019s International Unabridged Dictionary defines \u201cremainder\u201d as \u201cthe portion of a thing remaining, or left, after the separation and removal of a part; residue; remnant. \u2019 \u2019 \u201cResidue\u201d is there defined as \u201cthe part of a testator\u2019s estate . . . remaining after the satisfaction of all debts and previous devises and bequests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">We are persuaded that testator, by the words \u201cresidue\u201d and \u201cremainder\u201d in said Paragraph Nineteenth, meant the portion of the corpus of his estate which should remain after payment of funeral expenses and \u201call debts and obligations\u201d in accordance with Paragraph First, and payment of all specific legacies expressed in Paragraphs Second to Eighteenth, inclusive. Testator directed that \u201cthe residue . . . shall be kept intact for a period of five years after my death. ...\u201d Had he meant \u201cthe entire corpus\u201d he would have said so. He was not a layman who did not know the difference between the terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">The next difference in construction to be considered is the meaning of the words \u201cshall be kept intact for five years . . ..\u201d Respondents contend that these words, when considered with the whole of Paragraph Nineteenth, are tantamount to a direction that five years\u2019 income shall be added to and become a part of the \u201cresidue\u201d to be distributed to respondents. Such construction completely ignores the meaning of the words \u201cshall be kept intact.\u201d Again, we look to the dictionary. \u201cIntact,\u201d literally and in every day usage, means \u201cnot touched\u201d or \u201cuntouched.\u201d \u201cTouched,\u201d the adjective, describes that which \u201chas been subjected t\" touching, especially to handling, meddling, improving. . . .\u201d A residue which is \u201ckept intact\u201d cannot be subtracted from, nor can it be added to. We conclude that it was testator\u2019s intention, when he directed that the \u201cresidue . . . shall be kept intact for five years . . . ,\u201d that it remain the same as it was after effect had been given to Paragraphs First to Eighteenth of his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Testator\u2019s words, \u201cI direct that the residue of my estate shall be kept intact for a period of five years after my death\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>form a complete sentence. His next following expression, \u201cThe income, during the sixth and each year thereafter, shall be paid to my sister, Minnie L. Trepanier, my brother . . . L. E. O\u2019Connor . . . , share and share alike, during the lifetime of each,\u201d is likewise a complete sentence. We are impressed that testator so intended them.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">From the fact that testator provided that some of the specific bequests in Paragraphs First to Eighteenth should be paid in six months, one year, two years, or five years, respondent university argues that \u201cTestator showed a consistent regard for the time element in his bequests\u201d and had set the times for payment in order that such bequests could be paid from income without disturbing the corpus of the estate. However, it appears to us that testator\u2019s providing such varying times for payment makes it even more logical that he intended the phrase \u201cduring the sixth year and each year thereafter\u201d to express the times for payment of the income from the residue to his relatives, the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Appellants\u2019 argument that testator intended the first five years\u2019 income to be distributed to them during the sixth year, and each year\u2019s income to be so distributed annually thereafter, is more convincing than is the position of respondents that the first five years\u2019 income was intended to be added to and become a part of the \u201cresidue\u201d to be distributed to respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">We have considered Paragraph Nineteenth alone and in conjunction with and as a part of the entire will and the two codicils, and we find no expressed or implied provision for adding the first five years\u2019 income to the residue and distributing it to the respondents. On the contrary, it seems clear that testator intended \u201cthe income,\u201d not a part only, to be distributed to his brother and sister, the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">If, however, the testamentary writings of decedent had left this question in doubt, and it could not be determined from the will, then \u201cthe interpretation by which the property goes to those of the blood of the testator is preferred\u201d over the construction under which it would go to strangers. <em>(Estate of Boyd, </em>24 Cal.App.2d 287, 289-290 [74 P.2d 1049]; <em>Estate of Hartson, </em>218 Cal. 536, 540 [24 P.2d 171].)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Because of the conclusions hereinabove expressed, it becomes unnecessary for us to consider the other questions discussed in the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">The order is reversed and the cause remanded with diree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>tions to the court below to enter its decree determining heir-ship in accordance with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Doran, J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Respondents\u2019 petitions for a hearing by the Supreme Court were denied March 16, 1955. Schaner, J., was of the opinion that the petitions should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
