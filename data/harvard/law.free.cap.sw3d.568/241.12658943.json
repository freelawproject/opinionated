(Axiom) (collectively Appellants), filed a civil suit in Texas against five Texas residents (collectively Appellees) alleging that Appellees caused emotional distress and damages, and were unjustly enriched, after filing a criminal complaint, and/or giving testimony in support of charges, in a Mexican proceeding over a contract dispute involving the purchase of undeveloped real property in Juarez, Mexico. Appellants are non-residents of Texas. After Appellees filed a motion to dismiss based on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   , the trial court granted their motion and dismissed the case. Appellants appealed the trial court's dismissal order. On July 13, 2018, we issued an opinion and judgment reversing the trial court's order and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with our opinion. Appellees subsequently filed a motion for rehearing. We hereby deny Appellees' motion for rehearing, withdraw the opinion and judgment issued on July 13, 2018, and substitute the following opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    The Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Alvarez, the sole director of co-appellant Axiom, resides in Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico. Axiom is a Mexican corporation doing business in Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   With one exception, Appellees are all Delgado family members-three siblings and one in-law. Among them, the siblings include Rosa Delgado Dominguez de Cano (Rosa Cano), Mario Sergio Delgado Dominguez (Mario Delgado), and Blanca Delgado de Urquidi (Blanca Urquidi). Lucio Mario Cano Barraza (Lucio Cano), is the in-law and he is married to Rosa. Sibling Mario Delgado and married couple Rosa\n   Cano and Lucio Cano, are all citizens of Mexico who reside in Texas. Appellee Blanca Urquidi is a citizen of the United States and resides in Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellee Patricia Alvarez Ozuna (Patricia Ozuna) is the unrelated fifth person named in the suit who facilitated the initial contact between Alvarez and certain members of the Delgado family. Patricia Ozuna has dual citizenship with Mexico and the United States and resides in Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Contract to Purchase Land\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As alleged in Appellants' third amended original petition, on or about July 23, 2008, Axiom entered into a contract to purchase undeveloped land in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, from four members of the Delgado family: (1) Appellee Rosa Cano; (2) Appellee Mario Delgado; (3) Federico Delgado, who is now deceased and succeeded in interest by Monica Idaly Delgado Nevarez; and (4) Jesus Delgado, a defendant named in the underlying suit who has not yet been served with process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The purchase price of the property was structured to include both a fixed and a contingent payment: first, Axiom agreed it would initially pay $1,059,394.08; and second, if, within two years, the Delgados obtained government authorization to establish water and sewage utilities for the property, Axiom would then be required to pay an additional $2,188,759.68. There is no dispute the contract was executed in Mexico, and by its terms, Mexican law governed the transaction, and no part of it required performance in the United States. Appellee Ozuna acted as an intermediary who relayed messages between Alvarez, as director of Axiom, and the Delgados regarding Axiom's purchase of the Delgado property. Appellee Blanca Urquidi did not participate as a named party to the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Although Axiom made the initial payment as promised, a dispute arose between the parties over the authorization to establish utilities for the property and the resulting payment owed in satisfaction of the contingency. Although the Delgados provided a letter from a government official which purportedly authorized the establishment of utilities, Axiom asserted the letter fell short of authorizing permits acceptable for commercial development as required by their agreement. Axiom asserted it would extend the time for performance of the contingency but it would not accept the authorization as tendered. In opposition, the Delgados contended that they had fully performed their duties under the contract, and Axiom owed them the additional payment of $2,188,759.68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under Mexican law, fraudulent insolvency to the detriment of creditors is a crime punishable by a sentence of imprisonment up to four years and a fine. On or about May of 2011, the Delgados complained to authorities and criminal charges were filed against Alvarez in a Mexican proceeding alleging that Alvarez had rendered Axiom insolvent to avoid paying its debt. The Delgados asserted that Alvarez had transferred assets from Axiom to another Mexican company he controlled thereby causing Axiom to become insolvent. Based on the criminal complaint, on August 23, 2013, Alvarez was arrested and imprisoned in the Cereso Prison of Juarez, Mexico. A Mexican court later conducted a preliminary hearing in which several members of the Delgado family and others testified. The Mexican court found sufficient evidence to support a preliminary investigation and ordered that Alvarez remain in custody until November 28, 2013. Rather than await trial or appeal the decision, after eleven days of confinement, Alvarez paid the Delgado family the full amount of the contingency payment and all criminal\n   charges were dismissed as provided by Mexican law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Alvarez and Axiom subsequently sued Rosa Cano, Lucio Cano, Mario Delgado, Blanca Urquidi, Patricia Ozuna, Monica Idaly Delgado Nevarez, and Jesus Ignacio Delgado Dominguez in the 171st District Court in El Paso County, alleging they caused Alvarez to be imprisoned in Mexico by filing the criminal complaint against him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants' causes of action were for abuse of process, conspiracy to abuse process, intentional infliction of emotional distress, conspiracy to commit intentional infliction of emotional distress, and money had and received. As damages, Appellants sought restitution for the money he paid to the Delgados to obtain the dismissal of the Mexican criminal charge, for emotional distress, and for exemplary damages for \"substantial injury and harm.\" On its own, Axiom also filed suit in a Mexican court against Rosa Cano, Mario Delgado, Monica Nevarez, and Jesus Delgado, alleging unjust enrichment and sought restitution of the same funds at issue in the lawsuit filed in El Paso County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition to a plea to the jurisdiction, Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the El Paso County lawsuit on the ground of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens.\n   </em>\n   Appellees asserted that the relevant witnesses and physical evidence were in Mexico and controlling legal questions needed to be decided under Mexican law. The trial court granted the motion and issued findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of its order. The trial court concluded that (1) a court in Mexico is an alternative forum; (2) that the dispute between the parties was factually and legally a Mexican dispute such that the facts arose in Mexico and Mexican law would be necessarily involved in resolving the dispute; (3) that both the private and public interests weighed heavily in favor of the lawsuit being litigated in a Mexican court; and (4) that a court in Mexico provided the more appropriate court to resolve the dispute. Appellants appealed the trial court's grant of Appellees' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In three issues, Appellants argue the trial court abused its discretion in granting Appellees' motion to dismiss on the grounds of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens.\n   </em>\n   Appellants' first two issues challenge the sufficiency of the evidence in support of the dismissal of the case, asserting that (1) no alternative forum was shown to be \"available;\" and (2) no evidence exists to support dismissal. In their third issue, Appellants contend the evidence established that El Paso County not only maintains jurisdiction over all parties but also provides a convenient forum that works no injustice to Appellees-movants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The determination of whether to grant or deny a motion to dismiss based on the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Quixtar Inc. v.

While the laws regarding personal jurisdiction may vary from state to state in the United States, they are all subject to the constitutional requirements of due process and Supreme Court jurisprudence regarding the exercise of personal jurisdiction over defendants; however, we cannot say the same is true for a Mexican court, which would not be subject to those constraints. Further, none of the cited cases implicated whether we should presume that a foreign state court's ability to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant would be identical to a Texas court's ability to do so, but rather only whether we should presume that other states' substantive laws were the same as Texas's.

As such, if we were to apply Texas law to the context of whether a Mexican court would have jurisdiction over Ozuna, who holds dual citizenship with the United States and Mexico but does not reside in or have other contacts with Mexico, she would not be subject to personal jurisdiction in a Mexican court because her citizenship alone, without residency in Mexico or sufficient minimum contacts in Mexico, would not confer personal jurisdiction over her to a Texas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Since Appellees did not meet their (albeit diminished) burden to show that Mexico was an available alternate forum as to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   parties, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the motion to dismiss on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tullis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11091443\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/45/118/#p132\">\n    45 S.W.3d at 131-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a defendant fails to meet its burden in showing an alternate forum is available when it fails to produce evidence that all parties would be amenable to service in a foreign court and subject to its jurisdiction);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quixtar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321735\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/315/28/#p31\">\n    315 S.W.3d at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a defendant has a diminished burden in a\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   dismissal where the plaintiff is a nonresident in the forum of suit).

Appellees did not present such evidence in support of their motion to dismiss for\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    , and based on the record before us, the trial court abused its discretion by concluding that a Mexican court would have personal jurisdiction over Lucio Cano, Blanca Urquidi, or Patricia Ozuna, or that those parties would be amenable to process in Mexico.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Nevertheless, Appellees cite to the Texas Supreme Court case of\n    <em>\n     In re Bridgestone\n    </em>\n    for the propositions that (1) in the context of a\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    analysis, Texas courts have recognized Mexican courts' ability to \"seize jurisdiction\" when a foreign court rejects a suit on\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    grounds, and (2) that dismissal on\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    grounds was supported even when one of the named defendants stated that he would not submit to the jurisdiction of Mexican courts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Bridgestone\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6875717\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/459/565/#p568\">\n     459 S.W.3d at 577\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In\n    <em>\n     Bridgestone\n    </em>\n    , the defendants in the case presented testimony from a Mexican-law expert in support of similar contentions as are made here, and supportive of the Mexican court's jurisdiction over all defendants of the case.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6875717\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/459/565/#p568\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Yet unlike the defendants in\n    <em>\n     Bridgestone\n    </em>\n    , Appellees here did not similarly present evidence in support of their motion to dismiss that affirmatively showed that a Mexican court exercise jurisdiction over all parties in this case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6875717\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/459/565/#p568\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    As such, we find\n    <em>\n     Bridgestone\n    </em>\n    to be distinguishable, and disagree with Appellees' argument that a Mexican court would have jurisdiction over all defendants in this case when Appellees did not present evidence establishing that contention.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Appellees also point to the fact that Appellants' lawyer's report mentioned that this case \"is not a matter of personal jurisdiction, but of the subject matter jurisdiction of the Mexican court,\" since Blanca Urquidi and Patricia Ozuna were not parties to the contract with Axiom, and therefore Axiom is not entitled to sue them under Mexican law. Although we note the Mexican lawyer included a passing comment about personal jurisdiction, the report does not clearly establish that a Mexican court would have personal jurisdiction over Blanca Urquidi or Patricia Ozuna, or that either party is amenable to process in Mexico. Thus, we are unable to consider the report as evidence tending to establish either contention.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
