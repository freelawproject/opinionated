Easley appeals the denial after an evidentiary hearing of his Rule 24.035 motion for postconviction relief which claimed he was denied due process when the sentencing court permitted the state to play, over defense counsel's objection, a video about his victim's life which included hearsay, and which Easley claims was prejudicial to the imposition of sentence. Finding no error, we affirm. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
