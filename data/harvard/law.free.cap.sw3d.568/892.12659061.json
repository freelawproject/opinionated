This case involves a circuit court's\n     <em>\n      grant\n     </em>\n     of a post-sentencing Rule 29.07(d) motion, not the\n     <em>\n      denial\n     </em>\n     of such a motion. Nevertheless, in light of\n     <em>\n      Fite\n     </em>\n     , and the supreme court's re-transfer order in this case, it is unclear whether our prior decisions exercising appellate jurisdiction over the denial of a post-sentencing Rule 29.07(d) motion should continue to be followed.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-16\">\n     After reconsideration of our opinion issued on July 3, 2018, because of the retransfer order by the Missouri Supreme Court on October 30, 2018, we withdraw our previous opinion.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <opinion>\n    <div type=\"majority\">\n     <author id=\"p-17\">\n      --------\n     </author>\n     <p id=\"p-8\">\n      Thomas H.
