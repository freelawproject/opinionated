This case involves a circuit court's <em>grant</em> of a post-sentencing Rule 29.07(d) motion, not the <em>denial</em> of such a motion. Nevertheless, in light of <em>Fite</em> , and the supreme court's re-transfer order in this case, it is unclear whether our prior decisions exercising appellate jurisdiction over the denial of a post-sentencing Rule 29.07(d) motion should continue to be followed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"p-16\">After reconsideration of our opinion issued on July 3, 2018, because of the retransfer order by the Missouri Supreme Court on October 30, 2018, we withdraw our previous opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"p-17\">--------</author>\n<p id=\"p-8\">Thomas H.
