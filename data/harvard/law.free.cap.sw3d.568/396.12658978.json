Russell, Judge\n   Emilee Williams brought a medical malpractice action against Mercy Clinic Springfield Communities and Dr. Elene Pilapil.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Williams alleged Dr. Pilapil, and by association Mercy, negligently failed to diagnose and treat her for Wilson's disease, a rare genetic disorder that causes an excess of copper to slowly accumulate in the vital organs. A jury returned a verdict in favor of Williams. The circuit court entered judgment on the verdict for a total amount of $28,911,000 and allocated a portion of the future medical damages to periodic payments in accordance with section 538.220.2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Williams appeals, and Mercy cross-appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The application of section 538.220.2 is unconstitutional as applied to Williams because payment of future medical damages at a different interest rate than the interest rate used to compute the present value of the jury's award deprives Williams of the full value of the award and violates her due process rights. Further, because Mercy's April 27 motion to amend the judgment to remove post-judgment interest was not filed within 30 days of the entry of judgment, the circuit court did not have authority to amend the judgment to remove post-judgment interest. The circuit court's judgment is reversed to the extent it deprived Williams of the full value of the jury's award, violating her due process rights, and to the extent it sustained the untimely April 27 motion to amend striking post-judgment interest. The case is remanded for entry of a new judgment in accordance with this opinion. In all other aspects, the judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Williams, a 19-year-old woman, started seeing a counselor in 2011 for anxiety and depression. She also consulted with her primary care physician, who ordered lab tests showing Williams had elevated levels of liver enzymes and diagnosed her with mononucleosis. In October or November 2011, Williams began experiencing a change in her personality and an increase in anxiety and depression. Her primary care physician diagnosed her with anxiety and depression and prescribed Prozac.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Williams developed a tremor in her hand in December 2012 and first saw Dr. Pilapil, a doctor of internal medicine. Dr. Pilapil performed a neurological exam and concluded Williams did not have a neurological issue. Dr. Pilapil diagnosed her with anxiety and depression and increased her Prozac dosage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The next month, Williams had a follow-up appointment with Dr. Pilapil. There were no changes in medication or diagnosis, and Dr. Pilapil did not perform a neurological exam. Williams visited Dr. Pilapil a third time in May 2013, after her condition had continued to deteriorate. Her tremors were worse, her voice was elevated, her fifth finger extended outward, and her lip occasionally curled up involuntarily. Dr. Pilapil lowered the Prozac dosage. At the end of May, Williams and Dr. Pilapil exchanged emails regarding Williams' worsening symptoms. Dr. Pilapil told Williams to stop taking Prozac and prescribed a different antidepressant, Celexa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Williams visited Dr. Pilapil for the last time on June 28. At this time, Williams had trouble standing, had fatigue, could not write properly, and her fifth finger extended outward. Dr. Pilapil again stated she believed the symptoms were caused by anxiety. Dr. Pilapil continued the Celexa\n   prescription and added Klonopin. Williams requested an MRI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Williams and Dr. Pilapil exchanged emails during July regarding Williams' symptoms. Williams eventually asked Dr. Pilapil to schedule an appointment with a neurologist and order an MRI or CT scan. Dr. Pilapil said she would order an MRI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Williams received an EEG at the end of the month. At this time, Williams' hands and feet were clawing, her lips were curling out, and she was unable to continue physical therapy school. Williams again contacted Dr. Pilapil and requested an MRI. At the beginning of August, Williams received an MRI, which showed significant brain trauma appearing to be Wilson's disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Williams consulted doctors at the Wilson's Disease Center for Excellence at the University of Michigan. The doctors prescribed Trientine, an aggressive chelating agent that removes excess copper from the body but can cause additional neurological degradation. Williams' health continued to decline, and the doctors ordered Williams to stop taking Trientine. Williams was essentially paralyzed for approximately two and a half years. She was not able to walk, talk, or move, and she blinked her eyes to communicate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Since then, Williams has made significant improvements. She is able to talk and can walk with a limp. But her personality changed significantly, as she is prone to outbursts and has not been left unsupervised since August 2013. Williams filed suit, alleging Dr. Pilapil, and by association Mercy, negligently failed to diagnose and treat her for Wilson's disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The jury returned a verdict in favor of Williams for the total amount of $28,911,000. The jury awarded $511,000 for past medical and wage loss, $1 million for past non-economic damages, $21 million for future medical damages, $3.2 million for future wage loss, and $3.2 million for future non-economic damages. The circuit court entered judgment, which mirrored the jury's verdict and included post-judgment interest. Mercy moved to set aside the judgment to hear evidence about the application of section 538.220.2, seeking to have the future medical damages paid in periodic payments. Williams opposed the motion, arguing section 538.220.2 is unconstitutional as applied to her because payment of future medical damages at the statutorily required interest rate, when the jury had discounted the award to present value using a higher interest rate, effectively deprives her of the full value of the jury's award and violates due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The circuit court held an evidentiary hearing regarding the periodic payment of future damages. Williams' counsel submitted a proposed judgment, which the court entered on March 20. The judgment still included an award of post-judgment interest and extracted the attorney's fees from the amount to be paid periodically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 7, Mercy filed post-trial motions to amend the judgment, for new trial, for remittitur, and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. On April 27, Mercy filed another motion to amend the judgment, objecting to the inclusion of post-judgment interest. Williams moved to strike the April 27 motion as untimely because it was filed more than 30 days after judgment was entered. The circuit court heard argument on the pending motions.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    Before trial, Williams dismissed Dr. Pilapil without prejudice.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    All statutory references are to RSMo 2000, unless otherwise specified.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    The circuit court entered an amended judgment on June 23, sustaining Mercy's second motion to amend and striking the post-judgment interest. It also modified the future periodic payments schedule by increasing that amount to $10 million at an interest rate of 1.2%, and it was silent as to the payment of attorney's\n    fees. Williams appealed, and Mercy Clinic cross-appealed.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      I.

The expert explained the dollar amounts he provided accounted for medical inflation and were reduced to present value. He stated that in order to fully fund the future medical damages, Williams would need $17,758,161 today, which would require the jury to award her $21 million to cover her fees and expenses.

Article I, section 10 provides that \"no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\" Due process requires a law to be rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\n    <em>\n     Doe v.

But the application of section 538.220.2 in this case is not rationally related to these interests. Applying section 538.220.2 here, after the\n    jury discounted the award to present value, deprived Williams of the full value of the jury's award. The $10 million of Williams' future medical damage award to be paid periodically was effectively discounted twice - once by the jury when it reduced the entirety of the future medical damage award to present value and again when the $10 million in future periodic payments was subjected to the arbitrarily low statutory interest rate.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    Subjecting the $10 million to future periodic payments at a different interest rate than was used to reduce the future medical damages results in Williams receiving less than the jury awarded her.

When deciding what portion of the future medical damages should be paid in lump sum, the circuit court operated under the assumption that the 1.2% statutory interest rate would be applied.

Rule 81.05.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    In a recent decision, this Court clarified the powers these two rules confer on the circuit court.\n    <em>\n     State ex rel. Hawley v.

Because the April 27 motion was not filed within 30 days of the entry of judgment, the circuit court did not have the authority to amend the judgment to remove post-judgment interest. Its authority to amend the judgment was limited to those grounds raised in the timely filed April 7 motion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Mercy argues that even though its motion to remove post-judgment interest was not timely filed, the circuit court nonetheless had the authority to remove post-judgment interest under Rule 78.08. Rule 78.08 states, \"Plain errors affecting substantial rights may be considered at a hearing on motion for a new trial, in the discretion of the court, though not raised in the motion or defectively raised, when the court finds that manifest injustice or miscarriage of justice has resulted therefrom.\" Mercy argues Rule 78.08\n    should apply to grant the circuit court specific authority to correct the judgment. But Rule 78.08 gives the circuit court the power to consider at a hearing on a motion for a new trial plain error not timely raised as well as\n    <em>\n     whether a new trial should be granted\n    </em>\n    as a result of the error.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    Rule 78.08's plain error review is only for the time period during which the circuit court has authority. Rule 78.08 does not give the circuit court authority, after the court lost it, to amend the judgment after the 30-day period for reasons not preserved in a timely filed after-trial motion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Alternatively, Mercy contends that had the circuit court not amended the judgment to remove post-judgment interest, it would have argued this Court should review the inclusion of post-judgment interest for plain error pursuant to Rule 84.13(c).

The evidence and Williams' counsel's closing argument specified to the jury the timeline of Williams' treatment. Williams' damages evidence was not solely based on Dr. Pilapil's negligence in December 2012 and January 2013. The jury heard testimony from Williams' standard of care experts, Dr. Lisa Shah and Dr. Donald Frey, that Dr. Pilapil violated the standard of care during the December 2012, January 2013, and May 2013 visits because she failed to take a proper medical history, provided incorrect medical advice, did not consider Williams' medical records, and failed to refer Williams to a neurologist or follow up with a second neurological exam. Dr. Stanley Fischer, Williams' life care expert, testified that had Williams been properly diagnosed and treated for Wilson's disease in \"late 2012, earlier in 2013, even getting up to as far as maybe May of 2013\" she would have been \"normal or essentially normal.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    When determining whether a roving commission occurred, a jury instruction should be considered in the context of the trial as a whole.\n    <em>\n     Klotz\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7325994\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/311/752/#p760\">\n     311 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    767 ;\n    <em>\n     Stone\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10010064\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/785/671/#p678\">\n     785 S.W.2d at 678\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

These subparts instructed the jury its verdict must be for Williams if it believed Dr. Pilapil either (a) \"[f]ailed to take an adequate history in regards to [Williams'] tremor\" or (b) \"[f]ailed to adequately consider [Williams'] medical chart as part of her comprehensive review.\" Mercy asserts Williams' primary liability theory was encompassed in subpart D of the instruction, which stated that the jury's verdict must be for Williams if it believed Dr. Pilapil \"[f]ailed to timely refer [Williams] for a neurological consultation.\" Mercy argues the failure to take an adequate history or failure to adequately consider the medical chart are reasons why Williams claimed Dr. Pilapil failed to make a timely referral but, according to Williams' theory of liability, neither of these factors independently caused Williams' injuries.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Because subparts of a jury instruction might causally contribute to the same damages does not necessarily mean each subpart is not supported by substantial evidence. Subparts of jury instructions are often causally related. For instance, in\n    <em>\n     Lindquist\n    </em>\n    , the circuit court instructed the jury to assess a percentage of fault to the defendant if it believed the defendant either: \"[f]ailed to take an adequate history, or [f]ailed to perform an adequate physical examination, or [f]ailed to order MRI of his thoracic spine.\"\n    <em>\n     Lindquist v.

Additionally, the jury heard evidence that Dr. Pilapil could have diagnosed Williams' Wilson's disease through avenues other than a timely referral to a neurologist, such as through a blood test or by ordering an MRI. Williams' theory of liability did not rest solely on Dr. Pilapil's failure to timely refer her to a neurologist.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Further, Dr. Frey testified that Dr. Pilapil failed to take a thorough history during each of the first three visits, which prevented her from knowing the severity of the tremor and whether its status had changed over time. He stated that Williams' tremor was a \"red flag\" that should have been considered in light of her past medical issues, such as her heart condition, leg swelling, and liver problems. He noted that Dr. Pilapil's recorded medical history of Williams did not mention the location or type of the tremor. There was also testimony from Dr. Frey and Mercy's experts, Dr. Steven Frucht and Dr. Michael LeFevre, that a unilateral tremor is unusual in a young adult and indicates a problem more severe than anxiety. Subparts A and B of Instruction 6 were supported by substantial evidence. The jury could have found that Dr. Pilapil both failed to take an adequate history of Williams' tremor and failed to adequately consider Williams' medical chart because both of these acts were supported by expert testimony.

He testified this means that if the first MRI had been taken in December 2012 or January 2013, it would not have looked the same as the MRI taken in August 2013. Dr. Belz also stated that he believed the 2017 MRI looked the same as the 2013 MRI, an opinion mirroring that of Mercy's expert, Dr. Frucht.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Dr. Belz's testimony regarding the concept of subacute necrosis, the 2017 MRI, and causation did not constitute surprise. Dr. Belz's trial testimony was within his area of expertise, as he was retained to perform an independent medical exam of Williams and to create her life care plan, which required consideration of Williams' injuries, the causes of the injuries, and her current and future care needs. He brought to the deposition Williams' entire medical file - including the 2013 MRI report, which referenced subacute necrosis. During the deposition, Mercy questioned Dr. Belz regarding the bases for his conclusions regarding Williams' future needs detailed in the life care plan, and Dr. Belz explained\n    the information was from a number of sources, including Williams' medical records. Mercy had the opportunity to question Dr. Belz regarding the 2013 MRI, including the concept of subacute necrosis and causation, but it did not.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    During the time period between Dr. Belz's deposition and trial, Dr. Belz ordered the 2017 MRI of Williams. Mercy received a copy of the MRI report, and Williams' counsel indicated to Mercy that Dr. Belz's opinion had not changed. It is unclear how Mercy could have been genuinely surprised by Dr. Belz's testimony, as a party cannot claim surprise based on \"new opinions\" the expert witness was not asked about during discovery.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656367\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/545/864/#p870\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656367\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/545/864/#p870\">\n     at 870\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

There was no abuse of discretion in admitting those portions of the testimony of Dr. Belz.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    <em>\n     B. Testimony of Dr. Fischer\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Mercy points to three alleged errors in Dr. Fischer's testimony. It argues Dr. Fischer's trial testimony about whether Trientine caused Williams' neurological damage, the timing of Williams' treatment, and the significance of bilateral and unilateral tremors materially differed from his prior deposition testimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    <em>\n     1. Testimony Regarding Trientine\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Mercy initially claims the circuit court abused its discretion in admitting Dr. Fischer's trial testimony about whether Trientine caused Williams' neurological deterioration. Williams had been prescribed Trientine by doctors at the Wilson's Disease Center for Excellence in August 2013.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Dr. Fischer testified at his deposition that the administration of Trientine had caused neurological damage to Williams. At trial, Dr. Fischer noted that he had thought Trientine caused Williams' deterioration, but he began to question his belief after the second depositions of doctors at the Wilson's Disease Center and after his review of the 2017 MRI. He recognized the other doctors' depositions had cast doubt on his opinion that Trientine caused Williams' neurological damage. During cross-examination, Mercy's counsel impeached Dr. Fischer for doubting his own opinion, but Dr. Fischer did not deny Williams' condition had worsened within months after she first took Trientine. To the extent there was any variance in Dr. Fischer's testimony regarding the Trientine, the impeachment of Dr. Fischer was an adequate remedial measure. The remedy for variances in deposition and trial testimony is cross-examination.\n    <em>\n     Beverly\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656367\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/545/864/#p870\">\n     545 S.W.3d at 871\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The decision to allow Dr. Fischer to cast doubt on his previously stated opinion regarding whether Trientine caused Williams' neurological deterioration after he viewed the 2017 MRI was not an abuse of discretion in that it was not so arbitrary and unreasonable as to indicate a lack of careful consideration by the circuit court and did not materially affect the merits of this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    <em>\n     2. Testimony Regarding Timing\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Mercy next argues Dr. Fischer \"revised his opinions about when [Williams] needed to have been treated and offered new bases for his opinions that [Williams'] outcome would have been better if she had been treated earlier.\" Specifically, Mercy argues the change in Dr.\n    Fischer's trial testimony \"substantially enlarge[ed] the time when Dr. Pilapil's alleged negligence might have mattered to [Williams'] conduct.\" Mercy's argument is without merit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Dr. Fischer was consistent in his opinion that, had Williams been treated earlier, she would have been normal. During the deposition, Dr. Fischer testified that had Dr. Pilapil made a diagnosis in December 2012 or January 2013, Williams would have been \"totally normal.\" He testified that had the diagnosis occurred in May 2013, \"the outcome ... would have been significantly better than it is and was\" and Williams would be \"almost normal.\" He then stated that had she been diagnosed on June 28, 2013, \"she would not have gotten as bad\" and \"her ultimate outcome would have been better.\" According to Dr. Fischer, each day that passed without a diagnosis between March and August 2013 worsened Williams' ultimate condition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    At trial, Dr. Fischer's testimony was similar. He testified, \"It is my opinion that had the condition been diagnosed in late 2012, earlier in 2013, even getting up to as far as maybe May of 2013, [Williams] would be normal or essentially normal.\" He further testified that the first record that mentioned symptoms of dystonia was made on June 28, 2013, and that the damage referenced was reversible. Dr. Fischer's trial testimony was not different than his deposition testimony. His opinion as to when Williams' brain damage was reversible was consistent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    Mercy also points out the term \"necrosis,\" which Dr. Fischer mentioned once at trial, was not mentioned in his deposition. The term \"necrosis\" appeared on the 2013 MRI, which Dr. Fischer had in his file at the time of his deposition. During the deposition, Dr. Fischer stated he reviewed the 2013 MRI images and report. At the deposition, Mercy questioned Dr. Fischer about the findings on the MRI report. Mercy had the opportunity to question him about the meaning of the term \"necrosis\" on the report, but it did not.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Again, Mercy had the opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Fischer and to impeach him regarding any potential variance in his testimony, which was an adequate remedial measure.\n    <em>\n     Beverly\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656367\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/545/864/#p870\">\n     545 S.W.3d at 871\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Testimony Regarding Unilateral Versus Bilateral Tremors\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    In its third claim of error regarding Dr. Fischer's testimony, Mercy argues the circuit court abused its discretion in admitting his trial testimony regarding unilateral and bilateral tremors because he did not discuss the distinction between these two tremors during his deposition, and because, during his deposition, Dr. Fischer stated that he would not offer standard-of-care testimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    The circuit court allowed Williams' counsel to question Dr. Fischer about the distinction between unilateral and bilateral tremors in response to Dr. Frucht's earlier testimony that a beta-agonist can cause a unilateral tremor. Dr. Fischer's testimony, in rebuttal, explained potential causes of tremors. He did not testify about Dr. Pilapil's alleged negligence or her alleged violation of the standard of care, and he did not offer a substantially new opinion.

Further, because Mercy's motion to amend the judgment to strike post-judgment interest was not filed within 30 days of the entry of judgment, the circuit court did not have authority to amend the judgment to remove post-judgment interest. The circuit court's judgment is reversed to the extent it deprived Williams of the full value of the jury's award, violating her due process rights, and to the extent it sustained the untimely April 27 motion to amend striking post-judgment interest.

At a post-trial hearing, another one of Williams' economic experts testified the per annum interest rates used to calculate the present value figure presented to the jury ranged between .74% and 5.18% over Williams' 57-year life expectancy. The expert stated that for 55 of the 57 years, an interest rate greater than the statutorily required rate was used for the calculation of the present value figure. According to the expert, for this reason, use of the statutorily required interest rate for periodic payments resulted in a reduction of the value of Williams' award. The expert further testified that if Williams' entire future medical damages award were to be paid periodically at the statutorily required interest rate, she would need an award of approximately $40 million, rather than the $17,758,161 figure heard by the jury, to fully fund her life care plan.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-141\">\n     According to the United States Department of Treasury website, the coupon issue yield equivalent of the average accepted auction price for the last auction of 52-week United States Treasury bills settled immediately prior to June 23, 2017, was 1.21.\n     <em>\n      Daily Treasury Bill Rates Data\n     </em>\n     , U.S. Dep't Treasury , https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=billRatesYear&amp;year=2017 (last visited Jan. 11, 2019).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-142\">\n     It is conceivable that the interest rate requirement of section 538.220.2 could be constitutional when applied to a different set of facts.
