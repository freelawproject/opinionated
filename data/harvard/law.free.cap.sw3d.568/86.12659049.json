Vater appeals from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri, upholding the Director of Revenue's suspension of Vater's driver's license under section 302.505.1 after her arrest for driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum of law has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
