Because R.M.A.'s petition alleges facts that (if taken as true, as required by the standard of review) establish the elements of a claim under section 213.065, the judgment of the circuit court is vacated, and the case is remanded. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to article V, section 10, of the Missouri Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In October 2014, R.M.A. filed a charge of discrimination with the Missouri Commission on Human Rights (\"Commission\") alleging he was discriminated against in a public accommodation on the grounds of his sex. In July 2015, the Commission issued a notice of right to sue, which terminated its administrative proceedings. Then, following an unsuccessful attempt to obtain relief via a writ of mandamus,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   R.M.A. filed suit in October 2015 against the School District and the School Board (collectively, \"Defendants\"). R.M.A.'s petition alleges his \"legal sex is male\" and that, by denying him \"access to the boys' restrooms and locker rooms,\" Defendants have discriminated against him in the use of a public accommodation \"on the grounds of his sex\" in violation of section 213.065.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In November 2015, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The motion asserts two grounds for dismissal: (1) the MHRA does not cover claims based on gender identity and (2) Defendants are not \"persons\" as defined by section 213.010(14) and used in section 213.065.2. From September 2015 through May 2016, both R.M.A. and Defendants made numerous filings with the circuit court regarding Defendants' motion to dismiss. Then, in June 2016, the circuit court sustained Defendants' motion to dismiss without explanation and entered judgment dismissing R.M.A.'s petition with prejudice. This timely appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellate courts review \"a trial court's grant of a motion to dismiss ... de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

R.M.A. alleges Defendants have denied him (and, in 2015 when the petition was filed, were continuing to deny him) \"access to the boys' restrooms and locker rooms.\" Petition at \u00b6 31,\n   <em>\n    R.M.A. v.

Section 213.065 protects the following classes: \"race, color, religion, national origin, sex, ancestry, or disability,\" and the petition specifically alleges that \"R.M.A.'s legal sex is male.\" Petition at \u00b6 25.

The Fourth Circuit reversed, and in doing so held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [W]hile it is true Title VII does not afford a cause of action for discrimination based upon sexual orientation, Wrightson does not allege that he was discriminated against because he is heterosexual.

R.M.A.'s petition alleges he is a member of a protected class, he was discriminated against in the use of a public accommodation, his status as a member of a protected class was the basis for the discrimination he suffered, and he sustained damages, as required by section 213.065. At this stage of the proceedings,\n   that is all that is required of R.M.A; therefore, the circuit court should have overruled Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants also argue that, even if the Court finds they engaged in impermissible discrimination on the grounds of sex, they cannot be held liable under section 213.065 because neither Defendant is a \"person\" under the MHRA. This Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Section 213.065.2 provides: \"It is an unlawful discriminatory practice for\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any person\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold from or deny any other person ... any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, services, or privileges made available in any place of public accommodation ... on the grounds of ... sex.\" (Emphasis added.) The definition of the term \"person,\" as used in chapter 213, is set forth in section 213.010(14), which provides a person \"includes one or more individuals, corporations, partnerships, associations, organizations, labor organizations, legal representatives, mutual companies, joint stock companies, trusts, trustees, trustees in bankruptcy, receivers, fiduciaries, or other organized groups of persons.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants assert that, because section 213.010(14) does not specifically list \"school district,\" \"school board,\" or, more generally, a \"subdivision\" of the state, neither of them is a \"person\" as defined in section 213.010(14) and used in section 213.065.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   This argument fails because the definition of \"person\" in section 213.010(14) expressly states that it \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     includes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \" the individuals and entities listed therein, not that it is limited to them.

The principal opinion holds the analysis is simple and straightforward: the circuit court erred by dismissing R.M.A.'s petition because he alleges his legal sex is male and that Defendants discriminated based on his sex. This analysis is simple and straightforward, but it is also incorrect. R.M.A. alleged he is a\n   <em>\n    biological\n   </em>\n   female whose\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   sex is male. R.M.A. alleged Defendants discriminated unlawfully by barring him from the boys' restrooms and locker room because he \"is transgender and is alleged to have female genitalia.\" The MHRA prohibits sex discrimination and does not bar discrimination based on transgender status. The petition, therefore, fails to state a claim of unlawful sex discrimination under the MHRA.

By focusing on R.M.A.'s allegation that his \"legal sex\" is male while ignoring the allegation he is biologically female who transitioned to living as a male and self-identifies as male, the principal opinion implicitly, and without analysis, incorrectly extends the MHRA beyond biological sex to include claims of discrimination based on transgender status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    The MHRA prohibits discrimination on grounds of biological sex\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \"This Court's primary rule of statutory interpretation is to give effect to legislative intent as reflected in the plain language of the statute at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Laut v.

To the contrary, the fact the General Assembly expressly distinguished \"sex\" from \"sexual orientation\" while repeatedly declining proposed amendments to extend the MHRA to include claims based on sexual orientation or gender identity confirms that unlawful discrimination on grounds of \"sex\" refers only to discrimination based on biological sex.
