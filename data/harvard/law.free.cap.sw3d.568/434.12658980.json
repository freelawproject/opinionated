First Class contends the court erred in denying the motion to compel because the plain language of the arbitration agreement required the parties to arbitrate their disputes. First Class also argues that the court, which had originally granted the motion to compel arbitration but later denied it upon reconsideration, lacked the authority to reconsider its order because the proceedings had been stayed until completion of the arbitration process. For reasons explained herein, we affirm the denial of the motion to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Salsmans agreed to purchase the home of Vincent and Shauna Leonard (collectively, \"the Leonards\") in Grain Valley. The Salsmans allege that, during the course of negotiations, the Leonards represented that they had built the home approximately twelve years earlier and that there were no problems or flaws concerning the home's walls or exterior brick. Prior to closing on the home, the Salsmans retained First Class to perform a pre-purchase inspection of the home. The inspection and subsequent report given to the Salsmans did not identify any mold or water damage on the property. After the purchase occurred, however, the Salsmans\n   discovered mold and water damage in the home's basement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Salsmans filed a petition for damages against the Leonards and First Class alleging breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and negligence. First Class filed a motion to compel arbitration asserting that its inspection agreement with the Salsmans contained a valid arbitration clause, which required that this dispute be submitted to final and binding arbitration. The clause stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Any dispute, controversy, interpretation, or claim including claims for, but not limited to, breach of contract, any form of negligence, fraud, misinterpretation, or any other theory of liability arising out of, from, or related to this contract or arising out of, from, or related to the Inspection performed or The Inspection Report shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration under the\n   <em>\n    Rules and Procedures of the Expedited Arbitration of Home Inspection Disputes of Construction arbitration [sic] Services, Inc\n   </em>\n   . The arbitrator appointed must be knowledgeable in and familiar with the professional home industry. The decision of the arbitrator appointed shall be final and binding, and judgment of the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Emphasis in original). The circuit court initially determined that the arbitration agreement was valid and ordered First Class and the Salsmans to arbitration. The order also stated that a jury trial would proceed to dispose of the Salsmans' allegations against the Leonards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Several months later, the Salsmans filed a motion for reconsideration asserting that the arbitration agreement was impossible to perform as written because Construction Arbitration Services, Inc., (\"CAS\"), the arbitration entity named as the arbitral body for the parties' disputes, had stopped providing arbitration services approximately six years prior to the formation of the inspection contract between the Salsmans and First Class. The Salsmans requested that the court reconsider its prior ruling and either deny the motion to compel arbitration or specify which language in the arbitration agreement the court had reformed to make their compliance with the order possible. The circuit court granted the Salsmans' motion to reconsider, vacated its previous order, and denied First Class's motion to compel arbitration. This interlocutory appeal followed. Both parties agree that this appeal is properly before this court pursuant to Section 435.440.1(1), RSMo 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Whether the circuit court properly granted or denied a motion to compel arbitration is a question of law that we review\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ellis v.

Point III, relating to the propriety of this appeal, is no longer at issue given the parties' acknowledgment that an interlocutory appeal can be taken from the denial of motion to compel arbitration. The remaining points challenge the circuit court's procedural authority to reconsider the arbitration motion and the substantive basis for the denial. We will first address the procedural arguments in Points IV and II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Motion for Reconsideration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In Point IV, First Class asserts that the circuit court erred in granting the Salsmans' motion for reconsideration because it lacked jurisdiction to enter further orders after compelling the parties to arbitrate their dispute. First Class contends the court could re-establish jurisdiction over the case only after the binding arbitration proceeding was complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In discussing jurisdiction, the Supreme Court explained that Missouri courts recognize two kinds of jurisdiction-personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    J.C.W. ex rel. Webb v. Wyciskalla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/#p252\">\n    275 S.W.3d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 252 (Mo banc 2009). \"In modern terms, personal jurisdiction refers quite simply to the power of a court to require a person to respond to a legal proceeding that may affect the person's rights or interests.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/#p252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/#p252\">\n    at 252-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Subject matter jurisdiction refers to \"the court's authority to render a judgment in a particular category of case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/#p252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/#p252\">\n    at 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Personal jurisdiction derives from the federal Constitution, while subject matter jurisdiction arises from article V, section 14 of the state's constitution, which reads, in pertinent part: \"(a) The circuit courts shall have original jurisdiction over all cases and matters, civil and criminal. Such courts may issue and determine original remedial writs and shall sit at times and places within the circuit as determined by the circuit court.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Webb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/#p252\">\n    275 S.W.3d at 253-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   First Class's argument implicitly asks us to reverse the circuit court pursuant to an understanding of subject matter jurisdiction renounced in\n   <em>\n    Webb\n   </em>\n   . Prior to\n   <em>\n    Webb\n   </em>\n   , some courts discussed a third conceptualization of \"jurisdictional competence,\" which referred to cases in which the court undoubtedly had subject matter jurisdiction but a party asserted that a statutory provision or procedural consideration curtailed or removed the\n   <em>\n    jurisdictional\n   </em>\n   authority of a court to enter a specific judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/#p252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/#p252\">\n    at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Webb\n   </em>\n   , however, that concept was replaced with the understanding that, \"[w]hen a statute speaks in jurisdictional terms or can be read in such terms, it is proper to read it as merely setting statutory limits on remedies or elements of claims for relief that courts may grant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/#p252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/#p252\">\n    at 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Understanding that distinction, we turn to the Uniform Arbitration Act (\"UAA\") to determine the court's authority in regard to the motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The UAA grants the circuit court the\n   <em>\n    statutory\n   </em>\n   authority to hear motions concerning the existence of arbitration agreements and establishes the available remedies. \u00a7 435.355. The Act allows the court to \"summarily\" determine whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement and, in cases where the court concludes a valid agreement exists, order the parties to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/#p252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   First Class asserts that, in cases where the parties are ordered to arbitration, the court loses jurisdiction over the proceeding until arbitration is complete. As discussed,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , following the holding in\n   <em>\n    Webb\n   </em>\n   , First Class's contention is actually that the court lacked statutory authority to enter an order on the\n   motion for reconsideration. First Class has provided no authority, statutory or otherwise, to support this contention. In fact, the UAA clearly provides the court the statutory authority to act prior to the submission of an arbitrator's award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 435.360 (authority to appoint arbitrators in certain circumstances); \u00a7 435.370 (authority to compel arbitrators to promptly proceed to hearing and disposition); \u00a7 435.380 (authority to enforce subpoenas issued by or on the behalf of arbitrators); \u00a7 435.385 (authority to fix dates for the making of an award in certain circumstances). The UAA limits the remedies the circuit court can provide both pre- and post-award, but it does nothing to limit the court's authority to hear the motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First Class mistakenly relies on our decision in\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Telecom Mgmt., Inc. v. O'Mally\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11830484\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/965/215/\">\n    965 S.W.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. W.D. 1998), to support its claim of lost authority. In\n   <em>\n    O'Mally\n   </em>\n   , the circuit court, after finding that \"the panel had been arbitrary and biased against [one party],\" ordered the recusal of the arbitrators and the sealing of all documents and orders from the arbitration proceeding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11830484\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/965/215/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11830484\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/965/215/\">\n    at 217-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We reversed, finding that there was no statutory authority to order the recusal of arbitrators prior to their making an award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11830484\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/965/215/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11830484\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/965/215/\">\n    at 220-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In direct conflict with First Class's assertion, however, we stated that remedial authority for pre-award court intervention is set forth in Sections 435.350 and 435.355, which allow courts to determine the existence or enforceability of a contested arbitration provision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11830484\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/965/215/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11830484\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/965/215/\">\n    at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nothing in\n   <em>\n    O'Mally\n   </em>\n   supports First Class's contention that the court was without jurisdiction to hear the Salsmans' motion for reconsideration. Point IV is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In Point II, First Class argues that the circuit court abused its discretion in granting the Salsmans' motion for reconsideration because it failed to identify any grounds or bases for its decision. We find no error in the court's summary determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The circuit court initially entered an interlocutory order ordering the parties to arbitrate their dispute. However, \"Missouri does not follow the doctrine that a motion once ruled cannot be reconsidered.\"\n   <em>\n    Nicholson v. Surrey Vacation Resorts, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6863156\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/463/358/#p365\">\n    463 S.W.3d 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 365 (Mo. App. S.D. 2015). \"At any time before final judgment a court may open, amend, reverse or vacate an interlocutory order.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6863156\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/463/358/#p365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citation and quotations omitted). Thus, the court's original motion was open to reconsideration, and First Class has cited no authority that specifically curtails the court's ability to enter an order reversing its prior entry. Furthermore, First Class's contention that the second arbitration order did not specify the grounds for reconsideration is unavailing, as summary orders are permitted by statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   First Class argues that the court's grant of the Salsmans' motion for reconsideration in close temporal proximity to the scheduled arbitration date was an abuse of discretion similar to that found in\n   <em>\n    Simpkins v. Ryder Freight Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11290502\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/855/416/#p422\">\n    855 S.W.2d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 422 (Mo. App. W.D. 1993). At the close of the evidence in\n   <em>\n    Simpkins\n   </em>\n   , the circuit court vacated an interlocutory judgment of default that it had previously entered as a sanction for discovery violations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11290502\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/855/416/#p422\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11290502\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/855/416/#p422\">\n    at 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We reversed and remanded for a new trial because the vacated order charged the jury with the issue of liability when that issue had already been determined by default and there was \"no intimation in the record that the decision to vacate the interlocutory judgment of default was to correct an error, or to undo an oppressive order, or for any other end of the administration of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11290502\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/855/416/#p422\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11290502\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/855/416/#p422\">\n    at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We were particularly concerned that the burden of proof had been reimposed on a party after it was stripped of any ability to present proof of liability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11290502\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/855/416/#p422\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11290502\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/855/416/#p422\">\n    at 421-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nothing in the record in this case, however, presents similar concerns for First Class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After arguing that \"the agreement to arbitrate establishes that the Home Inspection Dispute Construction Arbitration Services, Inc. as the entity to administer and fully settle ... any dispute, controversy, interpretation, or claim between the parties[,]\" First Class retained the services of a different arbitrator, Construction Dispute Resolution Services, LLC (\"CDRS\"). When discussions between the parties' counsel stalled, First Class paid the Salsmans' half of the arbitration fee and requested CDRS begin the proceedings based on the court order compelling arbitration. The Salsmans then filed the motion to reconsider asking the court to either reverse the previous order or identify which portions of the contract were being reformed to allow CDRS to arbitrate in place of CAS. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Simpkins\n   </em>\n   , the court in this case did not vacate its original order after First Class's opportunity to present any evidence or make arguments in support of its motion to compel had lapsed. In fact, First Class was able to present arguments in opposition to the motion to reconsider.\n   <em>\n    Simpkins\n   </em>\n   presented unique circumstances concerning the ongoing effect of an interlocutory order of default. First Class's contention that the payment of an arbitration fee and the assignment of an arbitrator somehow severs the court's authority to act finds no support in\n   <em>\n    Simpkins\n   </em>\n   . Consequently, Point II is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Enforceability of Arbitration Provision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In Point I, First Class argues that the circuit court erred in granting the Salsmans' motion for reconsideration because the plain language of the agreement required the parties to arbitrate their disputes. First Class contends that the public policy favoring arbitration is so strong, we should default to arbitration on any discrepancy between the contract and the current arbitration proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We consider three factors in reviewing a motion to compel arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Frye v.

App. W.D. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First Class argues that the language of the arbitration clause is not ambiguous and plainly requires that the parties proceed to arbitration for disposition of the Salsmans' claims. The arbitration clause states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Any dispute, controversy, interpretation, or claim including claims for, but not limited to, breach of contract, any form of negligence, fraud, misinterpretation, or any other theory of liability arising out of, from, or related to this contract or arising out of, from, or related to the Inspection performed or The Inspection Report shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration under the\n   <em>\n    Rules and Procedures of the Expedited Arbitration of Home Inspection Disputes of Construction arbitration [sic] Services, Inc\n   </em>\n   . The arbitrator appointed must be knowledgeable in and familiar with the professional home industry. The decision of the arbitrator appointed shall be final and binding, and judgment of the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (Emphasis in original). First Class initially argued before the circuit court that \"the agreement to arbitrate establishes [CAS] as the entity to administer and fully settle ... any dispute, controversy, interpretation, or claim between the parties.\" After the Salsmans informed the court that CAS was defunct and no longer provided arbitrations, however, First Class argued that \"a simple [G]oogle search of either phrases (1) 'Home Inspection Dispute Arbitration Services, Inc.' or (2) 'Rules and Procedures of the Expedited Arbitration of Home Inspection Dispute arbitration Services, Inc.' results in the very first listings of Construction\n   Dispute Resolution Services, LLC ... and their website.\" This parol evidence is inadmissible to vary or contradict the terms of the agreement that First Class concedes are both complete and unambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090044\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/48/649/#p658\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And even if it were admissible, we can find no support for First Class's contention that, absent a specific provision expressing as much, the court's interpretation of a contractual agreement should be bound by a company's deft exploitation of Google search algorithms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Further, First Class essentially asks that we read the underlined portion of the arbitration clause out of the agreement entirely. Confusingly, First Class's arbitration agreement with CDRS, which was attached as an exhibit to First Class's response to the motion for reconsideration, attempted to have the Salsmans consent to an arbitration that would be \"conducted according to the CDRS Home Inspection Arbitration Rules and Procedures.\" This proposed rule and procedure system directly conflicts with the portion of the agreement between First Class and the Salsmans stating that the arbitration would proceed under the rules and procedures of CAS. We decline to engage in any reading of the parties' contract that invalidates portions of the agreement at the will of First Class. \"A construction that attributes a reasonable meaning to all the provisions of the agreement is preferred to one that leaves some of the provisions without function or sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Dunn Indus.

In fact, the Supreme Court of the United States has reiterated that the national policy favoring arbitration \" 'appli[es] in state as well as federal courts' and 'forecloses state legislative attempts to undercut the enforceability of arbitration agreements.' \"\n   <em>\n    Preston v.
