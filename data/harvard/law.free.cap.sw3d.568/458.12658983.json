He was investigated for alleged misconduct, which resulted in prison discipline, but no criminal charges. Evans filed a petition for expungement of the records of the prison misconduct investigation pursuant to \u00a7 610.122, RSMo. The circuit court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, because Evans did not seek expungement of the sort of \"records of arrest\" addressed in \u00a7 610.122, RSMo, and because he was ineligible for expungement because he had been previously convicted of a felony. Evans\n   appeals. We affirm. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, we have provided the parties an unpublished memorandum setting forth the reasons for this order. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
