His mother, Rodericka Bryant, took him with her to visit her friend, Terrah Love, at Love's apartment building, The 550 Apartments (Apartments). Roderick Moss, who was involved in an ongoing feud with Love and others, came to the complex and began shooting. One of the stray bullets hit Davion and he ultimately died from the injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bryant then sued Louisville Metro Housing Authority (LMHA), the owner and property management company of Apartments, and Juanita Mitchell, the property manager, for their failure to evict Love, thereby negligently causing Davion's death. Both the circuit court and the Court of Appeals held that LMHA was cloaked in governmental immunity, and Mitchell was shielded by qualified official immunity; thus, Bryant's case was dismissed. Although we find the events of this case troubling and heartbreaking, we must affirm both courts and hold that LMHA and Mitchell are both protected by the immunity doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2003, the City of Louisville and Jefferson County merged to form Louisville/Jefferson County Metropolitan Government (Louisville Metro), pursuant to Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) Chapter 67C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Louisville Metro is entitled to sovereign immunity as a matter of statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As part of this merger, the former Housing Authority of Louisville and the former Housing Authority of Jefferson County were also merged into a new entity: LMHA. LMHA is governed pursuant to KRS Chapter 80, which provides that authorities can be created \"for the purpose of providing adequate and sanitary living quarters for individuals or families[.]\" KRS 80.020(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As part of that purpose, LMHA owns, operates, and manages thousands of units available for low-income housing throughout Jefferson County. Most of LMHA's budget comes from federal funding and grants but LMHA also utilizes some state and local government funds. LMHA owns and operates Apartments as subsidized, public housing for low-income individuals and families pursuant to this purpose. Juanita Mitchell served as Apartments' property manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Terrah Love became a tenant at Apartments in February of 2008. Her rent was $45 per month. In September 2008, Mitchell sent Love a \"30 Day Lease Termination Letter with 'No Right to Cure' \", citing \"Material Non-Compliance with the Rental Agreement or Resident Rules.\" In that letter, Mitchell specifically cited to Section 7 of the Lease Agreement, which provided that the Resident and the Resident's guests and visitors must refrain from \"conduct which ... [i]s unlawful, unsafe, irresponsible, disorderly or violent or a hazard to the safety of any persons or property, including Resident, Household members, visitors, neighbors or Management staff[.]\" According to Mitchell, this violation arose from an allegation that Love was allowing persons not listed on the lease to live in the apartment. On April 13, 2010, a forcible detainer judgment was entered against Love; however, no further action was taken, and Love remained a tenant at Apartments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 3, 2011, Love was cited with a \"Warning Letter\" from Apartments. The letter stated that Love had violated\n   the lease by harboring pit bulls and creating a disturbance for neighbors through loud noise and music. On February 8, 2011, the Louisville Metro Police Department responded to a report of violence between Love and a boyfriend in front of her children. Love was initially charged with assault, fourth degree, however, it appears that her charges were later dismissed. In April, Love was sent a \"14 Day Lease Termination Letter.\" Mitchell once again cited to Section 7 of the Lease. Love attempted to pay her rent in April, but Mitchell sent the payment back to Love, stating that because of the 14-day termination, Mitchell and Apartments could not accept the payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mitchell also completed what was called a Form A, which states grounds for eviction in relation to a certain tenant. Mitchell stated that she had filled out such a document regarding Love and reported that LMHA had been notified that Love had been involved in \"shootings and physical fights with other residents.\" Mitchell retired on April 30, 2011. Mitchell's successor also completed Form A as to Love and LMHA filed a forcible detainer action against Love on May 12, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   However, before Love was evicted, tragedy struck. Love had been in an ongoing feud with another woman, Taneisha, over a man they were both seeing. It seems that Moss was friends with Taneisha and decided to take matters into his own hands. He approached Love's apartment on May 13, 2011. Love and several friends were gathered outside the apartment complex while the children, including Davion, were inside playing. Moss took out a gun and began shooting. As a result, Davion was shot in the head and succumbed to his injuries three days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Thus, while Louisville Metro maintains sovereign immunity, LMHA, even as a state agency, would never be entitled to sovereign immunity.

First, its parent entity is Louisville Metro, a government protected by sovereign immunity. The statutes portray sufficient control for this prong of the\n   <em>\n    Comair\n   </em>\n   test to be met. Second, the purpose of LMHA is a governmental one and it is integral to a state function. Although many of the factors we consider in this determination are not as clearly defined when examining LMHA, the legislative directive in creating LMHA supports a holding that LMHA is shielded by governmental immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a.

As we have made clear, governmental immunity is an extension of the parent's sovereign immunity. Here, LMHA was explicitly created, according to statute, by Louisville Metro. \"A county 'is a political subdivision of the Commonwealth as well, and as such is an arm of the state government. It, too, is clothed with the same sovereign immunity' ...

Louisville Metro, then, is clearly cloaked in sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Bryant argues that the statutory framework through which LMHA operates makes it a separate entity, and the immunity afforded to Louisville Metro should not be expanded to encompass LMHA. However, there is sufficient control authorized under KRS Chapter 80 to find a connection adequate for this prong of the\n   <em>\n    Comair\n   </em>\n   test. The housing authority is formulated pursuant to statute, with significant control by the Louisville Metro mayor and approval by the Louisville Metro Council.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   KRS 80.266(1). The legislature prescribed the manner through which a housing authority can contract for certain services. \"No contract or agreement with any contractor for the construction of low-income housing exceeding ten thousand dollars [ ] shall be made without advertising for bids. The bids shall be opened publicly and an award made to the best bidder, with power in the authority to reject any or all bids.\" KRS 80.130. The city attorney is statutorily authorized to conduct condemnation proceedings for the housing authority and \"the form and manner of [such] proceedings shall be the same as that provided in the Eminent Domain Act of Kentucky.\" KRS 80.150. These statutes portray a definitive, albeit more removed than other agencies of the government, control from the legislative and executive branches over LMHA. This control is sufficient to find that the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Comair\n   </em>\n   test is met. LMHA is a derivative agency of Louisville Metro.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. Integral state function\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The more important question, however, is whether LMHA is performing an integral state function. \"The question of whether an entity carries out an integral state function has remained the primary focus of our sovereign immunity analysis since at least the turn of the twentieth century.\"\n   <em>\n    Coppage,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6876273\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/459/855/#p859\">\n    459 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   862 (citing\n   <em>\n    Comair,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7298108\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/295/91/#p94\">\n    295 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   99 (citing\n   <em>\n    Gross v.

LMHA provides an alternative for those who are unable to engage with those private companies. LMHA is statutorily limited in setting rental fees.

As we have recognized, there is a fine line between \"public purpose\" and \"integral state function.\" However, the clarifying point here derives from the General Assembly's statements in creating housing authorities. The General Assembly has conclusively established its motive and statement of policy as to public housing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   It is hereby declared that there exist in Kentucky unsafe and unsanitary housing\n   conditions and a shortage of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low income; that these conditions necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and safety, fire and accident protection, and other public services and facilities; and that the public interest requires the remedying of these conditions. It is further declared that the assistance provided in KRS 80.280 to 80.300 for\n   <em>\n    the remedying of such conditions constitutes a public use and purpose and an essential governmental function for which public money may be spent and other aid given;\n   </em>\n   that it is a proper public purpose for any public body to aid any housing authority located or operating within its boundaries or jurisdiction, as the public body derives immediate benefits and advantages from such a housing authority or developments; and that the provisions of KRS 80.280 to 80.300 are necessary in the public interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   KRS 80.270 (emphasis added).

Although the question of whether an entity is immune is a judicial question,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the question of whether a function is \"integral\" to the state can turn on the question of public policy. The Commonwealth, through its General Assembly, determines what priorities, responsibilities, duties, and functions the state chooses to undertake. Thus, the General Assembly, to a certain extent, must have the legislative prerogative to enunciate\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   is integral to the state's function. Granted, such a statement cannot be a broad, vague declaration without proof in the actual record; otherwise, the immunity doctrine would become a legislative whim rather than a judicial determination. However, we acknowledge, especially given the Commonwealth's strong stance on the doctrine of separation of powers,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the legislative statement of public policy\n   <em>\n    informs\n   </em>\n   the judiciary's decision of whether a function is essential, or integral, to the administration of the Commonwealth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Given this background, we further acknowledge that the General Assembly created housing authorities to administer\n   duties that it recognized as essential and integral to the policy of the Commonwealth. LMHA was created for fulfilling this statutory responsibility. It functions within Louisville Metro to provide housing for low-income to moderate-income families and individuals. Such a function is essential, per the policy of the General Assembly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We must also determine whether the purpose of the entity is one of statewide concern or merely a local prerogative. \"The focus ... is on state level governmental concerns that are common to all of the citizens of this state, even though those concerns may be addressed by smaller geographic entities (e.g., by counties).\"\n   <em>\n    Comair,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7298108\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/295/91/#p94\">\n    295 S.W.3d at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"In other words, without [the agency] performing its function, the state-level concern would not be fully addressed.\"\n   <em>\n    Bibelhauser,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6938272\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/432/171/#p174\">\n    432 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   174 (citing\n   <em>\n    Stanford,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4235382\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/948/729/#p737\">\n    948 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   739 ). Although LMHA functions to serve a distinct, local area, it is intended to address a statewide concern. Once again, the General Assembly has spoken: it stated that providing low to moderate-income housing is one of statewide concern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   KRS 80.270. Thus, while LMHA provides services for Louisville Metro customers only, but for its operation, the statewide \"concern would not be fully addressed.\" LMHA works in tandem with housing authorities throughout the Commonwealth to protect and provide assistance on this statewide concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Bryant has also advanced the argument that the statutory language in creating housing authorities impliedly waived any immunity it might have otherwise had. Specifically, she cites to KRS 80.050, which states that a housing authority constituted under the chapter is \"a body corporate ... with power to contract and be contracted with, to sue or be sued, and to adopt a seal and alter it at will.\" However, our Commonwealth's highest courts have previously held that such language does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   waive immunity from tort. In\n   <em>\n    Wallace v. Laurel County Bd. of Educ.,\n   </em>\n   this Court's predecessor held: \"the right given by the statute to sue an arm of the state ... permitted suit against it on contracts; or to protect one's property; but such authority to sue did not embrace an action for tort committed by any of its officers or agents in the performance of a public duty.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2717602\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ky/287/454/\">\n    287 Ky. 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=153%20S.W.2d%20915\">\n    153 S.W.2d 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 916-17 (1941).

Thus, the bare language of \"sue or be sued\" is inadequate, on its own, to exhibit a legislative intent to waive immunity on behalf of a governmental agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In conclusion, LMHA is performing an integral state function. Its services are provided for a governmental, rather than a proprietary, purpose. The General Assembly has clearly articulated the Commonwealth's policy position on providing such housing. LMHA, although localized in specific\n   service, works to aid in the fulfillment of a statewide goal. The second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Comair\n   </em>\n   element is met.

Bryant argues that the following lease provisions create a ministerial duty for Mitchell: Section F(7):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   The Resident is responsible to refrain from, and cause household members, guests, visitors and individuals in and around the unit by authority, permission or invitation of the Resident or the Resident household members to refrain from any conduct which:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (a) Is unlawful, unsafe, irresponsible, disorderly or violent or a hazard to the safety of any persons or property, including Resident, household members, visitors, neighbors or Management staff;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (b) Creates a nuisance or violates the City's Unnecessary Noise Ordinance (Municipal Ordinance 132.04).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (c) Is criminal activity that threatens the health and safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises of [LMHA] by Residents or employees of [LMHA].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Further, the lease provided at the end of Section F:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A single noncurable violation of any of the terms and conditions of Section F, RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE RESIDENT including but not limited to any drug-related or criminal activity by Resident, or Resident's family members, guests, visitors, or individuals on LMHA property at the invitation of Resident or under the control of Resident shall be deemed a serious violation of material terms of this lease and good cause for termination of this residential lease without further opportunity to cure or remedy the violation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Section L(3) also stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Any criminal activity that threatens the health and safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of the Premises of [LMHA] by Residents or employees of [LMHA] or drug-related criminal activity on or off the premises, engaged in by a public housing tenant[,] any member of the tenant's household, or any guest or other person under the tenant's control, shall be cause for termination of the tenancy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Mitchell does not dispute that Love violated the terms of her lease and specifically cited to Section F(7) in the warnings and notices sent to Love. Thus, if the finding of that violation creates an\n   <em>\n    absolute duty\n   </em>\n   to evict, then the act is ministerial, and Mitchell is not entitled to immunity. However, if Mitchell still retained discretion in making the decision to evict, there is no ministerial duty. The premise of Bryant's argument is that the \"shall\" language is a\n   <em>\n    mandatory\n   </em>\n   , and thus ministerial, duty once the provision of the lease has been violated. But Bryant misinterprets the language of the lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Perhaps if the lease stated that any of these violations \"shall result in termination,\" we may adopt Bryant's interpretation. However, all the lease states is that the violations in question \"shall be deemed a serious violation of material terms of this lease and good cause for termination\" or \"shall be cause for termination of the tenancy.\" This does not result in automatic eviction; it only puts residents on notice that, should they violate these particular provisions, LMHA has the contractual authority to immediately evict. It does not create a mandatory duty for LMHA or Mitchell to evict; it provides them the opportunity to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Bryant correctly states that the term \"shall\" is usually interpreted as a mandatory directive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seeger v. Lanham,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655961\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/542/286/#p290\">\n    542 S.W.3d 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 290 (Ky. 2018). But \"the rest of the sentence ... must be acknowledged.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655961\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/542/286/#p290\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The word \"shall\" is an auxiliary verb; it must be followed by another action. The reader must ask: the subject shall what? Here, the violation shall: (1) \"be deemed a serious violation of material terms[;]\" (2) be \"good cause for termination of this residential lease without further opportunity to cure or remedy the violation[;]\" and (3) \"be cause for termination of the tenancy.\" These directives can be summed up as stating that these violations shall be deemed sufficient for LMHA to\n   <em>\n    make the decision\n   </em>\n   to immediately evict. It does not place a requirement upon the landlord to do so, however. The lease provisions allow for the landlord and LMHA to make the final appropriate decision given the specific facts. Due to this rather broad grant of discretion, we must hold that the lease provisions do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   create a ministerial duty and Mitchell was performing discretionary tasks in making the decision of whether to evict Love.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Bryant also states that, once the decision to evict was made, Mitchell's task\n   <em>\n    became\n   </em>\n   ministerial. A discretionary act can become a ministerial one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gaither v.

However, the record also belies this assertion. In Mitchell's deposition, plaintiff's counsel specifically asked: \"So even though [the termination letter] says no right to cure, they do have an opportunity to come and demonstrate a willingness and an ability to comply with the lease?\" Mitchell unequivocally responded, \"Yes ... That's true.\" In fact, Mitchell stated that, from the procedure taken in response to Love's 2008 violation, it seems Love cured the violation even though she was sent a termination letter. Plaintiff's counsel also asked whether there was an opportunity to cure a violation leading to a 14-day termination letter. Mitchell stated, \"They always have a right to cure. That's not up to me. When it crosses the desk, then that person, my supervisor, will make that decision.\" Counsel asked: \"[D]oes the manager have the right to say ... I know they got the 14-day letter, they haven't done anything to cure it, but you know what; I like them; I'm not going to prepare the writ [of eviction] and send it on?\" Mitchell responded that \"The supervisor\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   has that privilege.\" (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Per Mitchell, the first step in proceeding in the legal process for eviction is for the manager to fill out a \"Form A.\" That form is sent to the supervisor, then the director and executive director, and then eventually, the lawyers become involved to initiate eviction proceedings. However, the decision to fill out a \"Form A\" arises entirely from the property manager's discretion and decision-making. Counsel asked: \"[Y]ou wouldn't fill out a Form A[ ] unless you thought you had sufficient proof that the person was guilty of what they were guilty of, right?\" Mitchell responded, \"Correct.\" Once again, the decision to initiate the lengthy process for eviction begins with the property manager's ascertainment of the facts, investigation, and ultimate discretion in deciding what action is appropriate. Even once the decision was made, Mitchell responded affirmatively when asked whether she \"had authority ... to stop the eviction process if somebody cured their problems.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Discretionary acts are \"those involving the exercise of discretion and judgment, or personal deliberation, decision, and judgment ...\"\n   <em>\n    Sloas,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8465693\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/201/469/#p475\">\n    201 S.W.3d at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Yanero,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9397757\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/65/510/#p527\">\n    65 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   522 ). \"Discretion in the manner of the performance of an act arises when the act may be performed in one of two or more ways, either of which would be lawful, and where it is left to the will or judgment of the performer to determine in which way it shall be performed.\"\n   <em>\n    Sloas,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8465693\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/201/469/#p475\">\n    201 S.W.3d at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Collins v.
