Mewbourne decided to install a 300-gallon battery tank at a well site there and retained Banta Oilfield Services, Inc. (Banta) to assist in its installation. Mewbourne and Banta entered into a Master Services Agreement (MSA) drafted by Mewbourne, which they both concur governed their relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mewbourne also contracted with Steve Kent Trucking NM, LLC (Kent Trucking) to be a contractor at the well site in New Mexico. It also entered into an agreement with C&amp;M Services, LLC (C&amp;M) wherein C&amp;M would provide services at the site. An individual named Daniel Vargas worked for Kent Trucking and/or C&amp;M Services as either a direct employee, an agent, or a contractor. Vargas was injured at the New Mexico site when a chain slipped off a tank that was being moved by a Banta-owned-and-operated pole truck. Vargas' wife brought suit against Banta in New Mexico for Vargas' personal injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Banta sent a demand letter to Mewbourne seeking defense and indemnity from Mewbourne.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mewbourne refused Banta's demand, informing Banta that Mewbourne was only a pass-through for defense and indemnification and that Banta should demand a defense and indemnity from Kent Trucking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Banta brought suit against Mewbourne seeking a judicial declaration that: (1) Texas substantive law applied to the interpretation of the MSA; (2) Mewbourne breached the agreement; (3) Mewbourne was obligated to defend and indemnify Banta in regard to Vargas' personal injury lawsuit; and (4) Mewbourne was responsible to Banta for court costs and attorney fees. In response, Mewbourne argued that New Mexico law applied and that (under it and the MSA) Banta would be responsible for its own actions. Although the parties agreed that their respective liability would be governed by the terms of the MSA, they disagreed as to the interpretation of the contract. In doing so, they disagreed as to whether Texas law applied to the controversy or whether it would be governed by New Mexico law. After the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court denied Banta's motion and entered judgment in favor of Mewbourne, finding that New Mexico law applied to the parties' MSA and that Banta was estopped from arguing otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On appeal, Banta maintains (1) that Mewbourne's grounds for summary judgment were its affirmative defenses of judicial estoppel and quasi-estoppel, neither of which apply to the facts of this case, and (2) that Banta proved as a matter of law its own entitlement to summary judgment. For the reasons below, we reverse the trial court's order granting summary judgment in favor of Mewbourne, render judgment for Banta on its motion for summary judgment, and remand this case to the trial court for further determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Pleadings at Trial Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As previously stated, Banta sued Mewbourne in the 114th Judicial District Court of Smith County for breach of contract. It also sought a declaratory judgment regarding the enforceability of the asserted defense and indemnity obligations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Banta requested an award of attorney fees. Banta's position rested in large part on a provision in the MSA that stated (1) that any suit shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Tyler, Smith County, Texas, and (2) that \"[a]ll disputes, controversies, or claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement ... shall be governed and controlled by the substantive laws of the State of Texas, excluding any conflict of law or choice of law principles.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Shortly after filing suit, Banta moved for summary judgment on the enforceability of the indemnity provision under Texas law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mewbourne also moved for summary judgment, arguing that New Mexico law applied and that the principles of judicial estoppel and quasi-estoppel were applicable based on Banta's indemnity agreement in a case that involved a different contract, work site, and parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pina v.

Ct. App. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Banta subsequently filed an amended motion for summary judgment wherein it asserted the same arguments contained in its original motion, but also offered additional proof to demonstrate the application of the indemnity agreement as it applied to Vargas' claim. Mewbourne filed an amended response to Banta's amended motion for summary judgment. In its amended response, Mewbourne continued to argue the applicability of the principles of judicial\n   estoppel and quasi-estoppel, but also added a choice-of-law analysis under the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws and argued that the indemnity agreement was invalid under Texas law as applied to gross negligence and willful misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the trial court held two hearings on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, it entered judgment in favor of Mewbourne and denied Banta's motions for summary judgment. Banta appealed, maintaining that the trial court erred in granting Mewbourne's motion for summary judgment and in failing to grant its motion for summary judgment. Banta also contends that it affirmatively demonstrated entitlement to summary judgment on Mewbourne's indemnity obligation. Banta asks this Court to reverse the trial court's judgment in favor of Mewbourne, reverse the trial court's denial of Banta's summary judgment motion, render judgment in favor of Banta on the enforceability of the indemnity provision against Mewbourne and Mewbourne's breach thereof, and remand for a determination on the issues of damages and attorney fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Mewbourne's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In Mewbourne's motion for summary judgment and its supplement to its motion for summary judgment, Mewbourne argued that the application of judicial estoppel and quasi-estoppel prevented Banta from using \"a Texas choice-of-law provision in the Banta/[Mewbourne] MSA to obtain indemnity when, in the past, Banta has used the [NMOAIS] to void indemnity obligations and to thwart a similar choice-of-law provision.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial\n   court found merit in Mewbourne's argument and granted judgment in its favor. Therefore, in order for this Court to affirm the trial court's judgment in favor of Mewbourne, we must initially address Mewbourne's contention that the principles of judicial estoppel and quasi-estoppel are applicable to this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McConnell v.

In\n   <em>\n    Pina\n   </em>\n   , Banta and Gruy entered into a Master Services Contract (MSC) under which Banta agreed to perform work at an oil-well site operated by Gruy in Lea County, New Mexico. The MSC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   contained a choice-of-law provision requiring the application of Texas law to the company's obligation to indemnify the operator from liability for its own negligence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1031. Specifically, the MSC provided that it \"shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of Texas.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Gruy drafted the MSC and signed it in Texas. Banta signed the MSC in New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In addition, Article 10 of the MSC provided that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [t]o the fullest extent permitted by law, [Banta] shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless GRUY ... from and against all claims, damages, losses, liens, causes of action, suits, judgments, fines and expenses, including, but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees (collectively referred to and defined as \"Liabilities\"), of any person or entity arising out of, caused by or resulting directly or indirectly from the performance of the work under this Contract, ... regardless of whether the Liabilities are caused in part by the negligence of any Indemnitee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1030-31. Banta purchased liability insurance from Bituminous.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1031. The policy insured Banta against tort liability assumed by contract and named Gruy as an additional insured.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In March 2003, Pina's wife filed a wrongful death action against Gruy, alleging that her husband had suffered fatal burns in 2002 while employed by Banta at the well site located in Lea County, New Mexico, and which was owned and operated by Gruy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Pina alleged that her husband's injuries were caused by the wrongful conduct of Gruy's agents and employees.

After discussing the amendment to Section 56-7-2, the appellate court stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The Legislature's decision to expressly subordinate freedom of contract to well site safety is a persuasive indicator that the Legislature believed promoting safety at well sites to be an especially important public policy.

In doing so, Mewbourne emphasizes the factual similarities in this case to those contained in\n   <em>\n    Pina\n   </em>\n   , that is, (1) the operator, Gruy, drafted the agreement that included a Texas choice-of-law provision and an indemnity provision; (2) the agreement was signed by Banta in New Mexico; (3) the agreement was signed by the adverse party in Texas; (4) New Mexico was the location of the work to be performed; (5) the event leading to the underlying lawsuit was injury or death to a worker at a well site located in New Mexico; (6) demands for defense and indemnity were made under New Mexico's jurisdiction; and (7) the claims contained in the underlying lawsuit consisted of negligence and gross negligence. Mewbourne points out (1) that in\n   <em>\n    Pina\n   </em>\n   , Banta argued that the choice-of-law provision was void and unenforceable since the accident and lawsuit were in New Mexico and (2) that it received affirmative relief based on its argument. Mewbourne contends that the only time Banta makes any distinction in the two cases is when Banta sues in Texas to obtain a defense and indemnity, as opposed to Banta owing a defense and indemnity under similar contract terms and similar facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Notably, Mewbourne contends that it was not required to show that Banta made a prior\n   <em>\n    sworn\n   </em>\n   inconsistent statement.

Banta contends that according to this paragraph, the parties clearly intended Texas substantive law to apply to the interpretation of the MSA. While this issue appears to be one of first impression in Texas, Banta maintains that Texas' contract-construction principles require the same result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In support of its position, Banta contends that the exclusion is phrased broadly in terms precluding the application of \"any conflict of law or choice of law principles.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Banta states that under relevant contract-construction principles, this exclusion must have some meaning and that the only meaning that makes sense of the entire agreement is one that precludes the choice-of-law analysis that Mewbourne contends is necessary. According to Banta, \"Because Texas is-and always will be-the forum and because the forum's conflicts laws apply by default, the parties necessarily intended to preclude\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   choice-of-law analysis that would point away from applying Texas substantive law to their contractual disputes-even if the exclusion of choice-of-law principles were limited to those of Texas.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Maintaining that the parties did not intend for Texas law to apply in relation to any potential indemnification issues, Mewbourne contends that when a declarative contract provision is followed by \"excluding,\" the general rule is that the\n   parties intended to narrow the primary provision by carving out an exception. Thus, according to Mewbourne, the exclusionary language in the MSA means that conflict of law and choice-of-law principles are omitted from and not subject to the parties' attempt to fix the applicable law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mewbourne also contends that Banta ignores the phrase \"substantive laws.\" Thus, before the comma, the choice-of-law proviso addresses the substantive laws, while after the comma, the exclusion addresses the procedural choice-of-law principles.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Taken together, the intention is that the parties intend to be governed by Texas substantive laws insofar as they are permitted to make this selection. And in those instances when choice-of-law principles are available to override the parties' choice of substantive law, the parties have chosen to allow for application of the forum state's choice-of-law principles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   This Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   When interpretation of a contract is in issue, a court must first determine whether the provisions in question are ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    Coker v.

Mewbourne, the drafter of the agreement, is domiciled in Texas and conducts business in Texas. Its business office is located in Texas. Further, Banta maintains, and Mewbourne does not dispute, that Mewbourne drafted the MSA in Texas and signed the agreement in Texas. We recognize that Banta is a New Mexico company and that it signed the agreement in New Mexico. Despite those facts, we find, among other reasons, that because Mewbourne drafted the agreement in Texas, Texas, and not New Mexico, has a more significant relationship to the substantive issue before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In regard to the third and fourth factors, we find that Texas has a more significant relationship to the parties and the transaction than does New Mexico. Notably, Vargas' accident occurred while he was performing work in New Mexico; however, the parties' agreement is silent as to where any of the work was to be performed. The MSA did not state that New Mexico would be the place of performance. In fact, there is no mention of New Mexico in the entire agreement. More importantly, however, the issue in this case involves the enforceability of the indemnity provision in the MSA, and not the work that had been performed in New Mexico pursuant to that agreement. \"What is determinative is which state has the most significant relationship\n   <em>\n    with respect to the indemnity issue\n   </em>\n   ,\" and not the location of the work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake Operating,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inc. v.

Here, if New Mexico law were applied to the indemnity issue, as Mewbourne maintains, it would have relieved Mewbourne of the defense and indemnity it agreed to provide Banta. Certainly, Banta had a justified expectation that Mewbourne would comply with the terms of an agreement that Mewbourne negotiated, drafted, and signed (all in Texas).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Moreover, Mewbourne and Banta purchased insurance in order to comply with Texas law.

As such, we must enforce the parties' choice of Texas law. For these reasons, we hold that Texas law governs the enforceability of the MSA's indemnity provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Enforceability of MSA under Texas Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In order for this Court to grant its requested relief, Banta was required, pursuant to the laws of Texas, to present sufficient competent summary judgment evidence to show that Mewbourne's defense and indemnity obligations were enforceable pursuant to the terms of the MSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Coverage of Vargas' Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Mewbourne maintains that the provisions of the MSA did not cover Vargas' personal injury claim because Vargas was not Mewbourne's employee. Paragraph 5C of the MSA states that Mewbourne, as \"Company Group,\" would release, indemnify, defend, and hold Banta, as \"Contractor Group,\" harmless against any and all claims resulting from, among other things, personal injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   In paragraph 5.A.3, Company Group is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   (i) Company, its parent, subsidiary and affiliated or related companies, (ii) its and their working interest owners, co-lessees, co-owners, partners, joint operators, and joint venturers, if any, and their respective parent, subsidiary and affiliated or related companies, (iii) Company's other contractors of any tier, and (iv) the officers, directors, employees, agents, consultants, and invitees of any and all of the foregoing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The summary judgment evidence shows that on February 17, 2015, Mewbourne contracted with Kent Trucking to be a contractor at the New Mexico site. Further, in the plethora of summary judgment evidence provided to the Court, we find a letter written and sent by Mewbourne's counsel to Kent Trucking, which letter had been written following Vargas' accident. In it, Mewbourne's counsel explained, \"At the time of the incident Daniel Vargas was employed by C&amp;M Services LLC who either shares the same ownership as [Steve Kent Trucking] or was a subcontractor of [Steve Kent Trucking].\" There is even stronger evidence of this relationship in\n   Mewbourne's responses to Vargas' interrogatories, where Mewbourne ratified that Vargas was either employed by or was a contractor for Kent Trucking when the injury occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Based on the summary judgment evidence, we find that Banta demonstrated that Vargas was at the very least a \"contractor[ ] of any tier,\" or Mewbourne's invitee, and that Vargas had asserted a claim against Mewbourne for the injury he incurred while working at the New Mexico site. As such, the MSA covers Mewbourne's indemnity and defense obligations to Banta as it relates to the Vargas lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Further, the MSA consisted of seven pages of single-spaced language, with the majority of its contents written in lower-case letters. The language contained in paragraphs 5C and 5D, however, consist entirely of capital letters, along with bold type-face. In general, \"[l]anguage that appears in contrasting type or in capitals satisfies the conspicuousness requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v. CDB Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11103801\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/44/544/#p553\">\n    44 S.W.3d 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 553 (Tex. 2001),\n   <em>\n    superseded by statute on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Royston, Rayzor, Vickery, &amp; Williams, LLP v.

We, therefore, find that the indemnity provision of the MSA satisfies the express negligence doctrine and the conspicuousness requirement; thus, Mewbourne had fair notice that it agreed to indemnify Banta, even for Banta's own negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Despite this language, Mewbourne maintains that the MSA included no requirement that it indemnify Banta on\n   claims relating to punitive damages or gross negligence. We disagree. The MSA contains a list of claims that would be covered by the indemnity provision: latent or patent conditions, ultrahazardous activity, strict liability, tort, breach of contract, breach of duty, or breach of safety requirements or regulations. Moreover, the provision clearly includes language extending its duties to Mewbourne, that is, \"including without limitations\" and \"without regard to the causes of action thereof.\" It is plain that Mewbourne drafted this agreement. As the drafter of the agreement, Mewbourne cannot now maintain that it intended anything other than to indemnify Banta in relation to any cause of action, including gross negligence claims and punitive damages claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we find that Texas law applies to the terms of the parties' MSA; that under Texas law, Mewbourne had the obligation to defend and indemnify Banta against Vargas' claims; that it breached its contractual obligation to Banta by refusing to do so; and that Banta is entitled to recover damages and its attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   We, therefore, reverse the trial court's summary judgment in favor of Mewbourne, reverse the trial court's denial of Banta's motion for summary judgment and render judgment in favor of Banta on the enforceability of the indemnity provision against Mewbourne and Mewbourne's breach thereof; and remand to the trial court for a determination of damages and attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    Originally appealed to the Twelfth Court of Appeals in Tyler, this case was transferred to the Sixth Court of Appeals by the Texas Supreme Court pursuant to its docket equalization efforts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tex.

Banta contends that Mewbourne's claim against Kent Trucking rested on identical indemnity language contained in a MSA between Mewbourne and Kent Trucking. In Mewbourne's petition, it claimed that Kent Trucking was obligated to (1) indemnify Banta as a result of Vargas' claim, or (2) was obligated to indemnify Mewbourne as a result of Banta's claim. The trial court denied Mewbourne's motion for summary judgment against Kent Trucking. It also dismissed Mewbourne's claims against Kent Trucking on September 25, 2017.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    In the alternative, Banta asks this Court to remand its claims in whole or in part for further trial court proceedings, along with an award of appellate court costs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    In its supplement to its original motion for summary judgment, Mewbourne presented analogous estoppel arguments. Moreover, Mewbourne asserted a very similar position in its response to Banta's motion for summary judgment. In addition, Mewbourne filed an amended response to Banta's motion, continuing to assert its estoppel arguments, but also adding a choice-of-law analysis under the Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws and an argument that the indemnity agreement was invalid under Texas law to indemnify for gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    In its appellate brief, Mewbourne presents arguments beyond the estoppel arguments contained in its motion for summary judgment. \"[T]he Texas Supreme Court has held that summary judgment cannot be granted except on the grounds expressly presented in [a party's] motion.\"\n    <em>\n     Bean v.
