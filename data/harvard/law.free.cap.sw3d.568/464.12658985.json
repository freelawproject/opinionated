Henry was charged with one count of first-degree statutory rape and three counts of first-degree statutory sodomy to S.B., born in 2002, and three counts of first-degree statutory sodomy to T.B., born in 2006. S.B., T.B. (collectively \"Victims\"), and Victims' mother (\"Mother\") periodically lived with Henry and Henry and Mother's sons at different locations in 2012 and 2013. Henry was tried on the charges in May 2017. The jury convicted Henry of one count of first-degree statutory rape (count I) and three counts of first-degree statutory sodomy (counts II through IV) arising out of charges of first-degree statutory rape and sodomy to S.B. from March 1, 2012, to February 3, 2013, in the City of St. Louis. The jury could not reach a unanimous verdict on the three counts of first-degree statutory sodomy to T.B. resulting in a mistrial on counts V through VII. Henry was sentenced to concurrent terms of twenty years of imprisonment on counts I through IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On appeal, Henry raises four points: (1) the trial court plainly erred in submitting the verdict directors for counts I through IV because they failed to ensure the jury reached a unanimous verdict; (2) the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a new trial because the State violated\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963), by failing to disclose evidence indicating that S.B. was pregnant when the case was tried; (3) the trial court clearly erred in denying his motion to dismiss the charges based on the State's failure to bring him to trial within 180 days of its receipt of his request for a speedy trial under the Uniform Mandatory Disposition of Detainers Law (UMDDL), \u00a7 217.450\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; and (4) the trial court clearly erred in denying his motion to dismiss the State's charges against him because \u00a7 56.087 is unconstitutional. The State concedes error for part of Point I, instructional error regarding Counts III and IV. We find the instructional error in point I constitutes plain error with regard to count IV. The judgment and sentence of conviction on Count IV is reversed and remanded for new trial. The sentence and judgment as to all other counts is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Additional facts will be provided to the address the specific points when necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Henry was charged with seven counts: 1) first-degree statutory rape against S.B. from March 1, 2012, to June 1, 2012; 2) first-degree statutory sodomy against S.B. from March 1, 2012, to June 1, 2012; 3) first-degree statutory sodomy against S.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   from June 1, 2012, to February 3, 2013; 4) first-degree statutory sodomy against S.B. from July 1, 2012, to February 3, 2013; 5) first-degree statutory sodomy against T.B. from March 1, 2012, to June 30, 2012; 6) first-degree statutory sodomy against T.B. from June 1, 2012, to February 3, 2013; and 7) first-degree statutory sodomy against T.B. from February 1, 2013, to February 3, 2013. Trial began May 22, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At trial, the State presented evidence establishing that Mother reported the crimes alleged against Henry on February 3, 2013. A detective for the St. Louis police department testified he investigated the crimes alleged against Henry and arranged for a forensic interview of Victims but only S.B. was interviewed because T.B. was taken by her father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State presented evidence from Mother establishing where Mother and Victims lived during the relevant time periods. The evidence established that Henry, Mother, and the children lived on Cook St. in a one-bedroom apartment in the City of St. Louis from March 1, 2012, to June 1, 2012, and at various other locations in the City of St. Louis thereafter, including Mother's sister's on Carr St. in the City of St. Louis from July 2012 until December 2012 before moving into a shelter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   T.B. was eleven years old at the time of trial. T.B. testified that Henry made her suck his \"thing\" at their apartment, at Mother's sister's house, and in a porta potty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   S.B. was fifteen years old at the time of trial. S.B. testified that while they were living on Cook St. Henry stuck his penis inside of her and made her suck his penis. S.B. testified that Henry made her suck his penis numerous times in the laundry room at Mother's sister's house. S.B. testified Henry made her suck his penis in a porta potty while she living with Mother's sister.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   S.B.'s interview of February 7, 2013, was played for the jury. In that interview, she testified that Henry put his private part in her and made her suck his private part while they were living on Cook St. She testified that Henry made her suck his private part while sitting on the toilet seat in the bathroom at Carr St.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The jury found Henry guilty on the four counts related to S.B. but could not reach a unanimous verdict on the three counts related to T.B. and a mistrial was declared on those counts. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Plain Error Review of Henry's Right to Unanimous Jury Verdict\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In point I, Henry concedes he did not preserve this claim but contends the trial court plainly erred in submitting the verdict directors for counts I through IV because they failed to ensure the jury reached a unanimous verdict. Specifically, Henry argues the verdict directors failed to sufficiently differentiate between the multiple sex acts underlying each count. The State concedes the trial court erred in submitting the verdict directors for counts III and IV but argues the court only committed plain error regarding count IV because the State contends the verdict director for count III resulted in no manifest injustice due to the State differentiating the acts for counts III in closing argument. The State argues the trial court did not commit plain error in submitting the verdict directors for counts I and II because jury unanimity on one specific event was not required for these offenses given the nature of Henry's repeated, identical assaults of S.B., which provided no evidentiary basis for the jurors to distinguish between those acts. We reverse and remand Henry's conviction on count IV for a new\n   trial but affirm his convictions on counts I, II, and III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   An unpreserved claim of error can be reviewed only for plain error.\n   <em>\n    State v.

At trial, the victim testified each morning beginning in November of 2012 when she was twelve years old, the defendant would touch her breasts, thighs, and sometimes her vagina with his hands for about fifteen minutes until victim was told to get up and get ready for school. The victim testified this touching repeatedly occurred almost every morning she had school until the defendant's sons moved into their home in April of 2013. The defense presented no witnesses or evidence, but argued in closing the victim's allegations were not credible. The defendant's theory in closing argument was the victim lied because she wanted to get her mother out of her relationship with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The State submitted to the jury two counts of first-degree child molestation based on the identical allegation that the defendant touched the victim's breast for the purpose of arousing or gratifying his sexual desire.

In the interview, the victim stated the defendant forced her to touch him in the mornings before school, but also claimed the defendant forced her to touch him at other times when she would visit his apartment to play with his younger daughter. The trial court instructed the jury on two counts of first-degree statutory sodomy and on the lesser-included offense of first-degree child molestation. All counts alleged generally that on or about 2012 to 2013 the defendant knowingly placed the victim's hand on the defendant's genitals.

Consequently, the verdict director for each count focused on a single month, and specified the charged act of either statutory sodomy for placing his hand on Victim's vagina, attempted statutory sodomy for asking Victim to place her hand on his penis, or child molestation for touching Victim's breasts. The record is devoid of any other evidentiary facts that could have been included in each verdict director to distinguish one act of abuse from another. Moreover, there was no need to instruct the jurors that they must agree upon the same incident to support each conviction because there was absolutely no evidentiary basis upon which the jurors could possibly differentiate between the repeated, identical acts that fell within each verdict director.

The State argued Victims only\n   lived on Cook from March 2012 to June 2012 and then they lived on Carr from the beginning of July 2012 through February 2013.

He made her suck his penis while they were on Cook.\" On counts III and IV, the State argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   This occurred at [Mother's sister's] house.

Henry argued there was no corroborating evidence to support Victims' words and \"those words are not proof beyond a reasonable doubt ... because of the inconsistency within those words.\" Specifically, Henry argued that Mother's testimony and Victims' testimony about the porta potty incident was inconsistent. He argued Mother's testimony was she was at the house cooking chicken when she found them in the park near a porta potty and S.B.'s testimony is Mother is at the park with them and Henry asked Mother to go get some pizza and it happened when she left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As for the incidents on Carr, Henry pointed out that S.B. said the acts \"on Carr happened in the laundry room but when you watch the video from 2013, she talks to [the forensic interviewer] and she says that these incidents happen in the bathroom, and she tells [the forensic interviewer] it's a one bathroom apartment.\" Henry argued that a fight between Henry and Mother about Mother lying to Henry about Mother's contact with S.B.'s father proceeded S.B.'s allegations against Henry. Henry argued S.B. did not like the way Henry treated Mother and S.B.'s \"father was the outlet for her to get away and to take her mom with her and that's what's happened.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We first consider whether the trial court committed plain error in submitting the instructions for counts I and II - the first-degree statutory rape and first-degree statutory sodomy charges related to S.B. from March 1, 2012, to June 1, 2012, in the City of St. Louis.

On count III, the State argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   This occurred at [Mother's sister's] house. This occurred as Count III. He put his penis in her mouth while at [Mother's sister's] apartment.
