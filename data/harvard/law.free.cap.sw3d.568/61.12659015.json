Sup. Ct. Rule 24.035.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mohammad plead guilty to eight counts of the class C felony of burglary in the second degree, seven counts of the class D felony of stealing, and one count of the class D felony of property damage in the first degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mohammad contends the motion court clearly erred in denying his motion for post-conviction relief without a hearing, claiming he received ineffective assistance of counsel where his attorney did not file and litigate a motion to suppress evidence taken from his impounded Acura as part of a routine inventory search he consented to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal and find that the motion court did not clearly err in denying post-conviction relief. An extended opinion would have no precedential value. We have, however, provided a memorandum opinion only for use of the parties setting forth the reasons for the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We affirm the judgment pursuant to Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    All rule citations are to Missouri Supreme Court Rules (2015) unless otherwise indicated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
