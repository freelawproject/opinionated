Relatedly, Washington-Bey argues that the circuit court initially erred when, on November 3, 2005, it dismissed his Rule 29.15 Post-Conviction Motion (\"Post-Conviction Motion\"). We reverse the circuit court's judgment dismissing his Abandonment Motion on jurisdictional grounds and remand for further proceedings. His appeal of the 2005 order dismissing his Post-Conviction Motion is untimely and is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Facts and Procedure\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Washington-Bey was convicted of tampering with a motor vehicle in the first degree and sentenced to seven years in the Department of Corrections. He appealed and his conviction and sentence were affirmed in a decision issued by this Court on April 19, 2005. The Court of Appeals issued its mandate affirming his conviction and sentence on September 1, 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 24, 2005, Washington-Bey filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Rule 29.15 Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct the Judgment or Sentence. In his Post-Conviction Motion, he erroneously alleged that the Court of Appeals issued its mandate on April 19, 2005. On November 3, 2005, the circuit court entered its order dismissing his Post-Conviction Motion, finding that, pursuant to Rule 29.15\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , he was required to\n   file his motion within 90 days of the issuance of the Court's mandate; that the motion was not filed until October 24, 2005; and that the motion was therefore untimely in that it was not filed within 90 days of April 19, 2005. The circuit court did not appoint counsel and he did not file a timely appeal of the circuit court's order of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 3, 2018, Washington-Bey filed his Abandonment Motion, in which he alleged that he was abandoned as a result of the circuit court's failure to appoint him counsel in 2005.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 25, 2018, the circuit court issued an order, by docket entry, which stated: \"Court lacks jurisdiction to rule on motion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ordinarily, our review of a judgment rendered in proceedings brought pursuant to Rule 29.15 \"is limited to a determination of whether the motion court's findings and conclusions are clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    Eastburn v.

If he wished to appeal the circuit court's November 3, 2005, dismissal order, he was required to do so within 10 days after that judgment became final or, for good cause shown, within 12 months after it became final.

The Abandonment Motion in the legal file also appears to be missing some of its pages. Again, the State makes no complaint regarding this document and addresses the portion which is included in which Washington-Bey complains that he was abandoned due to the court's failure to appoint him counsel. The legal file herein is sufficient to determine whether the circuit court had jurisdiction to rule on Washington-Bey's Abandonment Motion, and whether he can now appeal the denial of his 2005 Post-Conviction Motion. Since the absence of \"Plaintiff's Abandonment Supplemental Motion Postconviction Court Abused Its Discretion\" and the incomplete copy of the Abandonment Motion do not inhibit our ability to determine both points on appeal, we will allow this appeal to proceed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The Court recognizes that for a judgment to be final (and thus appealable), three elements must usually be present: \"a writing, signed by the judge, and denominated as a judgment.\"\n    <em>\n     Watson v.

Additionally, Washington-Bey's argument does not include the applicable standards of review for his claims of error as required by Rule 84.04(e) (2018). \"Failure to substantially comply with Rule 84.04 preserves nothing for review and is a proper ground for dismissing an appeal.\"\n    <em>\n     Lueker v.

Washington-Bey did not include anything in the record on appeal with respect to the 2017 motion. The State did not seek to supplement the record and did not address the 2017 motion in its brief.
