An employee collapsed at work because of a medical condition unrelated to her employment. The employer knew of the employee's need for immediate medical assistance. The employer had acquired an AED but did not use it to assist the employee while awaiting the arrival of emergency medical responders. Medical responders assisted the employee, but she suffered a brain injury because of oxygen deprivation. We hold that an injury that is caused by an employer's failure to provide reasonable medical assistance arises out of and in the course of employment when an employee becomes helpless at work because of illness or other cause unrelated to her employment, the employee needs medical assistance to prevent further injury, the employer knows of the employee's helplessness, and the employer can provide reasonable medical assistance but does not do so. Here, the employee's claim did not arise out of her employment because her employer provided reasonable medical assistance and had no statutory or common law duty to use its AED to assist the employee. Therefore, the employer is not liable for workers' compensation benefits. We reverse the trial court's denial of the employer's motion to dismiss and remand to the trial court for an order of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case involves an employer's alleged failure to use an AED to assist an employee\n   who presumably suffered cardiac arrest at work. Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart malfunctions and stops beating unexpectedly. An AED is a lightweight portable device that delivers an electric shock through the chest to the heart to restore a normal heart rhythm following cardiac arrest.

Chaney collapsed while at work because of a medical condition unrelated to her employment. Chaney's heart stopped beating, and she could no longer breathe. Emergency medical responders were called to assist her. Chaney's employer, Team Technologies, Inc., had acquired an AED but did not use it to assist her. Medical responders revived Chaney, but she suffered a permanent brain injury caused by oxygen deprivation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In January 2015, Chaney sued Team Technologies in the Hamblen County Circuit Court, seeking workers' compensation benefits for the injuries resulting from Team Technologies' failure to use its AED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Chaney asserted that her employer's failure to use the AED and/or its failure to train or hire an employee able to use an AED delayed resuscitation efforts, causing Chaney to sustain a brain injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Team Technologies filed two motions to dismiss. In the first motion, Team Technologies asked the trial court to dismiss Chaney's complaint because her injury was unrelated to her employment. In the second motion, Team Technologies argued that, under\n   <em>\n    Wallis v.

The trial court denied the motions, ruling that Chaney had pleaded sufficient facts to set forth a prima facie case that her injury arose out of and in the course of employment; Team Technologies had an obligation\n   to provide her with medical assistance under\n   <em>\n    Russell\n   </em>\n   ; it was a disputed question of fact whether Team Technologies had provided adequate medical assistance under\n   <em>\n    Russell\n   </em>\n   ; and\n   <em>\n    Wallis\n   </em>\n   did not address an employer's duty to use an AED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court granted Team Technologies' motion for permission to seek an interlocutory appeal.

First, our AED statutes apply to all persons or entities who acquire AEDs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2068-140-403\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-140-403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (imposing requirements on any \"person or entity that acquires an automated external defibrillator (AED)\"). These statutes do not single out employers for special treatment or impose on them a duty to use an AED. Based on the plain language of the AED statutes, an employer is treated like any other \"person or entity\" that acquires an AED. As we held in\n   <em>\n    Wallis\n   </em>\n   , these statutes do not require any entity to use an AED.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373797\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/509/886/\">\n    509 S.W.3d at 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, an employer has no statutory duty to use an AED to assist an employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, the emergency rule requires an employer to render reasonable medical assistance, not any and all medical assistance. Under the common law, businesses have a similar duty to aid patrons who need emergency assistance but need not provide aid that requires special training to administer.\n   <em>\n    Wallis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373797\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/509/886/\">\n    509 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   902 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Applebaum v.

App. 1984) (holding that while day care center had duty to procure medical aid, it had no duty to provide lifesaving aid that required special training). Tennessee Code Annotated section 68-140-404 requires employers to ensure special training for users and registration with local emergency services before using or allowing use of an acquired AED. Employers should not be treated differently or have a higher duty because of their special relationship with their employees under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Chaney argues we should apply a remedial and equitable construction of the Workers' Compensation Law and extend our holding in\n   <em>\n    Russell\n   </em>\n   to require an employer to use an acquired AED to assist an employee who suffers an emergency at work. This argument fails because we cannot rewrite our AED statutes and need not revise the common law emergency rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In the only other workers' compensation case we have found involving an employer's duty to use an AED, the Kansas Court of Appeals reached a similar result. In\n   <em>\n    Adee v. Russell Stover Candies, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , an employee died after suffering a heart attack while at work, and her surviving spouse sued for workers' compensation benefits.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3682061\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/39/1017/\">\n    39 Kan.App.2d 1017\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3682061\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/39/1017/\">\n    186 P.3d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 841 (2008). After finding the employee on the floor, gasping for air, a supervisor left to retrieve a first aid kit while another employee began cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The employer had a policy to certify its supervisors in CPR and first aid so that they could respond to incidents until emergency personnel arrived.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 842-43. The employer called 911 immediately but did not use an available AED; paramedics arrived and assumed care within ten minutes of the heart attack. The employee died three days later.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 842. Under Kansas law, a heart attack is not a compensable injury, but benefits can be awarded if a worker suffered a loss of chance of surviving the heart attack because of the employer's negligence and the\n   loss arose out of the employment. The employee's surviving spouse presented expert testimony that with continuous CPR and use of an AED, the employee's survival chances would have been optimized.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 843. The Kansas Court of Appeals held that the employer's duty to render emergency aid did not include the use of an AED.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 847. The appellate court found that medical testimony showed that the employer's supervisors would have had to use the AED within three minutes of the employee's heart attack to increase her survival chances to 74% and that the employer had not trained its supervisors on how to use the AED.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 846. However, the employee's surviving spouse did not show that the supervisors' failure to use the AED contravened the employer's policy and that the training given to supervisors did not specifically include the use of an AED. Therefore, the court concluded, the supervisors' obligation to provide emergency care did not include the use of an AED.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 847.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although the result in\n   <em>\n    Adee\n   </em>\n   hinged on the conclusion that the employee's supervisors did not have a duty to use the available AED under an employer policy, the opinion's analysis is still useful. First, the Kansas appellate court's ruling accords with our holding in\n   <em>\n    Wallis\n   </em>\n   that the duty to render aid does not extend to providing aid that requires special training, such as using an AED. Second, the opinion underscores that an employer can fulfill its duty to provide reasonable medical assistance without using an available AED. Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Adee\n   </em>\n   , emergency personnel were summoned and assumed care of the injured employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Although not involving a workers' compensation claim under state no-fault law, the decision in\n   <em>\n    Sells v.

Because of the railroad's inability to communicate the employee's exact location, emergency personnel took over half an hour to reach the employee and could not save his life.

On appeal, the Florida appellate court held that the railroad's duty under FELA to provide general first aid to the employee did not require its employees to provide skilled treatment, such as CPR or use of an AED.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6858093\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/170/27/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6858093\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/170/27/\">\n    at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the court determined that an employer need only summon medical assistance and provide reasonable first aid until emergency personnel arrives.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6858093\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/170/27/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 38 (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 314A cmt. f) (the defendant \"will seldom be required to do more than give such first aid as he reasonably can, and take reasonable steps to turn the sick man over to a physician, or to those who will look after him and see that medical assistance is obtained\"). This result under applicable federal law is consistent with our rationale and holding here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In sum, an employer has neither a statutory nor a common law duty to use an AED to provide medical assistance to an employee under the circumstances presented in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Taking the complaint's factual allegations as true and construing them in Chaney's favor, we hold that her complaint fails to state a cause of action. Chaney's claim did not arise out of her employment because Team Technologies provided reasonable medical assistance and had neither a statutory nor a common law duty to use its AED to assist Chaney. We reverse the trial court's denial of Team Technologies, Inc.'s motions to dismiss and remand to the trial court for entry of an order of dismissal. We tax the costs of this appeal to Katherine D.
