Movant claims his three-year sentence of imprisonment for stealing over $500 was unauthorized by law according to\n   <em>\n    State v. Bazell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182019\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/497/263/\">\n    497 S.W.3d 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2016), which held that offense was not a felony, but was actually a misdemeanor. But\n   <em>\n    Bazell\n   </em>\n   was handed down\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Movant's sentence was imposed, and as the State correctly pointed out to the motion court,\n   <em>\n    Bazell\n   </em>\n   cannot be applied retroactively, only prospectively, expect to cases pending on direct appeal, as determined in\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Windeknecht v. Mesmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386985\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/530/500/#p503\">\n    530 S.W.3d 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 503 (Mo. banc 2017). The motion court did not err by dismissing Movant's case on this ground. An opinion would have no precedential value nor serve any jurisprudential purpose. We affirm under Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
