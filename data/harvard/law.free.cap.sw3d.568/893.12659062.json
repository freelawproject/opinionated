SHEFFIELD, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Bell Management, Inc. (\"Bell\") filed a petition for unlawful detainer against Theresa M. Barbero (\"Barbero\") in August 2017. Bell voluntarily dismissed its petition without prejudice in September 2017. Barbero attempts to appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Rule 67.02(a) permits a plaintiff to dismiss a civil action without order of the court when that dismissal is filed prior to the introduction of evidence at trial in a court-tried case or prior to the swearing of the jury panel for voir dire in a jury-tried case. Under Rule 67.02(a), a plaintiff's voluntary dismissal of a civil action without an order of the court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   is effective on the date the dismissal is filed with the court. Moreover, once a case has been dismissed under Rule 67.02, it is as if the suit were never brought. Consequently, a trial court loses jurisdiction to enter any subsequent orders regarding the dismissed action. No appeal can be taken from the dismissal. The circuit court may take no further steps as to the dismissed action, and any step attempted is viewed a nullity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Matter of Gurgel\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656051\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/543/135/#p139\">\n    543 S.W.3d 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 139 (Mo.

We recognize that Barbero appears\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    before this Court, just as she did before the trial court. But\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    parties \"are bound by the same rules of procedure as parties represented by lawyers, and are not entitled to indulgences they would not have received if represented by counsel.\"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Belisle v.
