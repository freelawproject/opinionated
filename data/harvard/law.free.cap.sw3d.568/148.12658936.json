Pathfinder counterclaimed, and alleged that the letter resulted in a contract and that Great Western had breached the contract, and Pathfinder sought specific performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After a trial, the jury found (1) that the letter was an enforceable contract between the parties and (2) that Great Western breached that contract. As a result, the trial court granted Pathfinder's requested relief of specific performance and ordered Great Western to fulfill its part of the contract, namely, to convey to Pathfinder a 25% working interest in the oil and gas lease. The trial court also ordered Great Western to pay the net proceeds of that interest, $3,053,023.40, to Pathfinder and to pay Pathfinder's attorneys' fees. In this appeal from that adverse judgment, Great Western asserts three issues. We reverse and render judgment that Pathfinder take nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Great Western and Pathfinder were participants in several oil and gas prospects in Hockley County; the parties had a joint operating agreement (the Latigo JOA) among themselves and other parties for those areas of mutual interest. Seismic data indicated that an area outside the area of mutual interest could be profitable, and Great Western acquired leases for itself in the new area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 1, 2004, Great Western sent a letter to Pathfinder and offered it a 25% working interest in the new leases it acquired from \"CH Foundation, et al.\" and asked Pathfinder to reply to its offer within forty-eight hours. Within the 48-hour time frame, Pathfinder checked an \"elects to participate\" box on the letter, signed it, and returned it to Great Western. The letter purported to give Pathfinder a 25% interest but stated that (1) the working interest included any obligations that Pathfinder might owe to third parties (the Kennedys) and that (2) Pathfinder could not assign any portion of the interest to anyone other than the Kennedys without Great Western's written consent. The letter further provided that Great Western would bill Pathfinder for its share of the costs associated with drilling and that the\n   details of a participation agreement for these leases would be worked out \"as soon as reasonably possible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Later, Great Western and Pathfinder disagreed on several issues. First, Pathfinder attempted to renegotiate the working interest offered from 25% to 28%, but that was not approved by Great Western's management.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Next, there were disputes between the parties over the joint operating agreement (JOA) and the Authorization for Expenditure (AFE) documents that Great Western created and asked Pathfinder to sign. In the June 1 letter, Great Western promised to draft a JOA and to provide Pathfinder with one, but Great Western did not give the JOA and AFE to Pathfinder until September 20. Pathfinder did not sign and return the documents. A second copy of the AFE was forwarded to Pathfinder on October 6, 2004.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pathfinder did not sign the documents until October 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Finally, Pathfinder disagreed over the meaning of consent on assignments, as outlined in the June 1 letter. The June 1 letter required that Pathfinder obtain Great Western's consent before Pathfinder assigned or sold any portion of its interest. Great Western expanded this right in the proposed JOA sent to Pathfinder on September 20, which gave Great Western a preferential right to purchase that interest in the event of Pathfinder's attempted assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In an attempt to resolve these disputes, Great Western's representatives, Carter Muire and Mike Heathington, and Pathfinder's representative, Ted Ashford, had a conference call on October 28; they did not reach an understanding. At trial, Muire and Heathington testified that Heathington withdrew Great Western's offer at the end of the call because the parties could not agree on the disputed issues: the JOA, the AFE, and the working interest amount. Ashford, on the other hand, did not recall Great Western's withdrawal during this conference call. The following day, Great Western sent a withdrawal letter to Pathfinder. Meanwhile, according to Ashford's testimony, he sent Great Western the required check, the signed JOA, and the signed AFE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Great Western brought suit seeking a declaratory judgment that the June 1 letter was not an enforceable contract. In response, Pathfinder counterclaimed and alleged that Great Western had breached the June 1 contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Prior to trial, the parties entered into a stipulation. The stipulation provided that Pathfinder had to prove that Great Western had an enforceable contract and that Great Western breached the contract. The stipulation also outlined that, if Pathfinder proved that it was entitled to recover from Great Western's breach, then its remedy would be specific performance. The stipulation also specified in paragraph (d) that, if the jury finds that Pathfinder is entitled to recover for Great Western's breach, Great Western would provide two accountings: one for out-of-pocket expenses, done in accordance with COPAS accounting procedures, and another one for revenue received by Great Western. Paragraph (f) of the stipulation further required that Great Western provide a simple calculation of the revenue and expenses, as listed in paragraph (d), from inception to the most recent accounting period before trial. Once that was provided to Pathfinder, Great Western would forward the representative proceeds in the amount of Pathfinder's\n   25% interest for all historical production within 15 days of the judgment, subject to any appeal and bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At trial, Great Western asked the trial court to submit a jury question on whether Pathfinder met the \"ready, willing, and able\" element of specific performance in the event that the jury found a breach; however, the trial court refused to submit this question. The jury found that the June 1 letter was an enforceable contract and that Great Western breached that contract. The trial court entered judgment in Pathfinder's favor, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In its first issue, Great Western contends that the trial court erred when it failed to grant Great Western's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because (1) conditions precedent to the formation of a contract had not been satisfied; (2) the offer was withdrawn prior to the acceptance; and (3) there was insufficient evidence to support an enforceable contract. In its second issue, Great Western argues that, even if a contract existed, the trial court's order of specific performance was improper because Pathfinder failed to demonstrate that it was ready, willing, and able to fulfill its contractual obligations. Finally, Great Western asserts in its third issue that the trial court improperly awarded damages and prejudgment interest to Pathfinder because the award violated the parties' stipulation and because the evidence did not support the award. Because the resolution of Great Western's second issue is dispositive, we begin there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Issue Two\n    </em>\n    : The trial court erred when it refused to submit a jury question on specific performance because the stipulation provided that if Pathfinder was entitled to recover for Great Western's breach, then its remedy was specific performance.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In its second issue, Great Western argues that the trial court erred when it denied Great Western's request to submit a jury question concerning Pathfinder's readiness, willingness, and ability to perform the obligations of the contract. Pathfinder asserted that the stipulation eliminated the need for that question because the stipulation only required Pathfinder to prove that an enforceable contract existed and that Great Western had breached it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We review a challenge to the trial court's jury charge under an abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    Tex.

The stipulation might have limited recovery to specific performance, but the stipulation did not obviate the necessity that Pathfinder prove its entitlement to it.

Pathfinder sent a check in the amount of $9,968.98 to Great Western on October 29, 2004, approximately 39 days after Great Western's September 20 letter that detailed the actual costs of the lease bonus and brokerage expenses to date and indicated that Pathfinder's 25% share of those costs was $9,968.98. Drilling costs for the first well were nearly $800,000, and a 25% share of those costs would have been about $200,000 based on the initial Drilling Cost Estimate and the revised AFE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The record reflects that Great Western sent a Drilling Cost estimate and AFE and a revised AFE for costs associated with the first well.

However, Pathfinder did not provide any evidence of a line of credit, cash reserves, escrowed funds, or any other source of funds to show that it was ready, willing, and able to perform the requirements of the proposed contract. Because Pathfinder did not conclusively prove that it was ready, willing, and able to pay the costs associated with the AFE, we hold that the trial court should have submitted a jury question on the issue and that it abused its discretion when it failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    B.
