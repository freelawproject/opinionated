App.-Eastland Mar. 26, 2015, no pet.) (mem. op.). Hulcher contends that it is entitled to a jury for the third attorney's fees trial based on cases holding that a party's jury waiver does not survive a remand after appeal. But Emmert claims that the parties' rule 11 agreement made before the second trial precludes Hulcher from demanding a jury in this third trial on attorney's fees. Because our judgment and mandate in the second trial remanded the issue of attorney's fees for a new trial without limitation-and the parties' rule 11 agreement in the second trial did not unambiguously indicate an intent that it apply to future trials on the same issue-we grant mandamus relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This court gave a detailed account of the background of this dispute in\n   <em>\n    Hulcher Services, Inc. v.

App.-Fort Worth Jan. 28, 2016, pet. denied) (mem. op.). Consequently,\n   we will set forth only the procedural facts applicable to the current dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Emmert and Hulcher's first trial-at which the parties attempted to try all of the claims and issues to a jury, including attorney's fees-ended in a mistrial. At the pretrial conference for the second trial, Hulcher and Emmert agreed on the record to have a jury decide all of Emmert's liability and damages claims except for attorney's fees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [Emmert's counsel]: Judge, may we put some stuff on the record with you --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   THE COURT: All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [Emmert's counsel]: -- and see if you'll approve it or not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [Emmert's counsel]: First, we're going to submit attorney fees to you, Judge, and not to the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [Hulcher's counsel]: That is agreed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE COURT: Is that agreed? All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the jury found in Emmert's favor and awarded damages, the trial judge incorporated the jury's awards into a final judgment along with his attorney's fees award. The trial court's final judgment stated, \"The parties agreed to try the issue of attorney's fees to the Court after the jury trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Hulcher appealed. This court modified the damages awards in the judgment, reversed the attorney's fees award because of that modification, and remanded \"the issue of attorney's fees for a new trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Back in the trial court, Hulcher filed a jury demand and paid the jury fee. When Emmert objected and moved to strike the jury demand, a visiting trial judge granted Emmert relief and ordered that the attorney's fees issue be tried to the bench.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Hulcher then filed this petition for writ of mandamus, arguing that its rule 11 jury waiver before the second trial does not preclude it from exercising its constitutional right to have the attorney's fees issue tried to a jury in the third trial. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Rule 11 Jury Waiver Does Not Control in Third Trial on Attorney's Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Although the Texas constitution guarantees the right to a trial by jury, Tex. Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 15, that right is not absolute in civil cases,\n   <em>\n    Howell v. Tex. Workers' Comp.

The terms of that agreement were fulfilled when Emmert's attorney's fee claim was tried to the court.\" We agree. The agreement stated on the record was to \"submit attorney fees\" to the trial judge, \"not to the jury.\" Although these words indicate an intent to submit the issue of attorney's fees to the trial judge at that point in time, they do not contemplate the possibility of a future trial on attorney's fees, nor do they show an intent to bind the parties to try \"the issue of\" attorney's fees for all time to the bench.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burnham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6735292\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f/88/627/#p628\">\n    88 F. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   628-30 ;\n   <em>\n    Nedrow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4425191\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/iowa/246/1075/\">\n    70 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   844 ;\n   <em>\n    Harding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10055631\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/485/297/#p299\">\n    485 S.W.2d at 298-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bank of Am.\n   </em>\n   , 278 S.W.3d at 343 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dorraj\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038191\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/349/691/\">\n    836 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   865 ;\n   <em>\n    State Farm Lloyds v.

App.-Austin 2009, no pet.) (construing rule 11 settlement agreement to apply solely to temporary orders and not final judgment). In addition to the plain language of the rule 11 agreement, the context of the second trial (as summarized by Hulcher) supports the same conclusion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Hulcher agreed to try the issue of attorney's fees to the trial court as part of a number of agreements made on the third day of trial. Given that Emmert was bringing a number of claims, some of which permitted attorney's fees and some of which did not, and of course no one knew which claims Emmert would prevail on, it would have been difficult to present the attorney fee evidence to the jury with various assumptions concerning segregation of fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   That the rule 11 agreement was intended to apply only to the second trial is further supported by the fact that Hulcher did not waive a jury for attorney's fees in the first trial that ended in a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We hold that the plain language of the rule 11 agreement waiving a jury on the issue of attorney's fees in the second trial does not unambiguously indicate that the parties intended to waive a jury for any future trials of the same issue. Thus, the trial court abused its discretion by striking Hulcher's jury demand and ordering the parties to try Hulcher's attorney's fees request to the bench on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    No Adequate Remedy by Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Because the trial court's order denies Hulcher its constitutional right to a jury trial-a loss which the supreme court has held is reviewable by mandamus,\n   <em>\n    In re Prudential\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9146465\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/148/124/#p129\">\n    148 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   139 -and because the proceedings in the trial court are now the third trial in this case, we hold that appeal is not an adequate remedy for Hulcher on this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Team Rocket, L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8213302\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/256/257/#p262\">\n    256 S.W.3d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 262 (Tex. 2008) (orig. proceeding);\n   <em>\n    In re Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , Nos. 13-16-00411-CV, 13-16-00416-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20395257\">\n    2017 WL 395257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8-9 (Tex.
