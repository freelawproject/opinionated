V. ROGERS, Cashier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Rogers'testified that-the statement was made out; and the receipt executed in' the form in which it\" appeared,\u2019 at. the\"request of Shearman; Shearman, who was a witness- for the defendant, testified\"-that he did not make\" such' request; but\" that Rogers, if lie ever executed such a receipt, drew \u25a0 it according to' his own notion, without any'suggestion from-him, and without any direction \u2022 from him, to have it' so drawn; and, that if he ever took such a' receiptfrbm Rogers,-, he never showed it to Ballou, or talked with him about it:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Rogers further-testified, \u201c I showed this'copy- of the state-ment and receipt- to Ballou, August'-29,-1859, at my d\u00e9sk- at the bank; I showed - it to him,-and-stated-to him, I had' given such a receipt as that, and asked him to \u2018 examine it\" he did, and said-it was all right.\u201d On his cross-examination, he'also testified that he showed the paper to Ballou;' that \u201che examined'it; he took it and looked at it; his \u00f1am\u00e9 does not appear in the statement; 1 think-1 remember\" his tossing the paper back and saying \u201c that was all right.\u201d Ballou testified that he did not, to his recollection, see any such statement and receipt- at any time before' the trial; that Shearman did not at any time show-him any such', receipt,or converse about it ;.and to his recollection,- no snclv receipt-was shown to him.by Rogers; and that he had-' no recollection of having any such conversation with Rogers about it, as Rogers'liad stated. Rogers further stated, that after he had shown the copy of statement and receipt to Ballou, and he had'said if was all- right,- that' he, Rogers, then made a memorandum thereon as follows: \u201c T-. P.- B., August 29; 1859, O. K.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">This' conflict of testimony the jury have determined; by. their verdict,-according to the testimony of Rogers, artd-have thereby found that the statement and receipt were' drawn-pursuant to the' directions of Shearman, and were,-on the\" 29tli of August,- 1859, shown to- Ballou,, and' examined: by him and returned with his answer that' it was- all right. Testimony was also given to show that Shearman; on- the December and- July following, made payments of interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>on the notes; but those payments were- not allowed in evidence against Ballou, for the want of proof to connect- any .agency on his part with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u2022And the principal question, therefore, is whether the evidence above given, warranted the jury in finding that Ballou ;.adopted the payment made by Shearman, on the 26th of July, 1859, and whether such adoption amounted to a payment by Ballou, within the meaning of the statute, in refer- \u25a0 ence to the limitations of actions.</p>\n<p id=\"AgX\">In order to avoid the operation of the statute of limitations upon a demand which has been due for more than six years, before the commencement of the action, there must have been . an acknowledgment or. promise in writing, signed by the party to be charged therewith, or a payment by him of principal or interest must be proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">It is well settled that a payment by one party, liable on \u2022 a demand, whether maker or indorser, is not such payment as will make another party liable, and therefore the payment . by Shearman, as such does, not help the plaintiff in this ..action; and unless, under the facts found by the jury, it is \u25a0. established that as between Ballou and the plaintiff, the payment was made by Ballou, the plaintiff was not entitled to a verdict against him.</p>\n<p id=\"AfB\">It is not necessary that the <em>act </em>of such payment should be proved. It would doubtless be sufficient, to prove the payment by the oral confession of the person sought to be charged that he had made it; and although the facts proved in this case to establish the payment by Ballou are different from those of any other which has come to my knowledge, it seems clear to me that Ballou, by what took place between him and Rogers, as the jury-have found, adopted the payment made by Shearman as his own and became entitled, as between him and the other parties liable on the notes, to the benefits secured to him by the receipt, and, as to the plaintiff, assumed the legal liabilities consequent upon such payment to' the same extent as if it had been actually made by \"him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>(Commercial Bank of Buffalo </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>15 N. <em>Y., </em>577, 580, 582.)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">These acts of his took place in the presence of, and with the cashier of <em>the </em>plaintiff, and the plaintiff had thereafter the right to consider Ballou as the actual payer of the interest, and to rely upon such payment as against him, and I think Ballou could not afterward repudiate such payment or claim that it was not made for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Rogers had the right thereafter to suppose that the payment made by Shearman was so made with the full understanding and arrangement that it should be so made for him (Ballou); and it is too late when, without such payment, the debt would be barred, to set up that his acts, which induced the plaintiff to delay the commencement of the action, did not amount to an admission of payment by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">On the trial two deeds for the transfer of real estate were given in evidence by the plaintiff' against the objection and exception of Ballou. I do not think that the court committed any error in receiving them in evidence. They were intended as a portion of the evidence to show that Ballou was more than an accommodation indorser, and that the indebtedness to the bank arose out of transactions in which Ballou was interested with Shearman; but the proof failed to establish this, and it is quite clear, from the manner in which the court submitted the case to the jury, that Ballou could not have been prejudiced thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">So, too, several exceptions were taken to portions of the charge of the court; but it is sufficient to say that the question was clearly left for the jury to find (assuming that Shear-man made the payment from his own funds, and took the statement and receipt without any arrangement or assent to his doing so on the part of Ballou, and without any subsequent arrangement between them that Ballou should adopt the payment as his own), whether the facts were as sworn to by Rogers, and that if so, the plaintiff was entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">I think the charge of the judge was correct, that a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>trial should be denied, and that judgment on the verdict should be entered for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Morgan, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Mdllin, J., did not vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Judgment for tlie plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
