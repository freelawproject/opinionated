Randolph, deceased, upon premises in New York city, and was dated and recorded in October, 1864. There was paid in, to the city chamberlain a surplus, after satisfying the mortgage debt, &amp;c., of $85,046.91, upon which claims were made by the executors of Randolph, and by the defendants, Phillips, Remsen, and Hoyt assignee, &amp;c., respectively. Phillips claimed as lessee' of the premises, by lease from the mortgagor, dated in May, 1865, for the term of ten years, and Remsen and Hoyt assignee, &amp;c., under first and second mortgages of the lease from Phillips. The widow of Randolph also claimed her dower. The lease to Phillips contained covenants for quiet enjoyment, and for payment of taxes by the lessee, and for rent quarterly; and for re-entry, in case of non-performance of covenants by the lessor; and it appeared that two years taxes had been paid out of the proceeds of the sale, and that a quarter\u2019s rent remained unpaid on the 3d May, 1869, at which time, upon demand of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>the purchaser, the tenant surrendered to him possession of the premises. Evidence was also given before the referee, of the value of the unexpired term cut off by the foreclosure suit, to which Phillips, Eemsen and Hoyt as assignee, &amp;c., were made parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-5\">The referee rejected the claims of Phillips, Eemsen, and Hoyt, and reported in favor of paying the surplus after satisfying the claim for dower, expenses, &amp;c., to the executors of Eaudolph. Exceptions to the report were filed; it was affirmed by an order of Special Term, from which this appeal is taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b257-6\"><em>C.

(See 1 Revised Statutes, 722, \u00a7\u00a7 1 to 6, both inclusive; 1 id., 750, \u00a7 10 ; 1 id., 754, 755, \u00a7 27.) Section 36 of chapter 3, of part 2d, relating to the proof and recording of conveyances of real estate, declares that the term <em>real estate </em>shall be construed <em>\u201c </em>as embracing all chattels real, except leases, for a term not exceeding three years,\u201d <em>as used in that chapter. </em>That chapter (chap. 3) does not relate at all, to the nature, quantity, or divisions of estates in land, except with reference to the proofs and recording of conveyances of estates in lands. Therefore, in speaking of the nature and quantity of the estate or interest, which Phillips, the lessee, had in the demised premises at the time of the foreclosure and sale, it may not be technically proper or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>accurate to call Ms estate or interest <em>real </em>estate. But what of it?</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">By the common law, and by the Revised Statutes, he had an estate (though not <em>real), </em>in the land for the unexpired term of years, called at common law, and by the Revised Statutes, a chattel \u25a0 real. Equity regards the substance of things, not names, and I cannot see, of what-possible materiality it is in .this ease, whether this estate is called or should he called <em>real </em>estate or a chattel real.. It was an estate in the lands. It entitled him, as between himself and his lessor, to its use and occupation, rents and \"profits, during the unexpired term, upon or under the terms of the lease. It was destroyed or diverted by the foreclosure sale and conveyance, under a mortgage made by the lessor, before its creation. The conveyance to the purchaser, carried the fee absolute including the estate of the lessee. The moneys bid and paid for the premises, were bid and paid for a fee absolute, all the estate which could he had or held in the premises, including the unexpired term or estate for years of the lessee. I .cannot see, why so much of the surplus moneys, as was paid 'for the lessee\u2019s estate, or as arose from the sale of it, should not be regarded in equity as representing, or as taking the place of his estate, and go to. indemnify his mortgagees of the term, and him.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The holder of a judgment in a court of record against- tho lessee, would have had a claim on such part or portion of tho surplus moneys, for such judgment would have been a lien on the lessee\u2019s term or estate. (2 Rev. Stat., 359, \u00a7 3.) The mortgagees of the lessee have a claim on such part or portion of the surplus moneys, for their mortgages gave them liens on' the lessee\u2019s term or estate. It would be strange, indeed, if the lessee\u2019s mortgagees have a claim on such part or portion of the surplus, because their mortgages gave them liens, on the lessee\u2019s unexpired term and estate, that the lessee, the owner of the unexpired term and estate itself, subject to the mortgages, should' not be entitled in equity as between him and the executor.of the lessor to what might be left of that part or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>portion of the surplus after paying his mortgagees of the term, considering the fall and express covenant of the lessor for quiet enjoyment, and especially considering that an action at law on this covenant would give the lessee a very inadequate indemnity for the loss of his unexpired term indirectly by the very act of the lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">But the lessee and Remsen, his principal mortgagee of the term, were parties to the foreclosure action, and I think are bound \"by the price for which the premises were bid off and conveyed. Therefore, in ascertaining what part or amount of the surplus moneys should be regarded as having been bid and paid for the unexpired term of the lease, I think \u00a7119,750 the amount which the premises brought at the mortgage sale should be taken as the value of the premises, or of a fee absolute in them, including the un expired term of the lease. I cannot doubt that upon such assumption the value of, or how much of the surplus should be regarded as having been paid for the lessee\u2019s unexpired term, subject to the annual rent, liability to pay taxes, &amp;c., I may say, subject to the terms of the lease, can be ascertained with reasonable accuracy. The opinions of witnesses as to the value of the lessee\u2019s unexpired term should not he resorted to, if such value can be ascertained by calculation on the assumption above stated with reasonable certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">In my opinion, after taking from the $85,046.91, the amount of the surplus paid into court, the costs and expenses of this proceeding as to such surplus, including the costs of all parties to this appeal oil this appeal and such reasonable and proper allowances for counsel, as the court shall have the power and feel authorized to make, and the ascertained value of the widow\u2019s right of dower, and the-ascertained value of the lessee\u2019s unexpired term, less the $750 rent m arrear, if anything should be left, the executor of the lessor would he entitled to it, but that the executor has no claim or lien on such surplus beyond such contingent residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">As to the sum or amount to be ascertained as the value of the lessee\u2019s unexpired term at the time of the mortgage sale, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number><em>it </em>less the $750 rent in arrear, should he,appropriated, first to the payment of the Reinsen mortgage in full; next to the payment of the mortgage held by Iioyt, assignee, in full, and whatever may be left of it, after paying these two mortgages, should he paid to Phillips, the lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">I do not think our decision of this case should be controlled by <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Stenton </em>(52 Barb., 389), considering the reasons given in the opinion in that case at General Term, for reversing the Special Term, and considering the special circumstances of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The order appealed from should he reversed and the exceptions to the referee\u2019s report allowed with' costs of all parties to this appeal, on the appeal, to be paid out of the surplus moneys, and the matter should be referred back to the referee, to proceed and report according to the views expressed in this opinion, and the order appealed from should be so reversed and matter referred back, without prejudice to counsel\u2019s right to make such application to the court for allowances as they may be advised to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
