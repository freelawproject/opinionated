Watkins, Appellant, <em>v. </em>Russell M. Rush, Respondent.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b252-5\">(General Term, Seventh District,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AE3\">September, 1869.)</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b252-6\">Upon a sale without writing, of standing grass, the vendee paid the whole price, entered, cut, and removed a portion of the crop, when he was stopped <em>by </em>the <em>vendor. </em>\u2014 Held, that the vendee was not entitled to recover the sum paid without allowance for the grass taken.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b252-7\">The complaint claimed damages for non-delivery of the grass, the answer was a general denial and plea of the statute of <em>frauds. </em>\u2014 Held, that evidence of the quantity of grass removed, was competent upon the question of damages.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-8\">This was an appeal from a judgment of the Ontario County Court, reversing the judgment of a Justice\u2019s Court upon the verdict of a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-9\">The complaint before the justice was in writing, and upon a contract made with the defendant for sale of standing grass, and it demanded damages for a refusal to deliver the same, or allow it to be cut according to the contract. The answer denied each and every allegation of the complaint, and averred that the alleged contract was for a sale of real estate, and void by the statute of frauds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-10\">It appeared that the plaintiff had purchased the grass in question, without written agreement, of the defendant, for the sum of twenty-five dollars, which he (plaintiff) paid, and afterward entered upon the land, and mowed and removed part of the grass, but while he was mowing the remainder, the defendant interfered and prevented him from continuing to cut or harvest it. The \"justice excluded evidence offered by the defendant to show the quantity of hay removed, as immaterial and improper, and the defendant excepted. The plaintiff had a verdict for the full amount paid for the grass; the defendant appealed, and the judgment was reversed in the County Court, and thereupon this appeal was taken by tke-plaintiif.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-11\"><em>H.

The plaintiff had received a portion of the property. He cannot maintain his action to recover the whole of the purchase price without making restitution, or compensating the defendant for the benefit which he has received. Honesty and fair dealing forbid it. <em>(Abbott </em>v. <em>Draper, </em>4 Denio, 51.)</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Besides, the action, as stated in the complaint, was not to recover back money paid under a void contract, but for damages by reason of the non-delivery of the grass by the defendant. The answer was sufficient to put in issue the amount of damage sustained by the plaintiff) and evidence of the amount of hay received by him was competent on the question of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">In either view of the case, therefore, the justice erred in excluding the evidence of the amount of hay received by the plaintiff, and in instructing the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the whole of the purchase price paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">The judgment of the County Court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">All concuring.'' Judgment affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
