P. DART, <em>Master.''</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-22\">This bill of lading was sent by the shipper to Ensign, the consignee at Buffalo, by mail, and was received by him. The plaintiff at the same time signed another bill of lading, the same in terms with that above set forth, omitting the memorandum : \u201c Eor I. F. Fox, care Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, Chicago, 111., deliver at their dock ; \u201d and also, \u201cfrom Hew York to Chicago, six dollars and twenty-five cents per ton net; \u201d the latter he retained in his possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-23\">The plaintiff delivered the cargo at Buffalo in due season as consigned, and it was received by the consignee, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>defendant. Ho claim was made at the time of delivery for hack freight, and the delivery was without notice of any lien or claim thereon, but a demand of the freight was afterwards made of the defendant, and payment refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-4\">There was delay at Buffalo in unloading the boat, on account of the defendant\u2019s neglect to receive the cargo upon its arrival. The plaintiff sued for the balance of freight charges to Buffalo, and also for damages by way of demurrage on account of the delay. The referee dismissed the complaint, and plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-5\"><em>Messenger c&amp; Jenkins, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-6\"><em>A. </em>Perry, for the respondent,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An6\">insisted substantially, with other points, that the bill of lading in this case differed from that in ordinary use. under which a consignee is held liable for freight, in that it made no provision for the payment of freight by the consignee, and that without such provision, and no other facts having been proved from which a contract to pay freight could be implied, the consignee could not be charged.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b403-7\">Present \u2014 Mullin, Morgan and Doolittle, JJ.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b403-8\">By the Court</p>\n<author id=\"AQ3\">Mullin, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiL\">There were two bills of lading signed by plaintiff, the one showing consignment to the defendant at Buffalo, that consignor had paid $412.52, which sum consignee was directed to retain for consignor out of freight earned by plaintiff. . The freight came to $616.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">By the other bill of lading the goods were consigned to Fox of Chicago to the care,of defendant at Buffalo. Freight to Chicago, $6.25 per ton, of which two dollars was to Buffalo. The two dollars was over tolls and unloading.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">It would seem that the latter bill was intended to accompany the goods to Chicago, the other to accompany them to Buffalo only. The plaintiff knew from the second bill above mentioned, that defendant was not owner of the goods; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>he received the goods only to forward them to Fox at Chicago. The plaintiff, when he delivered the goods to the defendants, had a lien for their carriage. His obligation to carry terminated at Buffalo, and his freight was then earned. When he delivered the goods to defendant he either transferred to him his lien, or lie surrendered the property relieved from all lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">It is obvious that it was the understanding between the consignor and the plaintiff that the latter was to be paid at Buffalo, as from the freight to that point the consignor\u2019s advances were to he retained. There was no one but plaintiff to pay. It is not to he presumed that, in view of these provisions, the plaintiff parted with his lien and consented to look to Fox, or the Chicago B. <em>&amp; </em>Q. R. R. Co. for his pay. The defendant was, I think, bound to pay freight when he accepted the goods. He was not liable for demnrrage if it was found that the detention was unreasonable. To subject an intermediate consignee to liability for damages in the nature of demurrage, he must own or have an interest in the property. The consignee at the place of final delivery may he liable although not interested in the property. '</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">For these reasons, I think the referee erred in his conclusions of law, and the judgment must he set aside and the order of reference vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
