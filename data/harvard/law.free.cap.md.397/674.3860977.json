Stansfield, of the Circuit Court for Carroll County, for hearing pursuant to Rule 16-757(c).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> After a hearing, at which the respondent appeared and participated, the court found the following facts by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The respondent was retained by Jeffrey A. Connelly, the complainant, to represent him in his pending divorce action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>The retainer agreement provided for the respondent to be paid at the rate of $180.00 an hour for her services and an initial retainer of $2,500.00, against which the respondent\u2019s hourly rate billing would be charged. The complainant paid the retainer by check. On the same day she . received the retainer check, the respondent deposited that check in her operating account, even though not all of the retainer had then been earned. Subsequently, beginning about two weeks after the retainer was paid, the complainant began a series of emails to the respondent, urging her to \u201cmove forward on his case.\u201d Despite these e-mail urgings, it was not until July 16, 2004, about a month later, that the respondent informed the complainant that \u201cthe documents required to file his divorce action were in progress.\u201d[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>] Thereafter, by e-mail dated August 5, 2004, the complainant \u201cdischarged\u201d the respondent, indicating that he would \u201cseek other counsel\u201d and \u201crequesting a <em>complete </em>refund to be paid to him by August 12, 2004.\u201d Despite sending the complainant a letter, dated the same day, August 5, containing copies of a letter and the original Complaint she had prepared and a bill showing a credit of $ 1,474.00 due the complainant, sans check, on August 7, 2004, the respondent sent the complainant an e-mail in which she asked that he reconsider his decision to discharge her. Other than an inconclusive exchange of e-mails\u2014the complainant stating his \u201cdesperate\u201d need for the refund and the respondent conceding that he \u201cwould be better off with someone who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>would give him the same consideration he had given\u201d her\u2014 almost three months passed before there was any other communication with the respondent with respect to the case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">The complainant filed his complaint with the petitioner, which complaint bar counsel forwarded, by letter dated November 1, 2004, to the respondent, with the request that she respond to it within 15 days. The respondent did not respond to that letter or to the two subsequent letters, one sent by certified mail, made necessary by that failure, until March 30, 2005. By that time, in addition to the bar counsel letters just mentioned, the complainant had written directly to the respondent, seeking a refund of the $1,474.00 the respondent had advised him he was due, and bar counsel had written yet another letter to the respondent, this time, in addition, seeking copies of her trust account and her client cards. When the respondent responded, she also included with her response to the complaint an amended bill for the client. According to that bill, the credit due the complainant was $880.00, some $594.00 less than reflected on the prior bill. The respondent refunded that amount to the complainant \u201cdirectly from her trust account,\u201d after she settled an unrelated personal injury case, as to which she received a fee of $960.00. The respondent\u2019s operating account balance in June 2004 was a negative one, and it remained a negative balance \u201cat the time a refund of at least Eight Hundred Eighty Dollars ($880.00) was clearly due the Complainant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">From the foregoing facts, the hearing court concluded, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent violated Rules 1.4(a)(3), 1.15(a), 1.16(d), 8.4(b), (c) and (d) of the Rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>of Professional Conduct, Rule 16-604 and \u00a7\u00a7 10-304 and 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The Rule 1.4(a)(3) and the Rule 8.1(b) violations relate to the respondent\u2019s failure to respond, to bar counsel and to the complainant. While its conclusion with respect to bar counsel and Rule 8.1 is clear and straight-forward, the hearing court explained, as to the complainant\u2019s request and Rule 1.4(a)(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">\u201c[T]he gravamen of [bar counsel\u2019s] contention is that if the e-mail were included with a letter of November 1, 2004, which the Respondent admitted she had not read, and even after becoming aware of it on December 1, 2004, did not respond to it, the Rule requires some type of response when a client asks that you either continue the representation and presumably actively pursue the matter for which the attorney had been engaged, or refund the retainer. The Court believes that there is an inherent requirement in this Rule that such a response be reasonably prompt. While facts and circumstances may justify days or even weeks in responding, certainly the length of time involved here is sufficient to find a violation of this Rule by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">With regard to the Rules 1.15 and 16-604 and \u00a7 10-304 violations, it was clear to the hearing court that the respondent received the retainer, deposited the unearned portion in her operating account rather than her escrow account and, \u201c[c]ompounding the problem,\u201d did not provide an explanation for not timely depositing it in escrow. In addition, the hearing court observed that \u201ca review of the Respondent\u2019s bank records clearly indicates that she commingled the Complainant\u2019s unearned retainer with her own funds, and she exhausted the same prior to having performed the work she promised to do for him.\u201d It did not find credible, and therefore rejected, the respondent\u2019s explanation for not depositing the retainer in her escrow account, \u201cto verify that the check [was] good, presumably before she would continue to perform work on behalf of the Complainant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Acknowledging that the respondent eventually refunded the unearned fee, the hearing court concluded that Rule 1.16(d) was violated nonetheless when she did not do so promptly. Addressing the discrepancy between the two bills that the respondent generated, each showing a different credit due the complainant, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-4\">\u201cAlthough the difference in the two statements provided to the Complainant and the difference between the credit balance amounts could raise a question of why there was a revision of the bill or how some item was not included in calculating the credit balance due the Complainant, we are left with the fact that the Respondent testified concerning problems obtaining bookkeeping and assistance services during that period of time and explained the error that resulted in this change. Further, the Complainant accepted the check sent by the Respondent in the lower amount, presumably in full payment of his refund.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">With regard to the Rule 8.4 violations and the \u00a7 10-306 violation, the hearing court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">\u201cThere is no question that the Respondent, after having deposited the Complainant\u2019s retainer into her operating account, spent it. She clearly had to secure funds from another matter some six (6) months later in order to have sufficient funds from which to send a refund to the Complainant. There is no other inference to be drawn from the evidence other than the Respondent spent the funds improperly for personal purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">On the other hand, it rejected the petitioner\u2019s argument that the respondent had committed theft, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">\u201cThere was a dispute as to the amount of the refund due until the Complainant accepted the refund check tendered by Respondent. While the Court feels that these rules and statutes [sic] have been violated by clear and convincing evidence, the Court does not find that these actions resulted from the requisite criminal intent to constitute Theft.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">The hearing court also commented on \u201cissues in the Respondent\u2019s testimony,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>\u201cIn the first place, she testified that essentially she had trouble engaging adequate or any assistance with the bookkeeping functions in her office, and was further plagued with extensive problems surrounding the death of her friend, who also functioned as an investigator. Tragically, it appears that that death occurred under very suspicious circumstances, and while we are not privileged to the criminal nature of these circumstances, the bottom line is that the Court finds no evidence to dispute the Respondent\u2019s testimony in this regard. However, the practice of law, especially in the Family Law area, most often requires an attorney to prioritize the needs of the various clients in order to attend to all matters related to all of the clients in the attorney\u2019s practice. That is very demanding at times and is often easier said than done, but errors in time frames for response, refunds, or other matters of this type, certainly should not be allowed to drift into the excessive time frame outlined in this case, not only for the efficient handling of clients\u2019 matters, but also for the proper functioning of a law practice. While there may be considerations of the mitigating factors in this case by the Court of Appeals, this Court does not see any of the arguments advanced by the Respondent in her proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law as sufficient to rise to the level that the Findings of this Court made by clear and convincing evidence are correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Neither the petitioner nor the respondent took exceptions to the findings and conclusions of the hearing court. The petitioner, however, did file Petitioner\u2019s Exceptions to Findings of Fact and Recommendation for Sanction, in which it recommended that the respondent be disbarred. It relies on <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 773 A.2d 463 (2001); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Blum, </em>373 Md. 275, 818 A.2d 219 (2003); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Duvall, </em>384 Md. 234, 863 A.2d 291 (2004); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Roberts, </em>394 Md. 137, 904 A.2d 557 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>In <em>Vanderlinde, </em>we reiterated and reemphasized the well settled principle that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-4\">\u201cMisappropriation of funds by an attorney is an act infected with deceit and dishonesty and ordinarily will result in disbarment in the absence of compelling extenuating circumstances justifying a lesser sanction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-5\"><em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 406, 773 A.2d at 480, <em>quoting Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bakas, </em>323 Md. 395, 403, 593 A.2d 1087, 1091 (1991), which, in turn, cited <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ezrin, </em>312 Md. 603, 608-09, 541 A.2d 966, 969 (1988). We then stated, emphatically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">\u201cAccordingly, we reiterate once again the position we announced in <em>Kenney. Moreover, we expound upon it by holding that, in cases of intentional dishonesty, misappropriation cases, fraud, stealing, serious criminal conduct and the like, we will not accept, as \u2018compelling extenuating circumstances,\u2019 anything less than the most serious and utterly debilitating mental or physical health conditions, arising from any source that is the \u2018root cause\u2019 of the misconduct and </em>that also result in an attorney\u2019s utter inability to conform his or her conduct in accordance with the law and with the MRPC. Only if the circumstances are that compelling, will we even consider imposing less than the most severe sanction of disbarment in cases of stealing, dishonesty, fraudulent conduct, the intentional misappropriation of funds or other serious criminal conduct, whether occurring in the practice of law, or otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-7\"><em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 413-14, 773 A.2d at 485. Underlying the rule is the recognition that \u201c[ujnlike matters relating to competency, diligence and the like, intentional dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to such a degree as to make intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418, 773 A.2d at 488. Thus, <em>Vanderlinde </em>and its progeny make clear that \u201c[djisbarment ordinarily should be the sanction for intentional dishonest conduct.\u201d <em>Id. See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Pennington, </em>387 Md. 565, 597, 876 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>642, 661 (2005); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lane, </em>367 Md. 633, 646, 790 A.2d 621, 628 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">In <em>Vanderlinde, </em>the respondent attorney, as she freely acknowledged, had \u201con many occasions over a period of time [ ] misappropriated money of the Association [her employer] for her own use.\u201d 364 Md. at 381, 773 A.2d at 466. Therefore, there simply was no issue of the intention with which she acted; she offered only mitigation, \u201cthe pressures of her life and the impairment of her mental faculties, including her periods of depression,\u201d <em>id., </em>hoping thereby to moderate the sanction. This Court rejected that mitigation. <em>Id. </em>at 414-15, 773 A.2d at 485-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Blum was found to have violated, in the representation of several clients, numerous Rules and Rules of Professional Conduct, including, <em>inter alia, </em>Rule 8.4(c), and statutes including \u00a7 10-306, involving client funds and misrepresentation. Among the misconduct sanctioned were the deposit of unearned retainers in his operating account, the use of those unearned fees before they were earned and the failure to return the unearned portion of a fee to a client. There were no mitigating facts offered or found. 373 Md. at 304, 818 A.2d at 236. In summarizing the basis for the disbarment sanction, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">\u201cBlum refused to return Ms. Dianat\u2019s money to her when she terminated his representation, and then altered a check, which he provided to her new attorney, in order to create the illusion that he had paid her. Blum also took funds that clients had given to him in anticipation of future services and deposited such funds into his personal and operating accounts for his own benefit, before he had earned those funds. Behavior such as this, in and of itself, \u2018in the absence of mitigating circumstances, ordinarily warrants disbarment.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">373 Md. at 303, 818 A.2d at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">In <em>Duvall, </em>the respondent attorney had been \u201cfound by the hearing court to have \u2018committed multiple violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct,\u2019 including failing to account for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>the unearned portion of a retainer, failing, despite being requested to do so to refund that unearned portion to the client and using those funds, which constituted trust funds, for a purpose other than that for which it was entrusted to the respondent,\u201d and previously had been disciplined. 384 Md. at 241, 863 A.2d at 295. We determined that disbarment was the appropriate sanction and, so, ordered her disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The petitioner argues, emphasizing the hearing court\u2019s factual findings and conclusions, especially \u201cthat Respondent\u2019s conduct violated Rule 8.4(c),\u201d and the absence of any finding of extenuating circumstances, that <em>Vanderlinde </em>and its progeny control the disposition of this case. It submits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">\u201cThe most serious aspect of this matter is that Respondent violated her fiduciary responsibility to Complainant by spending funds that were given to her in trust for her personal purposes at a time when those funds were the property of the client. As a result of her dishonesty, she did not have funds available to give the complainant which her own billings stated she owed him. Disbarment is the appropriate sanction for this misconduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Maintaining that there have been no compelling extenuating circumstances shown in this case\u2014in fact, the hearing court went to great pains to make that point\u2014, and, although conceding that the conduct <em>sub judice </em>is less egregious than either <em>Blum </em>or <em>Duvall, </em>the petitioner emphasizes nevertheless the seriousness of the respondent\u2019s violations, urging that that alone warrants disbarment. It adds and reiterates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATv\">\u201cRespondent abused the trust the client had placed in her by spending money that belonged to him on herself. She compounded this wrongdoing by refusing to refund Complainant the money she admitted she owed him for almost eight months after his first request for a refund, and by failing to answer Bar Counsel\u2019s request for information about this matter for almost five months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">As we have seen, the respondent did not take any exceptions. In fact, she expressly conceded that, although she did not agree with all of the findings made by the hearing court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>none of the findings was clearly erroneous. Moreover, the respondent was not reluctant to admit that she \u201cdid two very wrong things\u201d and that \u201c[she] expect[ed] there to be consequences for those wrong things that [she] did.\u201d One of those \u201cwrong things\u201d that she did and which she readily admitted was depositing into her operating account a retainer check when not all of the amount represented by the check had not been earned. Nor did she offer any excuses or try to explain those wrong things away. To be sure, the respondent indicated that she had reasons for what she did, but she made clear that they were not, nor intended to be, excuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Rather than merely accept a sanction, which she said she was tempted to do, the respondent, professing a desire to continue a 28 year career representing people in such matters as domestic violence, notwithstanding the stressors involved, asks the Court to impose a sanction other than disbarment. Noting that the Peer Review Committee recommended dismissal, which she believes to be insufficient, and finding a distinction between her misconduct and that in the cases on which the petitioner relies, she believes that something short of disbarment, although she would not be more specific, is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We are inclined to the view of the respondent with regard to the sanction. In urging the hearing court to find that the respondent violated Rule 8.4(b), (c) and (d), the petitioner argued that because \u201cmisappropriation of funds held in escrow constitutes the crime of Theft,\u201d the respondent committed the crime of theft. Although the hearing court found that the respondent\u2019s conduct did violate each of the subsections of Rule 8.4 charged and even referred to the respondent\u2019s spending of the unearned portion of the retainer as \u201cbasic misappropriation,\u201d it very clearly and emphatically found that \u201cthese actions [did not] result[ ] from the requisite criminal intent to constitute Theft.\u201d The petitioner interprets the hearing court\u2019s affirmation that the rules and statute had been violated by clear and convincing evidence to be dispositive of the sanction, it being a finding that the conduct was dishonest and deceitful. The respondent takes the opposite position, main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>taining that her argument of lack of intent carried the day. The finding is at best ambiguous, indicating that, at the least, the hearing court had some doubt as to the level of the respondent\u2019s culpability. Disbarment should not rest on such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Moreover, as indicated, the respondent has shown remorse: she expressly did not except to the findings or conclusions of the hearing court and, indeed, conceded their adequacy. She also accepted responsibility for the misconduct and did not seek to minimize or otherwise avoid consequences that might flow from it. We have recognized that \u201c[f]rom the respondent\u2019s remorse ..., that a repeat of the misconduct was unlikely, admittedly not mentioned, could have been inferred.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kovacic, </em>389 Md. 233, 239, 884 A.2d 673, 676 (2005). Finally, the respondent has no prior grievance history. Bearing in mind the purpose of attorney discipline, which we have stated repeatedly, to protect the public and not to punish the erring attorney, <em>see Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Rees, </em>396 Md. 248, 254, 913 A.2d 68, 72 (2006); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Wallace, </em>368 Md. 277, 289, 793 A.2d 535, 542 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Lockhart, </em>285 Md. 586, 597, 403 A.2d 1241, 1247 (1979), we are satisfied that suspending the respondent indefinitely is the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST CAROL LONG McCULLOCH.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-7\">.
