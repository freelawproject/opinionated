State, </em>(No. 123), <em>Womack v. State, </em>(No. 114), and <em>Pye v. State, </em>(No. 113). With one exception, all three cases address essentially the same legal issue and involve essentially the same argument with respect to the merger of certain handgun related offenses. The issue that the three cases have in common, as we have restated it, is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-12\">Whether our holding in <em>Frazier v. State, </em>318 Md. 597, 569 A.2d 684 (1990), that the offenses of carrying a handgun and possession of a firearm by a convicted person do not merge, is still viable, even though, subsequent to that decision, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>General Assembly increased the penalties associated with the crime of possession of a firearm by a convicted person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhJ\">Because the General Assembly is presumed to have been aware of our holding in <em>Frazier </em>when it enacted legislation to increase penalties for possession of a firearm by a convicted person, we conclude that it is still viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">The exception is the second issue, presented only in <em>Pye, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">\u201cDid the trial judge err in denying [Pye\u2019s] motions to dismiss and acquit by sentencing him to a five year no parole sentence for possession of a firearm by a person with a prior conviction under Article 27, \u00a7 449(e) where [Pye] previously had been convicted of a felony[,] but not a crime of violence?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Concluding that \u00a7 449(e) requires an individual to have been previously convicted of a crime or crimes that were both a felony <em>and </em>a crime of violence, <em>see Stanley v. State, </em>390 Md. 175, 887 A.2d 1078 (2005), we answer that question in the affirmative. Accordingly, we shall hold that the trial judge erred as a matter of law by denying Pye\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">In <em>Teel, Womack, </em>and <em>Pye, </em>the petitioners were convicted of wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol., 2001 Cum. Supp.) Article 27, \u00a7 36B<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and of possession of a firearm in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.

Thus, the issues we address are purely legal questions. Therefore, we shall review the judgments <em>de novo, Cox v. State, </em>397 Md. 200, 210-11, 916 A.2d 311, 317 (2007); <em>State v. Rucker, </em>374 Md. 199, 207, 821 A.2d 439, 444 (2003); <em>Carter v. State, </em>367 Md. 447, 457, 788 A.2d 646, 651 (2002); the trial courts\u2019 express interpretation of the law enjoys no presumption of correctness.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\"><em>Teel v. </em>State<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">In <em>Frazier v. State, </em>318 Md. 597, 569 A.2d 684 (1990), officers assigned to the Drug Enforcement Unit of the Balti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>more City Police Department, while proceeding to execute a warrant for an apartment on the second floor of an apartment building, encountered Frazier sitting on the front stoop of the building. When they approached, Frazier \u201cjumped up[,]\u201d reached into his waistband, produced a revolver, and began moving back into the building. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 569 A.2d at 686-687. The officers wrestled the gun away from Frazier and arrested him. Because he previously had been convicted of attempted robbery with a deadly weapon, a crime of violence, <em>see </em>\u00a7 441(e),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Frazier was charged with wearing, carrying, and transporting a handgun, in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl. Vol.) Article 27, \u00a7 36B (b), and possession of a handgun after being convicted of a crime of violence, in violation of \u00a7 445(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He was convicted of both offenses and sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">On certiorari to this Court, Frazier presented, inter alia, the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">\u201cMust the convictions and sentences for wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun and for possessing a pistol or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>revolver by a person who has been convicted of a crime of violence be merged?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><em>Frazier, </em>318 Md. at 604, 569 A.2d at 688. We answered that question in the negative, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">\u201cIt is significant that the Legislature did not amend or supersede Article 27, \u00a7 445(c). So, even if offenses are deemed the same under the required evidence test, the Legislature may punish certain conduct more severely if particular aggravating circumstances are present, by imposing punishment under two separate statutory offenses. <em>See Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260, 274 n. 4, 373 A.2d 262[, 270 n. 4] (1977). The Legislature\u2019s concern about the possession of a handgun, and its additional concern about the aggravating circumstance of the handgun being possessed by a person who has been convicted of a crime of violence, is not unreasonable____We hold that the two offenses of which Frazier was convicted do not merge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 614-615, 569 A.2d at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">More significant for our purposes, however, is the reasoning underlying that holding. After noting the \u201cgeneral rule for determining whether two criminal violations, treated separately under the statutory provisions, should be deemed the same when both violations are based on the same transaction,\u201d <em>i.e. </em>the \u201crequired evidence\u201d test, <em>see Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), and discussing its application, <em>id. </em>at 612-13, 569 A.2d at 692, the Court pointed out that it was not the only test, that \u201c \u2018[t]he imposition of multiple punishment ... is often particularly dependent upon the intent of the Legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613, 569 A.2d at 692, <em>quoting Whack v. State, </em>288 Md. 137, 143, 416 A.2d 265, 268 (1980), <em>appeal dismissed and cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 990, 101 S.Ct. 1688, 68 L.Ed.2d 189 (1981). Turning to the statutes then at issue, the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-10\">\u201cWhen it enacted the handgun control statute, Ch. 13 of the Acts of 1972, Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 36B-36F, the Legislature specifically addressed the matter of other statutes encompassing handguns, and it indicated its intent as to which of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>other statutes should no longer cover the use of handguns. Thus, prior to 1972, Art. 27, \u00a7 36, had proscribed the carrying of concealed weapons and the carrying or wearing of weapons openly with intent to injure, including handguns. Also prior to 1972, Art. 27, \u00a7 36A, had provided a maximum penalty of three years\u2019 imprisonment for carrying \u2018any ... deadly weapon of any kind\u2019 on public school property. Finally, prior to 1972, there was local legislation regulating and penalizing certain uses of handguns. In the handgun control act of 1972, the Legislature dealt with the above-described statutory provisions, so as to prohibit the pyramiding of penalties under both the existing law and the new law for the unlawful use of a handgun. It amended Art. 27, \u00a7 36, to expressly delete handguns from the coverage of the concealed weapons statute (Ch. 13, \u00a7 1, of the Acts of 1972). It further amended Art. 27, \u00a7 36A, to provide that where the weapon carried on public school property is a handgun, the penalty provisions of \u00a7 36A do not apply, but instead, the offender shall be sentenced in accordance with the penalty provisions of the new statute (Ch. 13, \u00a7 2, of the Acts of 1972). Lastly, with respect to local legislation regulating handguns, the Legislature stated (Ch. 13, \u00a7 6, of the Acts of 1972):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">\u2018[A]ll restrictions imposed by the law, ordinances, or regulations of the political subdivisions on the wearing, carrying, or transporting of handguns are superseded by this Act, and the State of Maryland hereby preempts the right of the political subdivisions to regulate said matters.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 613-14, 569 A.2d at 692-93, <em>citing Whack, </em>288 Md. at 145-46, 416 A.2d at 269 (footnote omitted). Emphasizing the point, the Court concluded: \u201c \u2018in enacting the handgun act,[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] the Legislature was concerned with the matter of duplicative legislation. Where it desired no duplication, it specifically amended or superseded those other statutes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., quoting Whack, </em>288 Md. at 147, 416 A.2d at 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Teel argues that the present case is different from <em>Frazier. </em>He relies primarily on the fact that, since <em>Frazier, </em>the General Assembly has greatly \u201cincreased the penalty for possession of a firearm by a convicted person.\u201d Pointing to the Maryland Gun Violence Act of 1996<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the Responsible Gun Safety Act of 2000,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Teel submits that \u201cthe amendments to the firearms statute since 1990 have drastically altered the landscape upon which the issue of merger must be examined____ Merger of carrying a handgun and possession of a firearm by a convicted person should now be required as a matter of course.\u201d More particularly, he argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">\u201cWith respect to the amendments to Article 27, \u00a7 449, however, the Legislature did not include language specifically authorizing cumulative sentences for possession of a firearm by a convicted person and the lesser offense of carrying a handgun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">\u201cAt best, the failure of the General Assembly to expressly address the issue of merger when it increased the punishment for possession of a firearm by a convicted person makes its intentions unclear. But this would weigh in favor of merger, not against it.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">We disagree. The legislative acts on which the petitioner relies were re-codifications of the relevant general provisions relating to the illegal use of weapons. We said in <em>Pack Shack v. Howard County, </em>371 Md. 243, 257, 808 A.2d 795, 803 (2002), that \u201c \u2018a change in a statute as part of a general re-codification will ordinarily not be deemed to modify the law unless the change is such that the intention of the Legislature to modify the law is unmistakable\u2019 \u201d <em>(quoting Duffy v. Conaway, </em>295 Md. 242, 257, 455 A.2d 955, 962 (1983)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>There is no indication in the Acts that the General Assembly intended to modify the holding in <em>Frazier </em>when it enacted the 1996 and 2000 Acts relating to the use of weapons. The contrary would appear to be more likely. Thus <em>Frazier, </em>which we decline to overrule, is controlling. In <em>Frazier, </em>as we have indicated, we held that \u201c[wjhere [the General Assembly] desired no duplication, it specifically amended or superseded those other statutes.\u201d 318 Md. at 614, 569 A.2d at 693 <em>(quoting Whack, </em>288 Md. at 146, 416 A.2d at 270). Since <em>Frazier </em>only increases in the permissible sentences for certain offenses have been enacted by the General Assembly, which also has further limited the transferability of certain weapons and imposed additional requirements on dealers. In neither of the codifications at issue here was reference specifically made to avoidance of duplication. In neither of the two statutory modifications, has the General Assembly indicated that duplicative sentences under separate statutory offenses, arising out of one incident involving handguns, are to be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">The General Assembly is presumed to be aware of our decisions. We recently stated in <em>Plein v. Department of Labor, </em>369 Md. 421, 437, 800 A.2d 757, 767 (2002), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuF\">\u201cOn the other hand, consistent with the Legislature\u2019s awareness of our cases, we have been reluctant to overrule our prior decisions where it is likely that the Legislature, by its inaction, indicates its adoption, or at least acceptance, of the interpretation reflected in the opinion announcing the decision....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">This principle was also expressed in <em>Jones v. State, </em>362 Md. 331, 337-38, 765 A.2d 127, 130-31 (2001), in which this Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">\u201c \u2018The General Assembly is presumed to be aware of this Court\u2019s interpretation of its enactments and, if such interpretation is not legislatively overturned, to have acquiesced in that interpretation. This presumption is particularly strong whenever, after statutory language has been interpreted by this Court, the Legislature re-enacts the statute without changing in substance the language at issue. Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>der these circumstances, it is particularly inappropriate to depart from the principle of stare decisis and overrule our prior interpretation of the statute.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-5\"><em>(quoting Williams v. State, </em>292 Md. 201, 210, 438 A.2d 1301, 1305 (1981) (citations omitted)); <em>Pack Shack, </em>371 Md. at 257, 808 A.2d at 803 (General Assembly is presumed to have knowledge of this Court\u2019s interpretation of its enactments). <em>See also Schaeffer v. Anne Arundel County, </em>338 Md. 75, 87, 656 A.2d 751, 757 (1995) (General Assembly is presumed to have knowledge of this Court\u2019s cases prior to proposing an amendment to the State Constitution); <em>Maryland Classified Employees Association, Inc. v. Schaefer, </em>325 Md. 19, 34, 599 A.2d 91, 98 (1991) (General Assembly is presumed to have knowledge of an agency\u2019s interpretations of its enactments).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The General Assembly is presumed to have had full knowledge of our holding in <em>Frazier </em>when it enacted the legislation on which Teel relies. Therefore, had the General Assembly wanted to avoid duplication with respect to handgun sentences arising out of a single incident, it certainly could have, and we believe would have, included in that legislation a provision prohibiting such sentences. It did not do so. Nothing but the passage of time and the legislation on which the petitioner\u2019s argument depends, which simply increased the penalty, have occurred since <em>Frazier. </em>As Judge Deborah Eyler correctly pointed out for the Court of Special Appeals: \u201cThe point of reference for legislative intent in <em>Johnson [v. State, </em>154 Md.App. 286, 839 A.2d 769 (2003),] was, as in <em>Frazier </em>and <em>Whack, </em>the 1972 Handgun Control Act and the legislature\u2019s concern with the \u2018increased use of handguns in the commission of crimes.\u2019 That point of reference is not changed____\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">The General Assembly has not seen fit to modify this Court\u2019s interpretation of the statutes at issue in <em>Frazier, </em>even though it has twice addressed similar issues. Rather than inserting a provision prohibiting duplicative sentencing, which it could have done in either of the subject enactments, 1996 or 2000, on which Teel relies, it simply increased the permitted sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>Moreover, and perhaps as important, it is most unlikely that the General Assembly would promulgate, on the one hand, a statutory scheme designed, in part, to increase sentences, while, on the other hand, and at the same time, intending that the doctrine of merger would apply and, thereby, reduce the total sentences. The legislature\u2019s actions in enacting the 1996 and 2000 legislation are consistent with our holding in <em>Frazier, </em>which we reaffirm.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\"><em>Womack v. </em>State<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Womack was convicted and sentenced under the same statutory scheme as applied in <em>Teel. </em>One of his convictions was pursuant to \u00a7 445(d)(1)(iii),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> possessing a regulated firearm, having been convicted of a \u201cviolation classified as a misdemeanor in this State that carries a statutory penalty of more than 2 years,\u201d and the other was pursuant to \u00a7 36B (c). Lamenting the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 rejection of his \u201ccontention that he could not be convicted for both transport<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>ing a handgun and possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a misdemeanor,\u201d he presents a single argument to this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-4\">\u201c[Whether the] Court of Special Appeals erred by ruling that [Womack] could be convicted of carrying a handgun as well as possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a misdemeanor carrying a statutory penalty of more than two years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">After discussing the relatively similar chronological history of the statutes in this case and those in the companion cases, the petitioner makes a similar argument to that made in those cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">\u201cThe legislature clearly intended not to allow convictions for both carrying a handgun and possession of a firearm by a misdemeanant. When the General Assembly included persons previously convicted of certain misdemeanors in \u00a7 445, the legislators were aware of this Court\u2019s 1990 decision in <em>Frazier v. State, supra. </em>They could foresee that the problem of whether persons could be convicted of both crimes would arise. They knew that, if they wanted to allow punishments for both crimes, they should say so in the statute. They failed to do so. Therefore, it is apparent that they did not intend to allow dual punishment for carrying a handgun and possession of a firearm by a misdemeanant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2c\">For the same reasons stated in <em>Teel, supra, </em>we reject that argument. The judgment of the Court of Special Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\"><em>Pye v. </em>State<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AB1\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">As mentioned above, Pye presents two issues for our review. The first is the same one presented in both <em>Teel, supra, </em>and <em>Womack, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">\u201cShould this Court\u2019s prior decision in <em>Frazier v. State, </em>that carrying a handgun does not merge into possession of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>firearm by a convicted person be inapplicable to the instant case because the General Assembly has greatly increased the penalty for possession of a firearm by a convicted person since the <em>Frazier </em>ruling?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">We resolve it in the same way that we resolved the issue in the prior cases: for the reasons stated in <em>Teel, supra, </em>we answer the above question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The additional issue Pye presents for our consideration is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">\u201cDid the trial judge err in denying [Pye\u2019s] motions to dismiss and to acquit and by sentencing him to a five year no parole sentence for possession of a firearm by a person with a prior conviction under Article 27, \u00a7 449(e) where [Pye] previously had been convicted of a felony but not a crime of violence?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Its answer depends upon the interpretation of \u00a7 449 in an attempt to determine whether \u00a7\u00a7 445 and 449(e) require a prior conviction of both a crime of violence and a crime of felony, or whether a conviction of one or the other, but not both, will suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">The petitioner was charged with possessing a firearm after having previously been convicted of a felony narcotic violation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He moved, prior to trial, to dismiss that charge. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>argued that such a conviction required proof of conviction of both a felony and a crime. The trial court reserved its ruling on the issue. At the close of evidence, Pye, making the same argument, moved for judgment of acquittal as to that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The trial court denied the motion for judgment of acquittal, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">\u201cAll right, for the reasons [] this Court has stated previously on the record, [ ], there is no need for the State to prove a conviction [ ], for a crime of violence and for that reason, as well as the court\u2019s reasons with respect to the reservation of 445(c) instead of 445(d), the Court is denying the motion for [ajcquittal----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The trial court then instructed the jury that the parties \u201chave stipulated that the defendant has been convicted previously of an offense which conviction prohibits him from possessing a handgun.\u201d <footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Section 449(e), the statute under which Pye was sentenced after being convicted of the first count, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-9\">\u201c(e) <em>Illegal possession of firearm with certain previous </em>convictions.\u2014A person who was previously convicted of a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441(e) of this article or convicted of a violation of \u00a7 286 or \u00a7 286A of this article, and who is in illegal possession of a firearm as defined in \u00a7 445(d)(1)\u00ae <em>and </em>(ii) of this article, is guilty of a felony and upon conviction shall be imprisoned for not less than 5 years, no part of which may be suspended and the person may not be eligible for parole. Each violation shall be considered a separate offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Art. 27, \u00a7 449(e) (emphasis added). Section 445(d)(1)\u00ae and (ii), which \u00a7 449(e) references, provide, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-4\">\u201c(d) <em>Restrictions on possession\u2014In </em>general.\u2014A person may not possess a regulated firearm if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">\u201c(1) Has been convicted of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">\u201c(i) A crime of violence; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">\u201c(ii) Any violation classified as a felony in this State[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The State argues that the language of (d)(1)\u00ae and (ii) controls. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">We recently were confronted with the same issue in <em>Stanley v. State, </em>390 Md. 175, 887 A.2d 1078 (2005); namely, whether a person must be convicted of both a crime of violence and a felony in order to be subjected to an enhanced sentence. We held that the word \u201cand\u201d in \u00a7 449(e) (emphasized in the quote of that subsection) controls because it requires that convictions for a prior offense or offenses must be both a crime of violence and a felony. As we stated in <em>Stanley:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-10\">\u201cWe agree with the petitioner and with Judge Davis, \u00a7 449(e) is clear and unambiguous. By its clear and explicit terms, to be subjected to the enhanced penalty it prescribes, a person must be in \u2018illegal possession of a firearm ... \u2019 <em>and </em>been convicted previously of a crime of violence ... or been convicted of certain enumerated drug related offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQM\">\u2018Section 449(e), by its plain structure, is divided into two requirements. The first requirement is that the defendant have a previous conviction of a crime that falls within \u00a7 441(e). The second requirement is that the defendant have a current conviction under \u00a7 445(d)\u00ae and (ii).\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-11\">\u201cThe definition of the illegal possession targeted for purposes of this statute-there are two other proscribed possessions listed in \u00a7 445(d)\u2014consists of two elements and is stated in the conjunctive. Consequently, both elements must be met; it is not sufficient if only one is present. That means, since the definition includes a crime of violence <em>and </em>\u2018any violation classified as a felony in this State,\u2019 that a conviction of both, not just one, must be established____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number><em>Stanley, </em>390 Md. at 183, 887 A.2d at 1082-83 (emphasis added) (citations omitted) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>\u201c[t]he State agree[d] that the question in the present case is the same as that presented in <em>Stanley v. State, </em>157 Md.App. 363, 851 A.2d 612, <em>[cert. grant</em>ed], 383 Md. 256, 858 A.2d 1017, ... argued on January 11, 2005.\u201d Accordingly, our holding in <em>Stanley </em>controls and we answer the question posed by Pye in the affirmative. The trial court should have granted the motion for judgment of acquittal with respect to the first count. Thus, we reverse Pye\u2019s conviction for possession of a firearm by a person with a previous conviction and vacate that sentence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the offenses of carrying a handgun and possession of a firearm by a convicted person do not merge. We also hold that, under <em>Stanley, </em>a person sentenced under Article 27, \u00a7 449(e) must have been convicted of a crime or crimes that are both crimes of violence and also felonies in order to receive the mandatory minimum sentence provided therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">IN CASE 123, JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY TEEL. IN CASE 114, JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, COSTS TO BE PAID BY WOMACK. IN CASE 113, JUDGMENT REVERSED AS TO THE FIRST COUNT AND THE SENTENCE ON THAT COUNT IS VACATED.

The officer retrieved the handgun and found suspected cocaine beneath the gun. The gun proved to be operable. It was stipulated that, previously, Teel had been convicted of an offense that prohibited him from possessing a handgun in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>State. He was charged, tried, convicted and sentenced to consecutive sentences, i.e., five years imprisonment without parole for possession of a firearm by a convicted person and three years for wearing, cariying, or transporting a handgun. Teel was acquitted of the drug charge. He appealed his convictions to the Court of Special Appeals on the remaining charges. In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals rejected Teel\u2019s argument that the trial judge erred by failing to merge the convictions.
