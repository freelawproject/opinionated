Because we hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>it is not, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In 1978 and 1979, the Petitioner, Gerald Davis Fuller, was indicted for first-degree murder, first-degree rape, and robbery with a deadly weapon charges. On July 12, 1979, a jury found Fuller guilty of first-degree murder, and he was sentenced to imprisonment for the balance of his natural life, with credit for time served. Later that year, Fuller pled guilty to first-degree rape and robbery with a deadly weapon, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>sentenced to imprisonment for the balance of his natural life, concurrent with the sentence he was then serving. Fuller remains incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Two years ago, Fuller, acting pro se, pursuant to Section 8-507 of the Health-General Article, filed a Petition for Commitment to the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Administration with the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, in which he alleged that he had an untreated 38-year history of alcohol and drug abuse, and that he was both an alcoholic and a heroin user \u201cin a system which is infested with alcohol and drugs.\u201d Fuller contended that throughout his 27-year incarceration, he had demonstrated a need for, and requested but received, only limited and inadequate care, supervision, and treatment for his substance abuse addictions and that this failure had impeded his complete rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">On March 15, 2005, Judge Clifton J. Gordy of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City denied the petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fuller noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, presenting three questions for review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Fuller contended, in addition to arguing that the judge abused his discretion by denying Fuller\u2019s petition and erred by not articulating his reasoning, that the Court of Special Appeals had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal under either the final judgment rule or the collateral order doctrine. In a reported opinion, Chief Judge Joseph F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Murphy, writing for the court, held that the denial of Fuller\u2019s petition was not appealable and dismissed his appeal. <em>Fuller v. State, </em>169 Md.App. 303, 900 A.2d 311 (2006). In reaching its conclusion, the court determined that nothing in Section 8-507, or its legislative history, reflected that a direct appeal would lie from the denial of a petition for commitment under Section 8-507. <em>Id. </em>at 308-09, 900 A.2d at 314. Further, the court remarked that the denial of Section 8-507 petitions are similar to the denial of Rule 4-345<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> motions for modification of a sentence, and cited <em>Costello v. State, </em>237 Md. 464, 206 A.2d 812 (1965), for the proposition that no direct appeal lies from the denial of a motion for modification of a sentence. The court also explicitly addressed the collateral order doctrine, deeming it \u201cinapplicable to the case at bar because this Court no longer has jurisdiction to review the final judgments of conviction to which the order at issue is allegedly \u2018collateral\u2019.\u201d <em>Fuller, </em>169 Md.App. at 310-11, 900 A.2d at 315-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">We granted Fuller\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, which presented the following question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Is a denial of a petition for commitment for substance abuse treatment pursuant to Section 8-507 of the Health-General Article an appealable order?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-5\"><em>Fuller v. </em>State, 394 Md. 478, 906 A.2d 942 (2006). We shall hold that the denial of a petition for commitment for substance abuse treatment pursuant to Section 8-507 of the Health-General Article is not an appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Fuller contends that the Circuit Court\u2019s Order denying his petition for commitment under Section 8-507 is appealable as a final judgment under Section 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because the denial resolved the issue contained in the petition and left no further action for the circuit court to take. Alternatively, Fuller argues that the order was appealable under the collateral order doctrine because it conclusively determined an important issue, otherwise unreviewable, which is completely separate from the merits of the underlying action. Fuller also analogizes the denial of his petition to the denial of a motion for modification of a sentence under Rule 4-345(e),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> contending that our decisions in <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number><em>Kanaras, </em>357 Md. 170, 742 A.2d 508 (1999), and <em>Herrera v. State, </em>357 Md. 186, 742 A.2d 517 (1999), lead to the conclusion that an appeal of the denial of a motion to modify a sentence is appealable. Further, Fuller suggests that the rationale for refusing to allow appellate review of the denial of a motion for modification\u2014because the decision is discretionary\u2014was obviated by this Court in <em>Merritt v. State, </em>367 Md. 17, 785 A.2d 756 (2001). He also contends that the appeal of the denial of his petition is not barred by the Post Conviction Procedure Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The State, conversely, argues that the Circuit Court\u2019s Order denying Fuller\u2019s petition for commitment under Section 8-507 is not appealable. The State contends that the denial of Fuller\u2019s petition did not constitute a final judgment because it did not determine and conclude Fuller\u2019s rights or deny him the means of further prosecuting or defending his rights. The State also argues that the collateral order doctrine is inapplicable because the denial of Fuller\u2019s petition did not resolve an important issue and that the issue was not completely separate from the merits of the underlying action. Additionally, the State maintains that the denial of Fuller\u2019s Section 8-507 petition is akin to the denial of a motion for modification, but that our decisions in <em>Kanaras </em>and <em>Herrera </em>did not alter the general rule that a sentence not alleged to be illegal is generally not appealable, citing <em>Costello v. State, </em>237 Md. at 464, 206 A.2d at 812, and <em>Wilson v. State, </em>227 Md. 99, 175 A.2d 775 (1961), as viable. The State also argues that the Post Conviction Procedure Act precludes Fuller\u2019s appeal of the denial of his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In Maryland, the right to seek appellate review is statutory; the Legislature can provide for, or preclude, the right of appeal. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1974, 2002 Repl. Vol.), Section 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cThe right of appeal exists from a final judgment entered by a court ... unless ... the right of appeal is expressly denied by law.\u201d); <em>State v. Manck, </em>385 Md. 581, 596, 870 A.2d 196, 205 (2005), quoting <em>State v. Green, </em>367 Md. 61, 77, 785 A.2d 1275, 1284 (2001) (\u201c[Questions of appealability have today become entirely governed by statutes.\u201d); <em>State v. Bailey, </em>289 Md. 143, 147, 422 A.2d 1021, 1024 (1980) (\u201cWe begin our consideration by recognizing that any right of appeal, in either a civil or criminal case, must find its source in an act of the legislature.\u201d). The statutory provision at issue, Section 8-507 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Health-General Article, does not include any provision regarding appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">An appeal, ordinarily, must await the entry of a final judgment. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1974, 2002 Repl. Vol), Section 12-302 of the Court and Judicial Proceedings Article. To be a final judgment, the decision \u201cmust be so final as to determine and conclude rights involved, or deny the appellant means of further prosecuting or defending his rights and interests in the subject matter of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Sigma Reproductive Health Center v. State, </em>297 Md. 660, 665, 467 A.2d 483, 485 (1983); <em>Gittings v. State, </em>33 Md. 458 (1871). One exception to the final judgment rule is the collateral order doctrine, that \u201capplies to a \u2018narrow class of orders, referred to as collateral orders, which are offshoots of the principal litigation in which they are issued and which are immediately appealable as \u201cfinal judgments\u201d without regard to the posture of the case\u2019.\u201d <em>Jackson v. State, </em>358 Md. 259, 266-67, 747 A.2d 1199, 1203 (2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The case <em>sub judice </em>raises the issue of whether the denial of a petition under Section 8-507 of the Health-General Article is appealable. Fuller and the State both assert that the denial of his Section 8-507 petition for commitment to a drug treatment program is analogous to the denial of a motion for modification under Rule 4-345(e). While Fuller contends that the denial of a motion for modification is appealable, the State argues that the denial of a motion to modify is not directly appealable when the motion does not challenge the legality of the sentence. Both Fuller and the State cite to our opinions in <em>State v. Kanaras, </em>357 Md. at 170, 742 A.2d at 508, and <em>Herrera v. State, </em>357 Md. at 186, 742 A.2d at 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In <em>Kanaras, </em>we had the occasion to explore the interaction between the Post Conviction Procedure Act and the appealability of the denial of a motion to correct an allegedly illegal sentence under Rule 4-345(a). Judge John C. Eldridge, writing for this Court, elucidated that the appeal from a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to correct an illegal sentence was not precluded by the Post Conviction Procedure Act, explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>overruling <em>Wilson, </em>227 Md. at 99, 175 A.2d at 776, which had held that a motion to correct an illegal sentence under former Maryland Rule 744(a),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the precursor to Rule 4-345(a), is a statutory remedy within the meaning of the Act, and thus the denial of such motion is not appealable,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and reconciling <em>Costello, </em>237 Md. at 469-70, 206 A.2d at 815, which cited <em>Wilson </em>for the proposition that \u201cthe Post Conviction Procedure Act provides that no direct appeal lies from the denial of a motion by the trial court for modification or reduction of the sentence\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\">The Court in <em>Costello, </em>however, did more than \u201cindicate\u201d its views on the merits. It discussed in detail the merits, held that the trial judge had not erred in imposing sentence, and concluded: \u201cWe have considered all of the appellant\u2019s contentions, and find no violation of any of his constitutional or legal rights.\u201d More significantly, instead of dismissing the appeal as was done in <em>Brady </em>and <em>Wilson, </em>the Court in <em>Costello </em>\u201caffirmed\u201d the trial court\u2019s judgment. Interestingly, the judge who had authored the <em>Brady </em>opinion for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Court dissented in <em>Costello, </em>not on the ground that the appeal should have been dismissed, but on the ground that the appellant had been illegally sentenced and that, therefore, the judgment below should be reversed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\"><em>Kanaras, </em>357 Md. at 177, 742 A.2d at 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In our determination that an appeal from the denial of a Rule 4-345(a) motion to correct an illegal sentence was not precluded by the Post Conviction Procedure Act, we stated that our rule-making authority did not render the Maryland Rules equivalent to a statute enacted by the General Assembly, that a Rule 4-345(a) motion was not an independent separate cause of action, and that a motion to correct an illegal sentence does not necessarily challenge the validity of incarceration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">The reason for the non-appealability holdings ... was the view that a motion to correct an illegal sentence, authorized by Rule 4-345(a), is a \u201cstatutory remed[y] ... for challenging the validity of incarceration under sentence of ... imprisonment\u201d within the meaning of subsection (e) of the Post Conviction Procedure Act, Art. 27, \u00a7 645A(e). As pointed out in the dissenting opinion in <em>Valentine [v. State], </em>305 Md. [108] at 123, 501 A.2d [847] at 854, however,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azq\">\u201ca motion to correct an illegal sentence is not a \u2018statutory\u2019 remedy. Statutes are enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland. The Maryland Rules are adopted by the Court of Appeals. As the Wilson court noted, the Maryland Constitution does provide that rules adopted by the Court \u2018shall have the force of law until rescinded, changed or modified by the Court of Appeals or otherwise by law.\u2019 Maryland Constitution, Art. IV, \u00a7 18(a). Nonetheless, the fact that the Maryland Rules have the force of law does not mean that a rule is a statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">Furthermore, the language of the Post Conviction Procedure Act obviously refers to separate common law or statutory causes of action, such as habeas corpus or coram nobis actions which are separate civil actions. It is doubtful that this Court\u2019s rule-making authority would extend to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>creation o f a separate cause of action. In any event, there is no indication in the language or history of Rule 4-345 that the court intended to create a separate cause of action. While a motion under Rule 4-345 may be made at any time, it is part of the same criminal proceeding and not a wholly independent action. The Rule simply grants the trial court limited continuing authority in the criminal case to revise the sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">In addition, subsection (e) of the Post Conviction Procedure Act refers to habeas corpus, coram nobis, or statutory actions \u201cfor challenging the validity of incarceration----\u201d A motion under Rule 4-345(a), however, is not specifically or exclusively designed to challenge the \u201cvalidity\u201d of incarceration. There may be illegalities in a sentence which have nothing to do with the validity of the incarceration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av3\">Consequently, we hold that the language of the Post Conviction Procedure Act does not preclude an appeal from a circuit court\u2019s ruling under Rule 4-345.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-8\"><em>Kanaras, </em>357 Md. at 182-84, 742 A.2d at 515-16 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Section 7-107 of the Post Conviction Procedure Act precludes appeals in cases \u201cin which a person challenges the validity of confinement under a sentence of death or imprisonment by seeking the writ of habeas corpus or the writ of coram nobis or by invoking a common law or statutory remedy other than this title.\u201d Maryland Code (2001), Section 7-107 of the Criminal Procedure Article. Although the State asserts that Fuller is challenging the validity of his incarceration, we agree with Fuller that he is not challenging the validity of his incarceration but rather asking to serve part of his sentence in a Department of Health and Mental Hygiene facility where he would receive better drug treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">In <em>Herrera, </em>decided the same day as <em>Kanaras, </em>we exercised appellate jurisdiction over the denial of a motion for modification of a sentence, under former Rule 4-345(b). Herrera\u2019s motion for modification, however, had challenged the <em>legality </em>of his sentence, and upon this premise we applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number><em>Kanaras </em>to permit an appeal, stating that \u201c[u]nder our holding[ ] in ... <em>State v. Kanaras, supra, </em>there was <em>no illegality or infirmity </em>in Herrera\u2019s sentence which required the Circuit Court to grant relief under Rule 4-345.\u201d <em>Herrera, </em>357 Md. at 189, 742 A.2d at 519 (emphasis added). Therefore, under our jurisprudence the denial of a motion to correct an illegal sentence, in the form of a motion for modification, is appeal-able.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Fuller equates the denial of a petition for commitment under Section 8-507 to the denial of a motion to correct an allegedly illegal sentence, and argues that we should <em>sua sponte </em>exercise appellate jurisdiction, relying upon <em>Kanaras, </em>357 Md. at 170, 742 A.2d at 508. Here, however, there is no appellate jurisdiction. Fuller\u2019s Section 8-507 petition is not akin to a motion to correct an illegal sentence, because it constitutes a statutory cause of action that is separate from his conviction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Scott v. State, </em>379 Md. 170, 182 n. 6, 840 A.2d 715, 722 n. 6 (2004) (\u201cWe observe that ... motions to correct an illegal sentence occur as \u2018part of the same criminal proceeding and not a wholly independent action\u2019 .... \u201d), citing <em>Kanaras, </em>357 Md. at 183, 742 A.2d at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Fuller, nonetheless, asserts that the denial of his Section 8-507 petition could be analogized to the denial of a motion for modification under Rule 4-345(e), and contends that such orders are appealable under our opinions in <em>Kanaras, Herrera, </em>and <em>Greco v. State, </em>347 Md. 423, 701 A.2d 419 (1997). Conversely, the State argues that because our holdings in <em>Kanaras </em>and <em>Herrera </em>did not overrule <em>Costello, </em>the principal we iterated therein\u2014\u201cno direct appeal lies from the denial of a motion by the trial court for modification or reduction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>sentence\u201d\u2014remains authoritative. <em>Costello, </em>237 Md. at 469-70, 206 A.2d at 815, citing <em>Gleaton v. State, </em>235 Md. 271, 277, 201 A.2d 353, 356 (1964). We disagree with both Fuller and the State. We disagree with the State\u2019s rationale relying upon <em>Costello </em>and <em>Gleaton, </em>that a decision left to the discretion of the trial court judge is not reviewable on appeal, because that justification was obviated in <em>Merritt, </em>367 Md. at 17, 785 A.2d at 756, in which we examined the appealability of the denial of a motion for a new trial. Judge Eldridge, again writing for this Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">Initially, we flatly reject the State\u2019s argument ... that the denial of a motion for new trial is absolutely unreviewable on appeal except for the situation where the trial judge has failed to exercise any discretion.... [T]he Maryland case law governing appellate review of rulings on motions for new trials has changed and evolved over the years. Moreover, language from older cases has sometimes been carelessly repeated in more recent cases without taking into consideration the changes in the law. The State\u2019s argument in the case at bar, however, represents an effort to change the present law, to adopt a rule from the past, and to require that our most recent eases on the subject be overruled. This we decline to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">The early opinions of this Court clearly took the position that a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a new trial was not subject to appellate review under any circumstances....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">\n<em>[T]he principle that rulings on motions for new trial were unreviewable on appeal appears to have been simply an application of the more general rule, adhered to by appellate courts at an earlier time, that any trial court ruling on a discretionary matter was insulated from appellate review.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArS\"><em>Id. </em>at 24-25, 785 A.2d at 760-61 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Nevertheless, we have alluded to the possibility that the denial of a motion for modification may be appealable under the final judgment rule in dicta in <em>Greco, </em>347 Md. at 423, 701 A.2d at 419. The issue presented in <em>Greco </em>was whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>trial court had jurisdiction to consider a motion for modification more than ninety days after conviction, but within ninety days of the granting of a previous motion for modification. We answered the question affirmatively, rejecting the rationale that trial judges need to be \u201cprotected] ... from continual and repeated requests to modify sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436, 701 A.2d at 425. We further remarked, though, \u201c[i]f the motion is denied, the defendant is finished\u2014he or she may not file another motion for reconsideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The denial of a Section 8-507 petition for commitment, however, is not analogous to the denial of a motion for modification. Unlike a motion for modification, a petition for commitment does not affect the length of a sentence, only where a portion of it is to be served. It also initiates a statutory cause of action separate from the conviction, and may be filed repeatedly \u201cat any other time the defendant voluntarily agrees to participate in treatment.\u201d These two characteristics render the Section 8-507 petition more akin to habeas corpus actions, which came into being statutorily in Maryland in 1809.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The original habeas corpus statute,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> derived from the English common law, <em>In re Glenn, </em>54 Md. 572, 607, (1880), was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>similarly silent as to the appealability of denials of petitions for relief, as is Section 8-507 of the Health-General Article. In addressing the appealability of the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under the statute, this Court had held that there was no right to appeal its denial. <em>Coston v. Coston, 25 </em>Md. 500 (1866); <em>In re Coston, </em>23 Md. 271 (1865); <em>Bell v. State, 4 </em>Md. (Gill) 301 (1846). In <em>Coston, In re Coston, </em>and <em>Bell, </em>we opined that the denial of a habeas corpus petition was not appealable because the decision was left to the discretion of the trial judge\u2014a rationale we later rejected in Merritt\u2014 and because a denial was not a final judgment in as much as the petitioner had the ability to repeatedly apply for a writ of habeas corpus. In <em>In re Coston, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">Among the reasons assigned for this conclusion are, that the writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>is a proceeding summary in its character, addressed to the discretion of the Judge or tribunal, to whom the application is made, so far as the discharge of the party is concerned; <em>a proceeding where, in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number><em>many cases, the evidence upon which the judgment is founded cannot be presented to the appellate court, and is not final and conclusive upon the party applying for the writ, as he may prefer a similar application to any other Judge or court of the State.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">23 Md. at 272 (emphasis added). <em>See also Bell, </em>4 Md. (Gill) at 304 (remarking that the dismissal of a habeas corpus petition did not have any of the characteristics of an appealable final judgment because it \u201cis not final and conclusive upon the party applying for the writ; as he may prefer a similar application, to any other Judge or Court of the State\u201d). Later, in <em>Coston, </em>25 Md. at 500, we commented that the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus was not a final judgment because it does not \u201cdeprive the petitioner of the right of petitioning again\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8a\">Although the petition should be released by the order of the Judge or court to whom he made application, if that order is subject to revision and reversal by an appellate court, <em>the final judgment, to be of any avail, must deprive the petitioner of the right of petitioning again; </em>whereas, the right of petitioning for a habeas corpus, is unlimited in its nature, and the application may be renewed <em>toties quoties,[</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>as long as the petitioner is confined, and a Judge or court can be found to whom he may address his prayer for relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 506 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In 1945, however, the General Assembly provided an aggrieved party with the statutory right to appeal the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus or from a \u201cfinal order of the Court\u201d in habeas corpus proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">The aggrieved applicant may appeal to the Court of Appeals from the refusal to issue a writ or from a final order remanding him or dismissing the proceedings; and the Attorney General or the State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City or the County in which such application was presented may appeal on behalf of the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>1945 Maryland Laws, Chapter 702; Maryland Code (1945), Article 42, Section 3C.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This statutory enactment, providing a petitioner the ability to seek appellate review of a denial of a petition for habeas corpus, was analyzed by then-retired former Chief Judge Charles Marke 11 in <em>Review of Criminal Cases in Maryland by Habeas Corpus and by Appeal, </em>in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, when he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asp\">The Act of 1945 provided that the \u201caggrieved\u201d applicant might appeal to the Court of Appeals from refusal to issue the writ or from a final order remanding him or dismissing the proceedings and that the Attorney General or the State\u2019s Attorney might appeal on behalf of the state. The general right of appeal under the Act of 1945 was equally applicable to the petitioner and the state. However, the nature of habeas corpus procedure makes it, in operation, one-sided against the prosecutors. Before 1945, the petitioner <em>in effect </em>had the right of 36 appeals by applications to every other judge in the state. One judge might set at naught the judgment of 36 other judges by releasing on habeas corpus a prisoner whom the other judges would not release. The petitioner still has 36 such appeals besides an appeal to the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\"><em>The result[] and the evident purpose[] of the Act[] of </em>... <em>1945 [has] been to put an end to long-standing abuse of the writ and to preserve the writ for its historical objects as a bulwark of liberty. This has been done by ... giving a general right of appeal, thus substituting authoritative statements of law for the action of 37 judges, of equal authority, not subject to review by any higher court. </em>The right of appeal, given without prepayment of costs, is as freely available to either party as the writ itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Judge Charles Markell, <em>Review of Criminal Cases in Maryland by Habeas Corpus and by Appeal, </em>101 U. Pa. L.Rev. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>1154, 1157, 1162-63 (1953) (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The General Assembly, then, in the history of habeas corpus petitions, proactively and clearly conferred the right of appeal to petitioners denied relief, whereas this Court had refused appellate review because the petition in issue could have been filed repeatedly. This was not done in Section 8-507 when petitioners were given the opportunity to repeatedly file their suit. We generally presume that the Legislature acts with full knowledge of prior and existing law, legislation, and policy, <em>Collins v. State, </em>383 Md. 684, 692-93, 861 A.2d 727, 732 (2004); <em>Bingman v. State, </em>285 Md. 59, 65, 400 A.2d 765, 768 (1979); <em>Bowers v. State, </em>283 Md. 115, 127, 389 A.2d 341, 348 (1978), and obviously could have provided an appellate remedy for the denial when a petition could be repeatedly filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Fuller also asserts that he has the right to appeal the denial of his Section 8-507 petition because it is a final judgment, citing to <em>In re Special Investigation No. 236, </em>295 Md. 573, 458 A.2d 75 (1983), and <em>In re Special Investigation No. 231, </em>295 Md. 366, 455 A.2d 442 (1983), for the proposition that if a motion is the only matter pending before a court, that court\u2019s ruling thereupon is a final judgment and therefore is immediately appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">In <em>In re Special Investigation No. 231, </em>as part of an investigation pertaining to certain health care providers, the Attorney General had issued several subpoenas; four of the individuals issued subpoenas sought to be represented by the same attorney. The State attempted to use the Code of Professional Responsibility to prevent their joint representation. 295 Md. at 367, 368, 455 A.2d at 442, 443. After the motion to disqualify the attorney was denied, we stated that the denial was a final judgment, and heard the merits of the appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">We have consistently held that a final judgment from which an appeal will lie is one which settles the rights of the parties or concludes the cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>In this case the proceeding consisted only of a motion to disqualify the attorney in question. Once the motion was denied there was nothing more to be done in this particular case. There was nothing else before the court. There was nothing pending. Hence, we conclude that the order of the trial judge here settled the rights of the parties and terminated the cause. Thus, it was a final judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 370, 455 A.2d at 444 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, the denial of Fuller\u2019s petition did not settle Fuller\u2019s ability to seek commitment pursuant to Section 8-507 for substance abuse treatment. Under Section 8-507, a petition may be filed at any \u201ctime the defendant voluntarily agrees to participate in treatment.\u201d Thus, petitions may be filed repeatedly and the denial of a single petition does not preclude Fuller from filing another.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In <em>In re Special Investigation No. 236, </em>295 Md. at 573, 458 A.2d at 75, the issue was whether the grant of a motion to obtain the return of financial records from a grand jury constituted a final judgment. Relying on our decision in <em>In re Special Investigation No. 231, </em>we noted that \u201c[o]nce that motion was <em>granted </em>there was nothing more to be done in this particular case\u201d because the documents would have been returned to the petitioner, and out of the grand jury\u2019s control. <em>In re Special Investigation No. 236, </em>295 Md. at 575, 458 A.2d at 76 (emphasis added). The return of the final records to the petitioner, thus, \u201csettled the rights of the parties and terminated the cause\u201d for good. <em>Id. </em>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>again, the denial of Fuller\u2019s petition did not settle his rights under Section 8-507 for good because his ability to seek commitment under the statute was not terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Fuller also argues that the denial of his Section 8-507 petition is appealable under the collateral order doctrine exception to the final judgment rule. The collateral order doctrine \u201ctreats as final and appealable a limited class of orders which do not terminate the litigation in the trial court.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>358 Md. at 266, 747 A.2d at 1202. To fall within the exception, the decision must <em>\u201cconclusively determine the dis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>puted question; </em>resolve an important issue; be completely separate from the merits of the action; and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266-67, 747 A.2d at 1203 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The Court of Special Appeals determined that the collateral order doctrine was inapplicable in the present case, asserting: \u201cThe \u2018collateral order doctrine\u2019 is inapplicable to the case at bar because this Court no longer has jurisdiction to review the final judgments of conviction to which the order at issue is allegedly \u2018collateral\u2019.\u201d <em>Fuller, </em>169 Md.App. at 310, 900 A.2d at 315. Moreover, after iterating the requirements of the collateral order doctrine, the court remarked: \u201cThe denial of a post-sentence petition for commitment to ADAA is simply not \u2018an issue that is completely separate from the merits of the action\u2019.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311, 900 A.2d at 316. In this we disagree; the statute creating the ability to petition for commitment for substance abuse treatment created a separate and independent cause of action from the merits of the conviction. Nevertheless, we do agree that the collateral order doctrine does not confer upon Fuller the ability to appeal because the disputed question was not conclusively determined, based upon the fact that a Section 8-507 petition can repeatedly be filed \u201cat any other time the defendant voluntarily agrees to participate in treatment.\u201d Fuller\u2019s rights under Section 8-507 were not completely settled by the denial of his petition, and the collateral order doctrine is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">For all of the aforementioned reasons, we hold that an order denying an inmate commitment to a drug treatment program pursuant to Section 8-507 of the Health-General Article is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED WITH COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\">.

State, </em>205 Md. 425, 109 A.2d 96 (1954), in which we determined that an appeal lies from an order overruling a motion to correct an illegal sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As7\">In Maryland all judgments are under the control of the court during the term in which they are entered, an during that time the court has inherent power to strike out or modify judgments in both civil and criminal cases. In this State no appeal lies from an order striking out a judgment, but an appeal lies from an order overruling a motion to strike out a judgment, as the liability of the defendant is thereby fixed and determined, and if he had no right of appeal therefrom he would be without a remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-9\"><em>Madison, </em>205 Md. at 431, 109 A.2d at 99.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b415-7\">.

Fuller would even have less of a basis to challenge the denial of his petition under the pre-2006 version of Section 8-507 based upon the analogy to a motion to correct an illegal sentence because Section 8-507 was only applicable if \"(1) No sentence of incarceration is currently in effect; and (2) No detainer is currently lodged.\u201d Md.
