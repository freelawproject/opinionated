The report involved four cases, which the respondent settled and in which funds were dispersed to clients. Additional irregularities were detected in three cases: those involving Davis Ebo, Anthony Ebo, and Yawa Doghboe. Ultimately, in a letter dated May 20, 2005, the Attorney Grievance Commission revoked the Conditional Diversion Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">\u201cIn the case of Davis Ebo, Respondent settled the case for $5,500. Mr Ebo received $2,616.00, a medical provider received $1,000.00, and the respondent\u2019s fee was $1,933.33. The disbursement left a shortfall of $49.33. In the case of Anthony Ebo, the matter was settled for $5,500.00. At the conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>sion of the disbursement, $50.00 was left from the settlement that was not disbursed. Neither figure matches the settlement, sheets or the monitor\u2019s report. Yawa Doghboe[ ] received a $7,000.00 settlement and $2,125.00 is unaccounted. There is no record that it was ever deposited in the escrow account.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">\u201cAfter reviewing the four cases included in the monitor\u2019s report, the investigator obtained the bank records of the respondent\u2019s escrow account and further irregularities were found. On three occasions, from June of 2003 until June of 2004, the account was overdrawn. First, on June 9, 2003, a deposit of a $2,286.00 check from State Farm was made. The payee was State Farm and under the column labeled \u2018description\u2019 was the name Felisha Ikpeama. A $100.00 deposit occurred on that day. On June 13, 2003, a check payable to Hillary Ikpeama as settlement of an accident in the amount of $4,490.00 was deducted from the account. This caused the account to have a negative balance of $431.26. A cash deposit of $300.00 was made: the account was still negative in the amount of $131.26. Two overdraft fees in the amount of $30.00 took the account to a negative balance of $191.26 on June 16, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">\u201cOn June 23, 2003, a deposit from M[AIF] Insurance [on] behalf of another client, Monico Navaro, was made in the amount of $1,000.00. The account balance was then $808.78. Obviously, the settlement meant only for Monico Navaro was used for other purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">\u201cSecondly, on August 21, 2003, another client, Chile Mwaiwu, received a check from the respondent for $2,466.80 as settlement of his claim. The check was post dated for August 26, 2003; however, the client presented it for payment immediately. This created a negative balance of $2,308.61.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">\u201cFinally, on June 29, 2004, the respondent wrote a check for Metro Med &amp; Rehab for $2,000.00 on behalf of client Gerri Belt and dated it the 30th. The check was presented for payment on the 29th and honored at that time. The account was again in the negative in the amount of $1,234.90. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>$2,500.00 deposit of insurance proceeds brought the account to $1, 265.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">\u201cAdditionally, the respondent also represented Yawa Doghboe in early 2004 and settled his case. The settlement money was not deposited into his escrow account; however, the respondent\u2019s account reflects $4,875.00 in disbursements. His disbursement sheet reflects $6,595.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">\u201cThe respondent testified to the careless nature of the management of his escrow account: he did not reconcile the account monthly, he left TIP\u2019 money in the account to cover fees and he left fees in his escrow account.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">\u201cAdditionally, he maintained inaccurate settlement sheets and kept very few records. When requested, he had to get copies of his escrow account records from the bank to provide to the Commission; he did not keep a ledger and post dated cheek[s] to accommodate clients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">From the foregoing findings of fact, the hearing court concluded that the respondent committed most, but not all, of the charged violations. Reiterating that the respondents\u2019 records \u201cdo not reflect the disbursement of his fee,\u201d that some of the funds associated with the Ebos, Doghboe, Mwaiwu and Belt representations \u201cwere not used for the persons intended\u201d and that the respondent did not keep, or preserve complete records of his representations, it concluded that Rule 1.15 of the Rules of Professional Conduct and Rules 16-604 and 16-607 were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The hearing court also found that the respondent violated Rule 8.4(a). It did not find any other Rule 8.4 violation, however. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-9\">\u201c... [T]he respondent did not have the intent to deceive. The offenses occurred due to sloppiness, not dishonesty. There was no forgery, fraud, lack of candor or attempts to conceal his records or his acts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-13\">Nor did the hearing court conclude that there was a violation of Rule 8.1. While it acknowledged that \u201cthe respondent did not respond as promptly as would have been ideal, he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>respond.\u201d Indeed, the hearing court \u201cfound the respondent to be quite candid and forthcoming.\u201d Accordingly, it concluded that he \u201cdid not knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">No mention was made by the hearing court of Rule 16-609 or any of the charged statutory violations. It made mitigation findings, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">\u201cFirst, while the respondent\u2019s maintenance of his account was in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct and clearly he did not maintain it as required, this fact does not reflect an ulterior motive. Clearly, he had no intent to defraud or steal from his clients. In fact, many of his problems resulted from his desire to accommodate his clients and to keep them satisfied with his representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">\u201cIn the cases of Davis Ebo and Anthony Ebo, he gave them more in settlement tha[n] previously agreed. This created inaccurate settlement sheets that resulted in the filing of the complaint by the bar counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">\u201cHe gave Chile Mwaiwu and Hassan Samuser post dated checks to spare them a trip back to his office, the latter resulting in the negative balance of August 21, 2003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD_\">\u201cSecondly, during this period of time, the respondent was dealing with extremely distracting family problems. His mother was suffering from a life threatening illness, which eventually took her life. His brother-in-law, who was without insurance, required dialysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\">\u201cWhile his wife was available to help, she and the respondent are the parents of six (6) children and his wife maintained employment as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-9\">\u201cAs a result, the respondent was forced to cut back on his practice. He was coping with stress at work and at home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG2\">\u201cLastly and most importantly, the respondent testified without contradiction that he has taken the appropriate remedial actions to maintain his escrow account in accordance with the Rules of Professional Conduct, and that his account is now in order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Only the petitioner has filed exceptions. It does not challenge or take exception to the hearing court\u2019s findings of fact, only its conclusions of law. Thus, the findings of fact made by the hearing court are established. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Logan, </em>390 Md. 313, 319, 888 A.2d 359, 363 (2005); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hodgson, </em>396 Md. 1, 6-8, 912 A.2d 640, 644 (2006). Specifically, the petitioner submits that the hearing court erred in failing to find that the respondent violated Rule 16-609 and \u00a7 10-306, both relating to the misuse of the respondent\u2019s trust account. It argues that the propriety of such findings is patent when \u201c[t]he fact that the Respondent did not keep Monico Navaro\u2019s funds intact, used other client funds to cover post dated checks and the Yawa Dogboe[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] disbursements, as well as never accounting for $2,125.00 of the Dogboe settlement\u201d is considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">It also disagrees with the conclusion that a Rule 8.1 violation had not been established. In support of this exception, the petitioner relies on the testimony of its investigator, and the inferences it draws from that testimony, with regard to the respondent\u2019s failure to produce, at the investigator\u2019s request, records additional to the settlement sheets, banks statements and cancelled checks the respondent did produce. Maintaining that the investigator\u2019s testimony in this regard is uncontradicted, it asks this Court to sustain the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The petitioner\u2019s final exception relates to the hearing court\u2019s failure to find a violation of Rule 8.4(d). Satisfied, apparently, that the hearing court adequately explained why it did not find a Rule 8.4(c) violation, in addition to the Rule 8.4(a) violation, it asserts that the explanation does not suffice insofar as Rule 8.4(d) is concerned. On the contrary, the petitioner argues, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>the causes of the misconduct found by the hearing court tend to affect, if not implicate, the integrity of the process of administering justice. Thus, it asserts, \u201c[biased on Judge Lamasney\u2019s findings, the Respondent should be found to have violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the hearing court\u2019s conclusions of law, Rule 16-759(b)(l);<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Hodgson, </em>396 Md. at 6-8, 912 A.2d at 644; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McLaughlin, </em>372 Md. 467, 493, 813 A.2d 1145, 1160 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Joehl, </em>335 Md. 83, 88, 642 A.2d 194, 196 (1994) (noting that the ultimate decision as to whether an attorney has engaged in professional misconduct rests with this Court). Exceptions to conclusions of law will be overruled when, the fact findings not being clearly erroneous, the conclusions are supported by the facts found. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Manger, </em>396 Md. 134, 146-147, 913 A.2d 1, 8 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">As we have seen, the hearing court relied on its findings in the two Ebo matters and the settlements involving Doghboe, Mwaiwu and Belt to conclude that funds intended for their use or benefit \u201cwere not used for the persons intended\u201d and, thus, to conclude that the respondent violated Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15 and Rules 16-604 and 16-607. Rule 16-609 prohibits the use of funds deposited in an attorney\u2019s trust account \u201cfor any unauthorized purpose.\u201d Similarly, \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Professions and Occupations Article proscribes the use of trust money \u201cfor any purpose other than the purpose for which the trust money is entrusted to the lawyer.\u201d The misconduct found by the hearing court, the failure to use funds for the benefit of the person intended, is as supportive of a violation of Rule 16-609 and \u00a7 10-306 as it is of a violation of the Rules as to which there has been no challenge, if not more so. We sustain the petitioner\u2019s exception to this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>With respect to the petitioner\u2019s exception to the failure to find a violation of Rule 8.4(d), that the respondent engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, we note that the hearing court was unequivocal that, in addition to certain discrete violations related to his escrow account, including overdrawing his trust account on several occasions, the respondent managed his escrow account \u201ccarelessly],\u201d failing to reconcile it monthly, \u201cmaintained inaccurate settlement sheets and kept very few records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">In <em>Rheb v. Bar Ass\u2019n of Baltimore City, </em>186 Md. 200, 46 A.2d 289, 291 (1946), this Court considered the interpretation of the phrase, \u201cconduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d We made clear in that case that \u201c \u2018conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice,\u2019 delegates or confirms to the courts the power and duty to consider particular conduct of one who is an officer of the court, in relation to the privileges and duties of a public calling that specially invites complete trust and confidence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 205, 46 A.2d at 291; see <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Post, </em>350 Md. 85, 100, 710 A.2d 935, 942 (1998), and that it should not be given \u201crestricted meaning.\u201d <em>Rheb, </em>186 Md. at 205, 46 A.2d at 291. Thus, \u201cIn the last analysis the duty rests upon the courts, and the profession as a whole, to uphold the highest standards of professional conduct and to protect the public from imposition by the unfit or unscrupulous practitioner.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The manner in which an attorney has handled his or her escrow account has been held to be conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. Post, 350 Md. at 99, 710 A.2d at 942. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Powell, </em>369 Md. 462, 469, 800 A.2d 782, 786-87 (2002) (concluding that conduct constituting violations of MRPC 1.15(a) and Maryland Rule 16-607 also violated Rule 8.4(d) of the Rules of Professional Conduct). Accordingly, we sustain the petitioner\u2019s exception as to Rule 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">We overrule the petitioner\u2019s other exception. That there is testimony contradicting the respondent and on the basis of which the hearing court could have found a rule violation, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>did not, is not a basis for sustaining an exception to a conclusion of law. That is the substance and the essence of the petitioner\u2019s argument for our concluding that the respondent violated Rule 8.1. We decline the invitation to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The petitioner recommends as sanction an indefinite suspension. Reiterating the violations the hearing court found that the respondent committed, it distinguishes this case from those in which a more lenient sanction was imposed, <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Obi, </em>393 Md. 643, 904 A.2d 422 (2006) (30 day suspension); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Rose, </em>383 Md. 385, 859 A.2d 659 (2004) (indefinite suspension with the right to reapply in 6 months); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McClain, </em>373 Md. 196, 817 A.2d 218 (2003) (30 day suspension); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Dicicco, </em>369 Md. 662, 802 A.2d 1014 (2002) (indefinite suspension with the right to reapply after 90 days), on the basis that, unlike in those cases, \u201cRespondent was given an opportunity to cure his escrow account and failed to make any corrective changes to the account.\u201d The opportunity to which the petitioner refers, and mentions expressly, is the fact that \u201cthe respondent entered into a Conditional Diversion Agreement where he was to properly maintain his escrow account by keeping records and to stop commingling monies in that account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The respondent, as indicated, has taken no exceptions. He has, however, made a recommendation as to sanction: that the Court impose a reprimand. He relies on <em>Obi, </em>which he distinguishes on the basis that, there, the respondent was also convicted of a Rule 8.1(b) violation, by knowingly failing to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s lawful demand for information in a disciplinary matter. Moreover, the respondent emphasizes the hearing court\u2019s observation that many of the respondent\u2019s problems were the result of his \u201cdesire to accommodate\u201d them and \u201ckeep them satisfied with his representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The purpose and goal of attorney discipline are well settled: to protect the public and not to punish the erring attorney. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Rees, </em>396 Md. 248, 254, 913 A.2d 68, 72 (2006). <em>See Attorney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number><em>Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Parker, </em>389 Md. 142, 155, 884 A.2d 104, 112 (2005); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Culver, </em>381 Md. 241, 283-84, 849 A.2d 423, 448-49 (2004). In <em>Rees, </em>we summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-4\">\u201cThat purpose is achieved, the public is protected, when the sanctions are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Stein, </em>373 Md. 531, 533, 819 A.2d 372, 375 (2003). While the circumstances of each case-the nature and effect of the violations-are critical, and ordinarily decisive, factors in determining the severity of the sanction to be imposed, <em>Parker, </em>389 Md. at 155, 884 A.2d at 112, there are other important factors we have identified, including \u2018the lawyer\u2019s state of mind which underlies the misconduct, actual or potential injury flowing from the misconduct, the duty of this Court to preserve the integrity of the profession, the risk to the public in allowing the Respondent to continue in practice, and any mitigating or aggravating factors,\u2019 <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Monfried, </em>368 Md. 373, 396, 794 A.2d 92, 105 (2002), the attorney\u2019s remorse for the misconduct, <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Wyatt, </em>323 Md. 36, 38, 591 A.2d 467, 468 (1991), the likelihood of repetition of the misconduct, <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Freedman, </em>285 Md. 298, 300, 402 A.2d 75, 76 (1979), and the attorney\u2019s prior grievance history. <em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Phoebus, </em>276 Md. 353, 362, 347 A.2d 556, 561 (1975).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 254-55, 913 A.2d at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">This case does bear a resemblance to <em>Obi, </em>and a striking one. In addition, the respondent is correct, the respondent in <em>Obi </em>was found to have failed to cooperate with bar counsel. On the other hand, it is unlike <em>Obi </em>in that we have sustained the petitioner\u2019s exceptions with regard to charged Professional Conduct Rule 8.4(d), Rule 16-609 and \u00a7 10-306. Furthermore, the respondent, as the petitioner points out, was afforded the opportunity of a conditional diversion agreement. That agreement was terminated when the monitor charged with checking and keeping an eye on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>respondent\u2019s escrow account, signaled a problem and it was learned that the respondent had not changed his accounting practices. These differences with <em>Obi, </em>more than the one emphasized by the respondent, support a sanction different from, and greater than, what we imposed in that case. Moreover, we are satisfied that it should require the respondent to demonstrate lessons learned and, critically, that the sloppiness which has characterized his handling of his escrow account will no longer obtain. The appropriate sanction, therefore, is, we believe, an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply for readmission after 90 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST VICTOR MBA-JONAS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-6\">.
