Proc.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we conclude that the relevant statutory limit is applicable only to child defendants, child respondents,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and their parents, we hold that a restitution order entered against an adult defendant is not subject to the $10,000 statutory ceiling.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">On 27 August 2003, Wallace Jerome Robey was convicted in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County of second-degree assault and reckless endangerment. The Circuit Court sentenced Robey to three years imprisonment, all of which was suspended, and ordered restitution<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in an amount to be deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>mined in a separate hearing. Based on medical bills and correspondence with the victim, Jesse McCoy, the Maryland Division of Parole and Probation recommended the figure of $42,260.75. On 21 November 2003, during the restitution hearing, the Circuit Court imposed on Robey an obligation to pay $42,342.74<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in restitution to McCoy. Robey appealed his conviction and sentence to the Court of Special Appeals. He did not prevail. He subsequently challenged the amount of the restitution order in the Circuit Court with a Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence. The limited ground of his motion was that Crim. Proc., \u00a7 ll-604(b) prohibits a restitution order in an amount exceeding $10,000. The Circuit Court denied Robey\u2019s motion and Robey filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Before that court could hear the appeal, we issued a writ of certiorari, on our own motion, to consider Robey\u2019s contention that the $10,000 statutory limit on restitution orders applies to adult defendants as well as child defendants and respondents and their parents. We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">At the time restitution was ordered against Robey, Crim. Proc., \u00a7 ll-604(b) provided: \u201cA judgment of restitution for $10,000 issued under Part I of this subtitle is the absolute limit for all acts arising out of a single incident and is the absolute limit against one child, the child\u2019s parent, or both.\u201d Robey posits that \u00a7 11\u2014604(b) should be parsed and read so that $10,000 is the absolute limit on the amount of a restitution order: (1) for all acts arising out of a single incident, <em>and </em>(2) against one respondent child, the child\u2019s parent, or both. By this construction, Robey argues that the $10,000 limit is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>applicable to adults under parsed clause (1) of \u00a7 ll-604(b). As support for his construction, Robey points out that the subtitle dealing with restitution deals with both criminal and juvenile proceedings and that \u00a7 11-604 itself contains no language limiting its scope to matters involving only children. He further states that the use of \u201cand\u201d in \u00a7 ll-604(b) serves to divide the subsection into two distinct clauses: one addressing all matters, and the other addressing matters involving only children. The State contends, however, that the plain language of \u00a7 ll-604(b), as confirmed by the surrounding context and the statute\u2019s legislative history, makes clear that the $10,000 limit on restitution orders is applicable \u201conly to actions wherein the defendant is a child who is charged as an adult in circuit court, or a child respondent in juvenile court, and the restitution payer is the child, the child\u2019s parent, or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">A. The Plain Language of \u00a7 ll-604(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Confronting us is the familiar task of statutory interpretation, the central canons of which are well-settled. It is patent that \u201cthe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Mayor &amp; Town Council of Oakland v. Mayor &amp; Town Council of Mountain Lake Park, </em>392 Md. 301, 316, 896 A.2d 1036, 1045 (2006); <em>Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 223, 858 A.2d 484, 487 (2004); <em>Price v. State, 378 </em>Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221, 1226 (2003). This endeavor invariably commences (and frequently ends) with an evaluation of the plain language of the statute in question. <em>Twine v. State, </em>395 Md. 539, 550, 910 A.2d 1132, 1138 (2006); <em>Deville, 383 </em>Md. at 223, 858 A.2d at 487. If the plain language is unambiguous, that is, it is not susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, we typically cease the inquest into the Legislature\u2019s intent and apply the statute accordingly. <em>Twine, </em>395 Md. at 550, 910 A.2d at 1138; <em>Mayor &amp; Town Council of Oakland, </em>392 Md. at 316, 896 A.2d at 1045; <em>Stearman v.

Nations-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number><em>Bank, N.A., </em>365 Md. 166, 181, 776 A.2d 645, 654 (2001). In construing statutes, we steadfastly refuse to employ \u201c \u2018forced or subtle interpretations [of a statute] that limit or extend its application.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 563, 576-77, 870 A.2d 186, 193 (2005) (quoting <em>Price, </em>378 Md. at 387, 835 A.2d at 1226); <em>Taylor, </em>365 Md. at 181, 776 A.2d at 654; <em>Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co. of Md. v. Dir. of Fin., </em>343 Md. 567, 579, 683 A.2d 512, 517 (1996); <em>Condon v. State-Univ. of Md., </em>332 Md. 481, 491, 632 A.2d 753, 758 (1993) (quoting <em>Tucker v.

Occasionally we see fit to examine extrinsic sources of legislative intent merely as a check of our reading of a statute\u2019s plain language. <em>Stanley v. State, </em>390 Md. 175, 185, 887 A.2d 1078, 1084 (2005) (citing <em>Design Kitchen &amp; Baths v. Lagos, </em>388 Md. 718, 730, 882 A.2d 817, 824 (2005); <em>State v. Glass, </em>386 Md. 401, 411, 872 A.2d 729, 735 (2005); and <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Chase, </em>360 Md. 121, 128, 756 A.2d 987, 991 (2000)); <em>Coleman, </em>281 Md. at 546, 380 A.2d at 54; <em>Chesapeake Amusements, Inc. v. Riddle, </em>363 Md. 16, 29, 766 A.2d 1036, 1042-43 (2001); <em>Morris v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>319 Md. 597, 604, 573 A.2d 1346, 1349 (1990). In such instances, we may find useful the context of a statute, the overall statutory scheme, and archival legislative history of relevant enactments. <em>Mayor &amp; Town Council of Oakland, </em>392 Md. at 316-17, 896 A.2d at 1045; <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Mullan, </em>381 Md. 157, 168-69, 848 A.2d 642, 649 (2004); <em>Md. Green Party v. Md. Bd. of Elections, </em>377 Md. 127, 178-79, 832 A.2d 214, 244 (2003); <em>Mid-Atl. Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>361 Md. 196, 204, 760 A.2d 1087, 1091 (2000); <em>Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs v. Bell Atl.-Md., Inc., </em>346 Md. 160, 178, 695 A.2d 171, 180 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Upon a plain reading of the statute, we find the language of \u00a7 ll-604(b) unambiguous. It is evident to us that the language of subsection (b) contemplates application to a \u201cchild, the child\u2019s parent, or both\u201d and no other classes of individuals subject to restitution. Robey\u2019s attempt to parse the language of \u00a7 ll-604(b) in order to manufacture a shelter for adult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>restitution obligors is without merit. The subsection is devoid of any mention of adult defendants or, in fact, any adult not a parent of a child restitution obligor.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Further, it is not apparent at all that the use of the typically conjunctive term \u201cand\u201d in \u00a7 ll-604(b) was meant to divide the subsection into two separate classes of individuals: one relating to all acts (by adults and children alike) arising out of a single incident, and the other relating to only children and/or their parents. First, the term \u201cand\u201d ordinarily is not read in the disjunctive as Robey wishes, but rather as \u201c[a] conjunction connecting words or phrases expressing the idea that the latter is to be added to or taken along with the first,\u201d <em>Little Store, Inc. v. State, </em>295 Md. 158, 163 n. 4, 453 A.2d 1215, 1218 n. 4 (1983) (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 79 (5th ed.1979)), such that the \u201cincident\u201d language is inextricably linked to the \u201cper child and/or parent\u201d language. Second, Robey\u2019s interpretation renders impermissibly superfluous the latter half of the subsection, the \u201cper child and/or parent\u201d language. <em>Mayor &amp; Town Council of Oakland, </em>392 Md. at 316, 896 A.2d at 1045; <em>Harvey v. Marshall, </em>389 Md. 243, 292, 884 A.2d 1171, 1200 (2005); <em>Smack v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>378 Md. 298, 305, 835 A.2d 1175, 1179 (2003). As the State argues persuasively, \u201c[i]f, in fact, the $10,000 limit applies to \u2018all acts arising out of a single incident\u2019 regardless of the defendant\u2019s age, then any separate reference to a limit against \u2018a child, the child\u2019s parent, or both\u2019 is unnecessary.\u201d It is a more reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 ll-604(b) that the reference to \u201ca child, the child\u2019s parent, or both\u201d was meant to apply to the entire subsection to the exclusion of any other classes of persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">An inspection of the two surrounding subsections that complete \u00a7 11-604 confirms that the thrust of the entire statute, including the $10,000 limit on a restitution order, is directed towards child offenders. Subsection (a) sets forth, as a general proposition, that children, their parents, or both may be ordered to pay restitution. Subsection (c) addresses the need to provide parents \u201ca reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present evidence\u201d before a court may order restitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>against parents of child defendants or respondents. This context, which focuses exclusively on the operation of restitution in the realm of matters involving children, without any mention of adult defendants, confirms the propriety of our conclusion that \u00a7 ll-604(b) does not have any application to adult defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Most telling, however, is the legislative history of the version of Crim. Proc., \u00a7 11-604 in force when the restitution order against Robey was entered. During code revision,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u00a7 11\u2014604(b) was created and derived from Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 807(a)(3),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which dealt solely with restitution in cases involving child defendants and respondents.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Revisor\u2019s Note accompanying \u00a7 11-604, which we view here as a persuasive aid to statutory interpretation, <em>Comptroller v. Blanton, </em>390 Md. 528, 538, 890 A.2d 279, 285 (2006), indicates that the statute was \u201cnew language derived without substantive change from former Art. 27, \u00a7 807(a)(3).\u201d The fiscal note addressing the revision further supports the notion that the revision generally propagated no substantive departure from the statutes as they were codified in the Annotated Code. Dep\u2019t of Legislative Servs., Fiscal Note, S.B. 1, at 1 (2001) (\u201cThis bill recodifies specified existing laws without substantive change.\u201d); <em>see Moore v. State, </em>388 Md. 623, 635 n. 4, 882 A.2d 256, 263 n. 4 (2005) (stating that fiscal notes are persuasive sources of evidence in divining legislative intent). Thus, when Crim. Proc., \u00a7 11-604 was enacted as the scion of Art. 27, \u00a7 807(a)(3), the new statute inherited its progenitor\u2019s focus on child restitution. Furthermore, at no point were adult defendants implicated by the 2001 revision creating Crim. Proc., \u00a7 11-604.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">We glean further substantiation for our reading of \u00a7 11-604(b) from a revision of \u00a7 ll-604(b) that occurred subsequent to the imposition of Robey\u2019s restitution order. <em>Nesbit v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>382 Md. 65, 78, 854 A.2d 879, 886-87 (2004) (indicating that subsequent enactments may provide persuasive information for the construction of an earlier version of the same statute) (citing <em>Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 385-87, 614 A.2d 590, 593-94 (1992)). In 2005, the General Assembly eliminated the overall ceiling of restitution for a single incident and focused on imposing a limit on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>liability of individual children when there are multiple actors in a single incident. Chapter 512, \u00a7 1 of the Acts of 2005 (\u201cA judgment of restitution for $10,000 issued under Part I of this subtitle is the absolute limit for all [each child\u2019s] acts arising out of a single incident and is the absolute -limit-against one childy the- child\u2019s parent, or both.\u201d) (emphasis in original). The newly revised statute lacks any mention of adult defendants. Moreover, it altered the phrase which Robey argues covered adult defendants by inserting language relating only to children. Tellingly, the portion of the fiscal note addressing this change did not discuss a substantive change effecting the limits of restitution awards imposed on adult defendants. Rather, the note described the revision as effecting only matters involving child defendants or respondents and their parents, elevating the potential for victims to recover more from multiple actors in a single incident than possible under the previous statute. Dep\u2019t of Legislative Servs., Fiscal Note, S.B. 873, at 2 (2005) (\u201cA victim may receive a restitution judgment up to $10,000 for each child\u2019s act arising out of a single incident, instead of a maximum cap of $10,000 for the incident, regardless of the number of actors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">B. Objectives of Restitution</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">We also consider the objectives of restitution as it may affect our interpretation of Crim. Proe., \u00a7 ll-604(b). Contrary to Robey\u2019s assertion, the principal objective of restitution in the adult and juvenile justice systems is differently nuanced in each. It is clear that restitution is significantly rehabilitative in nature in the adult system, <em>see Grey v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>363 Md. 445, 460, 769 A.2d 891, 900 (2001) (citing <em>Coles v. State, </em>290 Md. 296, 305, 429 A.2d 1029, 1034 (1981) and <em>Lee v. State, </em>307 Md. 74, 78, 512 A.2d 372, 374 (1986)), but especially so in the juvenile system. <em>In re Don Mc., </em>344 Md. 194, 203, 686 A.2d 269, 273 (1996); <em>see </em>Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc., \u00a7 3-8A-02(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">As restitution relates to the child alone, its sole purpose is rehabilitative. <em>Lopez-Sanchez v. State, </em>388 Md. 214, 247, 879 A.2d 695, 714 (2005). Robey\u2019s contention that restitution is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>\u201cpenal in nature,\u201d as applied to the child defendant or respondent, is misplaced. Robey relies on language from <em>In re John M., </em>129 Md.App. 165, 174, 741 A.2d 503, 508 (1999) (quoting <em>In re Zephrin D., </em>69 Md.App. 755, 761, 519 A.2d 806, 809 (1987) <em>(\u201cZephrin D.\u201d)) </em>as support for his position, but neglects to discuss fully from whence this retributive or penal quality was ascribed to the restitution statute. The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Zephrin D. </em>drew the \u201cpenal in nature\u201d language it used to describe restitution in the juvenile system from an earlier case, <em>In re Appeal No. 321, </em>24 Md.App. 82, 85, 329 A.2d 113, 114 (1974), which, importantly, discussed the retributive element of restitution as applied to the parents of child offenders. The <em>In re Appeal No. 321 </em>court justified the imposition of restitution on parents by reasoning that \u201cvicarious liability is imposed as a consequence of a presumed neglect of parental responsibilities.\u201d 24 Md.App. at 85, 329 A.2d at 114. Thus, in the context of child restitution orders, the only retributive consideration is directed towards the parents of child offenders. <em>Lopez-Sanehez, </em>388 Md. at 247 n. 7, 879 A.2d at 714 n. 7; <em>see also </em>Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc., \u00a7 3-8A-02(a)(2), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Because rehabilitation is the main objective of the juvenile justice system and its dispositional consequences, such as restitution, it is consistent with that objective to limit the amount of restitution to which a child may be obligated to pay. Placing an insurmountable debt on a child offender necessarily defeats the rehabilitative purpose of imposing restitution in the first instance because the child may endeavor forever to satisfy the obligation without success. Such futility frustrates the goal of rehabilitation, which aims at the successful completion of a disposition. Conversely, there is no policy rationale for imposing a limit on the amount of restitution which an adult defendant may be obligated to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WICOMICO COUNTY AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-8\">.

Art. 27, \u00a7 807(a)(3) read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the defendant is a child, the court may order the child, the child's parent, or both to pay restitution to a victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">(ii) As an absolute limit against one child, the child's parent, or both, a judgment of restitution issued under this section may not exceed $10,000 for all acts arising out of a single incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">(iii) A court may not enter a judgment of restitution against a parent under this section unless the parent has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present appropriate evidence on the parent\u2019s behalf. A hearing under this section may be held as part of the sentencing or disposition hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">For purposes of comparison, we reproduce the statute addressing the limitation on restitution, Crim. Proc., \u00a7 11-604, in effect when Robey was ordered to pay restitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-11\">(a) Notwithstanding any other law, if a child is the defendant or child respondent, the court may order the child, the child\u2019s parent, or both to pay restitution to a victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-12\">(b) A judgment of restitution for $10,000 issued under Part I of this subtitle is the absolute limit for all acts arising out of a single incident and is the absolute limit against one child, the child\u2019s parent, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-13\">(c) (1) A court may not enter a judgment of restitution against a parent under Part I of this subtitle unless the parent has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-14\">(2) A hearing under this subsection may be held as part of the sentencing or disposition hearing.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b485-6\">. Art. 27, \u00a7 807(a)(3) was the product of a revision instigated by the passage of the Victim\u2019s Rights Act of 1997, which, <em>inter alia, </em>merged into the new Art. 27, \u00a7 807(a)(3) one statute regarding restitution orders against child defendants charged as adults, Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 807(m), and another focusing on restitution imposed on children in juvenile courts, Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 808. Chapters 311, 312, \u00a7 1 of the Acts of 1997; <em>see Grey v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>363 Md. 445, 462, 769 A.2d 891, 901 (2001). The conflation of these two statutes, which concerned only children, makes clear that the scope of the resultant Art. 27, \u00a7 807(a)(3) was limited to restitution orders imposed on children.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
