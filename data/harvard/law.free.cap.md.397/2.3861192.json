The litigation began as an administrative appeal by David Reier from the State Department of Assessments and Taxation\u2019s (SDAT) termination of him as an Assessor III in its Carroll County office. The SDAT ceded authority to the OAH to conduct evidentiary hearings and render final administrative decisions in such personnel matters. The initial Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) at the OAH assigned to adjudicate Reier\u2019s appeal affirmed the validity of the termination upon a finding that Reier was given timely notice of his termination within 30 days of the SDAT\u2019s \u201cdiscovering the depth of [his] misconduct and performance failure,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 ll-106(b) of the State Personnel and Pensions Article, Maryland Code (1993, 2004 RepLVol.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Circuit Court for Baltimore County, on Reier\u2019s petition for judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, remanded the matter to the OAH. The court instructed the ALJ to reconsider her decision in light of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s newly announced interpretation of \u00a7 ll-106(b)\u2019s 30 day notice requirement found in <em>Western Correctional Institute v. Geiger, </em>130 Md.App. 562, 747 A.2d 697 (2000) <em>(Geiger I </em>).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Aggrieved by the Remand Decision rendered by a different ALJ, Reier again sought judicial review in the Circuit Court, which affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals <em>(Reier I), </em>that court remanded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>case to the OAH to apply the yet newer judicial gloss given the 30 day notice standard announced in this Court\u2019s <em>Western Correctional Institute v. Geiger, </em>371 Md. 125, 807 A.2d 32 (2000) <em>(Geiger </em>II).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The same ALJ undertook this case for a third time and, after rendering factual findings varying as to some key dates from her previous findings, determined that more than 30 days passed between when the SDAT became aware of facts sufficient to prompt an investigation into Reier\u2019s job performance and the termination. The ALJ thus ordered that Reier be reinstated and awarded back pay, consisting only of lost monetary wages. Both the SDAT and Reier turned again to the Circuit Court: the SDAT disputing the new factual finding that its managers in the Carroll County office were aware of Reier\u2019s asserted poor performance for more than 30 days before Reier was terminated, and Reier arguing that it was error to exclude from the back pay award benefits and the other accoutrements of State employment. The Circuit Court affirmed Reier\u2019s reinstatement and directed that he be awarded benefits as part of his back pay. On appeal by the SDAT, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed Reier\u2019s reinstatement, but concluded that back pay was limited to wages and did not include benefits. <em>Dep\u2019t of Taxation v. Reier, </em>167 Md.App. 559, 597, 893 A.2d 1195, 1218 (2006) <em>(Reier II). </em>We are asked, at this point, on cross-petitions for <em>certiorari, </em>to resolve two questions. We are called upon by the SDAT to decide whether the ALJ, in applying the <em>Geiger II </em>notice standard, erred in reformulating the factual findings concerning the point in time when the SD AT became sufficiently aware of Reier\u2019s misconduct and poor performance to trigger the statutory investigation and disciplinary action period. We also consider, upon Reier\u2019s petition, whether the phrase \u201cfull back pay\u201d, as it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>used in Maryland Code (1993, 2004 Repl.Vol.), State Personnel and Pensions Article, \u00a7 ll-110(d)(l)(iii),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> encompasses other State-offered benefits such as medical, dental, and life insurance; leave; and retirement credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">David Reier, until his termination on 7 October 1996, was employed as an Assessor III for the SDAT office in Carroll County. As an assessor, Reier was expected to conduct assessments of real property \u201caccounts\u201d, or individual properties, assigned to him by his superiors, to establish their fair market value for taxation purposes. A typical assessment would entail a preliminary review of building permits for each property, editing the computer database corresponding to each property (referred to as a Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (\u201cCAMA\u201d)), reviewing and noting comparable sales data, conducting an external physical inspection of each property, measuring new improvements, and speaking with the homeowner or appropriate adult occupant of a given property. This process is commonly referred to as an assessor\u2019s \u201cfieldwork\u201d. The SDAT conducts assessments on a triennial cycle, completing assessments or re-assessments of one-third of the State\u2019s taxable properties each year of the cycle. The SDAT generally strives to finish this task each year prior to 1 October in anticipation of the assessment notices being dispatched on 1 January of the following year. Before the process is considered complete, however, local supervisors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>typically carry out field audits of its assessors for quality control purposes. This auditing process generally does not commence for a given assessor until after the assessor reports that he or she has completed all of his or her field work for all assigned property accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The events leading up to Reier\u2019s termination occurred during the final months of the 1996 assessment year. In early August 1996, the Assistant Supervisor of Assessments for Carroll County, Lumen Norris,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> found a stack of 8 to 10 building permits on top of, or otherwise in close proximity to, a filing cabinet designated for the storage of such permits. This caught Norris\u2019s attention because assessors ordinarily commence their field work by locating and extracting from the cabinet permits linked to their assigned properties by account number so that the progress of any new construction may be evaluated properly. If permits were not in their proper place, filed in the cabinet, as was the case here, it may indicate that they were not being considered in the assessment process. Norris identified the misplaced permits by their account numbers as linked to properties assigned to Reier. Shortly after his discovery, Norris brought the misplaced permits to the attention of the Supervisor of Assessments for Carroll County, Larry White, during a discussion about quality control and the pending field audits. White decided to use the permits as a sampling of Reier\u2019s work for audit purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The timeline of the particular audit of Reier\u2019s work, as one may imagine, is a source of considerable dispute in this record because of its significance to the determination of the date on which SDAT became aware of the extent of Reier\u2019s asserted poor performance and misconduct. Because Reier was terminated on 7 October 1996, a finding that the SDAT was aware of Reier\u2019s deficient work prior to 7 September 1996 would render the discipline untimely under the <em>Geiger II </em>standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>for calculating the 30 day period in which the State as an employer has to investigate and effectuate discipline. As noted earlier, there was a divergence of findings on this point between the first and second remand hearings at the OAH. We shall explore these findings in greater detail <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The remainder of the factual background is uncontested. On 13 September 1996, White met with the State Supervisor of the SDAT, Joseph Szabo, and Personnel Administrator, Emory Rudy, about Reier\u2019s performance as an assessor. On 24 September 1996, Assessor Supervisor Gail Trawinski of the Carroll County office reported the findings of her review of Reier\u2019s \u201cedits\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of properties that recently had been sold.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Her initial review uncovered 21 errors in Reier\u2019s editing of 68 properties.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Trawinski\u2019s subsequent review of 300 other edits performed by Reier yielded a finding of 87 mistakes. Trawinski communicated her findings to White in late September. Around that same time, the SDAT headquarters dispatched Assessor Manager, Joseph Wagner, to audit Reier\u2019s work. Upon a drive-through of the geographical area containing the properties assigned to Reier, Wagner identified 24 properties exhibiting visible, new improvements that had been present for more than one month. Wagner determined that, of the 24, Reier\u2019s fieldwork correctly noted improvements on one account, incorrectly noted five, and entirely missed improvements on 18 properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Satisfied that the audit established thoroughly the pervasiveness and unacceptable frequency of Reier\u2019s assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>errors,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> White convened a meeting with Reier on 3 October 1996 to discuss the audit\u2019s findings and determine the appropriate sanction. White terminated Reier after weighing Reier\u2019s previously satisfactory job performance evaluation against the recent audit results and Reier\u2019s unsatisfactory explanation of the audit results.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\u2014 A CLOSER EXAMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">After 10 years of litigation, the procedural history of this case is admittedly protracted. We commence our close review of this history necessarily with the first remand to the OAH because it resulted in the pertinent factual findings later revised in the course of the second remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">\n<em>OAH Remand Decision I (8 December 2000)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">As a result of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Geiger I, </em>the Circuit Court for Baltimore County remanded Reier\u2019s appeal to the OAH for more detailed findings of fact pertaining to the SDAT\u2019s actions after the initial discovery of the out-of-place building permits. The court, quoting the standard from <em>Geiger I, </em>requested that the ALJ determine \u201cthe date by which SDAT \u2018... in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should reasonably have acquired enough knowledge\u2019 to justify terminating Reier on October 7, 1996.\u201d Of specific interest to the court was how long it took Norris to investigate the misplaced permits and \u201cdiscover the misconduct that they evidenced,\u201d as well as whether the review of Reier\u2019s work that transpired in \u201cearly September\u201d occurred before 6 September 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">In response to the Circuit Court\u2019s order, ALJ Sondra Spencer conducted a new hearing and accepted additional evidence from both parties, along with the record from the initial OAH hearing. The findings of fact in ALJ Spencer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>resultant decision, responsive to the Circuit Court order, were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-4\">3. In early August 1996, Lumen Norris, Assistant Supervisor of Assessments for Carroll County, found a stack of 8 to 10 building permits on a cabinet. There were no notations of [sic] the permits. The properties reflected on the permits were assigned to the Employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">4. Mr. Norris discussed the permits with Larry White, Supervisor of Assessments for Carroll County. Mr. Norris and Mr. White took the permits and went to the properties to determine if work had been performed pursuant to the permits. They discovered that the Employee had been to the properties but had not made any notations on the permits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">5. On September 3, 1996, the Employee completed his fieldwork.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">6. As part of a quality control review, once an assessor completes his fieldwork, Mr. White conducts a random audit of the assessor\u2019s work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-8\">7. On September 9, 1996, Mr. White conducted a field audit of the Employee\u2019s completed fieldwork. The assessments for 68 properties were reviewed and 21 errors, which affected property valuations, were discovered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-9\">8. Between September 14 and September 30, at least three more audits of the Employee\u2019s work were conducted. One of the audits revealed 87 out of a total of 300 properties with errors affecting evaluation. Another audit reviewed the fieldwork on 33 properties. Of the 24 properties with changes from previous assessments, the Employee accurately reflected one change, incorrectly noted five changes that he identified[,] and failed to reflect 18 changes, including decks and additional buildings on the properties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">Upon these findings of fact, the ALJ concluded that Reier had not made a <em>prima facie </em>showing that the SDAT was on notice of his misconduct to an extent that would justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>discipline more than 30 days prior to the actual termination. Even though Norris and White were aware of the misplaced permits and the errors evidenced by Reier\u2019s failure to note the relevant real property improvements, ALJ Spencer found that such knowledge did not rise to the level needed to justify terminating Reier\u2019s employment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Further, because Reier had not completed his field work at that time, it was n ot yet incumbent upon Norris or White to conduct their audit of Reier\u2019s work. The ALJ determined that the SDAT was put on notice of Reier\u2019s misconduct, to an extent sufficient to trigger commencement of the time period prescribed in \u00a7 11-106(b), only after Norris and White\u2019s 9 September 1996 audit of 68 of Reier\u2019s assigned properties, thus making the 7 October 1996 termination timely.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Reier sought judicial review of the AL J\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\n<em>Circuit Court Review (31 December 2001)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The Circuit Court judge affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision in favor of the SDAT under the deferential \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard of review. The court dismissed Reier\u2019s argument that the discovery of the misplaced permits was sufficient to trigger the 30 day period under \u00a7 11\u2014106(b). Commenting on Reier\u2019s position, the court stated \u201c[wjere the Court to adopt this approach, State agencies would have to launch a full scale investigation every time a supervisor discovered that an employee failed to put away documents used by the employee in performing his job.\u201d Reier appealed this decision to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\n<em>Court of Special Appeals Remand (19 December 2002)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion filed on 19 December 2002, weighed in on the 30 day notice provision of \u00a7 ll-106(b), taking into account our opinion in <em>Geiger II. </em>The intermediate appellate court identified its task as deciding \u201c[w]hen did the [SDAT] acquire knowledge sufficient to order an investigation of the conduct that ultimately resulted in the termination of [Reier].\u201d The appellate court panel prefaced its review of the procedural history and facts of the case by noting that if the SDAT acquired adequate notice in early August 1996, as alleged by Reier, the termination would have to be rescinded. Obfuscating the court\u2019s analysis of the question before it, however, was the fact that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag\">the chronology set forth [by the ALJ\u2019s factual findings] suggests\u2014but does not definitively establish\u2014that prior to September 3, 1996, Messrs. Norris and White went to the property <em>[sic] </em>mentioned on the mislaid permits and discovered that Reier had not noted the improvements on the permits even though he had claimed to have been on the premises.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">If Norris or White actually had checked Reier\u2019s field cards to determine if he had noted any of the improvements after Reier had claimed to have visited the properties, the panel hypothecated, then Reier\u2019s supervisors would have possessed, at that point, sufficient knowledge to investigate Reier for derogation of his duties. Because this realization would have occurred before Reier reported that his field work was complete on 3 September 1996, the 7 October termination would have fallen outside of the statutorily prescribed 30 day period for the proper administration of the statutory investigative and disciplinary processes in this case. The Court of Special Appeals ultimately resolved that it could not so conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>because neither the initial ALJ, M. Gayle Hafner, nor ALJ Spencer made an explicit determination of when Norris or White examined Reier\u2019s field cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Because of the ambiguous chronology established in the earlier administrative decisions, the appellate court panel noted that the facts as found, when alternatively viewed in a light most favorable to either party, would allow either party to prevail. The court noted that it was possible to conclude that Norris and White, prior to 3 September 1996, were aware of Reier\u2019s omission from the field cards of the improvements described in the misplaced building permits and that Jack Burgesen, another assessor in the Carroll County office, had audited one of Reier\u2019s assigned properties, at White\u2019s direction, on 4 September. Conversely, the record also supported a contrary conclusion that Norris and White only became aware of Reier\u2019s deficient performance upon their field inspection of the building permit properties on 9 September 1996. The intermediate appellate court opined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq_\">the date that SDAT acquired knowledge sufficient to order an investigation into whether Reier had been properly performing his field work was when the employer discovered (1) that improvements (mentioned on the misplace[d] permits) had been performed and (2) that Reier had visited the premises but had failed to note on SDAT\u2019s field cards that the improvements had been completed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The ambiguity of the ALJ\u2019s fact findings, however, did not determine with certainty when the critical knowledge noted above was acquired by the SDAT. Accordingly, the court remanded the case for a determination by the ALJ whether the SDAT acquired the critical knowledge prior to 7 September 1996, which, if so, would require rescission of Reier\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\n<em>OAH Remand Decision II (12 April 2001)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Upon remand, ALJ Spencer reconsidered the evidence adduced thus far, declining the SDAT\u2019s request to supplement the record further with additional testimony on the questions posed by the Court of Special Appeals. The ALJ recited her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>previous findings of fact from the first remand decision, along with a critical revision of finding number four<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-4\"><em>As </em>a result of the remand order and further review of the record, I find the following additional facts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">11. Mr. Norris found a stack of misplaced permits in August 1996. There were no notations of the permits that the property had been assessed or visited. Upon further checking, Mr. Norris concluded that the properties had been assigned to Reier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">12. After finding the field cards, Mr. Norris pulled the field cards to determine if Reier had been to the properties. The notation on the field cards indicated Reier had been to the properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">13. Mr. Norris discussed his findings with Mr. White. Both Mr. Norris and Mr. White then went to the properties identified in the permits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">14. Mr. White next instructed Jack Burgeson [sic], another assessor, to reassess the properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">15. Mr. Burgeson [sic] conducted reassessments on September 4,1996, September 14,1996, and September 30, 1996.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">ALJ Spencer recast the chronology relying on the testimony taken during the 17 April 1997 hearing, rather than testimony received on 7 May at the initial OAH proceeding presided over by ALJ Hafner. She found that the April testimony was \u201cmore credible and accurately reflected] the chronology of events in this case,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which now resolved that the SDAT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>acquired knowledge sufficient to trigger an investigation of Reier\u2019s job performance by 4 September 1996. The judge relied upon Norris\u2019s 17 April testimony that, after finding the misplaced permits, he reviewed the corresponding field cards, which led him to discuss the matter with White. The two then visited the properties to which the permits corresponded and discovered that Reier had not noted on the field cards the completed improvements located on the properties, despite his indication that he had visited the properties. This realization prompted White to order Burgesen to reassess those properties, which task Burgesen commenced on 4 September 1996, as evidenced by his notation of that date on one of the misplaced permits. ALJ Spencer further noted that Burgesen had to have possessed the field cards to conduct his reassessment of the properties, providing further evidence that the SDAT was cognizant of Reier\u2019s poor performance prior to the critical date of 7 September 1996. Accordingly, the ALJ rescinded the termination as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">ALJ Spencer then considered the question of whether State-offered benefits are contemplated as part of the \u201cfull back pay\u201d remedy provided in \u00a7 ll-110(d)(l)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> for a rescinded termination. In her view, \u00a7 11-1 10(d)(1) was framed in the disjunctive, thus providing three mutually exclusive possible outcomes to an employee\u2019s appeal of his or her termination: (1) affirmation of the discipline, (2) rescission or modification of the discipline and the restoration of pay and the full panoply of state benefits, <em>or </em>(3) reinstatement, full back pay, or both. The ALJ thus reasoned that the statute foreclosed the possibility of both reinstatement with full back pay <em>and </em>the award of benefits. Accordingly, Reier was reinstated with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>full back pay, but not restored with lost state benefits. Both Reier and the SDAT sought judicial review of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\n<em>Circuit Court Review (18 March 2005)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The SDAT assigned error to the ALJ for not permitting the admission of additional evidence on the questions posed by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Reier I </em>and to the ALJ\u2019s revision of her previous findings of fact. Reier, on the other hand, argued that the ALJ incorrectly concluded that State-offered benefits may not accompany an award of full back pay. Finding that the ALJ properly made supplemental findings of fact in response to the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s specific inquiries, the Circuit Court affirmed the administrative decision concluding Reier\u2019s termination to be unlawful. The court also concluded that it would defy logic to construe \u00a7 11\u2014 110(d)(1) as precluding benefits as part of a full back pay award for a wrongful termination. The SDAT appealed this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\n<em>Court of Special Appeals \u2019s Review (3 March 2006)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the reinstatement of Reier, finding that its previous unreported opinion in this case and <em>Geiger II </em>effectively vacated ALJ Spencer\u2019s original findings of fact. <em>Reier II, </em>167 Md.App. at 591, 893 A.2d at 1215. The intermediate appellate court perceived that it was incumbent upon ALJ Spencer to make new factual findings to \u201canswer specific questions that would undoubtedly go to the merits of what the Court of Appeals declared agencies and appellate courts should seek in reviewing matters under \u00a7 11\u2014 106.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The new factual determinations were not made in error because \u201cnew legal principles [were] to be applied to these facts.\u201d <em>Reier II, </em>167 Md.App. at 592, 893 A.2d at 1215. Because the resolution of the case under the <em>Geiger I </em>standard did not implicate as relevant facts pertaining to when the SDAT became aware of circumstances justifying an investigation of Reier, the resolution of the case under the <em>Geiger II </em>standard necessitated new findings of fact. <em>Reier II, </em>167 Md.App. at 593-94, 893 A.2d at 1216. It was within the ALJ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>discretion whether to accept further evidence from the SDAT on the questions posed by the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s remand opinion. <em>Reier II, </em>167 Md.App. at 594-95, 893 A.2d at 1216-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">Finally, the appellate court panel reversed the Circuit Court on the issue of benefits, holding that the plain language of \u00a7 11\u2014110(d)(1) precluded the award of benefits in addition to full back pay. The General Assembly drafted the statute to restore benefits in the event of the rescission or modification of a disciplinary action in subsubsubsection (ii), but not in conjunction with full back pay as provided in subsubsubsection (ni). The intermediate appellate court reasoned that if the Legislature intended for benefits to be available in addition to full back pay, the statute would have been framed more clearly to so provide. <em>Reier II, </em>167 Md.App. at 597, 893 A.2d at 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AhO\">A. The Revised Factual Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The SDAT renews here its assignment of error to ALJ Spencer\u2019s decision for her revision of the timeline findings pertaining to its notice of Reier\u2019s deficient performance as an assessor. Specifically, the SDAT argues initially that the law of the case doctrine forbade the ALJ from revising her previous findings of fact in this regard. The findings of fact made on the first remand to OAH supported ALJ Spencer\u2019s conclusion at that time that the SDAT was not on adequate notice of Reier\u2019s misconduct until 9 September 1996. This conclusion, as the SDAT\u2019s theory goes, is readily applicable to either the <em>Geiger I </em>or <em>Geiger II </em>standard, without the need for revisiting the fact-finding function. Thus, the ALJ overreached her authority in answering the Court o f Special Appeals\u2019s questions of clarification in <em>Reier I </em>by reformulating the timeline of events which previously had been affirmed by the Circuit Court as supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Illustrative of this overreaching, the SDAT observes that if the revised findings were in place for the first remand decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>applying the <em>Geiger I </em>standard, the ALJ would have had to come to a different conclusion than was reached in reliance on the findings of fact actually made in that decision. The SDAT asserts that Reier\u2019s termination would have been justified, and the 30 day \u201cclock\u201d would have begun to run had the SDAT known prior to 4 September 1996 that Reier failed to note and record the improvements evident at the properties he claimed to have visited. Notably, ALJ Spencer did not arrive at that conclusion in her first remand decision, but instead found that the SDAT was not aware sufficiently of Reier\u2019s possible misconduct, and thus the 30 day \u201cclock\u201d would not have begun to run, until 9 September 1996. The SDAT argues that when the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Reier I </em>sustained the finding that Norris and White conducted the audit on 9 September, such became the law of the case and could not be revised at the subsequent administrative hearing on remand to the OAH.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Reier counters that the ALJ merely was answering the questions posed by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Reier I </em>because of the ambiguity noted by that court in her findings of fact in the 8 December 2000 remand decision.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because it was not entirely clear when the SDAT became aware sufficiently of Reier\u2019s misconduct, the Court of Special Appeals remanded the ease to the ALJ for clarification. Thus, the ALJ did not exceed her authority in making the findings, revised though they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The \u201claw of the case doctrine is one of appellate procedure.\u201d <em>Scott v. State, </em>379 Md. 170, 183, 840 A.2d 715, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>723 (2004) (quoting <em>Goldstein &amp; Baron Chartered v. Chesley, </em>375 Md. 244, 253, 825 A.2d 985, 990 (2003)). \u201cUnder the doctrine, once an appellate court rules upon a question presented on appeal, litigants and lower courts become bound by the ruling, which is considered to be the law of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Turner v. Hous. Auth., </em>364 Md. 24, 32, 770 A.2d 671, 676 (2001)). The function of the doctrine is to prevent piecemeal litigation. <em>Fid.-Balt. Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>217 Md. 367, 371-72, 142 A.2d 796, 798 (1958). Thus, litigants</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai\">cannot prosecute successive appeals in a case that raises the same questions that have been previously decided by this Court in a former appeal of that same case; and, furthermore, they cannot, on the subsequent appeal of the same case raise any question that could have been presented in the previous appeal on the then state of the record, as it existed in the court of original jurisdiction. If this were not so, any party to a suit could institute as many successive appeals as the fiction of his imagination could produce new reasons to assign as to why his side of the case should prevail, and the litigation would never terminate. Once this Court has ruled upon a question properly presented on an appeal, or, if the ruling be contrary to a question that could have been raised and argued in that appeal on the then state of the record, as aforesaid, such a ruling becomes the \u2018law of the case\u2019 and is binding on the litigants and the court alike, unless changed or modified after reargument, and neither the questions decided not the ones that could have been raised and decided are available to be raised in a subsequent appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><em>Fid.-Balt. Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>217 Md. at 372, 142 A.2d at 798. It appears to us, however, that the doctrine of the law of the case, in its proper application, concerns appellate conclusions as to questions of law, not pure questions of fact. <em>Stokes v. Am.

Lohmuller Bldg.

The doctrine is rarely, and in a very limited class of cases, applied to matters of evidence as distinguished from rulings of law, and a decision on appeal on a question of fact does not generally become the law of the case, nor estop the parties on a second trial from showing the true state of the facts.\u201d) (emphasis added); 2A FED. PROC, L. ED. \u00a7 3:793, p. 542 (\u201cThe doctrine applies to determinations only of questions of law and not questions of fact.\u201d). Although factual determinations undergirding or mixed with conclusions of law may become the law of the case,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> pure matters of fact, absent commingling with the application of legal principles, have no estoppel effect under the law of the case doctrine. <em>Barrett, </em>151 Md. at 139, 134 A. at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The doctrine of the law of the case is inapplicable here. The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Reier I </em>reached no definitive conclusion with regard to the point in time at which the SDAT possessed knowledge sufficient to commence an investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>of Reier. In fact, to the extent that the <em>Reier I </em>panel discussed findings of fact, it specifically stated that it could not render legal conclusions based on the extant fact-finding because of the ambiguity of the factual findings made by the ALJs to that point. This is also true with respect to the legal significance of the date of 9 September 1996, cited by the SDAT as the critical day on which Norris and White conducted a \u201cfield audit\u201d of Reier\u2019s misplaced permit properties and discovered the extent of his misconduct sufficient to warrant an investigation. Because of the ordering and phrasing of the ALJ\u2019s findings, the <em>Reier I </em>court expressed its misgivings about whether this \u201cfield audit\u201d was merely of the properties that were the subject of the misplaced permits or a more extensive review of 68 properties.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, even if the doctrine of the law of the case were implicated by findings of fact, the <em>Reier I </em>court expressly declined to commit or opine as to any such findings, much less a version supporting the SDAT\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">The SDAT\u2019s reliance on <em>Stavely v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>376 Md. 108, 829 A.2d 265 (2003), as support for its \u201claw of the case\u201d argument is misplaced. In <em>Stavely, </em>an ALJ determined that an insurer\u2019s proposed nonrenewal of an automobile liability policy was not justified and, therefore, violated Maryland law. 376 Md. at 115, 829 A.2d at 269. The ALJ\u2019s legal conclusion was upheld by the Court of Special Appeals and the Court of Appeals denied <em>certiorari. Id. </em>Another ALJ presiding over the same case subsequently for purposes of determining an award of attorney\u2019s fees held, notwithstanding the previous final disposition on the issue, that the insurer was justified in not renewing the policy. <em>Id. </em>Upon subsequent judicial review, the <em>Stavely </em>Court concluded that this revisitation of the nonrenewal justification issue was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>contrary to the doctrine of the law of the case and/or principles of <em>res judicata. </em>376 Md. at 116-17, 829 A.2d at 270. The SDAT incorrectly imagines <em>Stavely </em>as presenting a scenario similar to what transpired in the present case. First, as we have noted previously, the doctrine of the law of the case does not apply here because no legal conclusions were reached by the <em>Reier I </em>court, unlike in <em>Stavely. </em>Second, the sequence of events in <em>Stavely </em>was not complicated, as here, by an intervening change in a legal standard relevant to the disposition of the case, which required a revisitation and reformulation of relevant fact-finding as previously addressed.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">The SDAT, however, claims that \u201cthe <em>Reier I </em>decision never vacated any facts although it sought clarification of certain events in the sequence.\u201d The SDAT here emphasizes only half of the story. The findings made by the ALJ remained intact to the extent that the Court of Special Appeals did not express doubt as to their precision. Notably, the intermediate appellate court indicated in <em>Reier I </em>that it was remanding the case for the ALJ to answer specific questions regarding the acquisition by the SDAT of knowledge of Reier\u2019s poor performance and misconduct precisely because of the imprecision of certain factual findings made earlier. The mandate in <em>Reier I </em>vacated the judgments below and instructed the ALJ to conduct \u201cfurther proceedings in conformity with the views set forth in this opinion,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> which the ALJ dutifully carried out by answering the questions posed. <em>See Harrison v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number><em>Harrison, </em>109 Md.App. 652, 666, 675 A.2d 1003, 1010 (1996) (\u201c[A]ny direction in an order or mandate that proceedings on remand are to be consistent with the opinion would necessarily require the opinion to be considered as an integral part of the judgment.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>343 Md. 564, 683 A.2d 177. Although the opinion in <em>Reier I </em>was silent on the question of whether new or revised factual findings were required to satisfy its queries, it is presumed that the ALJ possessed the discretion to carry out the mandate in whatever manner she best saw fit. <em>See Balducci v. Eberly, </em>304 Md. 664, 670, 500 A.2d 1042, 1046 (1985). We, thus, reject the SDAT\u2019s argument that ALJ Spencer overreached her authority by making revised findings. Rather, the revision of the previous findings was amply within the ambit of the remand and fulfilled the tasks set before her by the <em>Reier I </em>mandate and opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Because we believe that it was proper to permit Reier and the SDAT to argue the facts and the ALJ to reevaluate them in light of the <em>Geiger II </em>interpretation of the \u00a7 ll-106(b) notice standard, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s determination of the untimeliness of Reier\u2019s termination. Further, ALJ Spencer did not abuse her discretion by advising the parties in a 24 October 2003 letter that she would not accept further evidence proffered by the SDAT prior to oral arguments at the second remand hearing. The ALJ\u2019s decision to forego the receipt of possible further evidence is entitled to deference and may only be reversed if found to be arbitrary and capricious.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We are convinced further that ALJ Spencer\u2019s decision regarding the need for additional evidence was reasonable given the reality that, just prior to the remand, she re-acquainted herself with the arguments and voluminous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>record in this case. Both legally and practically speaking, therefore, ALJ Spencer was in the best position to make the determination of whether further evidence was needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">B. \u201cFull Back Pay\u201d and State-Offered Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Reier\u2019s question requires us to determine whether State-offered benefits are contemplated in the award of \u201cfull back pay\u201d, as the latter phrase is used in State Personnel and Pensions Article \u00a7 11\u2014110(d)(l)(iii). We conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the ALJ\u2019s legal conclusion that benefits are not included in \u201cfull back pay\u201d as the question is one of statutory interpretation and, therefore, a purely legal inquiry. <em>Schwartz v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., 385 </em>Md. 534, 554, 870 A.2d 168, 180 (2005); <em>Charles County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Vann, </em>382 Md. 286, 295, 855 A.2d 313, 319 (2004); <em>Spencer v. Bd. of Pharmacy, </em>380 Md. 515, 528-29, 846 A.2d 341, 348-49 (2004); <em>Coleman v. Anne Arundel County Police Dep\u2019t, </em>369 Md. 108, 121, 797 A.2d 770, 778 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The ultimate objective of our analysis is to extract and effectuate the actual intent of the Legislature in enacting the statute. <em>Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 223, 858 A.2d 484, 487 (2004); <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221, 1226 (2003). This process begins with an examination of the plain language of the statute. Section ll-110(d)(l)(iii) does not state expressly whether \u201cfull back pay\u201d embraces benefits. Reier interprets the plain language of the statute to include benefits in \u201cfull back pay\u201d for terminations because benefits are permitted for lesser disciplinary sanctions. The SDAT, on the other hand, points out that the organization and structure of \u00a7 ll-110(d)(l) specifically includes benefits as part of the compensation for lesser disciplinary actions not involving a \u201cbreak in service\u201d, but makes no mention of benefits as part of \u201cfull back pay\u201d awarded in response to an invalid termination. This, the SDAT argues, indicates that the General Assembly purposefully decided to exclude benefits from full back pay as part of the relief available to a employee successful in upsetting his or her termination, whether on a technicality or otherwise. It strikes us that the competing parties\u2019 argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>ments present \u201ctwo ... reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute,\u201d making the statute ambiguous and subject to a more expansive investigation of the field in our quest for legislative intent. <em>Deville, </em>383 Md. at 223, 858 A.2d at 487 (citing <em>Price, </em>378 Md. at 387, 835 A.2d at 1226). Therefore, we may employ \u201call the resources and tools of statutory construction at our disposal,\u201d <em>Deville, </em>383 Md. at 223, 858 A.2d at 487, including \u201clegislative history, prior case law, and statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Melgar v. State, </em>355 Md. 339, 347, 734 A.2d 712, 716 (1999)). After so doing, we conclude it more likely so than not that the General Assembly meant for the phrase \u201cfull back pay\u201d in \u00a7 11\u2014110(d)(1)(iii) to encompass State-offered benefits, including insurance, leave, status, and service credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">The word \u201cfull\u201d connotes a comprehensive approach to compensation such that it includes all of the incidents and benefits of State employment.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As we noted in <em>Geiger II, </em>the State personnel management system underwent a panoptic legislative revision in 1996 on the initiative of Governor Glendening. 371 Md. at 145, 807 A.2d at 44. The Governor established a Task Force to Reform the State Personnel Management System in 1995,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> which produced on 16 January 1996 its final Report to the Governor (Task Force Report) containing findings and recommendations. <em>Geiger II, </em>371 Md. at 145-46, 807 A.2d at 44-45. This report formed the basis of the subsequently introduced cross-filed bills of House Bill 774 and Senate Bill 466, later codified as the State Personnel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Management System Reform Act of 1996 (Reform Act).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Reform Act \u201cgenerally reflect[ed] the Task Force recommendations\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and \u201cwas passed in substantially the same form as proposed by the Task Force.\u201d <em>Geiger II, </em>371 Md. at 146, 807 A.2d at 45. Thus, the General Assembly\u2019s reliance on the Task Force Report serves as guidance for our interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The original draft of House Bill 774 provided that \u00a7 11\u2014110(d)(l)(iii)2 would read \u201cfull back pay, with a deduction for interim earnings from employment elsewhere or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence,\u201d thus providing a set-off for mitigation of damages accrued by the wrongfully disciplined employee. An amendment was introduced in the House of Delegates to strike the set-off language, in order to have the bill track the Task Force proposal that the OAH \u201cmay order back pay which will not be reduced by interim earnings from employment elsewhere and other earnings that could have been received.\u201d Task Force Report 48 (1996). The descriptive word \u201cfull\u201d remained in the statute after elimination of the set-off language, evidencing that \u201cfull\u201d possesses significance independent of the set-off language it had once accompanied. The SDAT essentially asks us to regard \u201cfull\u201d as a meaningless vestige of the deleted set-off language. Our canons of statutory interpretation, however, forbid us to \u201cconstrue a statute ... so that [a] word, clause, sentence, or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.\u201d <em>Blake v. State, </em>395 Md. 213, 224, 909 A.2d 1020, 1026 (2006); <em>Moore v. State, </em>388 Md. 446, 453, 879 A.2d 1111, 1115 (2005); <em>Mid-Atl. Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. Public Serv.

We look to the surrounding provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>of \u00a7 ll-110(d) to harmonize the various provisions of the statute and bestow the intended meaning to the word \u201cfull\u201d. <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v.

Bell Atl.-Md., Inc., </em>346 Md. 160, 178, 695 A.2d 171, 180 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">While \u201cfull\u201d is not used elsewhere in \u00a7 11-110, it appears in the subsubsubseetion immediately following the recitation of restored \u201ctime, compensation, status, and benefits\u201d as remedies for a wrongful termination. State Pers. &amp; Pens. Article \u00a7 11\u2014110(d)(l)(ii). Thus, \u201cfull\u201d reasonably could be construed as a blanket word encompassing the list of remedies\u2014\u201ctime, compensation, status, and benefits\u201d\u2014offered just above it. This interpretation is in accord with related Maryland jurisprudence. Since the Reform Act was codified, Maryland courts have conflated the provisions of \u00a7 11\u2014 110(d)(l)(ii) and (iii) so as to award both back pay and benefits. <em>See, e.g., Public Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Wilson, </em>389 Md. 27, 39, 40-41, 882 A.2d 849, 856-57 (2005) (indicating that a Circuit Court had awarded \u201cback pay and benefits\u201d as well as reinstatement as relief under \u00a7 11\u2014110(d)(1)); <em>Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v.

Wrongfully terminated State public sector employees generally receive benefits in addition to back pay as remedies for their improper dismissal. <em>See, e.g., Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Shrieves, </em>100 Md.App. 283, 296, 641 A.2d 899, 905 (1994) (stating that a Circuit Court ordered a security attendant at a state hospital be reinstated with \u201cback pay and any lost benefits\u201d); <em>Sheriff of Baltimore City v.

Mayor and Town Council of Mountain Lake Park, </em>392 Md. 301, 316-17, 896 A.2d 1036, 1045 (2006) (citing <em>Pete v. State, </em>384 Md. 47, 65-66, 862 A.2d 419, 429-30 (2004)), seems to contemplate that benefits are intertwined inextricably with State employee pay. Section 2-502 establishes the State Employee Health Program, which State employees are permitted to join by virtue of \u00a7 2-507(a) in order to receive a subsidy from the State for health care insurance. While on leave with pay, \u00a7 9-103 provides that State employees do not lose their health insurance subsidy and continue to accrue seniority and leave based on the employee\u2019s regular hours. Conversely, when a State employee is in a \u201cleave without pay status with regard to his employment^] no deductions occur, no subsidies are provided and no leave or retirement credit accrues.\u201d <em>Corr. Pre-Release Sys. v. Whittington, </em>119 Md.App. 436, 439, 705 A.2d 78, 80 (1998). The State Personnel and Pensions Article also grants State employees paid annual,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> personal,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and sick<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> leave commensurate with certain formulas based upon the employee\u2019s length of service or start date. What is more, under \u00a7\u00a7 9-304 and 305, unused annual leave may be redeemed for compensation at the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay, further linking leave with pay.

The SDAT further claims that the General Assembly intentionally spurned the Task Force Report\u2019s proposal to use \u201cand/or\u201d linking the possible actions available to the OAH as listed in (d)(1) by enacting the statute with the typically disjunctive word \u201cor\u201d separating the remedies. While it is true that \u201cor\u201d is read typically as a disjunctive, <em>see, e.g., County Council of Prince George\u2019s County v. Dutcher, </em>365 Md. 399, 418, 780 A.2d 1137, 1149 (2001); <em>Schlossberg v.

We have stated previously that \u201c[i]t is well settled that the terms \u2018and\u2019 and \u2018or\u2019 may be used interchangeably when it is reasonable and logical to do so.\u201d <em>Little Store, Inc. v.

SINGER, 1A SUTHERLAND STATUTES AND STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION, \u00a7 21:14 (6th ed.2002). The reasonably inferred intent of the General Assembly here was to permit (d)(l)(ii) and (iii) to be conjunctive options. In addition to the cases cited <em>supra </em>conflating the remedies of (d)(1)(h) and (hi), the language used in the Task Force Report was followed substantially by the General Assembly. The Task Force Report, in its proposals that ultimately became (d)(1), separated subsubsubsections (i) and (h) with an \u201cor\u201d and subsubsubsections (h) and (hi) with an \u201cand/or\u201d. We read this proposed language as evidence of the intent of the Legislature to permit either or both the rescission of a disciplinary action or the reinstatement of a dismissed employee and/or full back pay.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Moreover, the SDAT\u2019s attempt to distinguish the two subsubsubsections by limiting the reach of (d)(l)(ih) to \u201cbreak in service\u201d type disciplinary actions and (d)(1)(h) to all lesser disciplinary actions is contrary to the disciplinary scheme outlined in \u00a7 11-104. Terminations clearly are included as a form of \u201cdisciplinary action\u201d under \u00a7 11-104(6), along with the full comphment of lesser actions. Thus, it is not reasonable to parse terminations from other forms of discipline in the terms of \u00a7 ll-110(d)(l)(h) when it states that the OAH may \u201crescind or modify the <em>disciplinary action </em>taken\u201d. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>The SDAT\u2019s attempt to segregate terminations from lesser forms of discipline would result further in an illogical and manifestly unfair administration of remedies for wrongful terminations. The SD AT\u2019s construction of (d)(1) would allow for the award of benefits to the recipients of erroneously-imposed less severe discipline, such as suspensions or the forfeiture of leave, but necessarily would preclude the award of benefits to those terminated \u2019wrongfully, the most severe administrative punishment. We do not perceive that the General Assembly purposefully chose to restore fully the time, compensation, status, and benefits lost by those wrongfully disciplined who suffer consequences of a lesser magnitude as a result of their discipline and deny that same extent of relief to those who have borne erroneously the ultimate employment sanction. <em>Gwin v.

Senator Delores Kelley introduced Senate Bill 1080 on 8 March 2006, just three legislative working days after <em>Reier II </em>was filed on 3 March 2006. In Senator Kelley\u2019s testimony before the Senate Finance Committee on 23 March 2006, she specifically indicated that her sponsorship of the bill was motivated by the intent to \u201ccodify decades of practice by administrative law judges\u201d of rescinding wrongful terminations or suspensions and restoring back pay with benefits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>This practice, she noted, was disturbed by the <em>Reier II </em>decision which held that the Legislature could not have intended \u201cfull back pay\u201d to comprise both wages and benefits. The Committee favorably reported the bill the next day and it was passed on its third reading on the following day. Senator Kelley, we note, served as a member on the same Senate Finance Committee that considered the Reform Act in 1996, containing the original \u00a7 11\u2014110(d)(1), as the 2006 amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Having resolved that Reier was eligible for \u201cfull back pay,\u201d including State-offered benefits, further proceedings will be necessary to identify more precisely which benefits and amounts Reier may receive.

The ALJ explained that the errors pertaining to the non-annotated permits did not necessarily indicate that Reier was not visiting any properties at all, which \"would have indicated the need for an immediate investigation.\u201d Rather, it was only enough information to indicate that Reier may have been performing his duties poorly, which, in the judgment of the ALJ, apparently would not have been significant enough to prompt a more immediate investigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b41-7\">.

The reason for this inference is an assumption that the findings of fact were presented in chronological order. Thus, when the ALJ noted the discovery of the permits and the field audit by Norris and White in the numbered paragraph just prior to the entry reciting that Reier had completed his field work on 3 September 1996, it appeared that the entire permit episode pre-dated Reier's completion of his field work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b44-13\">.

If the answer to that question is 'yes,' did SDAT know prior to September 7, 1996, that Reier had been to the premises (mentioned in the misplaced permits) but had failed to note on the field cards the fact that improvements to the property had been made?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b50-6\">. <em>See, e.g., Beane v.

The resolution of this ambiguity was critical. If the 9 September \u201cfield audit\u201d were merely of the subject properties of the permits, the SDAT would have acquired the requisite knowledge to terminate Reier within 30 days of his actual termination\u2014making the discipline timely.
