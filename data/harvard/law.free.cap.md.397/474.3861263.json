If payments are not timely made, Section 9-728 of the Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides for the assessment of penalties against a delinquent \u201cemployer\u201d or \u201cinsurer\u201d in progressive percentages of the original award, depending on the number of days the payment is late. Maryland Code (1999), Section 9-728 of the Labor and Employment Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">In this workers\u2019 compensation case, Appellant, the Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Corporation (\u201cPCIGC\u201d), was assessed penalties and attorneys\u2019 fees by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission for the late payment of a workers\u2019 compensation award to Appellee, Peter L. Yanni, after the workers\u2019 compensation insurer to Yanni\u2019s employer, Legion Insurance Company, was declared insolvent. We are called upon in this case to determine whether the PCIGC is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>\u201cinsurer\u201d and subject to the assessment of penalties under Section 9-728 of the Labor and Employment Article; whether the penalties fall within Section 9\u2014301(d) of the Insurance Article\u2019s definition of a \u201ccovered claim\u201d which the PCIGC is required to consider; and whether the PCIGC is immune from the assessment of penalties under Section 9-314 of the Insurance Article, Maryland Code (1995, 1997 RepLVol.), and Section 5-412 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (1974, 2002 RepLVol.).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">We shall hold that the PCIGC is not obligated to pay the late-payment penalties assessed against it by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission because it is not an \u201cinsurer,\u201d the penalties do not constitute part of Yanni\u2019s \u201ccovered claim,\u201d and because the PCIGC is immune from the imposition of penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">On October 19, 2000, Peter L. Yanni, employed with MTI Technology Corporation (\u201cMTI\u201d) as a Customer Service Engineer, sustained an injury when a piece of equipment on which he was working began to fall, causing him to twist and wrench his back, for which he subsequently filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation. MTI was insured for such claims by Legion Insurance Company (\u201cLegion\u201d), which was declared insolvent in July of 2003. PCIGC subsequently assumed responsibility for Yanni\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">On September 29, 2004, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, after conducting a hearing on Yanni\u2019s claim, determined that Yanni had sustained an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment. The Commission awarded Yanni $211.00 in weekly wages, to be paid for 75 weeks, for permanent partial disability, commencing when his temporary total disability terminated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Yanni also was awarded $3,165.00 in attorneys\u2019 fees and $528.00 for medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>When the PCIGC failed to timely pay the award, Yanni filed issues<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \"with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, requesting that penalties be assessed against the PCIGC pursuant to Section 9-728 of the Labor and Employment Article, Maryland Code (1991). At the hearing on Yanni\u2019s request for penalties, both parties stipulated to the fact that Yanni\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation award was not paid until November 23, 2004, and the attorneys\u2019 fees until November 29, almost sixty days after the issuance of the award. The Commission ordered PCIGC to pay Yanni penalties in the amount of 35% of his workers\u2019 compensation award, but did not award additional penalties for the delayed payment of attorneys\u2019 fees. Yanni\u2019s counsel subsequently wrote the Commission inquiring into whether they had inadvertently neglected to assess that penalty in its Order; the Commission responded by issuing a new Order, \u201crescinding and annulling\u201d its earlier order and denying Yanni\u2019s request for any penalties. Yanni filed a second set of issues with the Commission, again requesting penalties against the PCIGC for the late payment of his award and attorney\u2019s fees. A second hearing was held before the Commission, after which the Commission ordered the PCIGC to pay Yanni penalties in the amount of 35% of the original award, plus $500.00 in additional attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">The PCIGC petitioned the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for judicial review of the penalties and subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment, to which Yanni responded by filing a cross-motion for summary judgment. The Circuit Court granted summary judgment to Yanni. The PCIGC noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals presenting one question for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Is the property and casualty insurance guaranty corporation subject to the assessment of a fine for late payment of benefits under \u00a7 9-728 of the Labor and Employment Article?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court, we issued a 'writ of certiorari on our own initiative. <em>Prop. Guaranty v. Yanni, </em>394 Md. 479, 906 A.2d 942 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">In this case we are called upon to determine whether the trial judge properly granted summary judgment to Yanni. The entry of summary judgment is governed by Maryland Rule 2-501, which provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">(f) Entry of judgment. The court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Maryland Rule 2-501(f). We recently explicated the standard of review for the entry of summary judgment in <em>River Walk Apartments, LLC v. Roger Twigg, </em>396 Md. 527, 914 A.2d 770 (2007):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">The question of whether the trial court properly granted summary judgment is a question of law and is subject to <em>de novo </em>review on appeal. <em>Standard Fire Ins.

In conducting statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always to \u201cto discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules.\u201d <em>In re Kaela C., </em>394 Md. 432, 468, 906 A.2d 915, 936 (2006); quoting <em>General Motors Corp. v. Seay, </em>388 Md. 341, 352, 879 A.2d 1049, 1055 (2005) quoting in turn <em>Davis, </em>383 Md. at 605, 861 A.2d at 81; <em>City of Frederick v. Pickett, </em>392 Md. 411, 427, 897 A.2d 228, 237 (2006). We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that \u201c \u2018no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory\u2019.\u201d <em>In re Kaela C., </em>394 Md. at 468, 906 A.2d at 936; <em>Mayor &amp; Town Council of Oakland v. Mayor &amp; Town Council of Mountain Lake Park, </em>392 Md. 301, 316, 896 A.2d 1036, 1045 (2006); <em>Kane v.

Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>356 Md. 180, 194, 738 A.2d 856, 860-61, 863 (1999). If that language is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends. <em>City of Frederick, </em>392 Md. at 427, 897 A.2d at 237; <em>Davis, </em>383 Md. at 605, 861 A.2d at 81. If however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous, and we resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose. <em>In re Kaela C., </em>394 Md. at 468, 906 A.2d at 936; <em>Mayor of Oakland, </em>392 Md. at 316, 896 A.2d at 1045; <em>Canaj, Inc. v.

Created by the General Assembly in 1971 as the Maryland Insurance Guaranty Association, the PCIGC was originally structured as a nonprofit, unincorporated legal entity, emulating a model act proposed in 1969 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners which was adopted by over forty states. <em>Ins. Comm\u2019r of State v. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Guar. Corp., </em>313 Md. 518, 522 n. 2, 546 A.2d 458, 460 n. 2 (1988); <em>A.S. Abell Publishing Co. v. Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. 26, 32, 464 A.2d 1068, 1071 (1983). In 1986, the General Assembly made substantial changes to the Maryland Insurance Guaranty Association by renaming it the Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Corporation, designating it as a nonprofit, nonstock corporation, declaring that it was not an agency or instrumentality of the State, and changing the process for the selection of its Board of Directors. 1986 Md.

Maryland Code (1995, 2003 RepLVol.), Sections 9-303, 9-304(b) and 9-306(d) of the Insurance Article. Each member insurer is assessed an annual fee by the PCIGC to cover its expenses in paying covered claims of insolvent insurance companies. Maryland Code (1995, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Sections 9-304(b) and 9-306(d) of the Insurance Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">In this case, Yanni contends that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission rightfully assessed late-payment fees against the PCIGC because it is an \u201cinsurer,\u201d as the term is used in Section 9-728 of the Labor and Employment Article, as evidenced by Section 9-306(c) of the Insurance Article, which states that it \u201cshall be deemed the insurer to the extent of the Corporation\u2019s obligations on the covered claims and, to that extent, shall have the same rights, duties, and obligations that the insolvent insurer would have.\u201d Maryland Code (1995, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Section 9-306(c) of the Insurance Article. Yanni further argues our decision in <em>Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v. Danner, </em>388 Md. 649, 882 A.2d 271 (2005), that the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund (\u201cUEF\u201d)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> was not an insurer is not persuasive because the PCIGC is a completely different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>creature from the UEF\u2014the UEF is a state agency, and its funds are maintained by the State. Yanni also alleges that the PCIGC is an insurer because it is statutorily required to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Yanni argues that the PCIGC is obligated to pay the late-payment penalties because they represent a portion of the unpaid obligation for compensation owed by the insolvent insurer. Yanni further maintains that to grant the PCIGC immunity from late-payment penalties is inconsistent with the PCIGC\u2019s statutory purpose, citing <em>Callaghan v. Rhode Island Occupational Info. Coordinating Comm./Indus. Educational, </em>704 A.2d 740 (R.I. 1997), which upheld a late-payment penalty against the state\u2019s insurers\u2019 insolvency fund, despite the fund\u2019s immunity against liability, on the ground that the penalty ensured that the fund discharged its obligations in a timely manner. Yanni contends that, such broad immunity would abrogate claimants\u2019 right to timely payment and leave them without any alternative remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Conversely, the PCIGC argues that, under our holding in <em>Danner, </em>388 Md. at 649, 882 A.2d at 271, it does not constitute an \u201cinsurer\u201d for purposes of Section 9-728 of the Labor and Employment Article. The PCIGC also maintains that, under Section 9-302 of the Insurance Article,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it is only permitted to pay \u201ccovered claims,\u201d which does not include the penalties explicated in Section 9-728 of the Labor and Employment Article. The PCIGC also alleges that it is immune from the assessment of penalties under Section 9-314 of the Insurance Article and 5-412 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which grant it immunity from liability, and under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Section 9-312 of the Insurance Article, which grants it immunity from taxes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The PCIGC is statutorily obligated to pay the \u201ccovered claims\u201d of insolvent member</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">insurance companies that amount to more than $100 and less than $300,000, to the extent of the covered claims existing on or before the determination of insolvency or arising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">(i) 30 days after t he determination o f insolvency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">(ii) before the policy expiration date, if that date is less than 30 days after the determination of insolvency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-9\">(iii) before the insured replaces the policy or causes its cancellation, if the insured does so within 30 days after the determination of insolvency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">Maryland Code (1995, 2003 RepLVol.), Sections 9-306(a)(l) &amp; (2) of the Insurance Article. With regards to workers\u2019 compensation claims, however, the PCIGC \u201cshall pay the <em>full amount </em>of any covered claim <em>arising out of </em>a workers\u2019 compensation policy.\u201d Maryland Code (1995, 2003 RepLVol.), Section 9-306(a)(2) of the Insurance Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">In order to execute its statutory duty to assume the \u201ccovered claims\u201d of insolvent insurers, the PCIGC is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALP\">deemed the insurer to the extent of the Corporation\u2019s obligation on the covered claims and, to that extent, shall have the rights, duties, and obligations that the insolvent insurer would have had if the insurer had not become insolvent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">Maryland Code (1995, 2003 RepLVol.), Section 9-306(c). One of the obligations of a workers\u2019 compensation insurer, such as Legion in the present case, is the prompt payment of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>award, as required by Section 9-727 of the Labor and Employment Article, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-4\">The employer or its <em>insurer </em>shall begin paying compensation to the covered employee within 15 days after the later of the date:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">(1) an award is made; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">(2) payment of an award is due.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Maryland Code (1999), Section 9-727 of the Labor and Employment Article. If payments are not timely made, Section 9-728 provides for the assessment of fines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">(a) <em>Within 15 </em>days.\u2014If the Commission finds that an employer or its insurer has failed, without good cause, to begin paying an award within 15 days after the later of the date that the award is issued or the date that payment of the award is due, the Commission shall assess against the employer or its insurer a fine not exceeding 20% of the amount of the payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">(b) <em>Within 30 </em>days.\u2014If the Commission finds that an employer or its insurer has failed, without good cause, to begin paying an award within 30 days after the later of the date that the award is issued or the date that payment of the award is due, the Commission shall assess against the employer or its insurer a fine not exceeding 40% of the amount of payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">Maryland Code (1999), Section 9-728 of the Labor and Employment Article (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">This Court has had occasion to examine what constitutes an \u201cinsurer\u201d for purposes of Section 9-728 of the Labor and Employment Article in <em>Danner, </em>388 Md. at 649, 882 A.2d at 271. We began our analysis by noting that, although not defined in Subtitle Seven of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u201cinsurer\u201d is defined in other subtitles. <em>Id. </em>at 669, 882 A.2d at 283. We looked to the Act\u2019s definition of an \u201cauthorized insurer\u201d in Subtitle Four as \u201ca stock corporation or mutual association that is authorized under the Insurance Article to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance in the State,\u201d quot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>ing Section 9-401 (b) of the Labor and Employment Article, and also to the definition of \u201cinsurer\u201d in Subtitle Three as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afe\">(i) a stock corporation or mutual association[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] that is authorized under the Insurance Article to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance in the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">(ii) the Injured Workers\u2019 Insurance Fund;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">(iv) a governmental self-insurance group[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] that meets the requirements of Title 25, Subtitle 3 of the Insurance Article; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">(v) an individual employer that self-insurers in accordance with \u00a7 9-405 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-8\"><em>Id., </em>quoting Section 9-316(a) of the Labor and Employment Article. We held that the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund was not an \u201cinsurer\u201d because it did not fall within any of the enumerated definitions but, was, rather, a state entity that did not operate for profit, as would a mutual association or corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 669, 882 A.2d at 283. Thus, it could not be assessed late fees under Section 9-728 of the Insurance Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Although Yanni is correct in pointing out that the PCIGC is structurally different from the UEF, it still does not meet the definition of \u201cinsurer\u201d provided in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The PCIGC is a nonstock, nonprofit corporation, rather than a for-profit stock corporation, mutual association, governmental self-insurance group, or an individual employer that self-insures. Nor is the PCIGC the Injured Workers\u2019 Insurance Fund. Further, the PCIGC does not issue workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies to employers. Instead, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>PCIGC is limited in its functions to paying \u201ccovered claims\u201d of insolvent insurers and assessing member insurers annual fees to cover the cost of its statutory duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Yanni, nonetheless, asserts that the late-payment penalties assessed against the PCIGC represent a portion of his \u201ccovered claim\u201d to render it liable for those penalties.

Although the penalties were to be paid directly to Yanni, they are not part of the original claim amount, but, rather, constitute an additional payment, above and beyond the original claim award. Thus, based on the plain language of Section 9-301(d) of the Insurance Article, late fees assessed under Section 9-728 of the Labor and Employment Article do not constitute part of the \u201ccovered claim,\u201d and the PCIGC is not obligated to pay them. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1995, 2003 RepLVol.), Section 9-306(a)(2) of the Insurance Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Although it is unnecessary for us to decide the other preserved issue of whether the PCIGC is immune from the assessment of fees in light of our determination that the PCIGC is not an \u201cinsurer\u201d and that the penalties are not part of Yanni\u2019s \u201ccovered claim,\u201d we nonetheless shall reach the immunity issue because it raises an important issue; an issue which may continue to arise in the PCIGC\u2019s performance of its statutory duty to pay covered claims.

Both Sections 9-314 of the Insurance Article and Section 5-412 of the Courts and Judicial Proceeding Article grant the PCIGC immunity from <em>liability </em>arising out of its performance of its statutory duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Liability is not defined in either the Insurance Article or Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article; nor is there any legislative history to shed light on the term. It is, however, defined in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary as a \u201clegal responsibility to another or to society, enforceable by civil remedy or criminal punishment,\u201d and as \u201cthe opposite of <em>immunity. </em>\u201d <em>Id., </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 932 (8th ed.2004), quoting William R. Anson, <em>Principles of the Law of Contract </em>9 (Arthur L. Corbin ed., 3d Am. ed.1919) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We explored the PCIGC\u2019s immunity from liability in <em>A.S. Abell Publishing Co., </em>297 Md. at 26, 464 A.2d at 1068, and determined that the Maryland Insurance Guaranty Association, the PCIGC\u2019s predecessor, was an agency or instrumentality of the State, such that it was required to disclose certain requested documents under the Public Information Act, and remanded the case for further proceedings. We held, however, that on remand, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs could not be awarded against MIGA under Section 5(b)(6) of Article 76A, the Public Information Act, Maryland Code (1957, 1980 Repl. Vol.).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">Ordinarily, a specific enactment prevails over an incompatible general enactment in the same or another statute.[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Additionally, Art. 48A, \u00a7 11<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> specifically provides that the provisions of Article 48A shall prevail over other statutory provisions relating to insurance matters. Accordingly, Article 48A, \u00a7 517,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> granting immunity from liability to MIGA and its agents, prevails over Article 76A, \u00a7 5(b)(6), permitting the assessment of attorney fees and costs in cases under the Public Information Act. Similarly, Article 48A, \u00a7 517 prevails over Md.Code (1974, 1980 Rep. Vol.), \u00a7 7-104(a)(1) and (2) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> permitting the assessment of appellate costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>against a State agency. Under these circumstances, there shall be no allocation of appellate costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 40-41, 464 A.2d 1068 (citations omitted). Thus, we interpreted MIGA\u2019s immunity from <em>liability </em>to include immunity from costs, and concluded that the specific provisions of Section 517 of Article 48A, the predecessor to Section 5^12 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, prevailed over the provisions for the assessment of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs of the Public Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Although the PCIGC has been restructured so that it may no longer be considered an agency or instrumentality of the State,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the <em>Abell Publishing </em>rationale remains applicable. Thus, applying our jurisprudence in <em>Abell Publishing </em>to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Corporation is immune under the specific provisions of Section 9-314 of the Insurance Article and Section 5-412 of the Courts and' Judicial Proceedings Article, which prevail over the general penalty provisions of Section 9-728 of the Labor and Employment Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">When faced with a similar issue, the Colorado Court of Appeals has reached the same conclusion. In <em>Mosley v. Industrial Claim Appeals </em>Office, 119 P.3d 576 (Colo.Ct.App.2005), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>2005 WL 2064906 (Colo.2005), the Colorado Court of Appeals explored whether the State\u2019s Insurance Guaranty Association\u2019s (\u201cCIGA\u201d) immunity clause shielded it from paying late-payment penalties assessed under Section 8-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>43-304(1) of the Colorado Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. CIGA\u2019s immunity statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">There shall be no liability on the part of, and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against, any member insurer, the association or its agents or employees, the board of directors, or the commissioner or his representatives for any action taken by them in the performance of their powers and duties under this part 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Colorado Revised Statutes (1971), Section 10-4-517. The court concluded that CIGA\u2019s immunity provision prevailed over the penalty provision of the Colorado Workers\u2019 Compensation Act because, following well-established rules of statutory interpretation, \u201cto the extent there is any conflict between the two statutory provisions, \u00a7 10-4-517, as the more specific and later-enacted statute, controls.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579. The court further explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">This interpretation of the statute furthers, rather than hampers, the legislative purpose of \u00a7 10-4-502, which is to avoid \u201cexcessive delay in payment and financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer.\u201d Indeed, the consequences of adopting claimant\u2019s statutory construction would be directly contrary to the purposes of the CIGA Act because requiring CIGA to pay penalties for post insolvency acts would result in <em>increased premiums for individual policyholders </em>and <em>depletion of CIGA funds to pay for covered claims </em>of all claimants whose insurers had become insolvent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 580 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">In <em>Caulfield v. Leonard, </em>676 So.2d 1117 (La.Ct.App.1996), the Louisiana Court of Appeals reached a similar conclusion when it was called upon to also address the issue of whether the Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association\u2019s (\u201cLIGA\u201d) was immune from late-payment penalties under Section 12:1220(B)(2) of the Louisiana Revised Statutes Annotated. Section 12:1220 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">A.

Any insurer who breaches these duties <em>shall be liable for any damages sustained as a result of the breach.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\">B. Any of the following acts, if knowingly committed or performed by an insurer, constitutes a breach of the insurer\u2019s duties imposed by Subsection a:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">(2) Failing to pay a settlement within thirty days after an agreement is reduced to writing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">C. <em>In addition to any general or special damages </em>to which a claimant is entitled for breach of the imposed duty, the claimant may be awarded penalties assessed against the insurer in an amount not to exceed two times the damages sustained or five thousand dollars, whichever is greater....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">F. The Insurance Guaranty Association Fund ... shall not be liable for any <em>special damages </em>awarded under the provisions of this Section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1119, quoting Louisiana Revised Statutes Annotated 22:1120 (1990) (emphasis added). Section 12:1391 of the Louisiana Insurance Code, LIGA\u2019s immunity provision, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASr\">There shall be no liability on the part of and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against any member insurer, the association or its agents or employees, the board of directors, or the commissioner or his representatives for any action taken by them in the performance of their powers and duties under this Part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Louisiana Revised Statutes Annotated 12:1391 (1970, 1991 Repl. Vol.). The Louisiana court harmonized the penalties provision of Section 12:1220(B)(2) of the Insurance Code with the immunity provisions of Section 12:1391, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">La.R.S. 22:1220(F) specifically provides that LIGA is immune from an assessment of special damages. In light of LIGA\u2019s broad grant of immunity under La.R.S. 22:1391, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>La.R.S. 22:1220(F) cannot be read, by implication, as allowing the imposition of general damages and/or penalties thereunder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1120. The court noted that, \u201cto expose LIGA [to penalties] could potentially threaten the very existence of the insurance guaranty fund which has as its avowed statutory purpose the avoidance of excessive delay in payment and the avoidance of financial loss to claimants or policyholders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1120. The court therefore held that LIGA is not liable for penalties in failing to timely pay claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Yanni urges us to adopt the Rhode Island Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Callaghan v. Rhode Island Occupational Info. Coordinating Comm./Indus. Educ., </em>704 A.2d 740 (R.I.1997), which upheld a late-payment penalty against the state\u2019s insurer\u2019s insolvency fund, despite the fund\u2019s immunity against liability, on the ground that the penalty ensured that the fund discharged its obligations in a timely manner. Yanni argues that this approach provides the only remedy for claimants whose award has not been timely paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In <em>Callaghan, </em>the Supreme Court of Rhode Island addressed whether the Rhode Island Insurer\u2019s Insolvency Fund (\u201cRIIIF\u201d), which mirrors Maryland\u2019s PCIGC, was susceptible to the assessment of late-payment penalties under Section 28-33\u2014 17(f)(5) of the Rhode Island Workers\u2019 Compensation Act for the RIIIF\u2019s late payment of cost-of-living adjustments to Callaghan\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation award. Section 27-34-16 of the General Laws of Rhode Island provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">there shall be no liability on the part of, and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against, any member insurer, the fund, or its agents or employees, the board of directors, or the commissioner or his or her representative for any action taken or not taken by them in the performance of their powers and duties under this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Rhode Island General Laws (1956,1988 Repl.Vol.), Section 27-34- 16. The Rhode Island Court defined liability as \u201c \u2018a broad legal term ... [that] has been referred to as of the most comprehensive significance, including almost every character <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>of hazard or responsibility, absolute, contingent, or likely,\u2019 \u201d and determined that the RIIIF\u2019s immunity statute could not be given such a broad application because it would abrogate the fund\u2019s obligation to pay the penalties. <em>Callaghan, </em>704 A.2d at 747. The court reasoned that, to give the RIIIF such broad immunity</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">would contravene the legislative purpose behind the [RIIIF] Act, namely to provide a mechanism for the payment of covered claims under certain insurance policies to avoid excessive delay in payment and to avoid financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-6\"><em>Id. </em>In addition to being a minority view, the Rhode Island opinion is distinguishable from our jurisprudence because the opinion did not explore whether there exists an alternative remedy to the enforcement of the timely payment of insolvent insurer\u2019s covered claims, which could include the filing a complaint with the State insurance commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">We explored the authority of the Insurance Commissioner with regard to the PCIGC in <em>Insurance Commissioner of State v. Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty </em>Corporation, 313 Md. at 522-23, 546 A.2d at 460, in which claimants sought payment of their Personal Injury Protection (\u201cPIP\u201d) claims from the PCIGC when their insurance provider became insolvent. The PCIGC contended that the claims were not \u201ccovered claims\u201d and refused to pay them. The Insurance Commissioner disagreed and ordered the PCIGC to pay them. We affirmed the authority of the Commissioner, stating that, under certain circumstances, the Commissioner retained the authority to order an insurer to pay a claim, citing to specific statutory provisions of the Insurance Article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">Section 55(2)[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>] provides: \u201c[t]he Commissioner may refuse to issue or after a hearing refuse to renew, or may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>revoke or suspend an insurer\u2019s certificate of authority, in addition to other grounds therefor in this article, if the insurer: (i) Violates any provision of this article other than those as to which refusal, suspension or revocation is mandatory____(iv) Without just cause unreasonably refuses or delays payment to claimants of the amount due them.\u201d Section 55A[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>] provides: \u201cIn lieu of or in addition to revocation or suspension of an insurer\u2019s certificate of authority the Commissioner may ... (2) require that restitution be made by such insurer to any person who has suffered financial injury or damage as a result of such violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 527-28, 546 A.2d at 462-63. Thus, we held that, because the PCIGC stands in the shoes of the insurer with regard to covered claims, and it had violated the Insurance Article by failing to pay a covered claim, it was \u201ctherefore subject to the Commissioner\u2019s powers under \u00a7\u00a7 55(2)(i) and 55A.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527, 546 A.2d at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Thus, a remedy afforded to Yanni in his pursuit of the prompt payment of his \u201ccovered claim\u201d was to have filed a complaint with the Insurance Commissioner at the expiration of the fifteen-day payment period. The Commissioner would then have had the opportunity to investigate the claim and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>intervene on Yanni\u2019s behalf. This option explored in our jurisprudence was not explored by the Rhode Island court.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">We, therefore, hold that the penalties should not have been assessed against the PCIGC because it is not an \u201cinsurer\u201d for purposes of Section 9-728 of the Labor and Employment Article. We also hold that the PCIGC is not obligated to pay the late-payment penalties because the penalties do not fit within the statutory definition of \u201ccovered claims\u201d of Section 9-301(d) of the Insurance Article. Further, even if the PCIGC were an \u201cinsurer,\u201d and the penalties were part of the \u201ccovered claim,\u201d it is immune from the assessment of late-payment penalties under the provisions of Section 9-314(a) of the Insurance Article and Section 5^412 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Thus, we reverse summary judgment for Yanni and remand to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for the entry of summary judgment for PCIGC. <em>See Salamon v. Progressive Classic Ins.

Two months later, in July, 2003, Legion became insolvent, and appellant, Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Corporation (PCIGC), accepted the claim as a \u201ccovered\u201d claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>On September 29, 2004, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission entered an award directing MTI and Legion, the actual parties to the proceeding, to pay temporary total and permanent partial disability benefits to Yanni, and an attorney\u2019s fee to his attorney. Because Legion was insolvent, PCIGC had a statutory obligation under Maryland Code, \u00a7 9-306 of the Insurance Article (INS) and \u00a7 9-727 of the Labor and Employment Article (LE), to commence payment of that award within fifteen days after its entry. It failed to do so, prompting a request by Yanni and his attorney for penalties allowable under LE \u00a7 9-728. After two false starts, the Commission found that penalties were appropriate and that PCIGC was liable for the penalties, and it therefore assessed them against PCIGC. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County, on PCIGC\u2019s action for judicial review, entered summary judgment affirming the Commission order.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Though acknowledging its responsibility to pay covered claims made against an insolvent insurer within fifteen days after entry of the award, its failure to discharge that responsibility, and the authority of the Commission to award penalties for non-conformance with that obligation, PCIGC nonetheless contends that no such penalties may be awarded against it because (1) it is not an insurer, (2) a penalty assessed under LE \u00a7 9-728 does not constitute a \u201ccovered claim\u201d for which it is liable, and (3) even if it <em>is </em>an insurer and the penalty <em>is </em>a \u201ccovered claim,\u201d it has statutory immunity against liability. The Court proposes to find merit in all three of those defenses. With respect, I dissent. None of them has merit, for if any of them did, the statute directly placing on PCIGC the obligation to pay Workers\u2019 Compensation awards issued against insolvent insurers would be rendered largely toothless.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The issue here, as framed by PCIGC, is entirely one of statutory interpretation. Our goal, therefore, is to implement, not find a way to frustrate, the legislative intent. Citing INS \u00a7 9-302, the Court acknowledges that PCIGC\u2019s statutory purpose is \u201cto provide a mechanism for the <em>prompt </em>payment of covered claims under certain [insurance] policies and to avoid financial loss to residents of the State who are claimants or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>policyholders of an insolvent insurer.\u201d (Emphasis added). That, within the bounds of the law, is what the Court should strive to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">\n<em>Is PCIGC An Insurer?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Relying on <em>Uninsured Employers\u2019 v. Danner, </em>388 Md. 649, 882 A.2d 271 (2005) and a few out-of-State cases, the Court first holds that, despite a clear, unambiguous statutory provision to the contrary, PCIGC is not an insurer. In my view, <em>Danner </em>is distinguishable and the out-of-State cases do not accurately reflect the intent of the Maryland General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Like Mr. Yanni, Gerald Danner suffered a compensable accidental injury, filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and received an award. Unlike this case, however, his employer did not carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance and made no payments on the award. Danner therefore requested payment from the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund (UEF), which denied the request. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission thereafter ordered the Fund to pay the award, as well as a penalty and attorney\u2019s fee. On judicial review, we upheld the order to pay the benefits under the award but reversed the order to pay the penalty and attorney\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">We are not concerned here with the discussion regarding the Fund\u2019s obligation to pay the basic benefits provided for in the award, but rather the reason why we held that the Fund was not liable for the penalty. That also was a matter of statutory construction. LE \u00a7 9-728\u2014the statute that allows the Commission to assess penalties for late payment of awards\u2014permits the Commission to assess a penalty if it finds that \u201can employer <em>or its insurer\u201d </em>has failed, without good cause, to begin paying an award within the time allotted. (Emphasis added). The Fund was certainly not Danner\u2019s employer; the question was whether it qualified as the employer\u2019s insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The term \u201cinsurer\u201d is not defined in \u00a7 9-728 or, indeed, anywhere in subtitle 7 of title 9. In the absence of any directly controlling statute, we looked to two other sections of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law\u2014LE \u00a7 9-401(b) and LE \u00a7 9-316(a)(3). Section 9-401(b), which is part of the subtitle dealing with the requirement of insurance coverage, defines \u201cauthorized insurer\u201d as a stock corporation or mutual insurer that is authorized to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance in the State, a governmental self-insurance group, a self-insurance group of private employers that meets certain statutory requirements, or an individual employer that self-insures in conformance with LE \u00a7 9-405. Section 9-316(a)(3), which permits the Commission to collect a tax from insurers to defray the expenses of the Commission, defines \u201cinsurer\u201d for that purpose in much the same way as \u00a7 9-401(b). The UEF, we held, did not fit within either of those definitions, and we therefore concluded, in the absence of any other statute that might bring it within the ambit of an insurer, it could not be considered one. Because it was neither an employer nor an insurer, it was not an entity against which a penalty could be assessed under LE \u00a7 9-728.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">In marked contrast to the situation with respect to UEF, PCIGC <em>is </em>defined as an insurer, for the very purpose at issue here. PCIGC is created and its duties are defined in title 9, subtitle 3 of the Insurance Article. Title 9 deals with impaired insurance entities; subtitle 3 provides for PCIGC. Unlike UEF, PCIGC is a private corporation, not a State agency. INS \u00a7 9-306(a) provides that, except as to surety bonds, PCIGC is obligated to the extent of covered claims existing on or before the determination of insolvency and, within certain dollar limits, requires it to \u201cpay the full amount of any covered claim arising out of a workers\u2019 compensation policy.\u201d Of particular relevance and, to me, of governing importance in this regard, \u00a7 9-306(c) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">\u201c[PCIGC] shall be deemed the insurer to the extent of the Corporation\u2019s obligation on the covered claims and, to that extent, <em>shall have the </em>rights, <em>duties, and obligations </em>that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the insolvent insurer would have had if the insurer had not become insolvent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Unlike the situation in <em>Danner, </em>we do not need to go hunting for definitions of \u201cinsurer\u201d in other parts of the Labor and Employment Article that have nothing directly to do with PCIGC to determine whether PCIGC falls within them. The statute that creates PCIGC and sets forth its functions and obligations makes it an \u201cinsurer\u201d for this very purpose and expressly imposes on it the duties and obligations that the insolvent insurer (Legion) would have had if it had not become insolvent. That, alone, renders the holding in <em>Danner </em>and the analysis underlying that holding inapposite. To the extent that the penalty assessed by the Commission constitutes part of a \u201ccovered claim,\u201d PCIGC clearly is an insurer and therefore falls within the ambit of LE \u00a7 9-728. None of the out-of-State cases relied upon by the Court dictate a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">\n<em>Covered Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The Court seeks to avoid the otherwise unambiguous application of INS \u00a7 9-306(c) by concluding that a penalty assessed pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-728 does not constitute a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d It notes that INS \u00a7 9-301(d), in relevant part, defines \u201ccovered claim\u201d as \u201can insolvent insurer\u2019s unpaid obligation\u201d that \u201carises out of a policy of the insolvent insurer issued to a resident or payable to a resident on behalf of an insured of the insolvent insurer.\u201d It then concludes that penalties assessed by the Commission under LE \u00a7 9-728 are statutory in nature and do not arise out of a policy of the insolvent insurer and, for that reason, do not constitute \u201ccovered claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">That, to me, is an unduly narrow construction that is wholly inconsistent with the legislative intent and, indeed, the whole purpose of PCIGC. PCIGC stands in the shoes of the insolvent insurer and is obligated to pay claims that, but for its insolvency, the employer\u2019s insurer would be obligated under its policy to pay. As this Court has confirmed on a number of occasions, \u201cMaryland adheres to the general rule that parties to a contract are presumed to contract mindful of the existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>law and that all applicable or relevant laws must be read into the agreement of the parties just as if expressly provided by them, except where a contrary intention is evident.\u201d <em>Wright v. Commercial &amp; Sav. Bank, </em>297 Md. 148, 153, 464 A.2d 1080, 1083 (1983); <em>Auction &amp; Estate Representatives, Inc. v. Ashton, </em>354 Md. 333, 344, 731 A.2d 441, 447 (1999); <em>Lema v. Bank of America, </em>375 Md. 625, 645, 826 A.2d 504, 516 (2003). That includes, in this instance, the requirement in LE \u00a7 9-727 that insurers commence payment of awards within fifteen days, and, in my view, it would also include the obligation to pay any penalty assessed under LE \u00a7 9-728 on account of the insurer\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">The penalty provision in \u00a7 9-728 is not in the nature of an insurance regulation. It cannot be, because the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission has no authority to regulate insurance companies. It is, rather, a mechanism to enforce an obligation that all workers\u2019 compensation insurers have under their policies to pay awards promptly and is, by law, incorporated into every workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy. Viewed in that light, a penalty assessed for an insurer\u2019s failure to comply with its policy obligations, even though assessed pursuant to statute, must also be regarded as arising from the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">It is thus clear to me that Legion was obligated <em>under its policy </em>to pay both the award made to Mr. Yanni in accordance with LE \u00a7 9-727, and any penalties assessed under LE \u00a7 9-728 by reason of its failure to do so. Because its liability for the penalty arises solely from its status as an insurer, it necessarily must arise \u201cout of a policy of the insolvent insurer.\u201d That makes it a covered claim, for which, in light of Legion\u2019s insolvency, PCIGC is liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">This conclusion is not just a matter of construing the words of the statutes in a proper relational way. It goes to the heart of the statutory scheme. There are only two purposes for requiring employers to be insured\u2014to assure payment of awards to injured workers and to protect employers from insolvency by reason of such awards. That is reflected in INS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>\u00a7 9-302, which states the purpose of subtitle 3 as being \u201cto provide a mechanism for <em>the prompt </em>payment of covered claims ... and to avoid financial loss to residents of the State who are claimants or policyholders of an insolvent insurer.\u201d If PCIGC were free to ignore Commission awards with impunity\u2014without being subject to the penalties allowed under LE \u00a7 9-728\u2014that statutory purpose would remain in serious jeopardy. It is of some importance that, although PCIGC is obligated to pay covered claims arising under a wide variety of casualty insurance policies, the Legislature saw fit, in INS \u00a7 9-306(a)(3), to specify, in particular, PCIGC\u2019s obligation to pay the full amount of covered claims arising out of a workers\u2019 compensation policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\n<em>Immunity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">As the third prong of its holding, the Court determines that, even if PCIGC were an insurer and even if a penalty assessed under LE \u00a7 9-728 constitutes a covered claim, PCIGC is immune from such an assessment under Maryland Code, \u00a7 5-412 of the Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Article (CJP), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atq\">\u201cThere shall be no liability on the part of and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against a member insurer, [PCIGC] or its agents or employees, the Board of Directors, or the Insurance Commissioner or the Commissioner\u2019s representatives for any action taken by them in the performance of their powers and duties under Title 9, Subtitle 3 of the Insurance Article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">In holding that the immunity provided under that section precludes the assessment of penalties against PCIGC, and thus allows it to thumb its corporate nose at its statutory obligation, the Court relies on <em>A.S. Abell Pub. Co. v. Mezzanote, 297 </em>Md. 26, 464 A.2d 1068 (1983). The principal issue in that case was whether the Maryland Insurance Guaranty Association\u2014a precursor of PCIGC\u2014was a State agency for purposes of the Public Information Act. A newspaper had filed a PIA request to inspect certain records of the Association, which was denied on the ground that the Association was not a State agency. The Circuit Court agreed. We concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>the Association was a State agency that was subject to the PIA and remanded the case to the Circuit Court for further proceedings. In doing so, we concluded that, in light of the predecessor statute to CJP \u00a7 5-412, the Association would not be liable for costs or attorneys\u2019 fees that otherwise might be assessed under the PIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">That is a far different situation than what we have here. As noted CJP \u00a7 5-412 provides immunity \u201cfor any action taken by [PCIGC or its members, directors, employees, or agents, or the Insurance Commissioner] in the performance of their powers and duties under Title 9, Subtitle 3 of the Insurance Article.\u201d A corporate decision by a hybrid guaranty entity created by statute, presumably on the advice of counsel, that it is not a State agency and therefore is not subject to the PIA may well be regarded as one that, even if later proved wrong, was nonetheless taken in the performance of its corporate powers and duties. A decision not to pay a covered claim in conformance with a clear statutory mandate is <em>not </em>one taken in the performance of its powers and duties. PCIGC has no power or duty not to pay a covered claim for which it is legally responsible. Failure to pay is not the <em>performance </em>of its duties but an unlawful defiance and disregard of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">To apply the immunity accorded in CJP \u00a7 5-412 to LE \u00a7 9-728 would be equivalent to having the tail wag the dog, for, read literally in that context, it would preclude any liability on the part of PCIGC for refusing to pay the very claims it was created to pay. The implication of such a broad reading of CJP \u00a7 5-412 is the substantial risk of leaving claimants without a source for the payment and employers subject to a liability that they may be incapable of discharging.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The Court suggests that the solution to any default by PCIGC in its obligation to pay awards entered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission in conformance with LE \u00a7 9-727 is for the claimant (or employer) to file a complaint with the Insurance Commissioner. Citing <em>Insurance Com\u2019r v. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Guar. Corp., </em>313 Md. 518, 546 A.2d 458 (1988), the Court observes that the Commissioner is empow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ered to order PCIGC to pay a disputed claim. That is true, but it is hardly an exclusive, or even a practical remedy. That case involved a dispute over whether PCIGC was responsible for paying personal injury protection claims arising under automobile insurance policies issued by insurers that had become insolvent. The issue was purely a legal, and generic, one of whether liability existed for any such claim. The Commissioner ordered PCIGC to pay the claims and, when it refused, the Commissioner, after an administrative hearing, again ordered it to pay the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The issue here is not whether PCIGC has legal liability for a class of claims. It recognized its obligation to pay Mr. Yanni\u2019s award, and it has never contested that the payment of awards must commence within fifteen days. For whatever reason, it simply failed to comply with its obligation. To require the claimant, who needs the money immediately and who, by law, is entitled to it within fifteen days, to file a complaint with the Insurance Commissioner, who knows none of the underlying facts, and go through a contested case administrative hearing, with the further prospect of judicial review in a Circuit Court, simply to have another agency do what the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission has already done, namely, order PCIGC to pay the award, makes utterly no sense. That cannot be what the General Assembly intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Chief Judge BELL authorizes me to state that he joins in the dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
