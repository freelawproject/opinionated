The theory of the prosecution was that Williams aided and abetted<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Anthony Henderson and Cheryl Gaines in the attempted armed robbery of Ahmed Hussein, the operator of a Citgo gas station and convenience store located in Baltimore County. The trial judge found Williams guilty of attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon (Count 1); attempted robbery (Count 2); assault in the first degree (Count 3); attempted theft (Count 4); use of a handgun in the commission of a felony (Count 6); and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence (Count 7). Williams was charged with, but acquitted of, wearing, carrying or transporting a handgun (Count 5)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and two counts of possession of a firearm (Counts 8 and 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">In this case, we have been asked to decide whether the Circuit Court judge rendered inconsistent verdicts when he convicted Williams of attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, assault in the first degree, and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence and a felony, but found him not guilty of wearing, carrying or transporting a handgun. We answer in the affirmative. In this case, the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>failed to acknowledge and explain the inconsistent verdicts. We therefore hold that the guilty verdicts for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, assault in the first degree, and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence and a felony must be vacated, and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">We adopt the facts as set forth by the Court of Special Appeals in its unreported opinion. <em>Williams v. State, </em>No. 2037, September Term, 2003. In addressing Williams\u2019s appeal, the intermediate appellate court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">On the morning of February 6, 2003, Ahmed Hussein was working as a cashier at the Citgo gas station and convenience store located at 620 Edmonson Avenue in Baltimore County. At approximately 6:30 a.m., a man and a woman entered the store. Hussein, who had been outside, followed them inside. At trial, Hussein testified that the man and woman were wearing masks, but it was \u201cvery cold\u201d and they said good morning so he believed that they were \u201cregular customers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">When Hussein entered the store\u2019s cashier room, the man told him to lay down. As Hussein turned around, he saw the man pointing a gun at his chest. Hussein did not lay down. Instead, he tried to close the door, but the man prevented him from doing so with his leg. The man twice told Hussein to lay down, then fired the gun at the floor, missing Hussein\u2019s feet by a few inches. After the shot was fired, the man cursed and he and the woman left the store. Hussein called the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">Mandy Thurston lives near the Citgo station. At approximately 6:30 a.m. on the morning in question, she was preparing to leave for school and went outside to warm up her car. At that time, Thurston observed a red Acura pull up in front of a bar, which was located directly across the street from Thurston\u2019s vehicle.1- ] Thurston stated that she \u201csaw a lot of movement ... in the car like they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>covering their faces.\u201d However, she could not see the individuals. The Acura then made a U-tum and drove off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">Thurston next saw a man and a woman walking up Old Edmondson Avenue toward the Citgo. According to Thurston, they did not have anything on their heads, and their faces were visible as they came up the street, although they were too far away for her to identify them. She then saw the Acura again, which backed into a parking space on the side of the bar. The man and woman exited the Citgo station and were \u201churrying\u201d toward the Acura. After they entered the vehicle, it \u201ctook off a little bit faster\u201d than Thurston had seen the car traveling previously. Thurston started to drive to school, but turned around when she saw the police heading toward the Citgo station. At the Citgo station, she gave a description of the red Acura to the police, noting that it had bumper damage to the left side of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">Detective James Bonsall testified that, on February 6, 2003, he was in plain clothes and traveling in an unmarked car, which was equipped with a blue light on the dashboard, but not a siren. At that time, he heard the broadcast for a vehicle involved in a robbery. The vehicle was described as a red, two-door Acura with silver along the bottom of the car and damage to the left rear with the bumper hanging down. A tag number was also provided. At approximately 11:46 a.m., a few miles from the Citgo, the detective observed a vehicle matching that description.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">Detective Bonsall followed the Acura and radioed for assistance. He was then advised that City police units were on the way. Detective Bonsall continued to follow the Acura while waiting for assistance. The Acura was driving normally and did not commit any traffic infractions, nor did the driver attempt to elude Bonsall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">Bonsall recalled that, after turning onto Winchester Street, the Acura traveled about a block to a block and a-half before the driver pulled the vehicle to the curb. The detective pulled over approximately three car lengths behind the Acura. The driver waited about thirty seconds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>before starting to get out of the vehicle. When the driver of the Acura appeared as if he were exiting the car, Bonsall began to get out of his vehicle. The detective crouched behind the car door and placed his hand on his weapon, but then the Acura \u201ctook off.\u201d Detective Bonsall \u201cnever reached that point where he was able to identify\u201d himself as a police officer. The detective continued to follow the vehicle. At some point, a helicopter joined the pursuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\">The Acura made a U-turn and Detective Bonsall \u201cgot a good look at the face of the driver.\u201d Although Bonsall eventually lost sight of the Acura, the police helicopter indicated that the car had stopped at the end of the 500 block of Longwood Street and that the driver had gone onto the porch of the residence at 501 Longwood Street. Although the police conducted an extensive search, the driver was not found.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">On February 7, 2003, the day after the attempted robbery, Detective Bonsall viewed a photographic array and identified [Williams] as the driver of the Acura. The detective also made an in-court identification of [Williams].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">Corporal Todd Edelin testified that the Acura was abandoned two and a-half to three miles from the Citgo station, in the 500 block of North Longwood Street in Baltimore City. He determined that the vehicle was registered to [Williams]. He showed Thurston pictures of the vehicle and she immediately stated: \u201cThat\u2019s the car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">Edelin responded to the address listed on the Acura\u2019s registration and spoke with [Williams]\u2019s mother. She confirmed that the Acura belonged to him and indicated that [Williams] had been staying with her \u201coff and on, but he had a drug problem and she hadn\u2019t seen him in awhile.\u201d Edelin obtained a search warrant for the vehicle. In the ensuing search, he recovered [WiUiam]\u2019s driver\u2019s license, a black knit hat, a black skull cap, and a pair of black cloth gloves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">[Williams] was arrested on April 3, 2003. He was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights/ ] agreed to waive those rights, and made a statement. Corporal Edelin offered the following testimony regarding [Williams]\u2019s statement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: And what, if anything did [Williams] tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">[EDELIN]: He stated that he was driving that car that day, his car, the Acura, helping two friends out. They were supposed to go to Catonsville to a house in Catonsville to get money from a friend of the co-defendant\u2019s, and when they got to the house, no one was home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">When they were driving back, he said the co-defendant wanted to stop for cigarettes at a gas station, and they stopped. He backed into a parking lot behind the gas station to do his heroin, and the two passengers got out and went into the gas station, came back, and then they went back to Longwood....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: What did he tell you happened when they got back to Longwood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">[EDELIN]: He said, when they were back at Longwood, the two got into an argument over what happened at the gas station.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: When you say the two, who do you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">[EDELIN]: Anthony Henderson, the codefendant, and Cheryl Gaines, the female girlfriend of Anthony Henderson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-11\">He said they got into an argument about what went on at the gas station. She was asking why he did that, and then the defendant asked\u2014said he asked what went on, and they told him that they went in to get money and the gun went off accidentally, and he said he freaked out and basically said he didn\u2019t know anything happened when he was at the gas station until afterward back at Longwood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: What did he [Williams] tell you Tony Henderson was trying to do in the store?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-13\">[EDELIN]: He said initially he was to get cigarettes, but when he found out back at the house, he said he went to get money to help him, to help the defendant out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: What did that mean? Did he say what that meant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">[EDELIN]: His drug problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">[Williams] also informed the corporal that Henderson had been arrested at 525 Longwood Street and that the police had recovered a handgun. [Williams] believed it was the gun used at the Citgo Station. Williams stated that, prior to the armed robbery, he had seen Henderson on Longwood Street with the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Further, Williams informed Corporal Edelin that, following the attempted robbery, he was driving the Acura when he realized he was being followed by a green car driven by a white male. At that point, [Williams] pulled over. The white male also pulled over and got out of the vehicle. According to [Williams], the white male \u201cpulled a gun on\u201d him so he jumped back in his car and sped away. Williams stated that he did not know that the white male was a police officer; he explained that he thought that someone was pulling a gun on him, because he was in an open-air drug market where a lot of criminal activity occurred. [Williams] drove to the 500 block of North Longwood Street, got out of his car, walked up the alley, and entered the residence at 501 North Longwood Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">After interviewing [Williams], Corporal Edelin confirmed that Henderson had been arrested in Baltimore City. Henderson\u2019s residence, 525 North Longwood Street, was searched by Baltimore City Police detectives and a 9 millimeter semiautomatic Beretta was recovered. Baltimore County Police had recovered bullet fragments from the floor of the cashier\u2019s room in the Citgo station, and ballistics tests determined that the bullet fired in the store came from that Beretta.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">Williams testified in his own defense. He stated that, on the morning in question, he parked his car and Henderson and Gaines got out to buy cigarettes at the convenience store. [Williams] moved his car because he was \u201cgoing to use drugs.\u201d Henderson and Gaines went into the Citgo Station, then came back to his car. They were not running <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>and were not wearing masks. In addition, they had cigarettes in their possession and did not tell him that they had robbed the Citgo Station.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">[Williams] drove back to Longwood Street, arriving there at about 6:50 a.m. He recalled that Gaines \u201cwas scared\u201d and she asked Henderson \u201cwhy did he do that[?]\u201d The three went into the house, where Henderson informed [Williams] that he had robbed the Citgo station. [Williams] and Henderson argued and [Williams] eventually drove towards his mother\u2019s residence. [Williams] explained that his mother is a Baltimore City Police Officer and he intended to ask her for advice. While en route to his mother\u2019s residence, Detective Bonsall began to follow [Williams],</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Williams said he pulled over on Winchester Street, but when he started to get out of the Acura, he looked in his side view mirror and saw that the detective was also exiting his vehicle. When [Williams] observed the detective \u201cgoing for a gun,\u201d he \u201cpulled off.\u201d [Williams] stated that he did not hear any sirens or see any emergency lights. In addition, he did not hear the police helicopter until he exited his vehicle. Later, [Williams] left his Acura on Longwood Street and went to a friend\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">[Williams] added that Henderson had shown him the handgun prior to the attempted robbery. He also acknowledged that he saw the weapon again after the incident, when the group returned to Longwood Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">In reaching its verdict, the trial court stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">There is no question this is a close case, but there is no question in the court\u2019s mind that [Williams] was present. He admits he was present. His conduct is that of a person with consciousness of guilt. That is the disturbing thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">And his conduct, even prior to the event, is indicative of complicity in the events. The witness sees some covert activity in the car, some apparent attempt, according to her, gestures and so forth, apparent attempts to cover up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>partially, if not wholly conceal the identity of the two persons that got out of the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">Going for cigarettes, why not park on the parking lot of the Citgo Station? Why park covertly in a hidden fashion, backing into a parking space behind the station where the passengers have to go through a fence in order to get to the store? If you are just going to buy cigarettes, you pull into the gas station. That is the kind of thing that makes his story just not quite buyable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">He is an almost believable witness. He testifies with a great deal of assurance with what happened. He seems cooperative with the police. That is much in his favor. There is no question about that, but I think at that point, he is trying to figure out a way, having sat in the car for several hours, how am I going to get out of this, how am I going to get out of this[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">He is trying to say, well, what I have to do is I have to own up to everything and I have to let them know who the perpetrator was and cooperate with them and maybe I will be believed that I didn\u2019t have any knowledge of it before hand. And you are close to that point, Mr. Williams, but not quite close enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">The court believes that you were knowledgeable about the events, that you were complicit in the events and that you are guilty of aiding and abetting in the commission of this attempted robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">The count, first count of attempted armed robbery is sustained. I find the defendant guilty of that because of his position as an aider and abettor. With respect to the remaining counts, robbery, of course, would merge into armed robbery or attempted armed robbery, as would assault. Theft is an element of robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-10\">\n<em>Now, the handgun in the vehicle, I don\u2019t think there is sufficient evidence to establish that he carried the weapon in his vehicle. I think that the perpetrator, the co-defendant, was the person that was carrying the </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>\n<em>weapon. It is a bit of a stretch to find him guilty of the handgun in the vehicle charge.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">Certainly, there is no question that a handgun was used. A handgun was discharged, and to the extent he had knowledge of the events about to take place or that did take place in the event, he is equally guilty of that, as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Without explanation or comment, the court also found appellant not guilty of the two counts of unlawfully possessing a regulated firearm [Counts 8 and 9],</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The court then summarized its rulings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">So, recapping, count one, guilty; countfs] two, three and four, merged; count five, not guilty; count six, guilty. I guess technically seven would be equally guilty, although it is just merged for sentencing purposes. Eight and nine, not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">The Court of Special Appeals compared the \u201cuse\u201d of a handgun to the \u201cpossession\u201d of a handgun and determined that the Legislature intended \u201cuse\u201d to be something more than \u201cpossession\u201d\u2014an active, rather than passive operation or employment of a handgun. In reviewing the trial court\u2019s findings, the Court of Special Appeals held that it was \u201cunable to conclude that the verdicts were not inconsistent.\u201d It continued: \u201cIf [Williams] was found to have used the handgun in the commission of the robbery, he must also have possessed the handgun. This is especially so in light of the trial court\u2019s findings that [Williams]\u2019s conduct, \u2018even prior to the event, is indicative of complicity in the events.\u2019\u201d The intermediate appellate court acknowledged that there existed no evidence that Williams actually possessed the handgun but noted that his convictions were not based on his actual use of the handgun; they were based on Henderson\u2019s use of the handgun and Williams\u2019s complicity in Henderson\u2019s actions. The court explained that before Williams could use the gun, he had to have possessed it and the trial court failed to explain that inconsistency. As such, the Court of Special Appeals reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Williams\u2019s convictions for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, assault in the first degree, and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence and a felony. It affirmed all of the other verdicts and remanded the case to the Circuit Court for a new sentencing. Subsequently, the State filed a petition for writ of certiorari<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in this Court, which we granted. <em>State v. Williams, </em>390 Md. 284, 888 A.2d 341 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The State contends that the Court of Special Appeals incorrectly determined that the verdicts were inconsistent because this Court has held that, in Maryland, the common law doctrine of accessoryship is applicable solely to felonies. The State cites <em>State v. Ward, </em>284 Md. 189, 396 A.2d 1041 (1978), for this principle, and then explains that, in contrast, there is no accessoryship for misdemeanors because all participants are principals. <em>See State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 604 A.2d 489 (1992). The State posits that because of this distinction, the intermediate appellate court erred in determining that the trial court\u2019s verdicts were inconsistent. The State concedes that \u201cthe Court of Special Appeals was correct as to Williams\u2019s convictions for the merged misdemeanor offenses of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony and in the commission of a crime of violence____\u201d The State argues, however, that the intermediate appellate court \u201cwas incorrect as to Williams\u2019s conviction of the felonies of attempted armed robbery and first degree assault ... [because] [t]he Court of Special Appeals failed to recognize that, in regard to felonies, one may be culpable as an accomplice, while, for misdemeanors, the offender must be a first degree principal.\u201d The State notes that Williams admitted to driving Henderson and Gaines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>to the gas station, acknowledged that Henderson and Gaines attempted to rob Mr. Hussein at gunpoint, and that he then drove Henderson and Gaines away from the scene after the crime. Therefore, the State argues, the evidence fully supported the trial court\u2019s verdicts. The State avers that because the trial court determined that Williams was not a principal as to the handgun possession count but was guilty of attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon and assault in the first degree as an aider and abettor, the verdicts are in no way inconsistent. Accordingly, the State requests that this Court reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals in order to uphold and reinstate the trial court\u2019s convictions of Williams for the two felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Williams evaluates the State\u2019s claims and argues that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEA\">[t]he State simply cannot have it both ways. If the trial [courtj\u2019s acquittal of the handgun possession charge was, as the State concedes, inconsistent with its finding of guilt as to the use of a handgun charges, it must also be inconsistent with the attempted armed robbery and first degree assault regardless of principalship and accessory law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Williams explains that the trial court rendered inconsistent verdicts in this case and that such verdicts are not tolerated in bench trials. To support this proposition, Williams cites several Maryland cases including <em>Shell v. State, </em>307 Md. 46, 512 A.2d 358 (1986), and <em>Stuckey v. State, </em>141 Md.App. 143, 784 A.2d 652 (2001), where this Court and the intermediate appellate court, respectively, determined that the verdicts of guilty were inconsistent and that the inconsistent verdicts of guilty could not stand. Williams argues that proof that he possessed a handgun was required before the court could convict him of using a handgun and attempting to commit a robbery with a handgun. As such, and in accordance with <em>Shell </em>and <em>Stuckey, </em>the trial court\u2019s act of acquitting Williams of wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun precluded the court from finding Williams guilty of the following crimes: using a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence and a felony, attempting to commit a robbery using that handgun, and assault in the first degree using that handgun. Williams also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>contends that the trial judge failed to explain the inconsistency and that, therefore, the inconsistent verdicts cannot stand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Williams concludes that the only appropriate remedy is to reverse or vacate the inconsistent verdicts of guilty as the Court of Special Appeals did in its unreported opinion. We agree with Williams and the Court of Special Appeals that the convictions for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, assault in the first degree, and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence and a felony are inconsistent with the acquittal for wearing, carrying or transporting a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\n<em>Inconsistent Verdicts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Verdicts are inconsistent if they are \u201c[Hacking consistency; not compatible with another fact or claim.\u201d BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 781 (8th ed.1999). It has been the position of this Court that inconsistent verdicts in jury trials are permissible in criminal cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Galloway v. State, </em>371 Md. 379, 408, 809 A.2d 653, 671 (2002); <em>Hoffert v. State, </em>319 Md. 377, 384, 572 A.2d 536, 540 (1990); <em>Shell, </em>307 Md. at 54, 512 A.2d at 362; <em>Johnson v. State, </em>238 Md. 528, 541, 209 A.2d 765, 771 (1965). In <em>Hoffert, </em>319 Md. at 384, 572 A.2d at 540, we stated that, in criminal cases, \u201cinconsistent verdicts by a jury \u2018are normally tolerated....\u2019\u201d and explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">[t]his is so because of \u201cthe unique role of the jury, and has no impact whatsoever upon the substantive law explicated by the Court.\u201d Due to the singular role of the jury in the criminal justice system, \u201cthere is a reluctance to interfere with the results of unknown jury interplay, at least without proof of \u2018actual irregularity.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">(citations omitted). In <em>Galloway, </em>this Court explained the rationale for this principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">[Cjonvictions based on inconsistent jury verdicts are tolerated because of the singular role of the jury in the criminal justice system.... The general view is that inconsistencies may be the product of lenity, mistake, or a compromise to reach unanimity, and that continual correction of such matters would undermine the historic role of the jury as the arbiter of questions put to it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">371 Md. at 408, 809 A.2d at 671 (citing <em>United States v. Powell, </em>469 U.S. 57, 105 S.Ct. 471, 83 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984)). Notwithstanding, it is also well settled in Maryland \u201cthat inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>verdicts of guilty and not guilty, by a trial judge at a nonjury trial, are not ordinarily permitted.\u201d <em>State v. Anderson, </em>320 Md. 17, 29, 575 A.2d 1227, 1233 (1990) (citations omitted); <em>see also Shell, </em>307 Md. at 54-55, 512 A.2d at 362-63. We draw such a distinction because of our determination that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">\u201cNone of these considerations justifying inconsistent jury verdicts is fairly applicable to the trial of a criminal case before a judge.

Sowell, </em>353 Md. 713, 728 A.2d 712 (1999); <em>State v. Ward, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>284 Md. 189, 396 A.2d 1041 (1978). In <em>Sowell, </em>353 Md. at 718-19, 728 A.2d at 715 (quoting <em>Ward, </em>284 Md. at 197, 396 A.2d at 1046-47), we outlined the differences between the various degrees of principals and accessories. We explained that \u201c[a] principal in the first degree is one who actually commits a crime, either by his own hand, or by an inanimate agency, or by an innocent human agent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To the contrary, a principal in the second degree \u201cis one who is guilty of [a] felony by reason of having aided, counseled, commanded or encouraged the commission thereof in his presence, either actual or constructive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A principal in the second degree differs from an accessory before the fact because an accessory before the fact \u201cis one who is guilty of [a] felony by reason of having aided, counseled, commanded or encouraged the commission thereof, without having been present either actually or constructively at the moment of perpetration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Lastly, an accessory after the fact \u201cis one who, with knowledge of the other\u2019s guilt, renders assistance to a felon in the effort to hinder his detection, arrest, trial or punishment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">These differences, however, are not applicable to misdemeanors because, in Maryland, the principles of accessoryship apply only to felonies; as to misdemeanors, all participants in a crime are considered principals. \u201cWhen a person embraces a misdemeanor, that person is a principal as to that crime, no matter what the nature of the involvement. In the field of felony, however, the common law divides guilty parties into principals and accessories.\u201d <em>State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 280, 604 A.2d 489, 494 (1992); <em>accord State v.

While the judge did not use the words \u201cprincipal in the second degree,\u201d he stated that Williams was guilty as an \u201caider and abettor,\u201d that he was \u201ccomplicit in the events\u201d and that \u201cthere is no question in the court\u2019s mind that [Williams] was present.\u201d We therefore interpret the trial judge\u2019s language and convictions of Williams as an \u201caider and abettor\u201d to mean that Williams was found guilty as a principal in the second degree as to his involvement in the crimes mentioned.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHA\">We have held that when a specific intent is a necessary element of a particular crime one cannot be a principal in the second degree to that offense unless such person entertained such an intent or knew that the principal in the first degree entertained such intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">jj* :{: sj\u00ab sfc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">\u201cTo be guilty as a principal in the second degree, a criminal intent is necessary.\u201d \u201cAid or encouragement to another who is actually perpetrating a felony will not make the aider or encourager guilty of the crime if it is rendered without mens rea.

Raines, </em>326 Md. 582, 594-98, 606 A.2d 265, 271-72 (1992) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">The evidence shows that Williams had the requisite <em>mens rea, i.e., </em>that he knew or had reason to know of the criminal intentions of Henderson and Gaines, which the judge made clear when he stated that \u201cthe court believes that [Williams was] knowledgeable about the events, that [he was] complicit in the events and that [he is] guilty of aiding and abetting in the commission of this attempted robbery.\u201d The trial judge then convicted Williams of attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, attempted robbery and assault in the first degree. Williams\u2019s complicity in the criminal events, therefore, rested on the fact that he aided and abetted the criminal acts of the others; namely, driving Henderson and Gaines to and from the crime scene, waiting for them in the car parked behind the gas station and acting to conceal their identity as they got out of the car. Thus, Williams was a part of the criminal enterprise and was responsible for all crimes committed in furtherance of that enterprise. Notwithstanding, the trial judge also stated that he did not believe that there was enough evidence to find that Williams actually or constructively possessed the handgun. He stated that it would have been \u201ca bit of a stretch\u201d to find that Williams possessed the handgun in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>vehicle, because it was Henderson who actually carried the handgun, and thus found Williams not guilty of wearing, carrying, or transporting it. In doing so, the trial judge rendered inconsistent verdicts and failed to explain how Williams was not in joint possession of the handgun used by Henderson and Gaines in the commission of the attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon and the lesser included offenses. <em>See Newman v. Commonwealth, </em>437 Mass. 599, 773 N.E.2d 963, 967 (2002) (explaining that so long as there is sufficient evidence that an individual involved in an armed robbery is aware that the perpetrator has a gun, then the individual can be convicted as a joint venturer to the armed robbery charges without ever actually possessing the gun himself); <em>see also Price v. State, </em>111 Md.App. 487, 498, 681 A.2d 1206, 1211 (1996) (noting that \u201cin [a crime] in which control or dominion over ... the instrumentality of the crime constitutes, or is the element of, the <em>actus reus, </em>the law engages in the legal fiction of constructive possession to impute inferentially criminal responsibility\u201d) (citing <em>Folk v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 508, 518, 275 A.2d 184, 189 (1971)). According to the evidence, there was only one handgun used in this case. Williams, Henderson, and Gaines traveled to and from the Citgo station together in Williams\u2019s car, and Williams spent substantial time with the others before and after the armed robbery. Because the trial judge held that Williams did not possess the handgun, and the trial judge failed to adequately explain how Williams was not in joint possession of the gun, the verdicts are inconsistent and the guilty verdicts for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon and assault in the first degree must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The trial judge also found Williams guilty of attempted robbery and attempted theft, two crimes that do not require proof of the use of a handgun in order to sustain a conviction. It, therefore, was not necessary that Williams possess a handgun or have knowledge that Henderson and Gaines were going to use a handgun to commit those crimes. As such, the guilty verdicts for attempted robbery and attempted theft are consistent with the trial court\u2019s acquittal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Williams for wearing, carrying or transporting a handgun. Accordingly, those verdicts can stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">There no longer appears to be any dispute as to whether the convictions for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence and a felony are inconsistent with the acquittal for wearing, carrying or transporting a handgun because Williams contended, and the State conceded, that they are inconsistent. The State, in its brief to this Court, stated that \u201cthe Court of Special Appeals was correct as to Williams\u2019s convictions for the merged misdemeanor offenses of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony and in the commission of a crime of violence.... \u201d In addition, the State conceded that the court was correct to vacate the handgun use convictions. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">We reiterate that when one embraces a misdemeanor, he or she is a principal as to that crime no matter what the nature of his or her involvement, <em>Hawkins, </em>326 Md. at 280, 604 A.2d at 494, and, in addition, \u201cwhen two or more persons participate in a criminal offense, each is responsible for the commission of the offense and for any other criminal acts done in furtherance of the commission of the offense or the escape therefrom.\u201d <em>Raines, </em>326 Md. at 598, 606 A.2d at 272. It is therefore irrelevant, in the present case, that some of the crimes committed in furtherance of the criminal enterprise were misdemeanors and that Williams did not enter the Citgo station.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\n<em>Use of a Handgun vs. Possession of a Handgun</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Consistent with the case law of this State, an individual must possess a handgun before he or she can use that handgun. For example, in <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 156-57, 626 A.2d 946, 956 (1993), in evaluating two different statutes, this Court stated that \u201cuse\u201d requires \u201cconduct different from possession\u2014an active, rather than passive, employment of a handgun\u201d and further, that \u201c \u2018use\u2019 requires that the defendant \u2018carry out a purpose or action\u2019 or \u2018make instrumental to an end or process\u2019 or \u2018apply to advantage\u2019 the firearm\u201d (quoting <em>Wynn v. State, </em>313 Md. 533, 543, 546 A.2d 465, 470 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>(1988)).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Furthermore, in <em>Wynn, </em>we analyzed the language of Md. AnmCode., Art. 27 \u00a7 36B (1957, Repl.Yol.1982, Cum. Supp.1986)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to determine whether the Legislature distinguished between the possession of a handgun and use of a handgun, when it enacted that provision. In that ease, we examined whether mere possession of a handgun is equivalent to the use of a handgun under those provisions. In examining the preamble to Art. 27 \u00a7 36B, now codified as Md.Code (2002), \u00a7 4-202 of the Criminal Law Article (Legislative findings), we noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">the [Legislature specifically distinguished between the <em>wearing, carrying and transporting </em>of handguns and the <em>use </em>of handguns in criminal activity ... [which] [ ] clearly indicates that the [L]egislature considered the use of a handgun to be something more than mere illegal possession of a handgun and that the [Legislature contemplated <em>use </em>of a handgun in an active as opposed to a passive manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXt\"><em>Wynn, </em>313 Md. at 541, 546 A.2d at 469. We stated further that, \u201cthe term \u2018use\u2019 connotes something more than bare possession of a handgun in the commission of a crime of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>violence,\u201d and concluded that, therefore, the Legislature \u201cdid not equate carrying of a handgun with use of a handgun.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although there exists a clear distinction between possession and use, possession is a necessary component of the term \u201cuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In accordance with these definitions and case law, we agree with Williams and the Court of Special Appeals, and conclude that Williams must have possessed the handgun before he could have used it. Because Williams embraced the entire criminal enterprise, it was inconsistent for the trial judge to conclude that Williams used the handgun, but did not actually or constructively possess that gun. The trial judge failed to adequately explain how Williams was not in possession of the handgun while traveling to the Citgo station with Henderson and Gaines, but, nonetheless, embraced all of the other crimes committed in furtherance of the attempted armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. BALTIMORE COUNTY TO PAY THE COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-9\">. The prosecution argued that Williams was the aider and abettor because he was acting as a \u201clook-out\u201d and \u201cacting as a get-away driver.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b205-10\">. The indictment lists the charge, as to Count 5, as wearing, cariying and transporting a handgun upon and about Williams\u2019s person. Although Williams was not specifically charged with transporting or possessing a handgun solely in his vehicle, the trial judge limited his findings, as to whether Williams wore, carried, or transported the handgun, to the time period that the handgun was in Williams\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b214-9\">. The State presented the following issue in its petition for writ of certiorari:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-10\">Did the Court of Special Appeals incorrectly hold that the sentencing court\u2019s verdict finding Williams guilty, as an accomplice, of attempted armed robbery and first degree assault was inconsistent with the trial court\u2019s acquittal of Williams of wearing!,] carrying and transporting a handgun?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b216-5\">. In addition, Williams posits that the trial judge\u2019s actions in the case <em>sub judice </em>violated the Double Jeopardy principles of both the U.S. Constitution and Maryland common law because the charge of wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun does not contain any additional elements than the charges of using a handgun in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence. Williams explains that a person cannot use a handgun without wearing, carrying, or transporting it on his person and also that the Legislature did not intend a separate punishment for wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun than it did for using a handgun during the commission of a felony or crime of violence. <em>See Wilkins v. State, </em>343 Md. 444, 682 A.2d 247 (1996). Lastly, Williams again cites <em>Stuckey </em>and notes that even though he was convicted of using a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence in the same proceeding in which he was acquitted of wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun, it is of no significance. The Court of Special Appeals agreed with Williams that these verdicts violated the Fifth Amendment prohibition against double jeopardy and Maryland common law double jeopardy principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">We need not address this Double Jeopardy contention because the State failed to present this question in its petition for writ of certiorari and we did not grant <em>certiora\u00f1 </em>as to that issue. <em>See supra </em>footnote 3 (providing the question presented in the State\u2019s petition). The applicable provision is Rule 8-131, entitled \"Scope of review,\" specifically subsection (b), entitled \"In Court of Appeals\u2014Additional Limitations.\" This subsection provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">Unless otherwise provided by the order granting the writ of certiorari, in reviewing a decision rendered by the Court of Special Appeals or by a circuit court acting in an appellate capacity, the Court of Appeals ordinarily will consider only an issue that has been raised in the petition for certiorari or any cross-petition and that has been preserved for appellate review by the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">In addition, we need not address the Double Jeopardy contention because our holding, <em>infra, </em>that the convictions for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence and a felony must be reversed, renders the issue moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b217-9\">.
