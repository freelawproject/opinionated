Charles Street (\u201cthe Property\u201d) in Baltimore, Maryland. The Property consists of a three story building which houses a bar and package goods store known as the Magnet.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On March 9, 2006, the City filed a petition for condemnation and a petition for immediate possession and title with the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. On March 15, 2006, prior to the property owner being served with any papers, the Circuit Court granted the City\u2019s petitions, ordering that the City \u201cbe vested with possession of the fee simple interest in that property known as 1924 N. Charles Street ... as of the 15th day of March, 2006.... \u201d Pursuant to the court\u2019s order, title in the Property would vest in the City ten days after personal service of the relevant order on the owner of the Property, George Valsamaki, <em>et al., </em>appellee, unless he filed an answer to the City\u2019s petitions 'within the ten day period \u201calleging that the City does not have the right or power to condemn title to the property____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Mr. Valsamaki filed an answer within the requisite time period and a hearing was scheduled and held on April 18, 2006. On May 19, 2006, the Circuit Court issued a memorandum opinion denying the City\u2019s petitions for condemnation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>immediate possession and title to the Property. On August 8, 2006, after a motion to reconsider had been denied, the City noted a direct appeal to this Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The City presents one question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\u201cDoes the City have the burden to prove \u2018necessity\u2019 to proceed with a quick take condemnation?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">We answer this question in the affirmative, holding that under the Code of Public Local Laws of Baltimore City, \u00a7 21-16(a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the City must demonstrate the reason or reasons why it is necessary for it to have <em>immediate </em>possession and immediate title to a particular property via the exercise of a quick-take condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">This case has its genesis in Baltimore City\u2019s urban renewal efforts. On October 25, 1982, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore adopted Ordinance No. 82-799, which established the Charles North Urban Renewal Plan for the Charles North Revitalization Area.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ordinance No. 82-799 sets forth the goals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>and objectives of the Charles North Urban Renewal Plan as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-4\">\u201cThe basic goal of this Urban Renewal Plan is the revitalization of the Charles/North area in order to create a unique mixed-use neighborhood with enhanced viability, stability, attractiveness, and convenience for residents of the surrounding area and of the City as a whole. The objectives of this Plan include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">a. protecting existing residential neighborhoods;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">b. establishing a positive and identifiable image for the Charles/North Area compatible with the surrounding residential areas;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">c. accommodating the expansion of existing retail small business;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">d. promoting new retail business activity in the area;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">e. establishing and enforcing uniform comprehensive design and rehabilitation standards that will enhance the physical environment of the business area through private investment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">f. bringing about a general physical improvement of the area through coordinated public improvements;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-11\">g. providing a pleasant environment for the staging of year-round promotional activities and events; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-12\">h. removing blighting influences and creating development lots for commercial uses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">The Property is located within the boundaries of the Charles North Revitalization Area. In June 2004, the Mayor and City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Council of Baltimore amended the Charles North Urban Renewal Plan by Baltimore City Ordinance No. 04-695, which specifically authorized the acquisition of the subject Property \u201cby purchase or by condemnation, for urban renewal purposes .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The issue before us arose on March 9, 2006, when the City acted on Ordinance No. 04-695 and filed a petition for condemnation and a petition for immediate possession of and title to the Property in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The petition for condemnation stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">\u201c[The City] is duly authorized to acquire the Property Interest hereinafter described [the Property] for public purposes by the following Ordinance(s) of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, viz: Article 13 \u00a7 2\u20147(h)[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] of the Baltimore City Code (2000 edition), approved November 11, 1999 and Ordinance No. 04-695, approved June 23, 2004.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">\u201cThis property will be used for redevelopment purposes; namely in the Charles North Project area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>The petition for immediate possession and title stated in pertinent part: \u201cThat it is necessary for [the City] to acquire immediate possession and title to the said property interest as appears from the affidavit of William N. Burgee, Director of Property Acquisition and Relocation, Department of Housing and Community Development, attached hereto and prayed to be taken as a part hereof.\u201d Relevantly, the attached affidavit read: \u201cThe property known as 1924 N. Charles Street, Block 3602, Lot 04[,] must be in possession of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore at the earliest possible time <em>in order to assist in a business expansion in the area.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added]. There was no attempt in the affidavit to specify the immediacy of the necessity other than a general statement that it was needed \u201cat the earliest possible time\u201d \u201cto assist in a business expansion.\u201d There was no discussion of \u201cwhy.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">On March 15, 2006, the Circuit Court granted the City\u2019s petitions, as discussed <em>supra. </em>Mr. Valsamaki, the owner of the Property, timely filed an answer challenging the City\u2019s power to condemn title to the Property and a hearing was set for April 18, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Prior to the April 18, 2006, hearing, Mr. Valsamaki attempted to obtain discovery by serving interrogatories and notices of depositions on various city officials involved with the Charles North Urban Renewal Plan, namely, Mr. Burgee and Paul J.M. Dombrowski (an official at the Baltimore Development Corporation responsible for the Charles North Project). Due to the abbreviated time period in which quick-take condemnation proceedings generally take place, the City would not have to respond under the normal discovery time line before the April 18, 2006, hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, Mr. Valsamaki <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>moved to shorten the time for discovery in order to ensure a response before the hearing. On April 4, 2006, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City denied that motion and, consequently, the City did not comply with the discovery requests prior to the April 18, 2006, hearing, and Mr. Valsamaki was forced to litigate without the aid of discovery practices, practices that would have been available in a regular condemnation action.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">On April 18, 2006, the hearing took place. The Charles North Urban Renewal Plan, illustrated by Ordinance No. 82-799, was introduced into evidence by the City, along with Ordinance No. 04-695, a map of the renewal area, and a photograph of the Property. The City called two witnesses at the hearing. The first witness was Mr. Dombrowski, the Director of Planning and Design for the Baltimore Development Corporation and also the Project Manager for the Charles North area. On cross examination by Mr. Valsamaki\u2019s counsel, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">\u201cQ Were you aware of the Affidavit by Mr. Burgee stating the necessity for, the reason for, necessity for the taking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">A I was aware that an Affidavit had been presented to the Law Department.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Q And are you aware of the contents of that Affidavit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">AI had not reviewed it before it was sent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">Q Do you know what is meant by a business expansion in the area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">A I think so. It means, to us, at least, the opportunity to provide for additional business expansion opportunities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">Q <em>Is there any plan for the development of this property?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">A <em>The specific property?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">Q Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-11\">A <em>Not as yet became the procedure we follow is through a request for proposal procedure as you well know.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-12\">Q So\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-13\">A When we assemble the site, we put it out for public offering for redevelopment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-14\">Q So when the Amendment was adopted in '04, the City really didn\u2019t have any idea what it was going to use the property for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-15\">A <em>We wanted mixed use development, but we had no specific plans because they follow on with the proposals. </em>They come in as part of a proposal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-16\">Q <em>But you really, at this point in time, and at the time you adopted the amendment, you really didn\u2019t have any plan for this property; did you?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-17\">A <em>Did not have a specific plan for the property. </em>We are seeking mixed use development for that assemblage of properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Q That onset of seeking mixed use development, is that set forth in Exhibit 1 at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">AI believe so. I believe the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">Q Could you point that out, then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">THE COURT: I\u2019m sorry. Mr. Clerk, could you hand this back, please, to Counsel while he\u2019s\u2014thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">A I\u2019m referring ... to page 1 of the Urban Renewal Plan, the very bottom of the page, \u2018Item 2, Plan Objectives.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] The basic goal of this Urban Renewal Plan is the revitalization of the Charles North area in order to create a unique mixed-use neighborhood with enhanced viability, stability, attractiveness and convenience for residents, et cetera. So, I think this is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">Q I\u2019m trying to understand this. This mixed-use concept then is just a conglomeration of different uses; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">A It\u2019s exactly as it says, \u2018a mixed use,\u2019 mixed uses, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\">Q So then there\u2019s no\u2014I\u2019m trying to relate this to the Affidavit where it says the expansion of a business in the area\u2014\u2018a business.\u2019 Was there any particular business that was referred to, you had in mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-12\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-13\">Q So you wouldn\u2019t be able to say that there was any particular type of business that you had in mind for this property or this block?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-14\">A Again, I would say that the overriding goal is to create additional retail business opportunities as well as housing opportunities, job opportunities, office opportunities, whatever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-15\">Q I just see in the plan the various permitted uses, include office, residential, community business, community commercial, central commercial, industrial. All those are basically permitted. Is that not right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>A As appropriately zoned, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">Q Excuse me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">A If they are appropriately zoned, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">Q But they are allowed by the plan, the bottom of page 2, the top of page 3. All these uses are allowed. Is that not right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">A In the plan area, yes. In the overall plan area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">Q <em>So as I understand what you\u2019re saying then, you really didn\u2019t have any specific plan for this property or for the plan when you adopted the Urban Renewal areas?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-10\">A <em>Not a specific plan. We would choose that when proposals came in. \u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">Mr. Valsamaki\u2019s counsel continued, asking Mr. Dombrowski specifically about the City\u2019s need for immediate possession of the Property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-12\">\u201cQ Is there any reason that it\u2019s necessary to have immediate possession?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-13\">A Well, immediate possession to us means getting something going after 20-some years of non investment in the area or 30 years. It\u2019s a matter of trying to assemble the site, given the fact that we know it takes time to go through this kind of procedure with appraisals, et cetera, and relocation assistance in Mr. Valsamaki\u2019s case. So we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>are looking for the most expeditious way to get development going and we deferred to the Law Department to tell us how to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">Q I don\u2019t understand. If you haven\u2019t even started the RFP process, why it\u2019s necessary to have immediate possession, why you could [not] go the normal route and just have an ordinary condemnation in say six, nine months, something like that. I\u2019m missing\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">A We will have an RFP done in a matter of weeks if we know that we can move ahead on the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">Q You don\u2019t really know whether anybody\u2019s going to respond to the RFP, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">A No, we never know that in advance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">The City next called M.J. \u201cJay\u201d Brodie, President of the Baltimore Development Corporation, as a witness. The City first asked Mr. Brodie why the subject Property was being acquired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">\u201cQ There are several specific questions that I would like to have you elaborate upon now since you\u2019ve given us sort of an overall view of the Urban Renewal process. What is the reason for\u2014can you elaborate upon the specific reason for acquiring this property, if you could just elaborate upon that for the Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">A Sure. Well, this property is part of a larger assemblage and it\u2019s our judgment in this case, put in front of the City Council and approved by them that the parcels of this size are necessary for the renewal of the area----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">On cross examination, Mr. Valsamaki\u2019s counsel asked Mr. Brodie to elaborate on whether there was a specific redevelopment plan for the Property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-14\">\u201cQ And you would agree with Mr. Dombrowski that at this point in time there is no specific plan, either for this property or for that lot in which this property [is] located; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-15\">A Actually, I would not agree with Mr. Dombrowski. <em>I believe on the contrary that the plan in front of the City </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>Council was as specific as most urban renewal plans are at that point in time. </em>It calls for specific land uses. It delineates disposition lots. It proposes\u2014in most cases, not in this case\u2014changes of zoning. So it is not atypical in any sense.... It is the classic one step at a head [time] moving toward a future redevelopment of a particular site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\">Q Tell me what specific land uses are called for in the plan for this property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">A The ones that are in the plan. I don\u2019t have the plan in front of me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">Q Well, let me get that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">[THE CITY]: I think [we] need the exhibit\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">THE COURT: It\u2019s 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">A <em>So there are obviously a spectrum of uses that are permitted. That [is] as specific as most urban renewal plans are. </em>The reason is\u2014and there\u2019s a reason. The reason is, in planning of, let\u2019s say 30 or 40 years ago, there was an attempt to pinpoint a specific use for each property such as business or residential or industrial. The organic view of cities that most of us have adopted, is that\u2019s really nearsighted. My nearsightedness has been corrected to 20/20 vision, so in planning terms, we think mixed use is much more sensitive and appropriate for City redevelopment and therefore, the old-fashioned idea of pinpointing a use on a specific property versus allowing a mixture of uses, that\u2019s where we are today. That\u2019s why the plan, as Mr. Dombrowski quoted, calls for a mixed use redevelopment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">Q You don\u2019t really know what specific use this property will be devoted to under the plan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">A ... I\u2019ve just told you. You may not like the answer, but that\u2019s the answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-12\">Q That you don\u2019t know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-13\">A No, sir. <em>That it\u2019s as specific as the description of mixed uses in the Urban Renewal Plan are.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Q And you would confirm Mr. Dombrowski\u2019s testimony that at this point no RFP has been prepared?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">A That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">Q <em>No RFP has been issued.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">A <em>That\u2019s correct.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">Q <em>There have been no developers identified for this property.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">\n<em>A That\u2019s correct.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">Q And the specific plan that will eventually come into existence for this property will be that proposed by a developer and approved by [the] Baltimore Development Corporation; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-11\">A I would say that is not <em>correct____The specific plan as Fve just described in the Urban Renewal Plan, the specific design for redevelopment will come out of a proposal by a private sector developer. \u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">On May 19, 2006, the Honorable John Philip Miller issued a memorandum opinion and order for the Circuit Court. In so doing, the court analyzed whether the City\u2019s petition for condemnation and petition for immediate possession and title outlined a \u201cpublic interest of sufficient necessity to award [the City] with immediate possession as called for under the language of \u00a7 21-16.\u201d The trial court utilized the affidavit of Mr. Burgee, the testimony of the City\u2019s witnesses presented at the hearing, and the exhibits introduced at the hearing by the City as evidence in reaching its determination. After a review of the applicable law and the evidence at hand, the trial court denied the City\u2019s petitions. Judge Miller, writing for that court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-14\">\u201cIn considering the arguments and the evidence presented by the parties, this Court finds that [the City] fails to demonstrate sufficient grounds which warrant the findings of necessity requisite for the immediate taking. The [City] impassively asserts that the Charles North Project will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>likely come to a temporary halt unless [the City] is awarded the Property in Interest immediately. The Court, based on all [the] evidence, is not satisfied that the [City] has met its burden. The [City] has failed to submit to the Court either a contract, a focused development plan as it pertains to the Property in Interest, or even a Request for Proposal ... supporting its contentions and establishing necessity required under \u00a7 21-16.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">In support of its conclusion, the trial court cited to the recent controversial United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Kelo v. City of New London, Connecticut, </em>545 U.S. 469, 125 S.Ct. 2655, 162 L.Ed.2d 439 (2005). The trial court acknowledged that under <em>Kelo, </em>\u201cnot only will economic development qualify as \u2018public use\u2019 for the purposes of eminent domain, but that also given \u2018a carefully considered development plan,\u2019 a plan that is comprehensive in nature and one that was preceded by thorough deliberation, a city\u2019s taking of private property will comport with the demands of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d After applying the <em>Kelo </em>holding to the matter at hand, however, the trial court found that it was \u201cnot satisfied that the [City] ha[d] demonstrated the necessity of the taking pursuant to any specifically outlined plan or contract, or as called for by \u00a7 21-16 of the Public Local Laws of Baltimore City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">On May 26, 2006, the City filed a motion for reconsideration to alter or amend judgment. On July 11, 2006, the Circuit Court denied the City\u2019s motion. Thereafter, on August 8, 2006, the City noted a direct appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">We initially note that the issue of an \u201cimmediacy requirement\u201d in quick-take condemnations appears to be an issue of first impression for this Court and has not been the subject of much discussion elsewhere. In a jurisdiction in which the issue has been discussed, the courts have, albeit sometimes as dicta, recognized such a requirement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The City argued in the Circuit Court, and argues now on appeal, that it does not have the burden to prove necessity in order to proceed with a quick-take condemnation proceeding for immediate possession and title to a property. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>opposition, Mr. Valsamaki argues that \u00a7 21-16 of the Public Local Laws of Baltimore City statutorily establishes a requirement that the City show why it is necessary for it to take <em>immediate </em>possession and title to property, and that in so doing the City must also show that any taking is for a public use consistent with Article XI-B of the Maryland Constitution and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Condemnation is a function of the State\u2019s power of eminent domain. Eminent domain is defined as \u201c[t]he inherent power of a governmental entity to take privately owned property, esp. land, and convert it to public use, subject to reasonable compensation for the taking.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>562 (8th ed.2004). \u201c[T]he power of eminent domain adheres to sovereignty and requires no constitutional authority for its existence.\u201d <em>Lore v. Board of Public Works, </em>277 Md. 356, 358, 354 A.2d 812, 814 (1976) (citing <em>Riden v. Phila., B. &amp; W.R.R. Co., </em>182 Md. 336, 339, 35 A.2d 99, 100 (1943)). The power of eminent domain, however, is limited by both the Constitution of Maryland and the United States Constitution. The right to private property, and the protection of that right, is a bedrock principle of our constitutional republic. This is explicit in the federal constitution. The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> states that, \u201cNo person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d U.S. Const. amend.

The genius, the nature, and the spirit, of our State Government, amount to a prohibition of such acts of legislation; and the general principles of law and reason forbid them. The Legislature ... cannot ... violate ... the right of private property. To maintain that our Federal, or State, Legislature possesses such powers, if they had not been expressly restrained; would, in my opinion, be a political heresy, altogether inadmissible in our free republican governments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">3 Dali, at 388-89 (emphasis deleted). Justice Story further expounded upon the importance of property rights in <em>Wilkinson v. Leland, </em>2 Pet. 627, 7 L.Ed. 542 (1829), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">\u201cThat government can scarcely be deemed to be free, where the rights of property are left solely dependent upon the will of a legislative body, without any restraint. The fundamental maxims of a free government seem to require, that the rights of personal liberty and private property should be held sacred. At least no court of justice in this country would be warranted in assuming, that the power to violate and disregard them; a power so repugnant to the common principles of justice and civil liberty lurked under any general grant of legislative authority, or ought to be implied from any general expressions of the will of the people. The people ought not to be presumed to part with rights so vital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>to their security and well being, without very strong and direct expressions of such an intention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">2 Pet. at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Thus, it is evident that government, through its federal and various state legislatures, does not have the authority to take a private individual\u2019s property and convey it to another private individual for a purely private purpose. <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. at 477-78, 125 S.Ct. at 2661 (\u201c[I]t has long been accepted that the sovereign may not take the property of <em>A </em>for the sole purpose of transferring it to another private party <em>B, </em>even though <em>A </em>is paid just compensation.\u201d). The Supreme Court elaborated upon this in <em>Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, </em>467 U.S. 229, 104 S.Ct. 2321, 81 L.Ed.2d 186 (1984), stating: \u201c[T]he Court\u2019s cases have repeatedly stated that \u2018one person\u2019s property may not be taken for the benefit of another private person without a justifying public purpose, even though compensation be paid.\u2019 \u201d 467 U.S. at 241, 104 S.Ct. at 2329 (citing <em>Thompson v.

The Maryland Constitution provides that: \u201cThe General Assembly shall enact no Law authorizing private property, to be taken for public use, without just compensation, as agreed upon between the parties, or awarded by a Jury, being first paid or tendered to the party entitled to such compensation.\u201d Md.

Furthermore, Article III, \u00a7 \u00a7 40A-40C of the Maryland Constitution gives the General Assembly authority to enact legislation providing powers to certain local (and state) entities for immediate takings, or quick-take condemnation actions, for different pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>poses. <em>Bern-Shaw, </em>377 Md. at 281-82 n. 1, 833 A.2d at 504 n. 1; <em>J.L.

Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 40A.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The constitutional provisions in regard to quick-take condemnation actions in Baltimore City are effectuated, in a limited manner, by Code of Public Local Laws of Baltimore City, \u00a7 21-16. Chapter 420 of the Acts of 1972. Section 21-16 provides the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore with the authority to institute quick-take condemnation actions by filing \u201ca Petition under oath stating that it is <em>necessary </em>for the City to have <em>immediate </em>possession of, or <em>immediate </em>title to and possession of, said property, <em>and the reasons therefore. \u201d </em>\u00a7 21-16(a) (emphasis added). The court may then grant immediate possession <em>\u201c[i]f it appears from a Petition for Immediate Possession, </em>with or without supporting affidavits or sworn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>testimony, that the public interest requires the City to have immediate possession of said property____\u201d \u00a7 21-16(d) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">By requiring the City to establish under oath the immediacy of the need for quick-take condemnation (as opposed to regular condemnation), the Legislature has imposed the burden of proof upon the City to establish that immediate need\u2014not imposed a burden on the property owner to prove the contrary. Quick-take condemnation, as established by \u00a7 21-16, is to be utilized by the City only when the public interest demands that it is necessary for property to be <em>immediately </em>taken. <em>See also </em>Nicole Stelle Garnett, <em>The Public-Use Question as a Takings Problem, </em>71 Geo. Wash. L.Rev. 934, 974 n. 257 (2003) <em>(\u201cSee, e.g., </em>Steven Elrod, THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN\u2014INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW \u00a7 1.35 (Supp.1998) (observing that \u2018quick-take is intended to be used only when the immediate use of the property is necessary and the project cannot wait until the procedural safeguards of traditional condemnation have been satisfied\u2019).\u201d). It is not a power to be utilized for regular condemnation purposes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>This statutory scheme provided by \u00a7 21-16 is essential to our determination of the issues in the case <em>sub judice. </em>As Judge Harrell, writing for the Court in <em>J.L. Matthews, </em>instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">\u201c[I]t is important to note that we have \u2018underscore^] the principle that condemnation actions are exclusive special statutory actions for the exercise of the eminent domain power.\u2019 <em>Utilities, Inc. [of Md. v. Wash. Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n], </em>362 Md. [37, 49-50], 763 A.2d [129,] 135 [(2000)] (citing <em>Sollins v. Baltimore County, </em>253 Md. 407, 252 A.2d 819 (1969)). <em>Thus, the statutory scheme delineating [a party\u2019s] condemnation authority informs our consideration of the issues before us.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\"><em>J.L. Matthews, </em>368 Md. at 91, 792 A.2d at 300 (emphasis added). <em>See </em>also Gregory G. Schwab, <em>The Maryland Survey: 2001-2002 Recent Decisions: The Court of Appeals of Maryland, </em>62 Md. L.Rev. 840, 845-46 (2003) (\u201cMaryland has an extensive statutory framework to guide governmental entities in the exercise of their eminent domain powers, set forth both in the Maryland Constitution an d in the Maryland Code. Political subdivisions and public entities have no condemnation powers other than those conferred upon them by the State. Therefore, <em>where the State has conferred condemnation authority, these governmental entities must strictly follow the statutory procedures.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added) (Footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">An \u201cImmediate\u201d Necessity</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">The City asserts that \u201c[t]his Court has held that the burden of proving lack of necessity in a quick take condemnation suit rests upon the party who objects to the proceeding....\u201d In support of this contention, the City cites to <em>Free State Realty Co., Inc. v. City of Baltimore, </em>279 Md. 550, 369 A.2d 1030 (1977) and <em>County Commissioners of Frederick County v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number><em>Schrodel, </em>320 Md. 202, 577 A.2d 39 (1990). This argument, however, does not acknowledge the plain language of \u00a7 21-16 of the Public Local Laws of Baltimore City, which imposes the requirement that the City first show \u201cthe reasons,\u201d i.e., the necessity for immediate possession by quick-take condemnation. Furthermore, the City misconstrues the language in <em>Free State, </em>and the cases cited therein, to impose a burden upon Mr. Valsamaki which does not exist in the present instance. The threshold issue in this case is whether the City provided sufficient reasons to show a necessity for it to have <em>immediate </em>possession of and title to the Property under \u00a7 21-16, not whether there was a sufficient showing of \u201cpublic use.\u201d As discussed <em>infra, </em>the City has failed to demonstrate such <em>immediate </em>necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">As indicated above, there is a distinction to be made between the two types of condemnation addressed in our case history: regular condemnation and quick-take condemnation. The majority of our cases deal with instances of regular condemnation, rather than quick-take condemnation. There is some confusion extant because the courts have a tendency to mix the interpretation of the two. In the case <em>sub judice </em>we are only concerned with quick-take condemnation in Baltimore City. The quick-take power is statutorily provided by \u00a7 21-16 of the Public Local Laws of Baltimore City and, as such, our determination as to the City\u2019s use of quick-take condemnation is governed by that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Judge Eldridge, writing for the Court in <em>Green v. High Ridge Association, Inc., </em>346 Md. 65, 695 A.2d 125 (1997), <em>in the context of traditional condemnation proceedings, </em>discussed the question of whether there is a \u201cnecessity\u201d for a condemnation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">\u201cThe Court has held ... that the question of whether there is a \u2018necessity\u2019 for a particular condemnation is primarily for the legislative and/or executive branches of government. <em>See, e.g., County Comm\u2019rs v. Schrodel, </em>320 Md. 202, 216-217, 577 A.2d 39, 46 (1990); <em>Anne Arundel County v. Burnopp, </em>300 Md. [343,] 348-349, 478 A.2d [315,] 318-319 [(1984)]; <em>Wash. Suburban Sanitary Comm. v.

Burnopp, supra, </em>300 Md. at 349, 478 A.2d at 318. Moreover, the burden is upon those challenging the condemnation to establish such bad faith, <em>County Comm\u2019rs v. Schrodel, supra, </em>320 Md. at 217, 577 A.2d at 46.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"><em>Green, </em>346 Md. at 79-80, 695 A.2d at 132. Thus, our statement in Green is that the burden lies with the property owners who allege bad faith having the burden of proving that bad faith. It, alone, does not relieve condemning authorities of any burden they may have of establishing a prima facie case of inherent public use.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The City relies on a line of cases derived from <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission v. Santorios, </em>234 Md. 342, 199 A.2d 206 (1964). These cases, however, are distinguishable from the \u00a7 21-16 quick-take condemnation proceedings at issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>where there is both a <em>statutory </em>requirement that the City show necessity for, i.e., give the reasons for, immediate possession and title to a property, and the requirement that the City satisfy the \u201cpublic use\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The City primarily relies on <em>Free State, </em>a case that also involved the condemnation of a property for urban renewal purposes. In <em>Free State </em>it was argued that the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore \u201cimproperly or unlawfully exercised its \u2018quick take\u2019 powers of eminent domain.\u201d 279 Md. at 551, 369 A.2d at 1030. There, as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the City filed a petition to condemn and a petition for immediate possession. An affidavit was attached to the petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>immediate possession stating why immediate possession was necessary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">\u201cThe affidavit ... said that the dwelling ... \u2018ha[d] deteriorated to such extent as to constitute a serious and growing menace to the public health, safety and welfare,\u2019 which was \u2018likely to continue to deteriorate unless corrected, and [that] such continued deterioration m[ight] contribute to the blighting or deterioration of the immediately surrounding area thereto.\u2019 It further recited that the owner had \u2018failed to correct the deterioration thereof as evidenced by the violation notice[s] attached____\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 552, 369 A.2d at 1031. The \u201ctrial court considered the right to condemn and the right to immediate possession as a preliminary matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553, 369 A.2d at 1031. Testimony was introduced from a building inspector who testified \u201cthat when he visited the subject property ... he observed that \u2018[windows and doors were broken,\u2019 there \u201cwas rubbish and debris inside,\u2019 \u2018the house was vacant\u2019 and \u2018the grounds were unsanitary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553, 369 A.2d at 1031-32. Furthermore, another city employee testified that the property had been boarded and cleaned up on September 25, 1974, \u201cbut that when he last visited the property on July 13, 1975, three days before the hearing on the petition, there had been no effort made to rehabilitate the dwelling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553, 369 A.2d at 1032. The Court conducted a review of Maryland\u2019s constitutional and statutory authority, as explicated <em>supra, </em>and concluded that the City, in that case, had authority to acquire the subject land. There, the evidence of immediate need and necessity was much stronger that the sparse evidence in the present case where the City, in essence, failed to expand upon the minimal affidavit it had filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Discussing the sufficiency of evidence, the <em>Free State </em>Court looked to Nichols, <em>Law of Eminent Domain, </em>\u00a7 26.1315, at 26-169 (3d rev. ed.1976), quoting and discussing the treatise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">\u201c \u2018The burden of proving lack of necessity rests upon the person who objects to the proceeding on this ground.\u2019 The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>same work in \u00a7 26.3 in discussing adjudication of the right to condemn states at pages 26-237 to 238 that the condemning authority must prove certain things and then adds \u2018and, in such jurisdictions as treat the necessity of the use as a judicial question, that the land sought to be taken is necessary for the public use, to the extent, at least, of making out a <em>prima facie </em>case.\u2019 Maryland is a jurisdiction treating the necessity of use as a judicial question. <em>See Prince George\u2019s Co. v. Beard, </em>266 Md. 83, 95, 291 A.2d 636 (1972), and cases there cited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\"><em>Free State, </em>279 Md. at 558, 369 A.2d at 1034. The necessity of immediacy is also a judicial question. The City, in the case sub judice, utilizes the first statement\u2014that the burden rests upon the person objecting to the proceeding\u2014without placing it into context with the requirement that the condemning authority must prove certain things relevant to the extent of necessity in order to first make out a <em>prima facie </em>case under the statute here controlling.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Additionally, the City argues that \u201cwhile the decision of an agency as to the public necessity for taking a particular property is subject to judicial review, that review is narrow and limited to determining that the agency\u2019s decision is not so oppressive, arbitrary or unreasonable as to suggest bad faith.\u201d That argument is, in part, correct. It does not, however, tell the whole story concerning judicial review under the cireum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>stances of a \u00a7 21-16 quick-take condemnation proceeding, nor for that matter of a regular condemnation. In the present case we are primarily concerned with quick-take actions. The continuing applicability of the City\u2019s position on the limitations on the courts in respect to regular condemnation actions, generally, will be left to future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Much of the City\u2019s argument is derived from language quoted in <em>Free State, </em>that the City has parsed out from the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Santorios. </em>The Court in <em>Santorios </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APu\">\u201cWhen the legislature authorizes a commission or other agency to take and acquire land in fee or as an easement for a public purpose by purchase or condemnation, the selection of the land to be condemned is a matter for the commission to decide. When the taking is challenged, the questions for the court to decide are limited to (i) whether there is any necessity whatever to justify the taking, or (ii) whether the decision of the commission is so oppressive, arbitrary or unreasonable as to suggest bad faith. <em>State Roads Comm. v. Franklin, </em>201 Md. 549, 95 A.2d 99 (1953); <em>Johnson v. Consolidated Gas, Electric Light &amp; Power Co., </em>187 Md. 454, 50 A.2d 918 (1947); <em>Murphy v.

In 1 <em>Nichols on Eminent Domain </em>(3rd ed.) \u00a7 4.11[3], it is said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">\u2018The necessity is for the condemnor and not for the courts to decide, and the decision of such condemnor is final so long as it acts reasonably and in good faith. If the land is of some use to it in carrying out its public object, the degree of necessity is its own affair. Whether there is any necessity whatever to justify the taking is, however, a judicial question.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">Furthermore, it has been said that the necessity for the taking does not have to be absolute: all that is required is that it be reasonable under the circumstances. <em>Johnson v.

But where the authority is based upon an ordinance or other legislative enactment, it would seem that reliance thereon would make a <em>prima facie </em>case and shift the burden to the person attacking it to show that it is arbitrary or unreasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number><em>Herzinger, </em>203 Md. 49, 62-63, 98 A.2d 87, 93 (1953). The Court\u2019s statement in Herzinger, was prefaced by the use of the word \u201cordinarily.\u201d Nothing in Herzinger obviates the City\u2019s responsibility to show a minimal level of immediacy, i.e., a prima facie showing in a quick-take situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In the case of regular condemnation, once the City establishes at least a minimal level of public use or purpose, judicial review may be thereafter limited to determining that the agency\u2019s decision is not so oppressive, arbitrary or unreasonable as to suggest bad faith; that, however, is not the case in assessing immediacy in a quick-take condemnation action in Baltimore City under \u00a7 21-16. Rather, the court must also determine whether there is a necessity to justify an <em>immediate </em>taking and, in that determination, must be able to assess the reasons for the immediacy. Section 21-16 expressly <em>requires the City </em>to state reasons relating to immediacy, thus the City has the burden not only to present a <em>prima facie </em>case of public use, but, additionally, in a quick-take action, the burden to establish the necessity for an immediate taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The Court in <em>Free State </em>determined that the property in that case, based upon the affidavit attached to the petition for immediate possession, constituted an immediately serious and growing menace to public health, safety and welfare. <em>Free State, </em>279 Md. at 552, 369 A.2d at 1031. In <em>Free State, </em>the evidence was sufficient. Therefore, there was necessity for \u201cquick-take,\u201d i.e., immediate, condemnation. In <em>Santorios, </em>a case apparently based not upon quick-take condemnation, but upon traditional condemnation, the Court stated that \u201c[t]he question of law concerning the necessity for the taking was heard separately ... and resulted in a dismissal of the petition for condemnation.\u201d 234 Md. at 343, 199 A.2d at 207. As such, the question of necessity was not even a direct issue in <em>Santorios:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">\u201cIn the case at bar <em>[Santorios], </em>where the right to condemn was conceded and the public necessity for the extension of the sewerage system was not questioned, there was no evidence to show, nor was it ever contended, that it was not necessary for the Commission to acquire an ease<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>ment in at least some part of the property of the landowners in order to construct the extension of the sewer line.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4W\">234 Md. at 346, 199 A.2d at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the City did not satisfy the basic statutory mandate of \u00a7 21-16(a) of the Public Local Laws of Baltimore City. As stated <em>supra, </em>\u201c \u2018condemnation actions are exclusive special statutory actions for the exercise of the eminent domain power\u2019 \u201d and \u201c[t]hus, the statutory scheme delineating [the City\u2019s] condemnation authority informs our consideration of the issues before us.\u201d <em>J.L. Matthews, </em>368 Md. at 91, 792 A.2d at 300 quoting <em>Utilities, Inc. of Md. v. Wash. Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>362 Md. 37, 49, 763 A.2d 129, 135 (2000); Schwab, <em>The Maryland Survey: 2001-2002 Recent Decisions: The Court of Appeals of Maryland, </em>62 Md. L.Rev. at 845-46. Section 21-16(a) specifically provides that the City must show the necessity for an <em>immediate </em>taking. The City\u2019s petitions evince a dearth of any specific evidence showing a necessity for the immediate possession of the Property via quick-take condemnation as opposed to a regular condemnation. In the petition for condemnation, the City simply stated that: \u201cThis property will be used for redevelopment purposes; namely in the Charles North Project area.\u201d The petition for immediate possession and title referenced an attached affidavit which provided only a conclusory and general statement that: \u201cThe property ... must be in possession of the [City] at the earliest time possible <em>in order to assist in a business expansion in the area.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added]. The trial court found, based upon these petitions, as well as from the testimony and exhibits introduced at the April 18, 2006, hearing, that the City failed \u201cto demonstrate sufficient grounds which warrant the findings of necessity requisite for the immediate taking\u201d of the Property. We agree with Judge Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The record does not demonstrate sufficient evidence to support a finding that the City is entitled to <em>immediate </em>possession of the Property. As stated <em>supra, </em>the affidavit attached to the petition for immediate possession and title only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>provides that immediate possession is necessary \u201cin order to assist in a business expansion in the area.\u201d This statement, in and of itself, while perhaps sufficient to justify regular condemnation, does not justify a quick-take condemnation. <em>Cfi Free State, supra </em>(where affidavit showed necessity for public safety). Furthermore, the testimony of the BDC officials at the hearing did not serve to substantiate the City\u2019s claim of immediate need. Mr. Dombrowski testified as to what a business expansion in the area meant, stating: \u201cIt means to us, at least, the opportunity to provide for additional business expansion opportunities.\u201d When asked whether there was a specific plan for the development of the Property, he replied: \u201cNot as yet because the procedure we follow is through a request for proposal procedure as you well know.\u201d Mr. Brodie disagreed with Mr. Dombrowski\u2019s statements to the effect that there was no specific plan for development of the property. However, when asked about what specific uses were called for in the plan for the Property, he declined to, or could not, provide a specific answer. He replied, \u201c[s]o there are obviously a spectrum of uses that are permitted. That [is] as specific as most urban renewal plans are.\u201d Furthermore, he stated that \u201cthe specific design for redevelopment will come out of a proposal by a private sector developer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">While the existence of a general urban renewal plan might, under some circumstances, justify the use of regular condemnation, it, alone, under the statute applicable in the instant case, does not suffice to provide the immediacy that needs to exist to justify quick-take condemnation with its lesser procedural due process standards. The vague explanation of \u201cbusiness expansion,\u201d subject to non-existent amorphous future proposals, does not justify the City\u2019s use of quick-take condemnation. The City needs a more concrete, immediate necessity for an exercise of such power that the \u201cpublic interest\u201d requires. \u00a7 21-16(d). <em>See e.g., Free State, </em>279 Md. at 552, 369 A.2d at 1031 (the Court found that, based upon an affidavit, the property constituted an immediate serious and growing menace to public health, safety and welfare); <em>Segall v. City of Baltimore, </em>273 Md. 647, 648, 331 A.2d 298, 298-99 (1975) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>(affidavit showed that all other properties in the development area had been acquired and sale of the entire site could not completed until the subject property had been acquired).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>But see Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Kelso Corp., </em>281 Md. 514, 518, 380 A.2d 216, 218-19 (1977) (property owner never challenged the City\u2019s compliance with the formal requirements of \u00a7 21-16 or lack of power to condemn, and therefore had no basis to attack the City\u2019s quick-take condemnation action); <em>Kelso Corp. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>45 Md.App. 120, 129, 411 A.2d 691, 696 (1980) (Discussing quick-take proceeding in Baltimore City, the Court of Appeals found that \u201cappellant has failed to show that the City lacked the power or right to condemn its property.\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">It is important to note that the opportunities to challenge a condemnation are shortened and truncated when quick-take condemnation is used as opposed to regular condemnation. The court processes available to an owner under the quick-take are severely curtailed, as is well exhibited in the present case. The property owner was ordered out of possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>his property just six days from the time of the filing of the action and only learned that he was dispossessed when the order was served upon him. Then the time for him to respond was so short that he was not afforded time to conduct\u2014or really to begin\u2014discovery procedures in order to be able to address the issues of public use, necessity, or immediacy. Yet, the City did not at that time have present plans for the utilization of the Property and would only know what was to be done with the Property when private developers submitted proposals to it\u2014which might be in an indeterminant future.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"API\">The desire for the general assemblage of properties for urban renewal might be sufficient to justify the use of regular condemnation proceedings, but absent more specific and compelling evidence than was presented here, does not satisfy the immediacy and necessity requirements under quick-take condemnation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As quick-take is used in this instance by the City, it lends itself to the view that quick-take may be used primarily for the purpose of severely limiting the ability of property owners to resist condemnation. Such a use would violate the rights of property owners, fundamental rights that are protected by the Federal and State Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The framers of the Federal Bill of Rights did not place the property rights clause in some obscure part of these documents. It was placed in an amendment considered by many to be among the most important sections of that foundation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>stone of our form of democracy. It is found in the Fifth Amendment, included with the double jeopardy clause and the privilege against coerced self-incrimination in criminal cases clause. U.S. Const, amend. V. Immediately alongside those cornerstones of our democracy lies the property rights clause: \u201cNo person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, <em>without due process of law; </em>nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d U.S. Con st. amend. V (emphasis added). Reverence is due the property rights clause just as is due the other great provisions of the Fifth Amendment. It is a fundamental right.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">It is in that context that we closely scrutinize issues relating to the abridgment of property rights and are careful in an appropriate case, not only to consider the use, or \u201cpurpose,\u201d proposed for the forced governmental acquisition of private property, but also to examine the procedural methods used to deprive an owner of his property. It is our function to determine what process is due in a given case. When, and if, a governmental entity attempts to unnecessarily utilize a form of condemnation that procedurally abridges the right of the property owner to contest the taking of his or her property, it is the function of the court to assure to the property owner that his or her procedural rights are protected. Judge Miller fully recognized what was occurring and with his judgment rectified the abridgment of Mr. Valsamaki\u2019s right to full due process under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, the <em>factually unjustified exercise </em>of quick-take condemnation rather than regular condemnation is an improper procedural abridgment of these rights. Quick-take condemnation should only be conducted when the need for the possession of the property is immediate (i.e., at the time of filing the petition, immediately necessary) and in the public interest. Otherwise, the City should utilize the regular condemnation power which permits a property owner the full exercise of his or her procedural due process rights. Under circumstances where there is no immediacy, the use of quick-take condemnation deprives a property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>owner of a significant part of the process to which he or she is due, without any corresponding necessity on the part of the City to justify that deprivation. When the stockpiling of property is the goal, except perhaps under some circumstances relating to a final acquisition, the regular condemnation power is more appropriate, in that it affords greater procedural due process protections to the property owner. Nor is the use of quick-take proper purely in order to gain a litigation advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">It is useful to understand some other important differences and effects between quick-take condemnation and regular condemnation, especially as they relate to the exercise of eminent domain in respect to the taking of commercial or business properties. In regular condemnation, a taking authority files suit in court to condemn the property and, while the months (or years) long process goes on, the property owner maintains possession of his residence or business, operates it in the case of a business (albeit that the pendency of condemnation proceedings can adversely affect that business, i.e., the ability to obtain financing, the ability to have credit extended to the business, and the like), or resides in it if a residence and, if ultimately, the property owner prevails on h is or her lack of public u se (or purpose) argument, his or her residence or business continues.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">When quick-take procedures are used, the taking entity obtains almost immediate possession of the property and in the process the business being conducted on the property, for all intents and purposes, is destroyed. Then, the quick-take process seriously circumscribes the procedural due process available in regular condemnation cases, a process in regular condemnation that contemplates that a property owner have a full opportunity to at least mount an effective challenge to the public nature of the use or purpose behind the taking. Instead of having a full opportunity to challenge the justification of the condemning authority, in quick-take condemnations the property is taken and he or she is left to argue, primarily, only about compensation as the property is already gone. Even if down the road, six months, a year, whatever period of time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>the property owner is able to meet the burden of challenging the intended public use of the property, the business itself is gone. The viable business, that he or she may have spent the better part of a lifetime building up, is gone. In many instances, an owner of a family (or other) business may be unable to simply start-up where he or she was before the condemning authority, via the quick-take process, destroyed the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Even when residential properties are taken by quick-take condemnation, it will often be impossible to place the property owner in the pre-condemnation condition if the property owner ultimately were to prevail. By that time the owner\u2019s home may have been destroyed. It is impossible to put him or her back in a pre-quick-take position.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">In essence, quick-take procedures can be used inappropriately to destroy altogether the right of the property owner to challenge the public use prong of eminent domain which, although greatly circumscribed by various state and federal cases, remains as a viable aspect of the use of eminent domain powers, or otherwise the courts would be writing language out of the constitution by judicial f\u00edat.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">It is for these and similar reasons that the lower courts should carefully scrutinize the use of this quick-take procedure to ensure that its use, in the first place, is supported by the immediacy,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> not of the process, but of the alleged public need. General allegations that \u201cwe are using it in this case because sometime in the future we want to request proposals from some unnamed and unknown developers, for us to consider, so that we can then convey the property to a developer and it will then construct something that will help \u2018renew\u2019 this property,\u201d simply do not suffice. In cases involving this type of condemnation, courts should also seriously consider whether the condemning entity is using this quick-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>take merely to gain a procedural advantage or to stockpile properties that it will later sell to private developers, or simply to freeze the value of the property in a time of a rising economy. These improper, potential considerations dictate that the entity attempting to utilize this process, clearly assert the specific immediacy of the need.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The statute that applies in this case, \u00a7 21-16 of the Public Local Laws of Baltimore City, does not merely say that possession of the premises may be immediate, but, just as, if not more, important, given that it involves fundamental constitutional rights of individuals, it limits the use of the particular type of condemnation to cases where the need for the property is immediate. It requires that its use be \u201cnecessary\u201d for \u201cimmediate possession or immediate title\u201d and requires the City to give \u201cthe reasons therefore.\u201d \u00a7 21-16(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">At the hearing below, the agents of the City literally refused to answer any questions directed at the immediate need for this specific property, but appeared to have adopted the attitude that the City did not have to have a specific immediate need for the property, so long as sometime in the near or distant future they had such a need. That may (or may not) suffice in regular condemnation proceedings. It is not sufficient when the City chooses to initiate quick-take proceedings. The conferring of quick-take power on Baltimore City (and certain other local governments) was not for the purpose of allowing such entities to use it \u201cwhenever they wanted to\u201d but to use it only when immediate possession or title was necessary, and then only when they can establish sufficient reasons for the immediacy of the taking. This extraordinary power conferred upon the City was not granted to it for it to use if it were merely convenient when the need for the use of the property was not immediately necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The purpose of the quick-take power is for it to be used when the need for the public use is immediate. It was not conferred for the purpose of allowing a condemning authority to run \u201croughshod\u201d over the owners of private property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>When that happens, or begins to happen, the property owner\u2019s recourse is to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Public Use/Purpose</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Both parties present positions and arguments in respect to the alleged public use of the Property. The City argues that the Circuit Court\u2019s reliance on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kelo v. City of New London, Connecticut, </em>545 U.S. 469, 125 S.Ct. 2655, 162 L.Ed.2d 439 (2005), was misplaced. In support of this argument, the City asserts that Maryland recognizes economic development as a public purpose and thus, the enactment of an urban renewal plan under Ordinance No. 82-799 and Ordinance No. 04-695, in and of itself, establishes the legal authority for the City\u2019s acquisition of the Property by quick-take condemnation. While urban renewal certainly may be the basis for a government\u2019s taking of private property, a government entity must provide some assurance that the urban renewal will constitute a public use or public purpose for the property taken. It is not enough, especially in quick-take situations, for the City to simply say that it is conducting urban renewal and leave it at that. <em>See, infra. </em>The much discussed Supreme Court <em>Kelo </em>decision, a case involving the use of the regular condemnation power, not quick-take power,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> sheds some light on the public use/purpose issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\n<em>Kelo v. City of New London</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">In 2000, the city of New London, Connecticut approved a development plan for a distressed waterfront area of the city. <em>Id. </em>at 471-72, 125 S.Ct. at 2658. The purpose behind the plan was to stimulate economic revitalization. In accomplishing this, the plan was \u201c \u2018projected to create in excess of 1,000 jobs, to increase tax and other revenues, and to revitalize an economically distressed city, including its downtown and waterfront areas.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kelo v. City of New London, </em>268 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Conn. 1, 5, 843 A.2d 500, 507 (2004)). In order to implement the plan, the city\u2019s development agent began to purchase properties from willing sellers and had proposed \u201cto use the power of eminent domain to acquire the remainder of the property from unwilling owners in exchange for just compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The resulting primary issue in <em>Kelo </em>was \u201cwhether the city\u2019s proposed disposition of th[e] property qualifie[d] as a \u2018public use\u2019 within the meaning of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The city of New London authorized a private non-profit entity, the New London Development Corporation (\u201cNLDC\u201d), to assist the city in its development planning. Various state agencies and the city council evaluated six alternative development proposals for the Fort Trumball area and, after \u201cobtaining state-level approval, the NLDC finalized an integrated development plan.... \u201d <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. at 473, 125 S.Ct. at 2659. The development plan concerned seven parcels and specifically provided for the composition of each parcel. The parcels would be comprised of (1) a waterfront conference hotel located in a \u201csmall urban village\u201d with restaurants, shopping, commercial and recreational marinas; (2) \u201capproximately 80 new residences organized into an urban neighborhood;\u201d (3) \u201cat least 90,000 square feet of research and development office space;\u201d (4A) a 2.4 acre site to be used either to support an adjacent state park or to support the nearby marina; (4B) a renovated marina; and (5, 6, 7) office, retail space, and parking. <em>Id. </em>at 473, 125 S.Ct. at 2659. A pedestrian \u201criverwalk\u201d would run the course of the waterfront along parcels 1 through 4B.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In January 2000, the city council of New London approved the plan and authorized the NLDC, as its development agent, to acquire properties within the development area by purchasing them or exercising eminent domain. The conflict arose when several individuals refused to sell their homes and other property and the NLDC commenced eminent domain proceedings. There was no evidence that the subject properties were \u201cblighted or otherwise in poor condition; rather, they were condemned only because they happened to be located in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>development area.\u201d <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. at 475-76, 125 S.Ct. at 2660.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">As a preliminary matter, Justice Stevens, 'writing for the Supreme Court, stated two general propositions regarding takings. First, \u201cthe City would no doubt be forbidden from taking petitioner\u2019s land for the purpose of conferring a private benefit on a particular private party.\u201d <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. at 477-78, 125 S.Ct. at 2661 (citing <em>Midkiff, </em>467 U.S. at 245, 104 S.Ct. 2321, 81 L.Ed.2d 186; <em>Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Nebraska, </em>164 U.S. 403, 17 S.Ct. 130, 41 L.Ed. 489 (1896)). Second, \u201c[n]or would the City be allowed to take property under the mere pretext of a public purpose, when its actual purpose was to bestow a private benefit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court, however, distinguished the situation in <em>Kelo, </em>finding that it did not fall under either of the two propositions because \u201c[t]he takings ... would be executed pursuant to a \u2018carefully considered\u2019 development plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Kelo, </em>268 Conn. at 54, 843 A.2d at 536).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The Court then proceeded to emphasize the requirement that the development plan satisfy a \u201cpublic purpose,\u201d as opposed to a \u201cpublic use.\u201d This is evidenced by the fact that the \u201c \u2018Court long ago rejected any literal requirement that condemned property be put into use for the general public.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. at 478-80, 125 S.Ct. at 2662 (quoting <em>Midkiff, </em>467 U.S. at 244, 104 S.Ct. at 2331).

Therefore, the Court found that \u201c[t]he disposition of this case [ ] turns on the question whether the City\u2019s development plan serves a \u2018public purpose.\u2019 Without exception, our cases have defined that concept broadly, reflecting our longstanding policy of deference to legislative judgments in this field.\u201d <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. at 480-81, 125 S.Ct. at 2663.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>The reto Court looked to. two cases, relevant to our evaluation of the case <em>sub judice, </em>in discussing situations in which the Supreme Court has found a taking justified by a valid public purpose: <em>Berman v.

That plan targeted blighted residential properties which were beyond repair. The area would be redeveloped with new streets, schools, public facilities, and low-cost housing. The Court found that: \u201cThe plan ... specifie[d] the boundaries and allocate[d] the use of the land for various purposes. It ma[de] detailed provisions for types of dwelling units and provide[d] that at least one-third of them [were] to be low rent housing with a maximum rental of $17 per room per month.\u201d <em>Berman, </em>348 U.S. at 30-31, 75 S.Ct. at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The owner of a piece of property located within the redevelopment area objected to the condemnation of the property. Though it was undisputed that the property\u2014consisting of a department store\u2014was not blighted, it was nonetheless condemned as part of the plan. There, the property owner argued that taking a person\u2019s property \u201cmerely to develop a better balanced, more attractive community\u201d was not a public purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 31, 75 S.Ct. at 102; <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. at 480-81, 125 S.Ct. at 2663.

The statute provided condemnation authority for transferring fee title of property from lessors to lessees for just compensation. The Court found a valid public use in the elimination of the \u201csocial and economic evils of a land oligopoly.\u201d <em>Midkiff, </em>467 U.S. at 241-42, 104 S.Ct. at 2330. In deciding that government does not have to actually utilize taken property itself, the Court stated that \u201cit is only the taking\u2019s purpose, and not its mechanics, that must pass scrutiny under the Public Use Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 104 S.Ct. at 2331.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In <em>Kelo, </em>the Court deferred to the legislature\u2019s judgment, finding that \u201c[t]he City has carefully formulated an economic development plan that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including-but by no means limited to-new jobs and increased tax revenue.\u201d 545 U.S. at 483-84, 125 S.Ct. at 2665.

Based upon the comprehensive development plan and the Court\u2019s prior decisions in <em>Berman </em>and <em>Midkiff </em>concerning judicial deference towards the legislature, the <em>Kelo </em>Court affirmed the city of New London\u2019s and NLDC\u2019s use of eminent domain via the regular condemnation power. The Court concluded: \u201cIn affirming the City\u2019s authority to take petitioners\u2019 properties, we do not minimize the hardship that condemnations may entail, notwithstanding the payment of just compensation. We emphasize that nothing in our opinion precludes any State from placing further restrictions on its exercise of the takings power.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. at 488-90, 125 S.Ct. at 2668 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the necessity for immediate possession (in contrast to the public use or public purpose to be achieved) is not sufficiently shown by the evidence introduced by the City in order to justify the use of quick-take condemnation, as opposed to the regular condemnation power.

Simply put, he stated that such a plan would be forthcoming sometime in the future when the City received a response to a \u201cRequest for proposals\u201d (RFP)\u2014should that ever occur. Mr. Brodie disagreed with Mr. Dombrowski\u2019s contention that there was no plan for the Property. He testified that \u201cmixed-use development\u201d was as specific as renewal plans generally are in such instances. In addition, however, Mr. Brodie testified that \u201cthe specific design for redevelopment will come out of a proposal by a private sector developer.\u201d Therefore, the only \u201cplan\u201d for the Property is that a private developer will possibly, at some future time, create a plan that the City might approve. The evidence, or lack thereof, as presented in this case, is not sufficient to demonstrate an immediate public interest necessitating the City\u2019s use of quick-take condemnation, under \u00a7 21-16 of the Public Local Laws of Baltimore City, to acquire the Property. Nor does it, in our view, fully comport with the holdings of the Supreme Court in <em>Kelo, Midkiff, </em>and <em>Berman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The takings in <em>Kelo </em>and <em>Berman </em>were conducted pursuant to comprehensive development plans that were in place prior to the takings. <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. at 473-74, 477, 125 S.Ct. at 2659, 2661 (\u201cThe takings before us, however, would be execut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ed pursuant to a \u2018carefully considered\u2019 development plan.\u201d); <em>Berman, </em>348 U.S. at 30-31, 75 S.Ct. at 101 (\u201cThe plan ... specifie[d] the boundaries and allocate[d] the use of the land for various purposes. It ma[de] detailed provisions for types of dwelling units and provide[d] that at least one-third of them [were] to be low rent housing with a maximum rental of $17 per room per month.\u201d). In fact, the <em>Kelo </em>Court found that: \u201cHad the public use in <em>Berman </em>been defined more narrowly, it would have been difficult to justify the taking of the plaintiffs nonblighted department store.\u201d <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. at 484 n. 13, 125 S.Ct. at 2665 n. 13. Furthermore, in both <em>Kelo </em>and <em>Berman, </em>the developers were bound by contracts to execute the legislatively dictated development plans. <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. at 486 n. 15, 125 S.Ct. at 2666 n. 15 (\u201cNotably, as in the instant case, the private developers in <em>Berman </em>were required by contract to use the property to carry out the redevelopment plan. See 348 U.S., at 30, 75 S.Ct. 98, 99 L.Ed. 27.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Under the scheme extant here, private developers are not contractually bound\u2014and may never be, because proposals may never be presented or approved. Additionally, it is impossible for a private property owner to be made aware of the contractual conditions at the time of the quick-take when such contracts do not exist. It is virtually impossible to determine the extent of the pubhc/private dichotomy when no one knows the who, what, and whether of the future use of the property. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the City has not even issued an RFP to acquire proposals for development plans for the subject Property, let alone contractually obligated a developer to develop the Property for a public use in a manner sufficient to satisfy the public purpose requirement. Nor can a property owner challenge the public use aspect of a plan for a property until there is a plan in place for the use of that property.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Finally, both <em>Berman </em>and <em>Midkiff </em>are distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice </em>based upon the condition of the property in the cases prior to condemnation proceedings. As Justice O\u2019Connor wrote in her dissent in <em>Kelo: </em>\u201cIn both those cases <em>[Berman </em>and <em>Midkiff], </em>the extraordinary, precondemnation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>use of the targeted property inflicted affirmative harm on society-in <em>Berman </em>through blight resulting from extreme poverty and in <em>Midkiff </em>through oligopoly resulting from extreme wealth.\u201d <em>Kelo, </em>545 U.S. at 499-500, 125 S.Ct. at 2674 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\n<em>Maryland Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The City argues that Maryland law recognizes economic development as a public purpose and that Ordinance No. 82-799 and Ordinance No. 04-695 implement an urban renewal plan which accomplishes or intends to accomplish such economic development. It is evident that the State recognizes economic development as a public purpose and constitutionally provides the City with authorization to utilize its power of eminent domain in achieving such development. It does not do so, however, without some restraint on the City\u2019s eminent domain power.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">As discussed <em>supra, </em>Article XI-B, \u00a7 1 of the Maryland Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he General Assembly of Maryland, by public local law, may authorize and empower the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore: (a) To acquire ... land and property of every kind ... for development or redevelopment. ...\u201d <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v.

Matthews, </em>368 Md. at 90, 792 A.2d at 299; <em>King, </em>298 Md. at 86, 467 A.2d at 1035. Section 21-16 of the Public Local Laws of Baltimore City, enacted by the Legislature in furtherance of Article III, \u00a7 40A, authorizes and empowers the City with quick-take condemnation authority to achieve such economic development.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">In exercising its quick-take condemnation authority, however, we restate that \u00a7 21-16 provides that the City must file a petition under oath stating the reasons why it is necessary to have <em>immediate </em>possession and the court must determine \u201cthat the public interest requires the City to have <em>immediate </em>possession of said property....\u201d \u00a7 21-16(a) and (d). This helps to provide justification that a taking is in fact for a public purpose. Then-Chief Judge Murphy, writing for the Court, has stated: \u201cWhether the use for which private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>property is taken is public or private is a judicial question, to be determined by the court; a legislative body cannot make a particular use either public or private by merely declaring it so.\u201d <em>Chertkof, </em>293 Md. at 43, 441 A.2d at 1051. <em>See Prince George\u2019s County v.

This was emphatically expressed well over a century ago in <em>New Central Coal Co. v. George\u2019s Creek Coal &amp; Iron Co., </em>37 Md. 537 (1873):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">\u201c[T]he Legislature has, by virtue of the right or power of eminent domain, the right to authorize, by compulsory process, the taking of private property for public uses, but for public uses only; and it is for the regulation of the exercise of this high and delicate power, and to secure full and ample compensation to the party aggrieved, that the constitutional provision has been adopted. Tt undoubtedly must rest as a general rule,\u2019 says Chancellor Kent, (2 Com. 340,) in the wisdom of the Legislature, to determine when public uses require the assumption of private property; but if they should take it for a purpose not of a public nature, as if the Legislature should take the property of A, and give it to B ... under the pretext of some public use or service, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>such cases would be gross abuses of their discretion, and fraudulent attacks on private right, and the law would clearly be unconstitutional and void. Whenever, therefore, the use is in fact public, or has for its object the public benefit or utility, though coupled with private objects of gain and emolument, the question of the exercise of the power of eminent domain over private property, is exclusively one of discretion in the Legislature; but <em>whether the use, in any particular case, be public or private, is a judicial question; for otherwise, the constitutional restraint would be utterly nugatory, and the Legislature could make any use public by simply declaring it so, and hence its will and discretion become supreme, however arbitrarily and tyran[n]ically exercised. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">37 Md. at 560 (emphasis added). Simply resting on the City\u2019s assertions in Ordinance No. 82-799 and Ordinance No. 04-695, that the Property will be taken for urban renewal or revitalization purposes is not sufficient to justify the abridgment of a property owner\u2019s rights to procedural due process by the use of the extreme power of quick-take condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In regular condemnations, however, only the public use, not the immediacy of the need, is at issue. In determining whether there is a valid public purpose for a regular condemnation action, we have looked to whether there is a comprehensive development plan. The Court stated in <em>Master Royalties </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">\u201cWe think that the requirement of a public purpose for the exercise of the power of eminent domain which the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment imposes upon the States is no more rigorous than the requirement of public use imposed by the Fifth Amendment upon the Federal Government\u2019s exercise of the power of eminent domain. <em>Berman v. Parker, </em>348 U.S. 26 (decided about a year after our <em>Herzinger </em>case) <em>seems to us controlling as showing that a taking in furtherance of a genuine urban renewal plan dealing with problems similar to those exist</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number><em>ing in the instant case,[</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>is a taking for a public purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-5\"><em>Master Royalties, </em>235 Md. at 88, 200 A.2d at 659 (emphasis added). In upholding a development plan for Baltimore City\u2019s harbor, the Court in <em>Marchant v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>146 Md. 513, 126 A. 884 (1924), stated: \u201cThe development of the harbor of Baltimore according to a comprehensive plan, by which the commerce of the port will be most advantageously served, and its future growth encouraged, is a project of distinctively public interest and purpose.\u201d 146 Md. at 521, 126 A. at 887 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In <em>Beard, </em>the Court addressed whether a proposed industrial park constituted a public use. 266 Md. 83, 291 A.2d 636. The Court found there to be insufficient evidence concerning the specific uses proposed for the industrial park and remanded the case, stating: \u201cUpon the remand the County will have full opportunity to spell out the use it proposes making of the property and all the details surrounding that use.... <em>In order for a court to perform its judicial function in this type of case the plan should indeed be comprehensive. </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96-97, 291 A.2d at 643 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\"><em>Collington Crossroads </em>concerned the same industrial park as that in Beard, however, by the time the issue reached the Court in that instance, a comprehensive plan had been developed. 275 Md. 171, 339 A.2d 278. The plan was developed to the point where the number of workers, jobs, and additional tax revenue could be predicted: \u201c \u2018Ultimately, 8,200 workers will probably be located on the Site, providing up to 5,800 new job opportunities for County residents. There will be a real property tax yield at Park completion of nearly $4.8 million annually.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177-78, 339 A.2d at 282. Furthermore, Prince George\u2019s County would maintain significant control over the project. As the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>\u201cThe County will subject land conveyed to private parties to certain \u2018development covenants.\u2019 The comprehensive plan provides that \u2018[tjhese covenants will deal with management of natural features, maintenance of health, safety and welfare, control of hazards and nuisances, and guidelines for assuring a high quality physical environment.\u2019 The entire industrial park will be placed in an EIA (Comprehensive Design for Employment and Institutional Areas) zoning classification. As the comprehensive plan states, the classification \u2018will offer Prince George\u2019s County the opportunity to control the detailed development of this 1700 acre area through the use of a three phase process of review and approval of detailed plans.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 180, 339 A.2d at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">All of these instances reflect greater specificity and planning than was presented as evidence below in the case <em>sub judice.</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, while economic development may be a public purpose, it must be carried out pursuant to a comprehensive plan. In a specific case, simply providing that a property is to be condemned \u201cfor urban renewal purposes,\u201d without more, is not enough.

Without evidence that the continuing existence of a particular building or property is immediately injurious to the health and safety of the public, or is otherwise immediately needed for public use, there is no way to justify the need for <em>immediate </em>possession of the Property via quick-take condemnation pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>eeedings. \u00a7 21-16(d). This is as opposed to offering a property owner the full process to which he or she is constitutionally due, via the exercise of the regular condemnation power.

Section 21-16(c) of the Public Local Laws of Baltimore City provides that an individual has ten days after being served with a petition for immediate taking of possession and title to property to file an answer challenging the City\u2019s right or power to condemn. In that event, the court must schedule a hearing within fifteen days of the date of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>filing of the answer. Therefore, a hearing would take place within 25 days of an individual being served with a petition. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 2\u2014421 (\"Interrogatories to parties\u201d) and Rule 2-422 (\"Discovery of documents and property\u201d), a party has 30 days to respond upon being served with a discovery request for interrogatories or documents. Additionally, Rule 2-417 (\"Deposition\u2014Written questions\u201d) provides that a party has 30 days from receipt of service of the notice to serve their own cross questions. So, not only is the time to prepare for trial drastically shortened in a quick-take action, but discovery in the ordinary course of litigation is virtually impossible. Important procedural due process protections are conspicuously absent from this stage of the proceeding in quick-take actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Because the issue of the facial constitutionality of this public local law process has not been adequately presented to the court, we shall not directly resolve it, although we shall express certain concerns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b260-9\">. The Baltimore City Solicitor's office is referred to as the \"Law Department.\u201d It appears that the practice of the Baltimore Development Corporation (\"BDC\u201d) is to first attempt negotiations for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>purchase of properties. Should those negotiations fail to result in a favorable purchase price for the City, or a purchase at all, the BDC turns to the Law Department to acquire properties via the exercise of eminent domain. Apparently, it is the decision of the Law Department as to whether to initiate traditional condemnation proceedings or to pursue a quick-take condemnation action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b262-16\">. <em>See </em>Ordinance 82-799's goals and objectives, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b263-14\">. Under the process utilized, while the City retains the power of approval and acceptance, the actual initial discussions as to how a property will be used are generated by private developers. This process is know as a \"Request for Proposals\u201d (\u201cRFP\u201d). It is apparent from the record that the City\u2019s process for redeveloping the Charles North Revitalization Area is first to obtain all, or at least many, of the properties targeted for renewal pursuant to Ordinance No. 04-695 (whether by purchase or condemnation) and then to issue an RFP to gamer development proposals from private developers. The City would then choose from amongst the proposals, should any be forthcoming. Under these circumstances, an owner of a property who is resisting condemnation has no knowledge as to what use his or her property will be put. In fact, not only is a property owner lacking of this knowledge, but the City is ignorant of specific proposals as well. The parties will only know what the use will be when proposals are received and one is chosen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b267-8\">. In <em>City of Chicago v. First Bank of Oak Park, </em>178 Ill.App.3d 321, 127 Ill.Dec. 552, 533 N.E.2d 424 (1988), the intermediate appellate court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Illinois, among other claims, dealt with the issue of \"whether the trial corut applied the proper standard for a \u2018quick-take\u2019 proceeding.\u201d 178 Ill.App.3d at 323, 127 Ill.Dec. 552, 533 N.E.2d at 425. The court noted: \"[T]he Code sets forth the allegations that must be contained in the motion for immediate vesting of title (quick-take) which include 'the formally adopted schedule or plan of operation for the execution of [condemnor's] project * * *; [and] <em>the necessity for taking such property in the manner requested in the motion.\u2019 \u201d Id. </em>at 325-26, 127 Ill.Dec. 552, 533 N.E.2d at 426 (emphasis added) (quoting Ill.Rev.Stat.1985, ch. 110). That court noted that in addition to determining the authority of the condemnor, it had to determine \" 'that such right is not being improperly exercised in the particular proceeding.' \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326, 127 Ill.Dec. 552, 533 N.E.2d at 426 (quoting Ill.Rev.Stat.1985, ch. 110). When that court, as has this court in many cases, noted that a condemnor had a burden of establishing \"a <em>prima facie </em>case of the necessity,\u201d it indicated, as dicta, that it also had the requirement of establishing immediacy. <em>Id. </em>at 327, 127 Ill.Dec. 552, 533 N.E.2d at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In another intermediate appellate court case from Illinois, <em>Department of Public Works &amp; Buildings v. Vogt, </em>51 Ill.App.3d 770, 9 Ill.Dec. 53, 366 N.E.2d 310 (1977), Vogt argued that the condemnor had utilized its quick-take power based on its representations that construction was so imminent that the vesting of title was required. Yet, no construction had commenced, nor were there even any plans finalized <em>four </em>years later. The Illinois statutes required the condemnor to specify why there was \"the necessity for taking such property in the manner requested....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 777, 9 Ill.Dec. 53, 366 N.E.2d at 314. The trial court had stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">\"The date of filing of an Eminent Domain suit is of paramount importance because the date of filing is the date used for evaluation of the subject property. The Court takes judicial notice of the fact that property values have increased steadily during the past ten years in this county, and that it would be manifestly unfair to permit any condemning authority to hurriedly file its condemnation petition when property values are relatively low, and then not be in a position to try the case until several years later when property values are relatively high.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 775, 9 Ill.Dec. 53, 366 N.E.2d at 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The Illinois intermediate appellate court held that \"it is an abuse of power for a condemning authority to 'quick take\u2019 property under the pretense of imminent necessity when there exists only some possibility of need at an indefinite future date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 779, 9 Ill.Dec. 53, 366 N.E.2d at 316. Furthermore, the court found that under the facts of the case, \"[cjlearly, petitioner knew that the construction on the project would not commence directly after the 'quick take.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 780, 9 Ill.Dec. 53, 366 N.E.2d at 317.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b269-5\">. \"...

Even if this <em>per se </em>declaration sufficed to establish public use under the provisions of the State Constitution, which we do not accept or reject, it would have no impact on the protections afforded property owners under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution. Nor does it justify the deprivation of process that may occur when the quick-take power\u2014as opposed to regular condemnation power\u2014is used.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\">. In contrast, the statutory and constitutional provisions conferring quick-take power on the State Roads Commission, do not expressly prescribe the requirement of immediacy. Accordingly, the City\u2019s quick-take powers are not the equivalent of the Commission\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b274-8\">. There is some indication from the record that the City, generally, may be misusing its quick-take condemnation power. Discussing when quick-take is used, the City\u2019s attorney stated at oral argument that: \u201cWe make a decision to take it by quick-take because we feel that the owner has been afforded every opportunity based upon the process we have in place.\u201d Additionally, at the hearing before the Circuit Court, the City\u2019s counsel made several statements concerning when it thought quick take was appropriate. The City stated: \"I think that when negotiation has taken place over a few years, then quick take becomes the appropriate measure to take to acquire a property\u201d and \"I think that 21-16 [the quick-take statute] was actually set up so that when there was a glitch in the system to acquire properly, that there would be another tool for acquisition____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Quick-take is not to be used simply because negotiations to purchase the property have failed. If the negotiation process has not resulted in the sale of a property, the City has the ability to initiate regular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>condemnation proceedings which provide all of the procedural due process protections that are absent from a quick-take condemnation proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\">. In <em>Free State, </em>as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>\u00a7 21-16 of the Public Local Laws of Baltimore City was the controlling statute. As discussed <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 21-16 provides that the court will grant immediate possession of a property pursuant to a quick-take condemnation action if the City files a petition under oath stating the reasons why it is necessary to have <em>immediate </em>possession and, if it appears from that petition, \u201cthat the public interest requires the City to have <em>immediate </em>possession of said property....\u201d \u00a7 21-16(a) and (d) (emphasis added). When a statute requires a governmental entity to meet a certain standard, the sufficiency of that entity\u2019s compliance with the statute will generally be subject to judicial review, especially when the deprivation of fundamental constitutional rights is involved. Thus, there is a statutory requirement that the City show immediate necessity and it is not sufficient to simply present a conclusory \u201cpublic use\u201d statement. Even when a statute expressly confirms public use status, it still remains, as we have indicated, ultimately a judicial question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b285-6\">. The situation in <em>Segall </em>is generally understood in land use law to be the \"hold-out\u201d factor. During property assemblages, whether private or public, one or more properly owners resist selling, wanting to be the last owner of a parcel or among the last, in order to be able to demand higher prices for their property because they are holding up a large project. In private acquisitions a purchaser\u2019s options in dealing with hold-outs are limited. In public acquisitions, the condemnation process\u2014even quick-take actions\u2014are available to address the situation. In the present case there was no evidence presented below that Mr. Valsamaki was a \u201chold-out\u201d or that an immediate taking (as opposed to regular condemnation) was necessary because the failure to <em>immediately </em>acquire the property would seriously and immediately impair the City\u2019s urban renewal needs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\">. It is evident in the case <em>sub judice, </em>that in the trial court proceeding, Mr. Valsamaki challenged the right of the City to condemn title to the Property based upon the City\u2019s failure to comply with the formal requirements of \u00a7 21-16. Mr. Valsamaki argued that the City lacked the right and power to initiate a quick-take condemnation action because it failed to show a public interest which necessitated <em>immediate </em>possession of the Property. Rather, the City only asserted the vague reason of \"business expansion,\" not subject to any particularized, detailed, or specific development plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b286-7\">.

The substitution of \u201cpublic purpose\u201d for \u201cpublic use\u201d has long been a staple of eminent domain law, both in Maryland and in the federal sphere.

After <em>Kelo, </em>there appeared a virtual blizzard of articles, treatises, law review articles, and the like. Most were critical of the opinion, but, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>more importantly, critical of the use of the power of eminent domain for urban renewal or economic development. The list of those articles is extensive and need not be listed in this note. Much of that criticism, can be typified by several comments in an article by Charles E. Cohen, <em>Eminent Domain after Kelo v. City of New London: An Argument for Banning Economic Development Takings, 29 </em>Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol\u2019y 491 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b296-5\">. Under a regular condemnation proceeding the City may well have introduced additional evidence reflecting a more comprehensive plan. We assume that the City, in a regular condemnation action, would be able to establish the \"public use/puipose\u201d of its plan. Though in such actions the City may want to consider offering much more evidence than it did in the present case. This would be beneficial in satisfying its minimal burden of presenting a <em>prima facie </em>case as to public use/purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b296-6\">. The Supreme Court addressed the \"lack of a reasoned explanation for a taking\u201d in <em>Cincinnati v. Vester, </em>281 U.S. 439, 50 S.Ct. 360, 74 L.Ed. 950 (1930). <em>Vester </em>concerned three consolidated Ohio cases which dealt with excess condemnation, \"that is, the taking of more land than is needed to be occupied by the improvement directly in contemplation.\u201d 281 U.S. at 441, 50 S.Ct. at 360. In <em>Vester, </em>the issue was whether the city of Cincinnati could appropriate property in excess of what was needed to widen a street. At the time of appropriation, the city did not have any specific plans for the excess property. Then-Chief Justice Hughes, writing for the Court, opined on the situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">\"We are thus asked to sustain the excess appropriation in these cases upon the bare statements of the resolution and ordinance of the city council, by considering hypothetically every possible, but undefined, use to which the city may put these properties, and by determining that such use will not be repugnant to the rights secured to the property owners by the Fourteenth Amendment. We are thus either to assume that whatever the city, entirely uncontrolled by any specific statement of its purpose, may decide to do with the properties appropriated, will be valid under both the state and Federal Constitutions, or to set up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>some hypothesis as to use and decide for or against the taking accordingly, although the assumption may be found to be foreign to the actual purpose of the appropriation as ultimately disclosed and the appropriation may thus be sustained or defeated through a misconception of fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 446, 50 S.Ct. at 362. The Court held that the takings did not conform to the laws of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">While the factual and procedural stance of Vaster is certainly distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice, </em>it does lend some weight to our discussion. It is not for the Court to have to guess what use the City may have for a particular piece of property. It is the City\u2019s responsibility to plan for economic development before condemnation occurs. This is not to say that the City does not have the flexibility to alter plans as the process moves along, but the City, using the quick-take procedure, cannot just stockpile an assemblage of properties without proving some further justification that those properties need to be taken immediately for a valid public use or purpose. In the case of quick-take condemnation, the City is statutorily required to show that there is an <em>immediate </em>necessity for the possession of a particular property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\">. The City did not specifically assert that the subject Property is blighted. The only reference to blight is in the City\u2019s petition for condemnation, which states: \"[The City] is duly authorized to acquire the Property Interest hereinafter described for public purposes by the following Ordinance(s) of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, viz: Article 13 \u00a7 2-7(h) of the Baltimore City Code (2000 Edition), approved November 11, 1999 and Ordinance No. 04-695, approved June 23, 2004.\" Simply referencing Article 13, \u00a7 2-7(h) of the Baltimore City Code, which provides for the acquisition of deteriorated or abandoned property, is not an affirmative assertion that the specific subject Property constitutes a \"serious and growing menace to the public health, safety and welfare.\u201d In any case, in terms of the action being a quick-take proceeding, rather than a traditional condemnation proceeding, the City would need to show <em>immediate </em>need for any such condemnation. <em>See Free State, </em>279 Md. at 552, 369 A.2d at 1031 (where the affidavit showed that the property \" 'constitute^] a serious and growing menace to the public health, safety and welfare\u2019 \u201d).
