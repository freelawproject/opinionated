The petitioner, a Maryland resident and registered voter in Baltimore County, is currently a student at a college in New York. Because she is living out-of-state while attending college, she could not vote personally at her precinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>polling station during the 2006 Maryland gubernatorial election. Rather, she intended to vote by absentee ballot. For that intent to be accomplished, her ballot had to be mailed to the County Board of Elections before Election Day. <em>See </em>Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 33.11.03.08(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The petitioner alleges that in mid-August 2006, she requested of the County Board of Elections in Catonsville, Maryland, by both facsimile and mail, an absentee ballot for both the primary and the general election.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The absentee ballot for the general election, bearing the postmark of November 1, 2006, did not arrive in the mail until Monday, November 6, 2006. Although the petitioner received it before midnight, at about 8:45 p.m., when she returned home, the time for all routine mail pickups had passed and no post offices near her were open at that time. She did not mail the absentee ballot until the next day, November 7, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Because Election Day was on November 7, 2006, and the ballot was not \u201ccompleted and mailed before election day,\u201d it was not be counted in the final tally. The petitioner, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>fore, contends that \u201c[djespite Appellants\u2019[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] diligence in meeting their obligation to timely request absentee ballots, Appellants were not able to vote in this election by virtue of Code of Maryland Regulations (\u2018COMAR\u2019) 33.11.03.08(b), which requires that absentee ballots be postmarked by November 6, 2006.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">The petitioners filed, on November 6, 2006, a complaint in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. The complaint contained four counts, asserting violations of the Maryland Constitution and Declaration of Rights. Count 1 alleged a violation of Article I, \u00a7\u00a7 1<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 3<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Maryland Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>tion and Article 7 of the Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Count 2 alleged a violation of the equal protection guarantee of Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Count 3 alleged a violation of the equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Count 4 purported to assert a violation of EL \u00a7 9-304,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> made actionable by Article 19 of the Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>The petitioners asked for two forms of relief: that the respondent, the Maryland State Board of Elections (\u201cthe Board\u201d),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> accept all absentee ballots postmarked on Election Day, Tuesday, November 7, 2006, or, in the alternative, preserve all such ballots, \u201cuntil such time as a full hearing on this matter may be conducted.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In support of the former, the petitioner noted the Governor\u2019s urging of citizens to vote by absentee ballot, and that a deficiency in the number of ballots available prevented a number of voters who had requested the ballots from being able to return them in the time frame allotted by the Board. This, the petitioner argues, has the effect of disenfranchising voters, through no fault of their own; the Board did not get the ballots out in time, putting those voters in the position of not having their votes counted. Thus, the petitioner urges, \u201cin order to give them that fundamental right to vote, ... we simply extend the time period for their votes to be counted so that they are postmarked at the end of [November 7] as opposed to [November 6].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">In response, the respondent points out that there is no constitutional right to an absentee ballot. They, in support of that proposition, cite <em>McDonald v. Board of Election Commissioners of Chicago, </em>394 U.S. 802, 807-808, 89 S.Ct. 1404, 1408, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>22 L.Ed.2d 739, 745 (1969), in which the Court held that absentee status, which was designed to make voting more available to some persons who cannot easily travel to polling places, does not, in itself, deny the right to exercise the franchise. Further, the respondent argues,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\">\u201cthe mere fact that the General Assembly of Maryland has made an absentee ballot process available does not mean that there is a constitutional right. Certainly not a constitutional right that is protected by a scrutiny analysis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Thus, the respondent argues that the regulation that designated the date that absentee ballots should be mailed is a reasonable one, especially in light of the fact that voters could still turn their absentee ballots in in-person if they were able to. Citing the four factor test of <em>Department of Transportation v. Armacost, </em>299 Md. 392, 474 A.2d 191 (1984), emphasizing the first factor, irreparable injury, the respondent observes that very little evidence of irreparable injury, if any, was provided by the complaint. They point out that no evidence was presented by the plaintiffs concerning the processing of absentee ballots, and neither of the two named plaintiffs testified, nor provided affidavits in support of the motion for a TRO. They also challenge the petitioners\u2019 standing, arguing that there was no evidence that \u201cthese two plaintiffs actually have the injury which their counsel alleges they have suffered.\u201d Moreover, the respondent is not convinced that the remedy sought-extending the voting deadline an additional day-would address the issue complained of or \u201cwhether the fact that the State Board and the local boards had some problems processing ballots is responsible for the injury that these particular Plaintiffs have suffered.\u201d The respondent asserts, as to the former, \u201c[i]t is completely speculative that if the Court orders the deadline extended by an additional day that these two Plaintiffs will, in fact, receive their ballots and will be permitted to vote in the way they say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">In an oral opinion, the Circuit Court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>\u201c[I]t is hard for me to ignore what Judge Wilner wrote in <em>Lamb v. Hammond. </em>Especially the last part that says, \u2018It would be a greater evil for the Courts to ignore the law itself by permitting election officials to ignore statutory requirements designed to safeguard the integrity of elections, which is the rights of the voters.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">\u201cAnd candidly, after reading all the material and looking at the standards, regretfully, I am not convinced that a TRO or a temporary injunction should be granted in this matter. I don\u2019t think the burden has been met. So, I am going to deny the motion.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Prior to the Circuit Court\u2019s issuance of its written order and mandate, the petitioner, on November 8, 2006, pursuant to EL \u00a7 12-203(a)(3), filed a direct interlocutory appeal to this Court, and petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which we granted. <em>Fritszche v. State, </em>395 Md. 485, 910 A.2d 1100 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Oral argument was held on November 13, 2006, and an order affirming the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment followed. This opinion explains the reasons for that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Maryland Rule 15-501 (b) defines a \u201cpreliminary injunction\u201d as \u201can injunction granted after opportunity for a full adversary hearing on the propriety of its issuance but before a final determination of the merits of the action.\u201d The granting of temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions is controlled by Maryland Rule 15-504, which provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-10\">\u201c(a) Standard for Granting. A temporary restraining order may be granted only if it clearly appears from specific facts shown by affidavit or other statement under oath that immediate, substantial, and irreparable harm will result to the person seeking the order before a full adversary hearing can be held on the propriety of a preliminary or final injunction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Moreover, this Court has enumerated four factors which must be considered by trial courts in deciding whether a TRO should issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\">\u201c(1) the likelihood that the plaintiff will succeed on the merits; (2) the \u2018balance of convenience\u2019 determined by whether greater injury would be done to the defendant by granting the injunction than would result from its refusal; (3) whether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction is granted; and (4) the public interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9A\"><em>In re Application of Kimmer, </em>392 Md. 251, 260, 896 A.2d 1006, 1012 (2006). <em>See also LeJeune v. Coin Acceptors, Inc., </em>381 Md. 288, 300-301, 849 A.2d 451, 458-59 (2004); <em>Fogle v. H &amp; G Restaurant, Inc., </em>337 Md. 441, 654 A.2d 449 (1995); <em>Lerner v.

Baltimore County, </em>281 Md. 548, 554, 383 A.2d 51, 55 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The gravamen of the petitioner\u2019s claim is that the Board, in failing to answer the overwhelming call for absentee ballots, has violated both State and Federal law by \u201cdenying eligible voters the opportunity to vote or, at least, by imposing a severe burden on the right to vote.\u201d She notes that following the General Assembly\u2019s enactment of legislation, which gave every Maryland voter the right to cast an absentee ballot as long as a timely request was made to the local board of elections, Governor Ehrlich urged the voters to take advantage of this option \u201c \u2018to avoid long lines and malfunctioning technology at polling places,\u2019 \u201d that as of Thursday, November 2, 2006, approximately 186,000 registered voters requested to vote by absentee ballot\u2014\u201calmost triple the number of absentee ballots submitted during the most recent mid-term election in 2002,\u201d\u2014and asserts that \u201c[a]s a result of this onslaught of absentee ballot requests, local boards of election have been unable to timely fulfill absentee ballot orders, creating a statewide emergency.\u201d The result, the petitioner claims, is that many voters did not receive ballots in time to have them postmarked on November 6, 2006. She notes further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATF\">\u201cAccording to the Maryland General Assembly\u2019s Office of Legislative Audits, problems with the printing and delivery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>of absentee ballots to local boards were identified nearly three weeks ago, during the week of October 16, 2006.[ ] Despite the early identification of these problems, many counties simply were not supplied with absentee ballots by the Appellees\u2019 vendor with any time left for them to timely fulfill the voters\u2019 absentee ballot requests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">The petitioner argues that COMAR 33.11.03.08(b), which establishes the November 6, 2006 deadline, \u201crepresents the discretionary exercise of the Appellees\u2019 regulatory powers,\u201d and that no statute requires this deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In order to succeed on the merits, the petitioner must show that the election regulation establishing the deadline for the postmark of absentee ballots, as executed and applied, is \u201carbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Baltimore Import Car Service &amp; Storage, Inc. v. Maryland Port Authority, </em>258 Md. 335, 342, 265 A.2d 866, 869 (1970). When an administrative agency, such as the Board, is vested with discretion, and exercises it within the scope of its authority, the courts will not intervene and substitute their judgment for that of the administrative body. <em>Baltimore Import Car Service &amp; Storage, Inc., </em>258 Md. at 342, 265 A.2d at 869; <em>Stacy v. Montgomery County, </em>239 Md. 189, 194, 210 A.2d 540, 543 (1965); <em>Kaufman v. Taxicab Bureau, </em>236 Md. 476, 204 A.2d 521, 523 (1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 849, 86 S.Ct. 95, 15 L.Ed.2d 88 (1965); <em>Serio v. Mayor &amp; C.C. of Baltimore, </em>208 Md. 545, 551, 119 A.2d 387, 390 (1956); <em>Masson v. Reindollar, </em>193 Md. 683, 688-689, 69 A.2d 482 (1949); <em>Gianforte v. Bd. of License Com\u2019rs, </em>190 Md. 492, 58 A.2d 902 (1948). Courts will act, however, where an administrative decision is not supported by facts, or where an action is not within the scope of delegated authority, or is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. <em>Baltimore Import Car Service &amp; Storage, Inc., </em>258 Md. at 342, 265 A.2d at 869; <em>Board of Education of Carroll County v. Allender, </em>206 Md. 466, 475, 112 A.2d 455, 459 (1955); <em>Heaps v. Cobb, </em>185 Md. 372, 380, 45 A.2d 73, 76 (1945); <em>Hecht v. Crook, </em>184 Md. 271, 280-281, 40 A.2d 673, 677 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The petitioner offers a number of examples that point to the fact that the regulation, as applied, resulted in an unreasonable denial of the absentee voters\u2019 right to vote. First, the petitioner notes that the Board of Elections of Prince George\u2019s County completed its absentee ballot mailing on Saturday, November 4, 2006, \u201callowing at most one business day for absentee ballots to be delivered to voters\u2019 mailboxes and for voters to complete, sign, and postmark the absentee ballots by November 6,\u201d and \u201c[f]or voters who did not receive their ballots until the afternoon of November 6, this time period may have been just a matter of hours, if there was any time at all.\u201d The petitioner notes that voters with Maryland residences who requested their ballots be mailed out-of-state may not have received their ballots at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Second, the petitioner states that, as of Monday, November 6, 2006, the Maryland State Board of Elections reported that at least 900 absentee ballots were not sent out until Saturday, November 4, 2006, and approximately 2,350 ballots were not sent out until Friday, November 3. Thus, she concludes, \u201c[a]s a result of these delays, many voters have not received or were not able to send out their absentee ballots by the postmark date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The Board, in response, concludes \u201c[i]t is impossible to determine whether this processing close to the November 6 postmark deadline was due to a large backlog of requests, the timing of the requests; or a combination of those factors \u2014 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It points out that \u201c[m]any Maryland voters apparently waited until the midnight of the October 31 deadline to request an absentee ballot.\u201d COMAR 33.11.02.02D.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>more, it notes that a large number of requests were processed on the days preceding the November 6 postmark deadline, and that a large number of absentee ballots that were mailed in were processed on the days preceding the election. The Board urges upholding the Circuit Court decision, on the basis that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">\u201ca number of pertinent factors are simply unknown, including: how many ballots will be returned that are postmarked November 7; how many of that number were sent by people who made late requests for the ballots; how many of the November 7 postmarked ballots were sent by people who received ballots in time to return them by the November 6 deadline but waited to put them in the mail; how many late-arriving ballots were due to tardy mail delivery, as opposed to late mailing by the local board; or and any number of other pertinent facts. Some of these facts can be ascertained in the coming days, some can never be ascertained, and none of them was known to the circuit court ... when it denied the plaintiffs request for TRO.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">This Court agrees with the Board. The record is scant and not well developed; as a result, there was very little for the trial court to use in order to grant a TRO, and, transitively, very little for this Court to use to overturn its decision. No evidence was presented showing that, other than the petitioner, particular ballots arrived at particular voters\u2019 residences too late to permit those voters to vote. Nothing has been presented that establishes a link between the Board\u2019s processing of the absentee ballots and the delay in absentee ballot returns. While, to be sure, a number of ballots were mailed very close to Election Day, it is unknown which of the ballots that were postmarked after November 6 were from voters who received them earlier but merely were tardy in returning them and which were ballots that were received late and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>therefore, could not have been returned earlier. This lack of evidence results in the petitioner\u2019s failure to establish that the COMAR regulation, as applied, was the primary cause of the petitioner\u2019s injury, i.e. that it was, as applied, \u201carbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.\u201d As articulated by the respondent, \u201c[the petitioner\u2019s argument] would require courts to entertain petitions from prospective voters attesting that they would have mailed the ballot but for their reliance on the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">This Court will not second guess the decision made by the State Board of Elections to refuse to include any absentee ballots that failed the requirements of COMAR 33.11.03.08(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The petitioner also argues that <em>\u201cLamb </em>strongly suggests that the state must accommodate Appellants and similarly situated voters by accepting ballots postmarked on November 7, 2006,\u201d because <em>\u201cLamb\u2019s </em>basic holding was that state election statutes should be strictly applied notwithstanding the negligence of state officials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\"><em>Lamb v. Hammond </em>involved a close race between two candidates for a seat in the House of Delegates. Trailing Lamb by three votes, Hammond challenged the decision of the Board of Elections not to count 24 absentee ballots, 12 of which were rejected unopened, due to a deficiency based on the ballots\u2019 postmarks, and 12 of which were rejected for other deficiencies. 308 Md. at 290, 518 A.2d at 1059. The trial court opened the 12 unopened ballots and, noting that each voter had signed an affidavit that the ballot had been completed and mailed no later than the day before the election, 308 Md. at 290, 518 A.2d at 1059, ordered the board to accept those votes. That resulted in Hammond being declared the \u2022winner by one vote. 308 Md. at 289, 518 A.2d at 1058. Lamb appealed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>The merits of the issue before the Court involved whether the disputed absentee ballots should have been eounted pursuant to Md.Code (1957, 1983 RepLVol., 1985 Cum.Supp.) Art. 33, \u00a7 27-9(c)(l). That statute designated an absentee ballot as timely if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">\u201c(i) It has been received by the board prior to the closing of the polls on election day; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">\u201c(n)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">\u201c1. It was mailed before election day;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\u201c2. The United State[s] Postal Service, or the postal service of any other country, has provided verification of that fact by affixing a mark so indicating on the covering envelope; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">\u201c3. The board receives the ballot from the United States Postal Service not later than 4 p.m. on the Wednesday following election day.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Pursuant to this statute, the Court analyzed the votes and concluded that, despite the affidavits, the ballots were postmarked too late, and, thus, were untimely. 308 Md. at 308-309, 518 A.2d at 1068. Hammond, the winner as a result of the included votes, fought on two separate grounds against this technical noncompliance: \u201c(1) that the requirement of Verification\u2019 by postmark is merely \u2018directory,\u2019 that the only \u2018mandatory\u2019 requirement is that the ballot be received by the alternate deadline, and that, as the \u2018mandatory\u2019 requirement has been satisfied, there has been substantial compliance with the law, and (2) that a voter should not be disenfranchised for technical noncompliance with the statutory requirement where he or she follows the instructions of the election officials.\u201d 308 Md. at 309, 518 A.2d at 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">This Court dismissed the notion that clear commands from the Legislature may be disregarded as \u201cmerely directory,\u201d explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">\u201cThe Legislature has accorded absentee voters a special privilege not shared by other voters\u2014the privilege of having their vote count even though received by the election officials after the polls have closed. Unqualified, or qualified only by a deadline on <em>receipt </em>of the ballot, that privilege could become a distinctly unfair political advantage; it would allow a group of voters actually to cast their ballots after the polls had closed, and thus open the way for some very unwholesome machinations.
