Because relators have established their entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief, we grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">{\u00b6 2} On March 21, 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23. Pub.L.No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010). Among other things, the act requires individuals to maintain minimum essential healthcare coverage beginning in 2014 and imposes a penalty for failure to maintain this coverage. Section 1501, Subtitle F, Part 1 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">{\u00b6 3} On March 22, relators gathered over 3,000 signatures to submit an initiative petition to amend the Ohio Constitution \u201cto preserve the freedom of Ohioans to choose their health care and health care coverage.\u201d Relators are Ohio Liberty Council, a nonprofit corporation and political action committee that is a statewide coalition of 25 grassroots groups, including nearly all of Ohio\u2019s Tea Party organizations; the Ohio Project, a ballot-issue committee; and five Ohio Liberty Council members who are state electors.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">{\u00b6 4} On April 1, pursuant to R.C. 3519.01(A), the attorney general certified that relators\u2019 summary of their proposed amendment contained \u201ca fair and truthful statement of the proposed constitutional amendment\u201d and then forwarded the proposed amendment to the secretary of state, in her capacity as the chair of the Ohio Ballot Board, for the board\u2019s consideration under R.C. 3505.062.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>{\u00b6 5} The amendment, which proposes to add Section 21 to Article I of the Ohio Constitution, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cARTICLE I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cPreservation of the freedom to choose health care and health care coverage</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cSection 21(A) No federal, state, or local law or rule shall compel, directly or indirectly, any person, employer, or health care provider to participate in a health care system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cSection 21(B) No federal, state, or local law or rule shall prohibit the purchase or sale of health care or health insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cSection 21(C) No federal, state, or local law or rule shall impose a penalty or fine for the sale or purchase of health care or health insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cSection 21(D) This section does not affect laws or rules in effect as of March 19, 2010; affect which services a health care provider or hospital is required to perform or provide; affect terms and conditions of government employment; or affect any laws calculated to deter fraud or punish wrongdoing in the health care industry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cSection 21(E) As used in this Section,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-12\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(1) \u2018Compel\u2019 includes the levying of penalties or fines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-13\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(2) \u2018Health care system\u2019 means any public or private entity or program whose function or purpose includes the management of, processing of, enrollment of individuals for, or payment for, in full or in part, health care services, health care data, or health care information for its participants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-14\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(3) \u2018Penalty or fine\u2019 means any civil or criminal penalty or fine, tax, salary or wage withholding or surcharge or any named fee established by law or rule by a government established, created, or controlled agency that is used to punish or discourage the exercise of rights protected under this section.\u201d (Boldface sic.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-15\">{\u00b6 16} On April 9, the ballot board held a meeting to determine, pursuant to R.C. 3505.062(A), whether relators\u2019 initiative petition contained more than one constitutional amendment. In the board\u2019s discussion, the secretary of state opined that although Sections A, B, and C of the proposed amendment were arguably related to the subject of individual choice in health care and health insurance, Section D was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-16\">{\u00b6 17} The secretary further explained that Section C of the proposed amendment could be successfully rationalized as relating to freedom of choice, but Section D could not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>{\u00b6 18} \u201cBut then when I get to (D), (D) is where I really \u2014 I mean, (C) I could probably, you know, successfully rationalize that. But when I get to (D) is where I run into problems where I don\u2019t see where I am talking about the purchase or sale of health insurance, but we\u2019re talking directly about government regulation without dealing with that industry of \u2014 of individual choice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 19} At the conclusion of the meeting, the ballot board adopted the secretary\u2019s recommendation, dividing the petition into two separate issues and certifying to the attorney general the original petition as two proposed constitutional amendments. In the ballot board\u2019s April 9 letter to the attorney general, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cWe, the undersigned members of the Ohio Ballot Board, hereby divide and certify that the initiative petition that you sent to us on April 1, 2010, proposing to add Section 21 to Article I of the Ohio Constitution contains two proposed constitutional amendments. The two proposed amendments are: one that deals with the freedom to choose health care and health care coverage; and the second that deals with the governance and oversight of the health care and health insurance industries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">{\u00b6 21} Four days later, on April 13, relators filed this action for writs of mandamus and prohibition to compel the secretary of state and the ballot board to certify the board\u2019s approval of the proposed constitutional amendment as written and to certify its approval to the attorney general. In the alternative, relators request that the writs compel the attorney general to certify relators\u2019 proposed constitutional amendment pursuant to R.C. Chapter 3519. On April 15, we granted an alternative writ on relators\u2019 mandamus claim and issued an accelerated schedule for responses to the complaint and the submission of evidence and briefs. <em>State ex rel. Ohio Liberty Council v. Brunner, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 1548, 2010-Ohio-1662, 924 N.E.2d 849. We also dismissed relators\u2019 prohibition claim. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">{\u00b6 22} Respondents submitted answers, and the parties submitted evidence and briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">{\u00b6 23} This cause is now before the court for our consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">\n<em>Preliminary Matters</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">{\u00b6 24} Before addressing the merits of relators\u2019 claim, it is instructive to remember what our resolution of their claim does not address. This case is not about the relative merits of relators\u2019 proposed constitutional amendment and whether its passage would actually result in the specified purpose of preserving the freedom to choose health care and health-care coverage. Nor is this case about the constitutionality or legality of the substance of the proposed amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ment. \u201cAny claims alleging the unconstitutionality or illegality of the substance of the proposed [initiative], or actions to be taken pursuant to the [initiative] when enacted, are premature before its approval by the electorate.\u201d <em>State ex rel. DeBrosse v. Cool </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 1, 6, 716 N.E.2d 1114.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">{\u00b6 25} Instead, the limited legal issue before us is whether the ballot board abused its discretion and clearly disregarded applicable law by determining that relators\u2019 initiative petition contained more than one proposed constitutional amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\n<em>Mandamus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">(\u00b6 26} Relators request a writ of mandamus to compel the ballot board to certify its approval of the single proposed amendment as written and certify its approval to the attorney general. To be entitled to the writ, relators must establish a clear legal right to the requested relief, a corresponding clear legal duty on the part of respondents to provide it, and the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Husted v. Brunner, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 119, 2009-Ohio-4805, 914 N.E.2d 397, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">\n<em>Lack of Adequate Remedy in the Ordinary Course of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">{\u00b6 27} Because of the proximity of the June 30 deadline to file the signed initiative petition with the secretary of state to have the proposed amendment submitted to the electorate at the November 2, 2010 general election, relators lack an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. See <em>State ex rel. Greene v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 631, 2009-Ohio-1716, 907 N.E.2d 300, \u00b6 10; Section la, Article II, Ohio Constitution. No right to appeal from the ballot board\u2019s determination is granted. See R.C. 3505.062; see also <em>State ex rel. Morgan v. State Teachers Retirement Bd. of Ohio, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 324, 2009-Ohio-591, 904 N.E.2d 506, \u00b6 20 (mandamus is an appropriate remedy to correct an abuse of discretion by a public board in a decision that is not appealable).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">{\u00b6 28} And notwithstanding respondents\u2019 claim to the contrary, relators\u2019 mandamus claim is not an ill-disguised claim of declaratory judgment and prohibitory injunction, and neither a declaratory judgment nor a prohibitory injunction would constitute an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. A declaratory judgment would not be an adequate remedy without a mandatory injunction ordering the ballot board to immediately certify its approval of relators\u2019 proposed constitutional amendment, as written, to the attorney general. See <em>State ex rel. Mill Creek Metro. Park Dist. Bd. of Commrs. v. Tablack </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 293, 297, 714 N.E.2d 917. And a prohibitory injunction would not provide relators with the relief they request: an order to <em>compel </em>the ballot board to comply with its duties under R.C. 3505.062 to certify its approval of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>proposed constitutional amendment as \u25a0written. Nor would it be sufficiently speedy, given the imminent deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">{\u00b6 29} Therefore, relators\u2019 complaint properly invokes our original jurisdiction, and an action in the court of common pleas for a declaratory judgment and a prohibitory injunction would not provide an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\n<em>Clear Legal Right and Clear Legal Duty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">{\u00b6 30} In extraordinary actions challenging the decisions of the secretary of state and boards of elections, for example, the standard is whether they engaged in fraud, corruption, or abuse of discretion or acted in clear disregard of applicable legal provisions. See generally <em>State ex rel. Owens v. Brunner, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 130, 2010-Ohio-1374, 926 N.E.2d 617, \u00b6 26. This standard is also appropriate for gauging the propriety of the ballot board\u2019s determination here. Therefore, in the absence of any evidence of fraud or corruption, the dispositive issue is whether the ballot board abused its discretion and clearly disregarded applicable law in determining that relators\u2019 initiative petition contained two proposed constitutional amendments and in dividing the petition into two and in certifying the two proposed amendments to the attorney general.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">{\u00b6 31} Under Section 1, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, \u201cthe people reserve to themselves the power to propose to the general assembly laws and amendments to the constitution, and to adopt or reject the same at the polls on a referendum vote as hereinafter provided.\u201d \u201cThe first aforestated power reserved by the people is designated the initiative, and the signatures of ten per centum of the electors shall be required upon a petition to propose an amendment to the constitution.\u201d Section la, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. \u201cThe limitations expressed in the constitution, on the power of the general assembly to enact laws, shall be deemed limitations on the power of the people to enact laws.\u201d Section 1, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">{\u00b6 32} Under Section 1, Article XVI of the Ohio Constitution, the General Assembly is authorized to propose a constitutional amendment by joint resolution, and one of the requirements specified therein for a legislatively initiated proposed constitutional amendment is that each amendment be submitted separately to the electors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cWhen more than one amendment shall be submitted at the same time, they shall be so submitted as to enable the electors to vote on each amendment, separately.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">{\u00b6 34} R.C. 3519.01(A) imposes a similar requirement on citizen-initiated proposed constitutional amendments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>{\u00b6 35} <em>\u201cOnly one proposal of law or constitutional amendment to be proposed by initiative petition shall be contained in an initiative petition to enable the voters to vote on that proposal separately. A </em>petition shall include the text of any existing statute or constitutional provision that would be amended or repealed if the proposed law or constitutional amendment is adopted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cWhoever seeks to propose a law or constitutional amendment by initiative petition shall, by a written petition signed by one thousand qualified electors, submit the proposed law or constitutional amendment and a summary of it to the attorney general for examination. Within ten days after the receipt of the written petition and the summary of it, the attorney general shall conduct an examination of the summary. <em>If, in the opinion of the attorney general, the summary is a fair and truthful statement of the proposed law or constitutional amendment, the attorney general shall so certify and then forward the submitted petition to the Ohio ballot board for its approval under division (A) of section 3505.062 of the Revised Code. </em>If the Ohio ballot board returns the submitted petition to the attorney general with its certification as described in that division, the attorney general shall then file with the secretary of state a verified copy of the proposed law or constitutional amendment together with its summary and the attorney general\u2019s certification.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">{\u00b6 37} R.C. 3505.062, in turn, specifies the duty of the ballot board to determine whether an initiative petition contains only one proposed law or constitutional amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe Ohio ballot board shall do all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c(A) <em>Examine, within ten days after its receipt, each written initiative petition received from the attorney general under section 3519.01 of the Revised Code to determine whether it contains only one proposed law or constitutional amendment so as to enable the voters to vote on a proposal separately. </em>If the board so determines, it shall certify its approval to the attorney general, who then shall file with the secretary of state in accordance with division (A) of section 3519.01 of the Revised Code a verified copy of the proposed law or constitutional amendment together with its summary and the attorney general\u2019s certification of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">{\u00b6 40} <em>\u201cIf the board determines that the initiative petition contains more than one proposed law or constitutional amendment, the board shall divide the initiative petition into individual petitions containing only one proposed law or constitutional amendment so as to enable the voters to vote on each proposal separately and certify its approval to the attorney general. </em>If the board so divides an initiative petition and so certifies its approval to the attorney general, the petitioners shall resubmit to the attorney general appropriate summaries for each of the individual petitions arising from the board\u2019s division of the initiative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>petition, and the attorney general then shall review the resubmissions as provided in division (A) of section 3519.01 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">{\u00b6 41} Because this separate-petition requirement is comparable to the separate-vote requirement for legislatively-initiated constitutional amendments under Section 1, Article XVI of the Ohio Constitution, our precedent construing the constitutional provision is instructive in construing the statutory requirement. In <em>State ex rel. Willke v. Taft, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 1, 2005-Ohio-5303, 836 N.E.2d 536, at \u00b6 34, we set forth the test for determining satisfaction of the separate-vote requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c[T]he applicable test for determining compliance with the separate-vote requirement of Section 1, Article XVI is that \u2018a proposal consists of one amendment to the Constitution only so long as each of its subjects bears some reasonable relationship to a single <em>general </em>object or purpose.\u2019 (Emphasis sic.) <em>[State ex rel.] Roahrig [v. Brown </em>(1972)], 30 Ohio St.2d [82] at 84, 59 O.O.2d 104, 282 N.E.2d 584. \u2018Thus, where an amendment to the Constitution relates to a single purpose or object and all else contained therein is incidental and reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the amendment, such amendment is not violative of the provisions of Section 1, Article XVI.\u2019 <em>State ex rel. Burton v. Greater Portsmouth Growth Corp. </em>(1966), 7 Ohio St.2d 34, 36, 36 O.O.2d 19, 218 N.E.2d 446. Courts have generally taken a \u2018liberal [view] in interpreting what such a single general purpose or object may be.\u2019 See <em>[State ex rel.] Foreman [v. Brown </em>(1967)], 10 Ohio St.2d [139] at 146, 39 O.O.2d 149, 226 N.E.2d 116; see, also, cases from other jurisdictions cited at fn. 7.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">{\u00b6 43} In applying this test to relators\u2019 proposed constitutional amendment here, we hold that the proposal consists of one amendment because all the sections contained therein bear some reasonable relationship to the single general purpose of preserving Ohioans\u2019 freedom to choose their health care and healthcare coverage as it existed on March 19, 2010, with certain exceptions, before the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Section 21(A) preserves this freedom of choice by prohibiting the government from compelling any person, employer, or health-care provider to participate in any health-care system. Section 21(B) advances the freedom of choice by forbidding the government to prohibit the purchase or sale of health care or health-care insurance. As relators observe, persons\u2019, employers\u2019, and health-care providers\u2019 choices of health care and health-care insurance will be inhibited if their ability to choose between different providers is limited. Moreover, it is manifest that Section 21(E) of the proposed amendment, which merely provides definitions for some of the terms used in the other sections of the amendment, relates to the single purpose as well. Respondents do not argue to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>{\u00b6 44} The ballot board and the secretary of state argue in their merit brief that although Sections A, B, D, and E of relators\u2019 proposed constitutional amendment all relate to the single general purpose or object of preserving freedom of choice of health care and health-care coverage, Section C does not because its \u201cunintended consequences\u201d \u201ctranscend the availability and terms of coverage\u201d and, if passed, it would \u201cfundamentally rework the way Ohio regulates the insurance industry.\u201d At its April 9 meeting, however, the board appeared to acknowledge that Sections A, B, and C of relators\u2019 proposed constitutional amendment relate to the single purpose or object of choice, but that Section D, which specifies exceptions to the amendment, constituted the separate amendment. Specifically, the ballot board seemingly determined that this section of the proposed amendment \u201cdeals with the governance and oversight of the health care and the health insurance industries\u201d rather than \u201cthe freedom to choose health care and health care coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">{\u00b6 45} For the following reasons, the ballot board abused its discretion and clearly disregarded R.C. 3505.062 in so concluding, regardless of whether it relied on Section C or Section D of the proposed amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">{\u00b6 46} First, despite respondents\u2019 claims to the contrary, the transcript of the ballot board\u2019s proceedings indicates that the board\u2019s decision was based on Section D rather than Section C of relators\u2019 proposed constitutional amendment. The secretary of state, in her capacity as chair of the ballot board, reasoned that Section C could be successfully rationalized as relating to the general purpose of freedom of choice of health care because a person \u201ccan\u2019t be penalized for exercising freedom of choice to the point that it would impede the choice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">{\u00b6 47} Second, Section 21(C) reasonably relates to the general purpose of freedom of choice by prohibiting the government from imposing a penalty or fine for the sale or purchase of health care or health-care insurance. As the secretary of state acknowledged at the ballot board meeting, persons\u2019 and employers\u2019 choices of health care and health-care insurance would be impaired if their choice of certain providers were subject to a substantial penalty or fine. That is, as relators argue, \u201cif a law imposes such a steep penalty upon the purchase or sale of private health care or health insurance to render it commercially and economically unrealistic, that law would effectively preclude the ability of an Ohioan to choose private health care or health care coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">{\u00b6 48} The ballot board asserts that relators improperly read Section 21(C) as if it had added the language \u201cbased on the contents of the policy\u201d to \u201c[n]o federal, state, or local law or rule shall impose a penalty or fine for the sale or purchase of health care or health insurance.\u201d But this additional language is also not included at the end of Section 21(B), which uses language similar to that contained in Section C: \u201cNo federal, state, or local law or rule shall prohibit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>purchase or sale of health care or health insurance.\u201d And relators admit that Section B is reasonably related to the single general purpose of freedom of choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">{\u00b6 49} Third, Section D of the proposed constitutional amendment, which the ballot board determined at the board\u2019s meeting was different from the rest of the amendment, has no independent meaning separate from the remainder of the amendment. In fact, it specifies the exceptions to Sections A, B, and C by beginning with the phrase, \u201cThis section does not affect * *</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">{\u00b6 50} Fourth, limitations on the scope of or exceptions to the changes made in a proposed amendment do not change the single amendment into multiple amendments. In effect, every amendment generally contains some limitations, whether they be temporal or by subject matter. For example, in <em>Foreman, </em>10 Ohio St.2d 139, 39 O.O.2d 149, 226 N.E.2d 116, paragraph four of the syllabus, we held that a proposed constitutional amendment that created a bond commission, but further specified the limited purposes for which money could be raised and used, did not violate the separate-vote requirement of Section 1, Article XVI of the Ohio Constitution by including limitations on the commission created by the amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cIf the proposed amendment provided only that a bond commission should be created to raise revenues for public purposes, no one would seriously contend that the proposal included more than one object and that therefore it represented more than one amendment. The fact, that the proposal limits the authority of the commission by specifying the purposes for which the revenues may be raised and used, does not turn the proposal into one for more than one amendment.\u201d Id. at 147, 39 O.O.2d 149, 226 N.E.2d 116.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">{\u00b6 52} Fifth, relators\u2019 proposed constitutional amendment does not violate the purposes of the separate-vote requirement. \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe constitutional mandate that multifarious amendments shall be submitted separately has two great objectives. The first is to prevent imposition upon or deceit of the public by the presentation of a proposal which is misleading or the effect of which is concealed or not readily understandable. The second is to afford the voters freedom of choice and prevent \u2018logrolling\u2019 or the combining of unrelated proposals in order to secure approval by appealing to different groups which will support the entire proposal in order to secure some part of it although perhaps disapproving of other parts.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Willke, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 1, 2005-Ohio-5303, 836 N.E.2d 536, \u00b6 28, quoting <em>Andrews v.

Donovan </em>(1960), 259 Minn. 35, 38, 104 N.W.2d 911, construing similar separate-vote requirements in the Maryland and Minnesota Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>{\u00b6 53} The inclusion of Sections C and D with the remaining sections of relators\u2019 proposed constitutional amendment does not render the amendment as a whole deceptive or constitute the attachment of an unrelated, unpopular proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">{\u00b6 54} Finally, notwithstanding the ballot board\u2019s implicit claim throughout its argument, there is no indication that the framers of the Constitution or the General Assembly intended that the citizens\u2019 constitutional right of initiative to propose a constitutional amendment be relegated to a stricter separate-vote requirement than that required for the legislature\u2019s constitutional right of initiative. In <em>State ex rel. LetOhioVote.org v. Brunner, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 322, 2009-Ohio-4900, 916 N.E.2d 462, \u00b6 19-20, we recently reiterated that \u201c[i]n 1912, the electors of Ohio adopted the initiative and referendum amendment to the constitution\u201d and that \u201c[s]hortly thereafter, we explained the significance of the amendment\u201d by recognizing the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">{\u00b6 55} \u201c \u2018Now, the people\u2019s right to the use of the initiative and referendum is one of the most essential safeguards to representative government. * * * The potential virtue of the \u201cI. &amp; R.\u201d does not reside in the good statutes and good constitutional amendments initiated, nor in the bad statutes and bad proposed constitutional amendments that are killed. Rather, the greatest efficiency of the \u201cI. and R.\u201d rests in the wholesome restraint imposed automatically upon the general assembly and the governor and the possibilities of that latent power when called into action by the voters.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 20, quoting <em>State ex rel. Nolan v. ClenDening </em>(1915), 93 Ohio St. 264, 277-278, 112 N.E. 1029.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">{\u00b6 56} The power of initiative must be liberally construed, and the General Assembly cannot diminish that power. <em>State ex rel. Hodges v. Taft </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 1, 4, 591 N.E.2d 1186. By imposing the separate-vote requirement on citizen-initiated proposed amendments, therefore, the General Assembly could not diminish citizens\u2019 constitutional right of initiative by construing that requirement more strictly than the similar constitutional requirement applicable to the legislative right of initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">{\u00b6 57} Based on the foregoing, the ballot board has a clear legal duty to liberally construe the right of initiative, and as long as the citizen-initiated proposed amendment bears some reasonable relationship to a single general object or purpose, the board must certify its approval of the amendment as written without dividing it into multiple petitions. Because the board did not comply with this duty here, where relators\u2019 proposed constitutional amendment bears some reasonable relationship to their single general object or purpose of preserving freedom of choice in health care and health-care coverage, relators are entitled to the requested writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\n<em>Remaining Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">{\u00b6 58} As a result of the foregoing, relators\u2019 alternate claim, that the ballot board lacks constitutional authority to divide a citizen-initiated proposed amendment, need not be addressed because it is not absolutely necessary to do so. See <em>State ex rel. Miller v. Brady, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 255, 2009-Ohio-4942, 915 N.E.2d 1183, \u00b6 11; <em>Smith v. Leis, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 309, 2005-Ohio-5125, 835 N.E.2d 5, \u00b6 54 (\u201ccourts decide constitutional issues only when absolutely necessary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">{\u00b6 59} Moreover, relators\u2019 alternate claim for a writ of mandamus to compel the attorney general to certify their proposed constitutional amendment is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\n<em>Extension of the Constitutional Deadline to Submit Initiative Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">{\u00b6 60} In their complaint, relators requested that the court grant them an \u201cextension of days by which Relators may continue to gather signatures, so as to atone for the delay associated * * * with [the] Secretary of State and Ohio Ballot Board\u2019s wrongful conduct.\u201d We deny this request for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">{\u00b6 61} First, although relators requested this relief in their complaint, they failed to include any argument in support of their request in their initial merit brief. Instead, they resuscitated their request only in their reply brief in response to the ballot board\u2019s extended argument in its brief that no extension of the constitutional deadline is warranted. Consequently, we need not address relators\u2019 request. See <em>State ex rel. Glasgow v. Jones, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 391, 2008-Ohio-4788, 894 N.E.2d 686, \u00b6 26 (court need not address claim that was raised in complaint but was not specifically argued in merit brief); <em>State ex rel. Colvin v. Brunner, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 110, 2008-Ohio-5041, 896 N.E.2d 979, \u00b6 61 (relators in election-related writ case are forbidden to raise issue in reply brief that was not raised in initial merit brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">{\u00b6 62} Second, although we have extended the constitutional deadline for referendum petitioners to submit a petition when the secretary of state has improperly refused to accept a summary and has thereby precluded the petitioners from circulating the petition for signatures, see <em>LetOhioVote.org, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 322, 2009-Ohio-4900, 916 N.E.2d 462, \u00b6 7, 54, and <em>State ex rel. Ohio AFL-CIO v. Voinovich </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 225, 236-237, 631 N.E.2d 582, respondents have introduced evidence here that an extension of the deadline would impair the ability of the secretary and the boards of elections to comply with their constitutional and statutory duties regarding the initiative petition and would affect several additional constitutional and statutory deadlines before the November 2, 2010 election.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">{\u00b6 63} For example, an extension of the deadline here could result in no resolution of whether the proposed constitutional amendment should be placed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the November 2, 2010 election ballot until after the absentee-ballot deadline has passed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b522-13\">1851 Center for Constitutional Law and Maurice A. Thompson; and Robert M. Owens, for relators.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AlM\">Richard Cordray, Attorney General, and Michael J. Schuler, Richard N. Coglianese, and Aaron N. Epstein, Assistant Attorneys General, for respondents Secretary of State and Ohio Ballot Board.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A5T\">Richard Cordray, Attorney General, and Pearl M. Chin and Damian W. Sikora, Assistant Attorneys General, for respondent Attorney General.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">{\u00b6 64} Finally, the primary impetus of relators\u2019 proposed constitutional amendment is the portion of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that requires individuals to maintain minimum essential health-care coverage and penalizes them if they do not, but these provisions are not effective until 2014. Therefore, relators need not be awarded an extension of time to place this issue on the November 2, 2010 ballot when they could seek placement of this initiative on the 2011, 2012, or 2013 general-election ballot without prejudice to their proposal or a departure from the constitutional deadlines.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">{\u00b6 65} Therefore, we deny the request for an extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">{\u00b6 66} Relators have established their entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus. Therefore, we grant a writ of mandamus to compel the ballot board to immediately certify its approval of relators\u2019 proposed constitutional amendment, as drafted, to the attorney general as one amendment. This result is consistent with our duty to liberally construe the citizens\u2019 right of initiative in favor of their exercise of this important right.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b522-10\">Pfeifer, Acting C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b522-11\">O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs and would have extended the deadline for submitting initiative petitions.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b522-12\">The late Chief Justice Thomas J.
