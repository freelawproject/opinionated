The BTA ordered the Tax Commissioner to reduce the values assigned to merchandise held in inventory by Rich\u2019s Department Stores with respect to tax years 2000, 2001, and 2002. Specifically, the BTA ordered reductions based upon \u201cvendor markdown allowances,\u201d i.e., allowances granted by vendors that supplied merchandise to Rich\u2019s, by which those vendors compensated Rich\u2019s for having to mark down the merchandise from its expected retail price.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">{\u00b6 2} On appeal, the commissioner primarily argues that the reductions ordered by the BTA violate the plain meaning of the relevant administrative rule, Ohio Adm.Code 5703-3-17 (\u201cAdministrative Rule 17\u201d). Although the BTA\u2019s factual findings generally merit the deference of the court, a careful review of the evidence in light of the pertinent statutes and administrative rules shows that the BTA did err in construing and applying Administrative Rule 17. We accordingly reverse the BTA\u2019s decision and reinstate the final assessment certificates issued by the Tax Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b211-15\">{\u00b6 3} During the fiscal years at issue, Rich\u2019s used the retail inventory method (\u201cretail method\u201d) to account for its merchandise inventory. Rich\u2019s kept track, in the aggregate, of costs and expected retail prices for all items held in inventory by each retail department of the company. Every addition of new items for sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>led to a new computation of the cost average and retail average for each department.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">{\u00b6 4} According to Rich\u2019s vice president of divisional accounting, the inventory\u2019s value is carried at the end of an accounting period as \u201cending inventory\u201d or \u201cending inventory at cost\u201d on the books of the company. That figure is generated by multiplying the ending retail figure by the cost-to-retail ratio. As part of that calculation, markdowns of expected retail price reduce the ending retail figure. See Larson &amp; Miller, Fundamental Accounting Principles (13th Ed. 1993) 502-503.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">{\u00b6 5} At issue in the present case is the accounting for markdown <em>allowances. </em>Like other retailers, Rich\u2019s engages in open-ended relationships with its vendors, who have a vested interest in the success of the department store\u2019s efforts to sell the wares that they supply, and to do so at the projected profit. The store buys items for its inventory from the vendor with a certain \u201cmargin performance,\u201d or profit expectation, in mind. When items sell for less than the expected retail price, they are marked down. In those instances, the vendor will often grant Rich\u2019s an allowance, by which the vendor itself contributes to the margin performance. The amount of the allowance is typically credited as an offset against an amount Rich\u2019s would otherwise owe the vendor. These allowances are granted by informal agreements in which Rich\u2019s will request an allowance after a disappointing sales period.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">{\u00b6 6} The record documents two effects of a markdown allowance on Rich\u2019s books. First, the allowance affects the balance sheet by reducing the company\u2019s liability in the form of accounts payable. Second, the allowance affects the income or profit-and-loss statement by reducing the cost of goods sold and thereby increasing the profit margin.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">{\u00b6 7} It must be noted that the cost of goods sold, while significant in terms of the profit-and-loss statement, does not constitute the book value of the merchandise inventory. In that regard, the testimony of accounting professor Ray Stephens specifically addressed the distinction between ending inventory and cost of goods sold, asserting that allowances from merchandise vendors \u201cshould not result in a reduction in ending inventory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">{\u00b6 8} In assessing the property for the years at issue, the Tax Commissioner applied Administrative Rule 17. That rule addresses how to value merchandise inventory when the mei-chant keeps its books using the retail method. The rule states that the starting point for the value of merchandise under the statutes \u201cshall prima facie be the \u2018average inventory value\u2019 at cost as disclosed by the books of the taxpayer.\u201d Under that provision, the commissioner\u2019s assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>began with the \u201caverage value of inventory\u201d on Rich\u2019s books; ending inventory figures were derived from Rich\u2019s books to arrive at an appropriate 12-month average for the fiscal year. See R.C. 5711.15 (merchant ascertains value of inventory by computing 12-month average of inventory on hand).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">{\u00b6 9} The commissioner next applied the additional language of Administrative Rule 17, which allows adjustments based on pertinent factors \u201creflected on the books of the taxpayer for the succeeding three months following the close of the annual accounting period of the current tax year.\u201d The administrator of the personal property tax division testified at the BTA hearing that under this part of the rule, the commissioner reduced the valuation significantly below the inventory figure originally reflected on Rich\u2019s books for the period \u2014 as much as 20 percent below. But the commissioner denied reductions based on markdown allowances and issued final assessment certificates accordingly. Rich\u2019s appealed to the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">{\u00b6 10} At the BTA hearing, Rich\u2019s presented the testimony of four employees and the tax agent who conducted the audit, along with 15 documentary exhibits. The commissioner offered the testimony of the administrator of the property-tax division and Professor Stephens. In the course of the BTA proceedings, Rich\u2019s withdrew all claims except the claim of reduction based on vendor markdown allowances.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">{\u00b6 11} The BTA concluded that reducing the book value of inventory by the amount of markdown allowances constituted a valid computation of the \u201ccost as disclosed by the books of the taxpayer\u201d under Administrative Rule 17. <em>Rich\u2019s Dept. Stores, Inc. v. Wilkins </em>(Feb. 3, 2009), BTA No. 2005-T-1609, at 11, 2009 WL 294413. The board specifically held that Rich\u2019s claim involved \u201cthe factors that comprise book value.\u201d Id. at 12. Thus, the BTA did <em>not </em>predicate its decision on a finding that Rich\u2019s had rebutted the prima facie validity of book value; the BTA instead found that the adjustment Rich\u2019s requested was consistent with a proper determination of the prima facie standard: \u201ccost as disclosed by the books of the taxpayer\u201d under Administrative Rule 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">{\u00b6 12} Based on this conclusion, the BTA ordered that the commissioner grant the requested reductions. The Tax Commissioner has appealed, and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">\n<em>The BTA Misconstrued Administrative Rule 17</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">{\u00b6 13} It is settled that \u201c \u2018[t]he fair market value of property for tax purposes is a question of fact, the determination of which is primarily within the province of the taxing authorities, and this court will not disturb a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals with respect to such valuation unless it affirmatively appears from the record that such decision is unreasonable and unlawful.\u2019 \u201d <em>EOP-BP Tower, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number><em>L.L.C. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 1, 2005-Ohio-3096, 829 N.E.2d 686, \u00b6 17, quoting <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision v. Fodor </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 52, 44 O.O.2d 30, 239 N.E.2d 25, syllabus. On the other hand, \u201c \u2018we will not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Satullo v. Wilkins, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 399, 2006-Ohio-5856, 856 N.E.2d 954, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">{\u00b6 14} The Tax Commissioner advances several arguments contending that the BTA\u2019s decision is unreasonable and unlawful. We consider one of those arguments dispositive, rendering the others moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">{\u00b6 15} The commissioner asserts that the BTA \u201cmisinterprets and misapplies the presumptively valid methodology for determining the true value set forth in [Administrative Rule 17].\u201d The rule, which prescribes the method for determining the value of merchandise inventory when a taxpayer uses the retail method of accounting, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe true \u2018average inventory value of merchandise\u2019 to be estimated for taxation shall prima facie be the \u2018average inventory value\u2019 at cost as disclosed by the books of the taxpayer, after making proper adjustments for cash discounts and merchandise shrinkage, less the aggregate net markdowns, at cost, (taking into consideration markdown cancellations and additional mark-ups at cost) which are reflected on the books of the taxpayer for the succeeding three months following the close of the annual accounting period of the current tax year.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 5703-3-17.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">{\u00b6 17} The BTA specifically held that subtracting markdown allowances constituted a valid part of determining \u201ccost as disclosed by the books of the taxpayer,\u201d treating markdown allowances as one of the factors that comprise book value under the rule. The BTA plainly misconstrued the phrase \u201ccost as disclosed by the books of the taxpayer\u201d in Administrative Rule 17. That rule was promulgated to effectuate the general mandate that \u201cdepreciated book value shall be taken as the true value of such property, unless the assessor finds that such depreciated book value is greater or less than the then true value of such property in money.\u201d R.C. 5711.18. It follows that any cost factor under the rule must relate to how the inventory is carried as a value on the books of the company following proper accounting principles and methods. See <em>Hoffman v. State Med. Bd. of Ohio, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 376, 2007-Ohio-2201, 865 N.E.2d 1259, \u00b6 17, citing <em>Carroll v. Dept. of Adm. Servs. </em>(1983), 10 Ohio App.3d 108, 110, 10 OBR 132, 460 N.E.2d 704 (\u201cAdministrative rules are designed to accomplish the ends sought by the legislation enacted by the General Assembly\u201d); accord <em>Chicago Pacific Corp. v. Limbach </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 432, 435, 605 N.E.2d 8 (administrative rule does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>not conflict with a statute to the extent that it provides a reasonable, supportable interpretation of it).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">{\u00b6 18} The BTA\u2019s decision violates this plain intent. As noted above, the record shows that \u201cending inventory\u201d or \u201cending inventory at cost\u201d is the accounting category that pertains to carrying the value of inventory on the books. Rich\u2019s evidence demonstrates that markdown allowances should be subtracted when computing the \u201ccost of goods sold\u201d on the profit-and-loss statement. But the evidence is uncontroverted that, as Professor Stephens adamantly stated, allowances from merchandise vendors \u201cshould not result in a reduction in the ending inventory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">{\u00b6 19} The testimony confirms that markdown allowances offset the amount of net markdowns, which, under the rule, are themselves subtracted from the retail figure when the value of inventory is computed. Professor Stephens testified that a markdown allowance \u201creally should be a reduction in the net markdowns in order to value inventory.\u201d Rich\u2019s vice-president for divisional accounting likewise testified that a markdown allowance leads Rich\u2019s to \u201crecord a markdown cancellation\u201d and \u201ca markdown cancellation, in essence, is [an] addition to retail.\u201d At oral argument, Rich\u2019s counsel acknowledged that the markdown reductions explicitly authorized under the rule involved net markdowns, i.e., markdowns reduced by the amount of markdown cancellations, including cancellations attributable to markdown allowances. The reduction that Rich\u2019s requested and the BTA granted is thus not one that properly relates to carrying the inventory at its value under generally accepted accounting principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">{\u00b6 20} The BTA nonetheless construed Administrative Rule 17 to encompass the adjustment proposed by Rich\u2019s. In doing so, the board mistakenly construed the phrase \u201ccost as disclosed by the books of the taxpayer\u201d as requiring a cost determination that would include adjustments to the \u201ccost of goods sold\u201d on the profit-and-loss statement. The proper construction of the rule ties the prima facie standard to the \u201cbook value\u201d mandated by R.C. 5711.18. As a result, the phrase \u201c \u2018average inventory value\u2019 at cost as disclosed by the books of the taxpayer\u201d encompasses only those adjustments that relate to the computation of \u201cending inventory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">{\u00b6 21} Rich\u2019s offers an additional reason why it may import a cost-of-goods-sold adjustment into the balance sheet: the agents of the Tax Commissioner on audit sometimes do the same thing. But a review of the testimony on this point persuades us that the type of adjustments described by the commissioner\u2019s agent involves standardizing the accounting between taxpayers within the confines of accepted accounting principles. Accord <em>R.H. Macy Co., Inc. v. Schneider </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 94, 26 O.O.2d 440, 197 N.E.2d 807 (tax assessor\u2019s substitution of retail inventory method for last-in, first-out method of accounting to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the value of inventory was affirmed on appeal). For example, one of the Tax Commissioner\u2019s agents testified that expenditures related to transporting inventory might be expensed by one taxpayer on the income statement but included in the cost of inventory by another taxpayer on the balance sheet. In the former circumstance, the tax agent would apply the transportation expenditure to increase the cost of inventory on the balance sheet in order to treat the taxpayers equally. Nothing in the record suggests that this adjustment strays outside accepted accounting principles; by contrast, subtracting markdown allowances from ending inventory plainly does.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">{\u00b6 22} By ordering the reduction that Rich\u2019s had requested, the BTA erroneously construed the cost concept embodied in Administrative Rule 17 and thereby misapplied the rule. Because of this legal error, we must reverse the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\n<em>Rich\u2019s evidence fails to rebut the prima facie standard for value set forth in Administrative Rule 17</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">{\u00b6 23} Rich\u2019s points out that under the statutes and our case law, book value has only a prima facie validity as establishing true value, and other factors may indicate a higher or lower value than book value. See R.C. 5711.18 (in valuing property used in business, book value is taken to be true value \u201cunless the assessor finds that such depreciated book value is greater or less than the then true value of such property in money\u201d); <em>R.H. Macy Co., </em>176 Ohio St. 94, 26 O.O.2d 440, 197 N.E.2d 807, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>PPG Industries, Inc. v. Kosydar </em>(1981), 65 Ohio St.2d 80, 19 O.O.3d 268, 417 N.E.2d 1385, paragraph one of the syllabus. Rich\u2019s then urges that the evidence of the effect of markdown allowances on cost constitutes evidence that the true value of its merchandise inventory was less than the properly computed book value of that asset. Accordingly, the BTA\u2019s reliance on that evidence as rebutting the prima facie standard would merit the deference of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">{\u00b6 24} We disagree. While the BTA\u2019s factual findings merit utmost deference when supported by the record, Rich\u2019s is asking that we defer to a finding that the BTA did not make. As discussed, the BTA held that subtracting markdown allowances constituted a valid adjustment in arriving at the prima facie standard articulated by Administrative Rule 17. Because of that holding, the BTA had no need to address whether the prima facie standard had been rebutted, and it did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">{\u00b6 25} Our disposition of this appeal contrary to the BTA\u2019s holding raises the question of whether the case should be remanded to afford the BTA the opportunity to determine whether Rich\u2019s has rebutted the prima facie standard. We hold that the present record does not justify a remand. The evidence that Rich\u2019s presented related to the effect of markdown allowances on the cost of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>merchandise for accounting purposes. While the concept of cost, properly construed, does relate to the manner in which inventory value is accounted for on the company\u2019s books, Rich\u2019s offers no reason why the evidence that it presented' \u2014 the testimony and documentation that markdown allowances led to a reduction of cost of goods sold on the profit-and-loss statement \u2014 constitutes evidence of value apart from its significance under accounting principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">{\u00b6 26} This contrasts sharply with cases in which the court has held that a presumptive valuation has been rebutted. In some cases, a recent arm\u2019s-length sale furnishes a direct indication of value that rebuts the depreciated book value. It is elemental that \u201c[t]he best evidence of true value of tangible personal property is an arm\u2019s-length transaction.\u201d <em>Shiloh Automotive, Inc. v. Levin, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 4, 2008-Ohio-68, 881 N.E.2d 227, \u00b6 20, citing <em>Tele-Media Co. of Addil v. Lindley </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 284, 24 O.O.3d 367, 436 N.E.2d 1362, syllabus. E.g., <em>Grabler Mfg. Co. v. Kosydar </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St.2d 75, 72 O.O.2d 42, 330 N.E.2d 924 (sale price constituted value of personalty). In the present case, Rich\u2019s does not offer evidence of a recent bulk sale of inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">{\u00b6 27} In cases in which a sales price has not been offered as best evidence of value, other evidence might rebut the prima facie validity of book value. For example, in <em>Willard Storage Battery Co. v. Peck </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 197, 53 O.O. 89, 118 N.E.2d 514, a manufacturer sought a reduction of the value assigned to its inventory of lead. The court acknowledged that a month-by-month analysis of market prices for the commodity could rebut the value as carried on the company\u2019s books. Id. at 201, 53 O.O. 89, 118 N.E.2d 514. And in other cases, taxpayers have presented evidence of the specific nature of a manufacturing business to rebut the Tax Commissioner\u2019s decision to add plant depreciation into the value of manufacturing inventory. See <em>PPG Industries, Inc., </em>65 Ohio St.2d 80, 19 O.O.3d 268, 417 N.E.2d 1385; <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Kosydar </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St.2d 96, 73 O.O.2d 353, 338 N.E.2d 366. The evidence in these types of cases bears no similarity to that offered by Rich\u2019s here.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">{\u00b6 28} In essence, Rich\u2019s has proven nothing more than that its enjoyment of vendor markdown allowances entails a reduction of the cost of goods sold for accounting purposes and, more generally, can be viewed as an after-the-fact offset against the original acquisition cost of the merchandise. The former does not, as already discussed, justify an adjustment to book value; nor does the latter more directly establish true value than do the accounting methods. That is so because a more precise computation of the acquisition cost does not, by itself, establish what Rich\u2019s can receive by selling the merchandise, which is the relevant figure for applying the retail inventory method of accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">{\u00b6 29} Rich\u2019s argument in effect claims that it should pay <em>less </em>tax, through a reduction in the value of its inventory, because it has received a <em>benefit </em>from its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>vendors in the form of a credit against monies owed. The inventory itself and the expected retail price thereof do not change merely because Rich\u2019s has been granted a markdown allowance. While the need to mark down merchandise may indicate a reduced value for some items still held in inventory, the retail inventory method properly establishes a conservative valuation overall by stating the value of merchandise inventory at cost rather than at expected profit. And while markdowns by themselves reduce profitability and thereby indicate a lower value of merchandise to the merchant, the grant of markdown allowances supports profitability; as a result, the expectation of receiving allowances stabilizes rather than reduces the value of the merchandise inventory. Put in this light, the logical fallacy of Rich\u2019s argument is exposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">{\u00b6 30} We hold that the record furnishes no factual basis upon which the BTA could predicate a reduction from book value in the amount of markdown allowances. It follows that there is no need for a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">{\u00b6 31} The foregoing analysis causes us to conclude that the BTA erred in its construction and application of Administrative Rule 17, and our resolution of that issue renders the commissioner\u2019s other arguments moot. We therefore reverse the BTA\u2019s decision and reinstate the Tax Commissioner\u2019s final assessment certificates as issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Decision reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b218-8\">O\u2019Connor, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b218-9\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b218-10\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ANI\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">{\u00b6 32} I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">{\u00b6 33} It is difficult to comprehend how a vendor markdown allowance on merchandise delivered to a store for retail sale does not reduce the inventory cost of that merchandise, and thus that reduced inventory cost should be recognized for purposes of assessing personal property tax. Every company assesses a certain cost to its inventory; when, at some point subsequent to that assessment the retailer is afforded a markdown allowance on the inventory, retailers treat that as a reduction in the cost of inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">{\u00b6 34} In <em>R.H.

Schneider </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 94, 96, 26 O.O.2d 440, 197 N.E.2d 807, we stated that \u201c[t]he assessment of personal property requires the assessor to consider the book value as stated by the taxpayer, together with other statements of the taxpayer and other available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>evidence, and apply the applicable rules of valuation to arrive at the ultimate goal of the assessment, a determination of the true value of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">{\u00b6 35} With respect to merchandise in inventory, Ohio Adm.Code 5703-3-17 (\u201cAdministrative Rule 17\u201d) provides, \u201cThe true \u2018average inventory value of merchandise\u2019 to be estimated for taxation shall prima facie be the \u2018average inventory value\u2019 at cost as disclosed by the books of the taxpayer, after making proper adjustments for cash discounts and merchandise shrinkage, less the aggregate net markdowns, at cost, * * * which are reflected on the books of the taxpayer for the succeeding three months following the close of the annual accounting period of the current tax year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">{\u00b6 36} As stated by the Board of Tax Appeals, \u201cOnce cost is determined on the books of the taxpayer, [Administrative Rule 17] permits additional adjustments for cash discounts, merchandise shrinkage and net markdowns. These adjustments are made only after the cost of the inventory is determined. As we have previously discussed, cost, as disclosed on Rich\u2019s books, includes [markdown allowances].\u201d <em>Rich\u2019s Dept. Stores, Inc. v.
