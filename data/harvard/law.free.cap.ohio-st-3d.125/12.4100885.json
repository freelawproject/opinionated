The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we publicly reprimand respondent, based on findings that he withdrew for his personal use settlement proceeds held in trust for a client. We agree that respondent violated ethical standards by withdrawing unearned funds from his client trust account; however, we find a six-month suspension of his license to practice, all stayed on condition of no further misconduct, to be the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent in one count with multiple violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, including Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a) (requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property), 1.15(b) (allowing a lawyer to deposit personal funds in a trust account only to pay or waive bank charges), and 1.15(c) (requiring a lawyer to deposit into a client trust account advances to be withdrawn only when earned). The parties waived a hearing, and a panel of three board members heard the case on the parties\u2019 agreed stipulations of fact and law. Based on respondent\u2019s admissions and other evidence of record, the panel found the cited misconduct and recommended a public reprimand. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">{\u00b6 3} Respondent, a sole practitioner, maintained both an Interest on Lawyer Trust Account (\u201cIOLTA\u201d) and a business account at Huntington National Bank. In December 2007, he settled a personal-injury claim on behalf of three clients for $7,700. Respondent agreed to reduce his contingent fee from one-third to an amount equal to the amount received by each client. He also obtained one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>doctor\u2019s consent to reduce a medical bill by 20 per cent but agreed with his clients to keep the remaining settlement proceeds in trust as he continued to negotiate with the doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">{\u00b6 4} In the following months, respondent distributed $910 in settlement proceeds to each of the three clients from his IOLTA account. But from mid-January to mid-February 2008, respondent withdrew $1,535 in unearned proceeds from this account by drawing eight checks payable to cash. Respondent used these funds for personal expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">{\u00b6 5} Respondent admitted that by withdrawing unearned funds from a bank account dedicated to safekeeping entrusted client funds, he violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a), (b), and (c). We accept his admissions and find that he has breached these ethical duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">{\u00b6 6} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d) 10(B). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21. Because each disciplinary case is unique, we are not limited to the factors specified in the rule but may take into account \u201call relevant factors\u201d in determining what sanction to impose. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">{\u00b6 7} In comparing respondent\u2019s case to others in which lawyers misused client trust accounts, the board noted dispositions ranging from a one-year suspension, all stayed on conditions, to a six-month conditionally stayed suspension, to a public reprimand. Though the board resolved that respondent\u2019s long and previously unblemished career weighed in favor of a public reprimand, the board acknowledged that we ordinarily impose a conditionally stayed suspension of six months for this misconduct. Examples cited by the board included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cIn <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Fletcher, </em>[122 Ohio St.3d 390, 2009-Ohio-3480, 911 N.E.2d 897], respondent did not have an operating account from 2002 to 2007, paid his personal and business expenses from the IOLTA account, wrote at least 150 checks from 2005 to 2007 and received a 6 month stayed suspension.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cIn <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Johnston, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 403, 2009-Ohio-1432 [904 N.E.2d 892], respondent received a one year suspension, all stayed. He used his IOLTA account for operating and personal expenses for two years, commingling his own funds with his clients.\u201d</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"b210-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Stacy Solochek Beckman, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-3\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cIn <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Nance, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 55, 2008-Ohio-3333 [891 N.E.2d 746], respondent admitted that he had violated [ethical standards prohibiting conduct that adversely reflects on a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law and requiring a lawyer to maintain client funds in an identifiable bank account separate from his own] by misusing his client trust account. He received a six month stayed suspension with conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cIn <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Peden, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 244, 2008-Ohio-2237 [887 N.E.2d 1183], respondent received a six month suspension, all stayed, where he had no IOLTA account and also violated Gov.Bar V(4)(G).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cIn <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Newcomer, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 351, 2008-Ohio-4492, [894 N.E.2d 50], respondent received a six month suspension, stayed. Respondent\u2019s personal account was closed by his bank and he then used the IOLTA account for personal expenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">{\u00b6 13} That respondent has practiced nearly 40 years without incident weighs in his favor. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a). Also mitigating are respondent\u2019s cooperation and honesty during the disciplinary process and his good character and reputation apart from the underlying misconduct. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(d) and (e). The board found that respondent had made timely and good-faith restitution in that he replenished the IOLTA account upon notice that it was overdrawn. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">{\u00b6 14} While the board found that respondent may not have specifically intended to misuse his client trust account, we conclude that he knew that he had withdrawn client funds to which he was not entitled, and that conduct calls for our standard disposition. Respondent is therefore suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for six months; however, the suspension is stayed on condition of no further misconduct. If respondent violates this condition, the stay will be lifted, and respondent\u2019s license to practice will be suspended for the full six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">{\u00b6 15} Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b210-10\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b210-11\">O\u2019Donnell, J., dissents and would publicly reprimand respondent.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"A57\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Thomas F.
