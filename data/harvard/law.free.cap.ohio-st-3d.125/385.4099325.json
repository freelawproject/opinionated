Gilbert and Lee A. Gilbert, and denying a writ of mandamus to compel the city to commence an appropriation proceeding for the alleged regulatory taking of the Gilberts\u2019 property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the court of appeals properly granted the writ on the Gilberts\u2019 physical-taking claim and correctly denied the writ on their regulatory-taking claim, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">{\u00b6 2} In 1998, Richard C. Gilbert, through his investment company, purchased a house and over 5.5 acres of property in Cincinnati, Ohio. The property includes a creek that runs along its length. Richard Gilbert refinanced the property in 1999, and the property was transferred to him and his wife, Lee A. Gilbert. The Gilberts have lived in the home on the property since then.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>{\u00b6 3} When the property was purchased, the Gilberts were both real-estate agents, and they intended to develop the property by dividing it into 10 or 11 lots, in accordance with applicable zoning regulations. Although a sewage line is adjacent to the property and a nearby pump station serves it, the property is not connected to the sewer system, and therefore the Gilberts\u2019 property uses a septic system.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">{\u00b6 4} Although a means to dispose of the waste from the proposed development was necessary, Richard Gilbert purchased the property without knowing that there would be limitations on his ability to use the sewer system. He had not contacted the sewer district before the purchase and had no expectation that the nearby pump station would be upgraded to accommodate the increased waste from the proposed development. In fact, in 1995, the city knew that the existing pump station was incapable of accepting any additional sewage flow unless it was upgraded.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">{\u00b6 5} After he bought the property, Richard Gilbert was given a copy of a 1997 letter to other property owners in the neighborhood who had inquired about the city\u2019s providing sewer service to their property. In that letter, the city explained that it could not provide sewer service, because the existing system was at full capacity. The city noted that it was planning to upgrade the pump station in late 1998, when additional sewer connections would be permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">{\u00b6 6} The Gilberts subsequently sought approval for the development of additional single-family residences on the property, but the requests were denied because the city had not yet upgraded the pump station to handle the additional sewage generated by the proposed development.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">{\u00b6 7} After the Gilberts purchased the property, the pump station repeatedly overflowed, spilling sewage into the creek on their property. Pursuant to a consent decree entered into between the federal and state environmental protection agencies and the city after the city was found to be in violation of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the city erected a sign near the creek on the Gilberts\u2019 property. The sign stated that the area was a sanitary-sewer-overflow area, that water in the area \u201cmay contain sanitary sewage,\u201d and that contact with sewage poses a \u201cpotential health risk.\u201d The sewage has impaired the Gilberts\u2019 ability to use and enjoy their property and has restricted their control of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">{\u00b6 8} In 2007, the Gilberts filed an action in the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County for a writ of mandamus to compel the city to commence an appropriation proceeding. In their mandamus petition, the Gilberts alleged two separate takings claims: (1) a regulatory taking based on the city\u2019s failure to improve the sewer-system pump station, which frustrated the Gilberts\u2019 reasonable investment-backed expectations, and (2) a physical taking based on the city\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>upgrade the pump station, which caused raw sewage to directly encroach upon the Gilberts\u2019 property by flowing into the creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">{\u00b6 9} In November 2007, the court of appeals denied the writ. <em>State ex rel. Gilbert v. Cincinnati, </em>174 Ohio App.3d 89, 2007-Ohio-6332, 880 N.E.2d 971. The court of appeals concluded that (1) the Gilberts\u2019 inability to develop their property to the maximum allowed under its zoning classification had not resulted in a regulatory taking and (2) the Gilberts had failed to present sufficient evidence that sewage from the pump station had overflowed onto their property so as to constitute a physical taking. Id. at \u00b6 27-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">{\u00b6 10} The Gilberts appealed the court of appeals\u2019 denial of the writ to this court in case No. 2008-0029. After the court of appeals entered its judgment, the Gilberts received additional sanitary-sewer-overflow reports from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency that they had previously requested. Based on this new evidence, the Gilberts filed a Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment in the court of appeals and motions in this court to stay the appeal and to remand part of the appeal to the court of appeals to rule on the Civ.R. 60(B) motion. We granted the motions for a stay and a partial remand. <em>State ex rel. Gilbert v. Cincinnati, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 1445, 2008-Ohio-2831, 888 N.E.2d 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">{\u00b6 11} On remand, the court of appeals granted the Gilberts\u2019 motion for relief from judgment on their physical-taking claim by ordering the parties to file evidence and briefs on the issue whether \u201cthe discharge of raw sewage from a sewer system onto private property constituted a taking.\u201d The additional evidence included testimony that the planned pump-station upgrade, which would eliminate overflows and allow additional sewer-system connections, was close to completion. Following the completion of briefing, the city filed a motion to supplement the record with evidence that the pump-station upgrade had been completed, the sanitary-sewer-overflow sign had been removed, and the upgrade provided capacity for the Gilberts\u2019 planned development.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">{\u00b6 12} In 2009, the court of appeals granted a writ of mandamus to compel the city to commence an appropriation proceeding on the Gilberts\u2019 physical-taking claim. <em>State ex rel. Gilbert v. Cincinnati, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-070166, 2009-Ohio-1078, 2009 WL 636541. The court of appeals also denied the city\u2019s motion to supplement the record and denied the city\u2019s subsequent request for findings of fact and conclusions of law. The city appealed the judgment in case No. 2009-0753.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">{\u00b6 13} This cause is now before the court upon the Gilberts\u2019 appeal from the judgment of the court of appeals denying the writ of mandamus for their regulatory-taking claim and the city\u2019s cross-appeal from the judgment of the court of appeals granting the writ of mandamus for the Gilberts\u2019 physical-taking claim.</p>\n<p id=\"Atu7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\">\n<em>Mandamus to Compel Appropriation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe United States and Ohio Constitutions guarantee that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Shemo v. Mayfield Hts. </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 59, 63, 765 N.E.2d 345, judgment modified in part on other grounds, 96 Ohio St.3d 379, 2002-Ohio-4905, 775 N.E.2d 493; Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; Section 19, Article I, Ohio Constitution. \u201cMandamus is the appropriate action to compel public authorities to institute appropriation proceedings where an involuntary taking of private property is alleged.\u201d <em>Shemo </em>at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">{\u00b6 15} To be entitled to the requested writ of mandamus, the Gilberts must establish a clear legal right to compel the city to commence appropriation, a corresponding legal duty on the part of the city to institute that action, and the lack of an adequate remedy for the Gilberts in the ordinary course of law. See <em>State ex rel. Shelly Materials, Inc. v. Clark Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 337, 2007-Ohio-5022, 875 N.E.2d 59, \u00b6 15. The Gilberts claim entitlement to appropriation proceedings for two separate takings of their property \u2014 a regulatory taking and a physical taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">\n<em>Appeal: Regulatory Taking</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">{\u00b6 16} In their appeal, the Gilberts assert that the court of appeals erred in denying a writ of mandamus to compel the city to commence an appropriation action on their regulatory-taking claim. The Gilberts claim that the city\u2019s failure to timely upgrade the pump station and to permit sewage connections or alternatives to dispose of sewage interfered with their reasonable investment-backed expectations for the property. The court of appeals denied the Gilberts\u2019 takings claim because they were not able to establish that the city\u2019s regulatory actions \u201cdenied all economically viable use of the land.\u201d <em>Gilbert, </em>174 Ohio App.3d 89, 2007-Ohio-6332, 880 N.E.2d 971, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">{\u00b6 17} The court of appeals erred in so holding because the Gilberts\u2019 failure to establish that the city\u2019s regulatory actions denied them all economically viable use of their property does not render their mandamus claim meritless. See <em>State ex rel. Gilmour Realty, Inc. v. Mayfield Hts., </em>119 Ohio St.3d 11, 2008-Ohio-3181, 891 N.E.2d 320, \u00b6 21. The Gilberts could still establish a partial regulatory taking under the standard specified by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co. v. New York City </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 104, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631. Id.; <em>State ex rel. Duncan v. Middlefield, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 313, 2008-Ohio-6200, 898 N.E.2d 952, \u00b6 17-18. <em>\u201cPenn Cent. </em>recognizes an ad hoc, factual inquiry that requires the examination of the following three factors to determine whether a regulatory taking occurred in cases in which there is no physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>invasion and the regulation deprives the property of less than 100 percent of its economically viable use: (1) the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant, (2) the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations, and (3) the character of the governmental action.\u201d <em>Shelly Materials, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 337, 2007-Ohio-5022, 875 N.E.2d 59, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">{\u00b6 18} Although the court of appeals erred in this regard, \u201c[w]e will not reverse a correct judgment simply because some or all of a lower court\u2019s reasons are erroneous.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Swain v. Bartleson, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 125, 2009-Ohio-4690, 914 N.E.2d 403, \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cIn order to make a successful claim under the Takings Clause, appellants must establish first that they possess a constitutionally protected property interest.\u201d <em>Neifert v. Dept. of the Environment </em>(2006), 395 Md. 486, 522, 910 A.2d 1100, citing <em>Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co. </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 986, 1000-1001, 104 S.Ct. 2862, 81 L.Ed.2d 815; <em>Beasley v. Flathead Cty. </em>(2009), 350 Mont. 177, 2009 MT 121, 206 P.3d 915, \u00b6 13 (\u201ctakings claims require a plaintiff first to demonstrate that it possesses a constitutionally protected property interest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">{\u00b6 20} To be sure, property, for purposes of the Takings Clause, \u201cencompasses more than the physical object owned.\u201d <em>McNamara v. Rittman, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 243, 2005-Ohio-6433, 838 N.E.2d 640, \u00b6 24-25. Courts have nevertheless recognized that access to government-provided sewer service is not a constitutionally protected interest subject to the Takings Clause. <em>Neifert, </em>395 Md. at 522, 910 A.2d 1100, quoting <em>Penn Cent., </em>438 U.S. at 124-125, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (\u201cAppellants have not demonstrated that the denial of sewer service has interfered with interests \u2018that were sufficiently bound up with the reasonable expectations of the claimant to constitute \u201cproperty\u201d for Fifth Amendment purposes\u2019 \u201d); <em>Front Royal &amp; Warren Cty. Indus. Park Corp. v. Front Royal </em>(C.A.4, 1998), 135 F.3d 275, 286-287 (holding that the failure to provide sewer service is not a taking, because there is no constitutionally protected property right to government-provided sewer service).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">{\u00b6 21} Ohio is no different. We have long recognized that a \u201cmunicipality is not obliged to construct * * * sewers.\u201d <em>Doud v. Cincinnati </em>(1949), 152 Ohio St. 132, 137, 39 O.O. 441, 87 N.E.2d 243; see also <em>Holbrook v. Brandenburg, </em>Clark App. No. 2007 CA 106, 2009-Ohio-2320, 2009 WL 1387192, \u00b6 17. Because the appellate court decision relied upon by the Gilberts fails to analyze whether there is a constitutionally protected right to government-provided sewer access, we find it unpersuasive. See <em>November Properties, Inc. v. Mayfield Hts. </em>(Dec. 6, 1979), Cuyahoga App. No. 39626, 1979 WL 210535.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">{\u00b6 22} Moreover, the Gilberts\u2019 investment-backed expectations for their property were not reasonable under the circumstances. Richard Gilbert had been a real-estate agent for over 15 years when he bought the property in 1998, and Lee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Gilbert had been a real-estate agent since 1989. When Richard Gilbert purchased the property in 1998 through his investment company, he did not expect that the sewer district would upgrade the pump station. He bought the property without contacting the sewer district to see if he could tap into the sewer system and without investigating or knowing whether there would be limitations on his ability to use the sewer system. The city had no clear legal duty to provide these sewer taps sooner than it did when the pump station was already operating at capacity and an upgrade would have required the expenditure of additional government resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">{\u00b6 23} Therefore, although its rationale for denying the writ was erroneous, the court of appeals correctly held that the Gilberts\u2019 regulatory-taking claim lacked merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">\n<em>Cross-Appeal: Physical Taking</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">{\u00b6 24} In its cross-appeal, the city argues that the court of appeals erred in granting the writ of mandamus on the Gilberts\u2019 physical-taking claim. \u201cThe rights related to property, i.e., to acquire, use, enjoy, and dispose of property, * * * are among the most revered in our law and traditions.\u201d <em>Norwood v. Horney, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 353, 2006-Ohio-3799, 853 N.E.2d 1115, \u00b6 34. \u201cThere can be no doubt that the bundle of venerable rights associated with property is strongly protected in the Ohio Constitution and must be trod upon lightly, no matter how great the weight of other forces.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 38. \u201c[P]hysical takings require compensation because of the unique burden they impose: A permanent physical invasion, however minimal the economic cost it entails, eviscerates the owner\u2019s right to exclude others from entering and using her property \u2014 perhaps the most fundamental of all property interests.\u201d <em>Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. </em>(2005), 544 U.S. 528, 539, 125 S.Ct. 2074, 161 L.Ed.2d 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">{\u00b6 25} The city contends that the court of appeals committed error when it \u201cestablished a new legal precedent that any overflow of sewage onto private property is a <em>per se </em>taking requiring appropriation of the subject property\u201d and \u201cregardless of whether or not the overflow has given rise to damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">(\u00b6 26} The city is incorrect. The court of appeals did not so hold. In fact, the court expressly held to the contrary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-10\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cBut the supreme court has never held that any overflow of sewage from a sewage system automatically constitutes a-taking. We emphasize that evidence of one or two sewage overflows onto a landowner\u2019s property would not necessarily be sufficient to show a taking. Proof of damage alone will not entitle a landowner to compensation.\u201d <em>Gilbert, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-070166, 2009-Ohio-1078, 2009 WL 636541, at \u00b6 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>{\u00b6 28} The court of appeals then held that the Gilberts\u2019 evidence established \u201cunequivocally\u201d that the pump station had \u201coverflowed a substantial number of times since 1998 when they * * * bought their property\u201d and that this constituted a physical invasion of their property, so they did not need to prove that they were denied all use of their property. Id. at \u00b6 11,14.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">{\u00b6 29} Our precedent supports the court of appeals\u2019 holding that there was a physical taking of the Gilberts\u2019 property. \u201cAny direct encroachment upon land, which subjects it to a public use that excludes or restricts the dominion and control of the owner over it, is a taking of his property, for which he is guaranteed a right of compensation by section 19 of the Bill of Rights.\u201d <em>Norwood v. Sheen </em>(1933), 126 Ohio St. 482, 186 N.E. 102, paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201c[Ujnder this principle, a municipality in creating a public improvement, may be liable for causing sewage * * * to be cast upon the land of another, if in so doing the owner is deprived of any of the use and enjoyment of his property.\u201d <em>Masley v. Lorain </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 334, 336, 2 O.O.3d 463, 358 N.E.2d 596; <em>Mansfield v. Balliett </em>(1902), 65 Ohio St. 451, 471, 63 N.E. 86 (in case in which city emptied sewage into natural watercourse, the court held that \u201cany physical interference by another with the owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of his property is a taking, to that extent\u201d and that \u201cthe principle of the constitution is as applicable where the owner is partially deprived of the uses of his land as where he is wholly deprived of it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">{\u00b6 30} There was sufficient evidence here to establish that the city directly encroached upon the Gilberts\u2019 property by depositing sewage in the creek that flows through their property. The pump station had overflowed on at least 79 days between 1998, when Richard Gilbert purchased the property, and 2008. The sewer district\u2019s own employees testified that when the pump station overflowed, the sewage went into the creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">{\u00b6 31} There was also evidence that the frequent sewage overflows at least in part deprived the Gilberts of the use and enjoyment of their property. The sewer district\u2019s own sign declared that the area was a \u201csanitary sewer overflow\u201d area and that \u201c[cjontact with sewage poses a potential health risk.\u201d A sewer-district engineer agreed that \u201c[a]nytime you come in contact with sewage there is the potential for disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">{\u00b6 32} In effect, the Gilberts established a taking because the city physically displaced them from exercising dominion and control of the creek and surrounding area on their property. See <em>McNamara, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 243, 2005-Ohio-6433, 838 N.E.2d 640, at \u00b6 28 (\u201cRights appurtenant to property are protected from governmental invasion, and water rights are appurtenant to title in real property\u201d). Moreover, because the sewage overflows were directed at the Gilberts\u2019 property, a taking occurred even in the absence of physical displacement. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>McKee v. Akron </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 282, 285, 27 O.O.2d 197, 199 N.E.2d 592, overruled on other grounds by <em>Haverlack v. Portage Homes, Inc. </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 26, 2 OBR 572, 442 N.E.2d 749 (\u201cA taking may also be found where it is clear that the injury sustained by a person differs substantially in kind from that sustained by others in the neighborhood, even though there has been no physical displacement. Thus a person might recover by showing that the damage was directed at his particular property\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">{\u00b6 33} Even if the taking were temporary as opposed to permanent, as the city asserts, that conclusion would not preclude a finding that there was, in fact, a taking. <em>Norwood, </em>126 Ohio St. 482, 186 N.E. 102, at paragraph one of the syllabus. Moreover, even when taking into consideration the supplemental evidence proffered by the city in the proceedings below, the evidence is conflicting whether the pump-station upgrade would necessarily fix the problems caused by the sewage having been dumped into the Gilberts\u2019 creek. The Gilberts testified that unless the city also cleaned the creek, the contamination caused by the decade-long overflow of sewage into the creek would not be remedied by the upgrade.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">{\u00b6 34} Therefore, the court of appeals correctly held that the Gilberts established a physical taking of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">{\u00b6 35} In its cross-appeal, the city also claims that the court of appeals abused its discretion by denying its motion to supplement the record with evidence that the upgrade of the pump station is complete and that any physical invasion has thus been abated because this evidence bears upon whether the taking is permanent or temporary. \u201cThe admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d See generally <em>State v. Haines, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 393, 2006-Ohio-6711, 860 N.E.2d 91, \u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">{\u00b6 36} The court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in denying the city\u2019s motion based on its belief that \u201cthe issue of whether the upgrade has resolved the problem is more relevant to the issue of damages in the appropriation proceeding than to the issue of whether a taking has occurred.\u201d <em>Gilbert, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-070166, 2009-Ohio-1078, 2009 WL 636541, \u00b6 16. Although this evidence would have been helpful, \u201c[wjhether a taking is characterized as temporary or permanent is of little significance in determining whether a taking has occurred and is not conclusive on the issue of when a suit must be brought on a taking claim, but such characterization has a bearing on the measure of damages.\u201d See Annotation, Elements and Measure of Compensation in Eminent Domain Proceeding for Temporary Taking of Property (2009), 49 A.L.R.6th 205, Section 2. And insofar as the city further contends that an appropriation proceeding is not the proper remedy when there is a temporary taking, we have expressly held otherwise. See, e.g., <em>Shemo, </em>95 Ohio St.3d at 70, 765 N.E.2d 345 (writ of mandamus granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>to compel respondents to commence appropriation proceedings to determine the amount of the city\u2019s temporary taking of relators\u2019 property); see also <em>Duncan, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 313, 2008-Ohio-6200, 898 N.E.2d 952, \u00b6 16 (in case in which relator alleged a temporary regulatory taking, court held that mandamus is the appropriate action to commence an appropriation proceeding to determine the amount of compensation to be awarded if taking is established).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">{\u00b6 37} Finally, notwithstanding the city\u2019s claim, the court of appeals did not err by denying the city\u2019s request for findings of fact and conclusions of law. \u201c \u2018[A] trial court has a mandatory duty under Civ.R. 52 to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law upon request timely made.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Papp v. James </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 373, 377, 632 N.E.2d 889, quoting <em>In re Adoption of Gibson </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 170, 173, 23 OBR 336, 492 N.E.2d 146. The purpose of this provision is \u201cto aid the appellate court in reviewing the record and determining the validity of the basis of the trial court\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Werden v. Crawford </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 122, 124, 24 O.O.3d 196, 435 N.E.2d 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cIf the court\u2019s ruling or opinion, together with other parts of the trial court\u2019s record, provides an adequate basis upon which an appellate court can decide the legal issues presented, there is * * * substantial compliance with Civ.R. 52.\u201d <em>Abney v. </em>W. <em>Res. Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 424, 431, 602 N.E.2d 348. \u201cThe test for determining whether a trial court\u2019s opinion satisfies the requirements of Civ.R. 52 is whether the contents of the opinion, when considered together with other parts of the record, form an adequate basis upon which to decide the narrow legal issues presented.\u201d <em>Brandon/Wiant Co. v. Teamor </em>(1999), 135 Ohio App.3d 417, 423, 734 N.E.2d 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">{\u00b6 39} After applying that test here, we conclude that the contents of the court of appeals\u2019 judgment and opinion granting the writ are sufficiently detailed for this court to decide the pertinent legal issues raised by the appeal and cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">{\u00b6 40} The court of appeals correctly granted the writ of mandamus to compel the city to commence an appropriation proceeding to determine the compensation due the Gilberts for the city\u2019s physical taking of their property. The court of appeals also properly denied the writ of mandamus on the Gilberts\u2019 regulatory-taking claim. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b590-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Manley Burke, Matthew W.
