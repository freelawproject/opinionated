R.J. Corman Derailment Servs., L.L.C., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 280, 2010-Ohio-1029, 927 N.E.2d 1092, challenge the constitutionality of R.C. 2745.01, an employer intentional-tort statute enacted by Am.H.B. No. 498, effective April 7, 2005. 150 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 5533. For the reasons that follow, we hold that R.C. 2745.01 violates neither the plain language nor the plain meaning of Sections 34 or 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. We find the construction of Sections 34 and 35 set forth in <em>Johnson v. BP Chems., Inc. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 298, 707 N.E.2d 1107, to be inconsistent with other decisions of this court, including decisions subsequent to <em>Johnson. </em>Moreover, the provisions of the statute we review herein are significantly different from those of the statute reviewed in <em>Johnson. </em>Therefore, while we do not specifically overrule the decision in that case, we limit its reach to apply only to the statutory provisions that were then at issue. Because the judgment of the court of appeals in the case sub judice was based on Johnson\u2019s flawed interpretations of Sections 34 and 35, we must reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-16\">{\u00b6 2} In <em>Stetter, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 280, 2010-Ohio-1029, 927 N.E.2d 1092, also decided this day, we uphold the constitutionality of R.C. 2745.01 in the face of challenges on other grounds. The net result of these two decisions is to confirm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the constitutional validity of R.C. 2745.01. We therefore apply the statute to this case and consider the record in light of the statutory standards for an employer intentional tort. We agree with the trial court that summary judgment in favor of the employer is warranted as a matter of law pursuant to R.C. 2745.01. Accordingly, we reinstate the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">{\u00b6 3} On June 30, 2005, plaintiff-appellee, Rose Kaminski, was working as a press operator at the Salem, Ohio metal fabrication manufacturing facility of defendant-appellant, Metal &amp; Wire Products Company (\u201cMetal &amp; Wire\u201d). The automatic press that Kaminski operated used a coil of rolled steel fed into the press to produce stamped, flat pieces. In operating the press, Kaminski\u2019s job was to ensure that the coil feed ran smoothly, shut the press down if it jammed, and verify that the stamped pieces met required specifications. When the coil of steel was used up, she would summon a supervisor, who would load a new coil into place with a forklift.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">{\u00b6 4} When Kaminski\u2019s press ran out of steel on June 30, she searched for her shift\u2019s supervisor to load another coil, but she was unable to find him. Kaminski enlisted a co-worker who had loaded coils in the past to load the new coil. The co-worker used the right fork of a forklift to lift a coil, which was about five feet tall and weighed about 800 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">{\u00b6 5} To properly load the coil onto Kaminski\u2019s press, the coil had to be switched from the right fork to the left fork. To accomplish the switch, the coworker had to lower the coil to the floor, back the forklift away from it, and then pull forward again with the left fork positioned to pick up the coil.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">{\u00b6 6} When the coil is off the fork, it can become unsteady. The co-worker was at first reluctant to have Kaminski, a small woman who was about the same height as the coil, steady the coil in an upright position while he backed away from it and repositioned. However, the two eventually agreed that Kaminski would hold the coil because the supervisor was not there and because the coworker believed that Kaminski wanted to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">{\u00b6 7} With Kaminski steadying the coil, the co-worker backed the forklift away and then pulled forward. Rather than going cleanly into the coil\u2019s opening, the fork bumped the coil. Kaminski was unable to control the coil. It wobbled and then fell onto Kaminski\u2019s legs and feet, injuring her.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">{\u00b6 8} Kaminski applied for and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits for her injuries. She was unable to return to work at Metal <em>&amp; </em>Wire as a press operator due to the injuries. After receiving paychecks until March 2006, she was eventually discharged from employment because no other position was available. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>There is nothing in the record to indicate that Kaminski\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits were ever terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">{\u00b6 9} About two months after the incident, on August 29, 2005, Kaminski filed a lawsuit in which she alleged that Metal &amp; Wire had committed an employer intentional tort under R.C. 2745.01. Additionally, Kaminski specifically asserted that R.C. 2745.01 \u201cin its entirety is unconstitutional\u201d under this court\u2019s precedent, and she alleged that Metal &amp; Wire had committed a common-law employer intentional tort. Metal &amp; Wire answered and asserted a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment that R.C. 2745.01 is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">{\u00b6 10} Metal &amp; Wire moved for summary judgment on its counterclaim. The trial court granted the motion, declaring the statute constitutional and holding that it therefore applied to Kaminski\u2019s claim. Metal &amp; Wire then moved for summary judgment on Kaminski\u2019s complaint. The trial court granted that motion, determining that Kaminski had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that Metal &amp; Wire\u2019s conduct fell within the statutory criteria necessary to commit an employer intentional tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">{\u00b6 11} On appeal, the Seventh District Court of Appeals agreed with Kaminski\u2019s first assignment of error and held that R.C. 2745.01 is unconstitutional in its entirety. It based its decision upon decisions of this court interpreting prior employer intentional-tort statutes. 175 Ohio App.3d 227, 2008-Ohio-1521, 886 N.E.2d 262, \u00b6 34. The court of appeals declined to consider Kaminski\u2019s further arguments that the statute is unconstitutional on new grounds never before addressed, reasoning that \u201c[bjecause R.C. 2745.01 is unconstitutional based on Sections 34 and 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution\u201d pursuant to those decisions, \u201cfurther analysis here is unnecessary.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">{\u00b6 12} The trial court had considered Kaminski\u2019s claims only under the employer intentional-tort statute. However, the court of appeals proceeded to consider at length whether her claims met the criteria for a common-law employer intentional tort. It held that Kaminski had presented sufficient evidence under the common-law test to survive summary judgment, and it remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings. Id. at \u00b6 46-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">{\u00b6 13} We accepted Metal &amp; Wire\u2019s discretionary appeal for review of three propositions of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 119 Ohio St.3d 1407, 2008-Ohio-3880, 891 N.E.2d 768. The first proposition urges us to overrule the precedent relied upon by the court of appeals in holding R.C. 2745.01 unconstitutional. The second proposition asserts that R.C. 2745.01 does not violate Sections 34 and 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. The third proposition asserts that the court of appeals should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>remanded the cause to the trial court upon its holding that the statute is unconstitutional, rather than itself considering whether the facts constituted a common-law employer intentional tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">II. History and Development of Employer Intentional-Tort Law in Ohio</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">{\u00b6 14} Any analysis of the development of Ohio\u2019s case law regarding employer intentional torts necessarily centers on Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cFor the purpose of providing compensation to workmen and their dependents, for death, injuries or occupational disease, occasioned in the course of such workmen\u2019s employment, laws may be passed establishing a state fund to be created by compulsory contribution thereto by employers, and administered by the state, determining the terms and conditions upon which payment shall be made therefrom. Such compensation shall be in lieu of all other rights to compensation, or damages, for such death, injuries, or occupational disease, and any employer who pays the premium or compensation provided by law, passed in accordance herewith, shall not be liable to respond in damages at common law or by statute for such death, injuries or occupational disease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">{\u00b6 16} Ohio employees injured in the workplace before Section 35, Article II was adopted were forced to bring a common-law action against their employer and to prove that the employer was at fault. The employer had a number of powerful common-law defenses that left many deserving employees uncompensated. In 1911, in response to calls for reform, the General Assembly, acting without the benefit of a specific constitutional provision, enacted a statute governing compensation for industrial injuries. 102 Ohio Laws 524 et seq. The following year, the initial version of Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution was adopted. See <em>Van Fossen v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 100, 109-110, 522 N.E.2d 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">{\u00b6 17} In its initial form, Section 35 empowered the General Assembly to provide for the compensation of workplace injuries or occupational diseases and authorized that body to enact legislation requiring compulsory employer contributions into a statewide fund. Section 35 and its derivative legislation \u201cwere public policy trade-offs\u201d by which the employee achieved \u201ca certain and speedy recovery in exchange for granting a more limited liability to the employer.\u201d Id. at 110, 522 N.E.2d 489. As originally enacted, Section 35 did not speak to the question of whether an employee who collected from the state fund could also sue the employer in tort for the same injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">{\u00b6 18} The 1911 legislation contained a \u201cwilful act\u201d exception that allowed an employee to bring a common-law action against his employer in certain situations. The term \u201cwilful act,\u201d however, was not originally statutorily defined, leading to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>\u201cconsiderable legal activity against employers.\u201d Id., 36 Ohio St.3d at 110, 522 N.E.2d 489. In 1914, the General Assembly enacted G.C. 1465-76 to define \u201cwilful act\u201d as an act done \u201cknowingly and purposely with the direct object of injuring another.\u201d 104 Ohio Laws 194. This court later held that under G.C. 1465-76, \u201c \u2018willful act\u2019 * * * imports an act of will and design and of conscious intention to inflict injury upon some person. Gross negligence or wantonness can no longer be a willful act under this section * * *.\u201d <em>Gildersleeve v. Newton Steel Co. </em>(1924), 109 Ohio St. 341, 142 N.E. 678, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">{\u00b6 19} Effective January 1, 1924, Section 35, Article II was amended to make the workers\u2019 compensation laws the exclusive remedy. The amendment added the second sentence to Section 35, which continues in force today and provides that \u201c[s]uch compensation shall be in lieu of all other rights to compensation term\u201d and that employers who comply with workers\u2019 compensation laws \u201cshall not be liable to respond in damages at common law or by statute.\u201d On its face, this provision was widely believed to grant immunity to complying employers \u201cfrom <em>any </em>common-law actions for injuries suffered by employees in the workplace.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Van Fossen, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 111, 522 N.E.2d 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">{\u00b6 20} Fifteen years later, this court decided <em>Triff v. Natl. Bronze &amp; Aluminum Foundry Co. </em>(1939), 135 Ohio St. 191, 14 O.O. 48, 20 N.E.2d 232, which held at paragraph two of the syllabus that an employee could file suit, despite Section 35, for an injury that resulted from a noncompensable occupational disease. The General Assembly \u201cimmediately amended the workers\u2019 compensation laws to restore the exclusivity of remedy.\u201d <em>Van Fossen, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 111, 522 N.E.2d 489. To that end, the General Assembly modified G.C. 1465-70, see 118 Ohio Laws 422, 426-427, to provide that employers who comply with workers\u2019 compensation statutory requirements \u201cshall not be liable to respond to damages at common law or by statute, for any injury, disease, or bodily condition, whether such * * * is compensable under this act or not.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> G.C. 1465-70 was later recodified as R.C. 4123.74. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>\n<em>A. Modem Case Law Establishing the Elements of a Common-Law Employer Intentional Tort</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Akq\">{\u00b6 21} Despite the emergence and development of the concept that recovery within the workers\u2019 compensation system was to be the exclusive remedy for employee injury in the workplace, this court in <em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chems., Inc. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 608, 23 O.O.3d 504, 433 N.E.2d 572, devised an exception. <em>Blankenship\u2019s </em>syllabus held that \u201c[a]n employee is not precluded by Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, or by R.C. 4123.74<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> * ** * from enforcing his common law remedies against his employer for an intentional tort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>Blankenship, </em>the trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 suit, which alleged that the employer, a manufacturer of chemicals, had committed an intentional tort by exposing the plaintiffs to dangerous chemicals. The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal by reasoning that \u201cthe purpose of Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, was to abolish civil actions by employees against complying employers for work-related injuries.\u201d Thus, courts lack jurisdiction over such claims. \u201cTo hold otherwise would clearly frustrate the enabling language of Art. II, Section 35 * * * and the legislative scheme embodied in R.C. 4123.74 * * <em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chems., Inc. </em>(Jan. 14, 1981), Hamilton App. No. C-790768, 1981 WL 9561, *5.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>{\u00b6 23} In reversing the dismissal, this court stated that \u201cwhere an employee asserts in his complaint a claim for damages based on an intentional tort, \u2018* * * the substance of the claim is not an \u201cinjury * * * received or contracted by any employee in the course of or arising out of his employment\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 4123.74.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blankenship, </em>69 Ohio St.2d at 613, 23 O.O.3d 504, 433 N.E.2d 572, quoting <em>Delamotte v. Midland Ross Corp. </em>(1978), 64 Ohio App.2d 159, 161, 18 O.O.3d 117, 411 N.E.2d 814. This court further stated, \u201cSince an employer\u2019s intentional conduct does not arise out of employment, R.C. 4123.74 does not bestow upon employers immunity from civil liability for their intentional torts and an employee may resort to a civil suit for damages.\u201d 69 Ohio St.2d at 613, 23 O.O.3d 504, 433 N.E.2d 572. Thus, the <em>Blankenship </em>court declared that workers\u2019 compensation is not always the exclusive remedy for certain intentional torts. It reversed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint and remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings without considering the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 intentional-tort claims. Id. at 615-616, 23 O.O.3d 504, 433 N.E.2d 572.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">{\u00b6 24} Notably, this court in <em>Blankenship </em>did not consider Section 35, Article II, beyond observing that it does not \u201cexpressly extend the grant of immunity to actions alleging intentional tortious conduct by employers against their employees.\u201d Id. at 612, 23 O.O.3d 504, 433 N.E.2d 572. See also id. at the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">{\u00b6 25} In <em>Jones v. VIP Dev. Co. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 90, 95, 15 OBR 246, 472 N.E.2d 1046, this court followed up on <em>Blankenship </em>by rejecting the proposition that an employer\u2019s \u201cspecific intent to injure is necessary to a finding of intentional misconduct.\u201d Relying on Prosser &amp; Keeton, Law of Torts (5th Ed.1984) 35-36, Section 8, and 1 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965) 15, Section 8A, the <em>Jones </em>court formulated a broadened definition of \u201cintent.\u201d That definition focused not just on the specific consequences that an actor desires but also on those consequences that an actor believes are substantially certain to result from the actor\u2019s conduct. The court held at paragraph one of the syllabus: \u201cAn intentional tort is an act committed with the intent to injure another, or committed with the belief that such injury is substantially certain to occur.\u201d The court then applied this holding to the facts of three different cases accepted for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>review and resolved all three in favor of employees pursuing recovery for alleged employer intentional torts. Id. at 95-98, 15 OBR 246, 472 N.E.2d 1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">{\u00b6 26} The <em>Jones </em>court also made two more noteworthy holdings. The court held at paragraph two of the syllabus that \u201c[t]he receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits does not preclude an employee or his representative from pursuing a common-law action for damages against his employer for an intentional tort.\u201d The court held at paragraph three of the syllabus that \u201c[a]n employer who has been held liable for an intentional tort is not entitled to a setoff of the award in the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits received by the employee or his representative.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">{\u00b6 27} In the wake of <em>Blankenship </em>and <em>Jones, </em>the General Assembly enacted former R.C. 4121.80 in Am.Sub.S.B. No. 307, 141 Ohio Laws, Part I, 733-737, effective August 22, 1986. Former R.C. 4121.80(G)(1) defined \u201csubstantially certain\u201d as requiring that an employer act \u201cwith deliberate intent to cause an employee to suffer injury, disease, condition, or death.\u201d 141 Ohio Laws, id., at 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">{\u00b6 28} Having held that former R.C. 4121.80 did not apply to the case before it,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> this court in <em>Van Fossen </em>endeavored to clarify the standards established in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>Jones </em>for a common-law intentional tort. The court explained that trial courts had misconstrued the phrase \u201csubstantially certain to occur,\u201d essentially with the result of \u201ctransforming negligence cases into intentional tort cases.\u201d 36 Ohio St.3d at 115, 522 N.E.2d 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">{\u00b6 29} The standards for a common-law employer intentional tort established in <em>Van </em>Fossen<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> were subsequently modified in <em>Fyffe v. Jeno\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 115, 570 N.E.2d 1108, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus. Paragraph one of the syllabus of <em>Fyffe </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cWithin the purview of Section 8(A) of the Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts, and Section 8 of Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts (5 Ed.1984), in order to establish \u2018intent\u2019 for the purpose of proving the existence of an intentional tort committed by an employer against his employee, the following must be demonstrated: (1) knowledge by the employer of the existence of a dangerous process, procedure, instrumentality or condition within its business operation; (2) knowledge by the employer that if the employee is subjected by his employment to such dangerous process, procedure, instrumentality or condition, then harm to the employee will be a substantial certainty; and (3) that the employer, under such circumstances, and with such knowledge, did act to require the employee to continue to perform the dangerous task. <em>(Van Fossen v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. </em>[1988], 36 Ohio St.3d 100, 522 N.E.2d 489, paragraph five of the syllabus, modified as set forth above and explained.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">{\u00b6 31} Paragraph two of the syllabus of <em>Fyffe </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>{\u00b6 32} \u201cTo establish an intentional tort of an employer, proof beyond that required to prove negligence and beyond that to prove recklessness must be established. Where the employer acts despite his knowledge of some risk, his conduct may be negligence. As the probability increases that particular consequences may follow, then the employer\u2019s conduct may be characterized as recklessness. As the probability that the consequences will follow further increases, and the employer knows that injuries to employees are certain or substantially certain to result from the process, procedure or condition and he still proceeds, he is treated by the law as if he had in fact desired to produce the result. However, the mere knowledge and appreciation of a risk- \u2014 -something short of substantial certainty- \u2014 -is not intent. <em>(Van Fossen v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. </em>[1988], 36 Ohio St.3d 100, 522 N.E.2d 489, paragraph six of the syllabus, modified as set forth above and explained.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">{\u00b6 33} In light of later decisions of this court striking down as unconstitutional several more enactments governing employer intentional torts (including former R.C. 4121.80), <em>Fyffe\u2019s </em>common-law test for employer intentional torts applied until the General Assembly in House Bill 498, effective April 7, 2005, enacted the version of R.C. 2745.01 whose constitutionality is at issue in this case and in <em>Stetter. </em>In the case sub judice, the court of appeals, after it held current R.C. 2745.01 to be unconstitutional, evaluated Kaminski\u2019s claims under the <em>Fyffe </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\n<em>B.

Although Justice Brown agreed that \u201cR.C. 4121.80 is not authorized by Sections 34 and 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution,\u201d id., he did not believe that this conclusion ended the inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cThis does not mean, however, that the General Assembly has <em>no </em>power to modify intentional tort law by legislation. The legislature may do so in the exercise of its police power. Cf. <em>State, ex rel. Yaple, v. Creamer </em>(1912), 85 Ohio St. 349, 97 N.E. 602 (enactment of Workers\u2019 Compensation Act prior to the adoption of Section 35, Article II was a valid exercise of the police power). However, while the General Assembly\u2019s exercise of the powers granted by Sections 34 and 35 of Article II is not limited by any other provision of the Ohio Constitution, * * * its exercise of the police power is. Thus, it is necessary to go beyond the analysis in the majority opinion and test the constitutionality of R.C. 4121.80 with reference to provisions of the Constitution other than Sections 34 and 35 of Article II.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 640, 576 N.E.2d 722.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">{\u00b6 44} Justice Brown then stated that former R.C. 4121.80(C) and (D) violated Section 5, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, which guarantees the right to a trial by jury, by requiring the Industrial Commission, and not a civil jury, to determine damages in an intentional-tort action. Id.. He also reasoned that former R.C. 4121.80(D)\u2019s cap on damages was unconstitutional.

Significantly, the provisions Justice Brown objected to in former R.C. 4121.80(C) and (D) have no counterparts in the version of R.C. 2745.01 we review here.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">{\u00b6 46} This court next had occasion to consider employer intentional-tort legislation in <em>Johnson v.

For clarity of analysis, we defer our discussion of <em>Johnson </em>until later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">{\u00b6 47} R.C. 2745.01, effective April 7, 2005, provides in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">(\u00b6 48} \u201c(A) In an action brought against an employer by an employee, or by the dependent survivors of a deceased employee, for damages resulting from an intentional tort committed by the employer during the course of employment, the employer shall not be liable unless the plaintiff proves that the employer committed the tortious act with the intent to injure another or with the belief that the injury was substantially certain to occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">{\u00b6 49} \u201c(B) As used in this section, \u2018substantially certain\u2019 means that an employer acts with deliberate intent to cause an employee to suffer an injury, a disease, a condition, or death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c(C) Deliberate removal by an employer of an equipment safety guard or deliberate misrepresentation of a toxic or hazardous substance creates a rebuttable presumption that the removal or misrepresentation was committed with intent to injure another if an injury or an occupational disease or condition occurs as a direct result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c(D) This section does not apply to claims arising during the course of employment involving discrimination, civil rights, retaliation, harassment in violation of Chapter 4112 of the Revised Code, intentional infliction of emotional distress not compensable under Chapters 4121 and 4123 of the Revised Code, contract, promissory estoppel, or defamation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">\n<em>A. The Statutory Intent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">{\u00b6 52} In construing current R.C. 2745.01, the court of appeals in the instant ease reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-13\">(\u00b6 53} \u201cR.C. 2745.01(A) provides that in an employer intentional tort action, the employee must prove \u2018that the employer committed the tortious act <em>with the intent to injure another or with the belief that the injury was substantially certain to occur.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>{\u00b6 54} \u201c \u2018Intent to injure\u2019 is clear and, therefore, is not defined in the statute. [Substantially certain,\u2019 however, is not as clear. Therefore, the legislature provided a definition. R.C. 2745.01(B) defines \u2018substantially certain\u2019 as acting \u2018with deliberate intent to cause an employee to suffer an injury, a disease, a condition, or death.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cWhen we consider the definition of \u2018substantial certainty,\u2019 it becomes apparent that an employee does not have two ways to prove an intentional tort claim as R.C. 2745.01(A) suggests. The employee\u2019s two options of proof become: (1) the employer acted with intent to injure or (2) the employer acted with deliberate intent to injure. Thus, under R.C. 2745.01, the only way an employee can recover is if the employer acted with the intent to cause injury.\u201d <em>Kaminski, </em>175 Ohio App.3d 227, 2008-Ohio-1521, 886 N.E.2d 262, \u00b6 29-31.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 56} As an initial matter, we agree with the court of appeals that the General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting R.C. 2745.01, as expressed particularly in 2745.01(B), is to permit recovery for employer intentional torts only when an employer acts with specific intent to cause an injury, subject to subsections (C) and (D). See <em>Talik v. Fed. Marine Terminals, Inc., </em>117 Ohio St.3d 496, 2008-Ohio-937, 885 N.E.2d 204, \u00b6 17 (the General Assembly in R.C. 2745.01 \u201cmodified the common-law definition of an employer intentional tort\u201d by rejecting \u201cthe notion that acting with a belief that injury is substantially certain to occur is analogous to wanton misconduct\u201d). See also <em>Stetter, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 280, 2010-Ohio-1029, 927 N.E.2d 1092, at paragraph three of the syllabus, in which we hold that R.C. 2745.01 does not eliminate the common-law cause of action for an employer intentional tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">{\u00b6 57} This view is supported by the history of employer intentional-tort litigation in Ohio and by a comparison of the current statute to previous statutory attempts. See, e.g., <em>Van Fossen, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 108-109, 522 N.E.2d 489, holding that former R.C. 4121.80(G) (which bore a marked resemblance to current R.C. 2745.01(B)) imposed \u201ca new, more difficult statutory restriction upon\u201d an employee\u2019s ability to bring an employer intentional-tort action; <em>Johnson, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 310, 707 N.E.2d 1107 (Cook, J., dissenting) (\u201cBy enacting [former] R.C. 2745.01, the General Assembly sought to statutorily narrow [the] common-law definition [of employer intentional tort] to \u2018direct intent\u2019 torts only\u201d). Accordingly, our task in this case and in <em>Stetter </em>is to determine whether the statute, insofar as it intends to significantly restrict actions for employer intentional torts, survives scrutiny under certain provisions of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">\n<em>B. Sections 31 and 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">{\u00b6 58} Our inquiry into the constitutionality of R.C. 2745.01 is guided by familiar and well-established standards. First, all statutes enjoy a strong presumption of constitutionality. \u201cBefore a court may declare unconstitutional an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>enactment of the legislative branch, \u2018it must appear beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislation and constitutional provisions are clearly incompatible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arbino v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 25, quoting <em>State ex rel. Dickman v. Defenbacher </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 142, 57 O.O. 134, 128 N.E.2d 59, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">{\u00b6 59} Second, \u201ca fundamental principle of the constitutional separation of powers among the three branches of government is that the legislative branch of government is \u2018the ultimate arbiter of public policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arbino </em>at \u00b6 21, quoting <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer, Div. of Gannett Satellite Information Network v. Dupuis, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 126, 2002-Ohio-7041, 781 N.E.2d 163, \u00b6 21. In fulfilling that role, the legislature is entrusted with the power to continually refine Ohio\u2019s laws to meet the needs of our citizens. <em>Arbino, </em>id.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">{\u00b6 60} It is undisputed that Section 1, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, which vests all legislative power of the state in the General Assembly, empowers that body to enact any law that does not conflict with the Ohio or United States Constitution. See <em>State ex. rel Jackman v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St.2d 159, 162, 38 O.O.2d 404, 224 N.E.2d 906. This authority includes the power to \u201calter, revise, modify, or abolish the common law\u201d as the General Assembly may deem necessary to further the common good. <em>Arbino </em>at \u00b6 131 (Cupp, J., concurring). See <em>Thompson v. Ford </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 74, 79, 57 O.O. 96, 128 N.E.2d 111 (within the scope of its police powers, the General Assembly \u201cmay modify or entirely abolish common-law actions and defenses\u201d); accord <em>Strock v. Pressnell </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 207, 214, 527 N.E.2d 1235.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">{\u00b6 61} Third, it is not the role of the courts to establish their own legislative policies or to second-guess the policy choices made by the General Assembly. \u201c \u2018[T]he General Assembly is responsible for weighing [policy] concerns and making policy decisions; we are charged with evaluating the constitutionality of their choices.\u2019 \u201d <em>Groch v.

Section 31, Article II of the Ohio Constitution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">{\u00b6 63} Section 34, Article II authorizes the General Assembly to enact laws \u201cproviding for the comfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employes.\u201d Clearly, this section states its grant of authority to the General Assembly in the affirmative (\u201cLaws may be passed\u201d) and not in the negative or in the restrictive.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>{\u00b6 64} In <em>Am. Assn. of Univ. Professors, Cent. State Univ. Chapter v. Cent. State Univ. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 55, 717 N.E.2d 286 <em>(\u201cAAUP II\u201d), </em>a case decided after <em>Johnson, </em>this court considered the constitutionality of R.C. 3345.45, a statute addressing concerns over the decline in faculty teaching hours at public universities. The plaintiffs challenged the statute under Section 34, Article II, contending that Section 34 authorizes only those laws benefiting employees and arguing that the statute was unconstitutional because it burdened employees rather than benefiting them. Id. at 60, 717 N.E.2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">{\u00b6 65} In rejecting these arguments and upholding the statute as \u201ca valid exercise of legislative authority under Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution,\u201d id. at paragraph two of the syllabus, we reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cThis court has repeatedly interpreted Section 34, Article II as a broad <em>grant </em>of authority to the General Assembly, not as a limitation on its power to enact legislation. See, <em>e.g., Rocky River v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 1, 14, 539 N.E.2d 103, 114. [Plaintiffs\u2019] position would require Section 34 to be read as a limitation, in effect stating: \u2018No law shall be passed on the subject of employee working conditions <em>unless it furthers </em>the comfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employees.\u2019 Under that approach, however, Section 34 would prohibit all legislation imposing any burden whatsoever on employees, regardless of how beneficial to the public that legislation might be. The invalidity of this position becomes strikingly apparent when viewed in the context of <em>existing </em>employment-related laws.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 61, 717 N.E.2d 286.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">{\u00b6 67} We recently reiterated that Section 34 does not limit the General Assembly\u2019s authority to legislate. See <em>Lima v. State, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 155, 2009-Ohio-2597, 909 N.E.2d 616, \u00b6 11, quoting <em>AAUP II, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 61, 717 N.E.2d 286.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">{\u00b6 68} Decisions of this court after <em>Johnson </em>have therefore conclusively established that Section 34, Article II is not a limitation on the General Assembly\u2019s authority to legislate.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">2. <em>Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">{\u00b6 69} Just as Section 34, Article II is phrased as an affirmative grant of power to the General Assembly (\u201cLaws may be passed\u201d), Section 35, Article II also is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>expressed as an affirmative grant of power: \u201cFor the purpose of providing compensation to workmen and their dependents, for death, injuries or occupational disease, occasioned in the course of such workmen\u2019s employment, <em>laws may be passed </em>establishing a state fund * * (Emphasis added.) Section 35 also specifies the effect of the exercise of that power by the General Assembly: The compensation \u201cshall be in lieu of all other rights to compensation, or damages, for such death, injuries, or occupational disease,\u201d and employers who pay the premium or compensation provided by the workers\u2019 compensation laws <em>\u201cshall not be liable to respond in damages at common law or by statute </em>for such death, injuries or occupational disease.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">(\u00b6 70} This court construed Section 35 in <em>Holeton v. Crouse Cartage Co. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 115, 748 N.E.2d 1111. In that case, we considered whether former R.C. 4123.931, a workers\u2019 compensation subrogation statute enacted in 1995 (Am.Sub.H.B. No. 278, 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3596), violated Section 35. We concluded that it did not.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">{\u00b6 71} In rejecting the argument that the concept of a workers\u2019 compensation subrogation statute is repugnant to Section 35, this court in <em>Holeton </em>stated that \u201cSection 35, Article II enables a displacement of the common law only to the extent necessary to provide the injured worker with an automatic recovery. Once payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits is ensured, the employer may, without any disparagement to the bargained-for rights of the employee, seek to impose the loss upon the ultimate wrongdoer.\u201d Id. at 120, 748 N.E.2d 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">{\u00b6 72} We observed that concerns about the statute diminishing or extinguishing the claimant\u2019s <em>tort </em>recovery were not relevant to an analysis under Section 35 because the statute did not affect the claimant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation. \u201cAfter the statute completes its task, * * * the claimant is always left with the full measure of compensation and benefits to which he or she is entitled under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d Id. We therefore concluded that the former statute did not \u201cdisrupt any of the rights or obligations of the claimant and the employer with regard to the payment of statutory workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and the balance of compromise upon which the viability of the workers\u2019 compensation system depends remains intact\u201d and held that the former statute did not violate Section 35. Id., 92 Ohio St.3d at 121, 748 N.E.2d 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>{\u00b6 73} Thus, in <em>Holeton, </em>we held that Section 35 does not forbid legislation that affects employees\u2019 tort recovery without affecting employees\u2019 receipt of workers\u2019 compensation. It follows that Section 35 does not forbid the legislation before us today, which affects employees\u2019 recovery for intentional torts, but not receipt of workers\u2019 compensation. Viewed from an employee\u2019s perspective, Section 35 addresses and authorizes recovery under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Legislation that does not affect that recovery falls outside of any Section 35 concerns. See <em>Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 640, 576 N.E.2d 722 (Herbert R. Brown, J., concurring) (\u201cIntentional torts do not * * * come within the scope of Section 35, Article II\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">{\u00b6 74} This court also recognized that Section 35 is a broad grant of authority to the General Assembly in <em>Bickers v. W. &amp; S. Life Ins. Co., </em>116 Ohio St.3d 351, 2007-Ohio-6751, 879 N.E.2d 201: \u201cIt is within the prerogative and authority of the General Assembly to make [choices] when determining policy in the workers\u2019 compensation arena and in balancing, in that forum, employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 competing interests. See, e.g., <em>Rambaldo v. Accurate Die Casting </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 281, 288, 603 N.E.2d 975. We may not override [those choices] and [impose our own preferences] on this wholly statutory system. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cMoreover, it would be inappropriate for the judiciary to presume the superiority of its policy preference and supplant the policy choice of the legislature. For it is the legislature, and not the courts, to which the Ohio Constitution commits the determination of the policy compromises necessary to balance the obligations and rights of the employer and employee in the workers\u2019 compensation system. Section 35, Article II, Ohio Constitution.\u201d <em>Bickers, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 351, 2007-Ohio-6751, 879 N.E.2d 201, \u00b6 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">{\u00b6 76} As illustrated by the above discussion, Section 35, Article II, like Section 34, Article II, is a <em>grant </em>of authority to the General Assembly, not a <em>restriction </em>of that body\u2019s authority to legislate.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">(\u00b6 77} This would end our analysis of the constitutionality of the employer intentional-tort statute before us under Sections 34 and 35, except for this court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">\n<em>C.

In this regard, we can only assume that the General Assembly has either failed to grasp the import of our holdings in <em>Brady </em>or that the General Assembly has simply elected to willfully disregard that decision. In any event, we will state again our holdings in <em>Brady </em>and hopefully put to rest any confusion that seems to exist with the General Assembly in this area.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 304, 707 N.E.2d 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">{\u00b6 80} Having thus restated <em>Brady\u2019s </em>\u201choldings\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> regarding Sections 34 and 35 and similarly deciding that the statute at issue violated those provisions, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>in <em>Johnson </em>next declared that \u201cthe constitutional impediments at issue in <em>Brady, </em>concerning former R.C. 4121.80, also apply with equal force to R.C. 2745.01,\u201d in that both statutes were enacted to provide immunity from suits by employees based on \u201cintentional tortious conduct of employers in the workplace.\u201d Id. at 305, 707 N.E.2d 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">{\u00b6 81} The court in <em>Johnson </em>then went on to detail some of the specifics of former R.C. 2745.01 that it viewed as objectionable. For example, former R.C. 2745.01(A) limited an employer\u2019s liability for an \u201cemployment intentional tort,\u201d as defined by former R.C. 2745.01(D)(1) to \u201c \u2018an act committed by an employer in which the employer <em>deliberately and intentionally </em>injures, causes an occupational disease of, or causes the death of an employee.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 306, 707 N.E.2d 1107, quoting former R.C. 2745.01(D)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">{\u00b6 82} In addition, the court in <em>Johnson </em>expressed disapproval of other provisions of the statute, including former R.C. 2745.01(B)\u2019s requirement that an intentional tort must be demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence, (C)(l)\u2019s application of a clear-and-convincing-evidence standard to withstand an employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment, (C)(2)\u2019s requirement that every court filing be signed by an attorney or by a party, and (C)(2)\u2019s additional requirement that the court impose sanctions for noncompliance. Id., 85 Ohio St.3d at 306, 707 N.E.2d 1107. The court stated that \u201c[b]y establishing the foregoing standards in R.C. 2745.01, the General Assembly has created a cause of action that is simply illusory,\u201d id., and held former R.C. 2745.01 unconstitutional in its entirety. Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b6 83} Three members of this court dissented in <em>Johnson. </em>Justice Cook\u2019s dissenting opinion, joined by two other justices, noted that there are two types of employer intentional torts. Citing <em>Harasyn v. Normandy Metals, Inc. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 173, 175, 551 N.E.2d 962, this dissent observed that \u201cdirect intent\u201d torts are those in which the actor\u2019s action brings about the exact result desired, while \u201cinferred intent\u201d torts are those in which the actor believes his action is \u201csubstantially certain\u201d to cause a particular result, even if the actor does not desire to bring that result about. Id., 85 Ohio St.3d at 309-310, 707 N.E.2d 1107. \u201cBy enacting R.C. 2745.01, the General Assembly sought to statutorily narrow that common-law definition to \u2018direct intent\u2019 torts only.\u201d Id. at 310, 707 N.E.2d 1107 (Cook, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">{\u00b6 84} Justice Cook wrote that Sections 34 and 35 of Article II are both solely grants of authority and cannot be read as Kmiting the General Assembly\u2019s power to enact legislation in the area of employer intentional torts. Id. at 310-311, 707 N.E.2d 1107. Furthermore, Justice Cook stated that \u201cSection 35, Article II cannot be <em>both </em>inapplicable to employer intentional torts and, at the same time, offended by any legislation regulating such torts. Yet those are exactly the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>contradictory conclusions reached by <em>Brady </em>and followed here.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 311-312, 707 N.E.2d 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">{\u00b6 85} Justice Lundberg Stratton\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>Johnson </em>characterized the majority\u2019s holding as striking down \u201ca constitutionally valid attempt by the General Assembly to restore balance between employees\u2019 and employers\u2019 rights in the context of workplace injuries.\u201d Id. at 314, 707 N.E.2d 1107 (Lundberg Stratton, J., dissenting). Justice Lundberg Stratton stated that only injuries caused by truly intentional acts should be recognized as the basis for an intentional-tort action, and that all other injuries should be compensable only through the workers\u2019 compensation system. Id. at 316, 707 N.E.2d 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">{\u00b6 86} Justice Lundberg Stratton also took issue with the majority\u2019s conclusion, based upon <em>Brady, </em>that former R.C. 2745.01 violated Section 34, Article II because it removed a right to a remedy: \u201cR.C. 2745.01, which requires \u2018deliberate intent\u2019 to cause injury, does not remove a right to a remedy; it merely restores the definition of intentional tort to its proper and original, bargained-for definition.\u201d Id. at 318, 707 N.E.2d 1107. She noted that remedies continued to be available to all injured workers after the enactment of the former statute. Id. at 318, 707 N.E.2d 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">{\u00b6 87} As to Section 35, Article II, Justice Lundberg Stratton stated, \u201cThe General Assembly had authority to enact R.C. 2745.01 under its general grant of legislative power [under Section 1, Article II of the Ohio Constitution] and did not need to rely on the specific grant of authority in Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. And, in fact, the General Assembly [in Section 3 of Am.H.B. No. 103] specifically stated that R.C. 2745.01 was to control actions <em>not </em>governed by Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 319, 707 N.E.2d 1107. Justice Lundberg Stratton reasoned that because the General Assembly through its police power has the authority to modify or abolish common-law actions and defenses and to codify the common law, former R.C. 2745.01 was a valid exercise of the police power as \u201ca codification and modification of employer intentional tort case law.\u201d Id. at 320, 707 N.E.2d 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\n<em>D. Johnson and Stare Decisis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">{\u00b6 88} Metal &amp; Wire asserts that this court in <em>Johnson </em>misconstrued Sections 34 and 35 and that the decision is severely flawed. Metal &amp; Wire asserts that we should hold R.C. 2745.01 constitutional as not in violation of Sections 34 and 35 and overrule <em>Johnson, </em>consistent with the three-part test for overruling precedent established in <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201cA prior decision of the Supreme Court may be overruled where (1) the decision was wrongly decided at that time, or changes in circumstances no longer justify continued adherence to the decision, (2) the decision defies practical workability, and (3) abandoning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>precedent would not create an undue hardship for those who have relied upon it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">{\u00b6 89} Metal &amp; Wire does not specifically argue that <em>Brady </em>should be overruled. This position recognizes that <em>Brady </em>was a plurality decision with limited stare decisis value for the issues we review in this case. See <em>Hedrick v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Go. </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 42, 44, 22 OBR 63, 488 N.E.2d 840, overruled on other grounds by <em>Martin v. Midwestern Group Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 478, 639 N.E.2d 438 (when a plurality opinion yields a syllabus that received the votes of four justices, \u201cthe only law emanating from [that decision] is contained in the syllabus\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">{\u00b6 90} Metal &amp; Wire\u2019s principal arguments for overruling <em>Johnson </em>are that the doctrine of stare decisis should be applied with greater flexibility in cases of constitutional adjudication, which cannot be corrected by the legislature as can cases involving statutory interpretation. Metal &amp; Wire further argues that the pragmatic concerns of the second and third <em>Galatis </em>factors have less relevance in cases involving constitutional interpretation and should be applied with more flexibility in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">{\u00b6 91} We recognize a considerable degree of merit in Metal &amp; Wire\u2019s arguments concerning the <em>Galatis </em>test\u2019s application in constitutional adjudication, and we accept that there are serious internal flaws in the analysis of Section 34 and 35 set forth in <em>Johnson, </em>as we discuss below. However, because a different statute was at issue in <em>Johnson, </em>we constrain the interpretation of Section 34 and 35 to the specific context of that case, and we decline to overrule <em>Johnson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">\n<em>1. Johnson\u2019s Interpretations of Section 31 and 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">{\u00b6 92} Notwithstanding the clear text of Section 34, this court in <em>Johnson </em>interpreted Section 34 as placing substantive limits on the General Assembly\u2019s authority to enact employer intentional-tort legislation. However, <em>AAUP II, </em>87 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Ohio St.3d 55, 717 N.E.2d 286, and <em>Lima v. State, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 155, 2009-Ohio-2597, 909 N.E.2d 616, contradict <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>view that Section 34 limits the General Assembly\u2019s authority to enact legislation. Because <em>Lima v. State </em>and <em>AAUP II </em>are the more recent and controlling authorities regarding Section 34, they have effectively superseded the interpretation given to that section by <em>Johnson. </em>Consequently, the decision in <em>Johnson </em>has no stare decisis value on this issue. Because Section 34 is not a limitation on the General Assembly\u2019s authority, it necessarily follows that R.C. 2745.01 does not violate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">{\u00b6 93} Similarly, notwithstanding the clear text of Section 35, this court in <em>Johnson </em>in effect held that any legislative attempt to govern employer intentional torts is per se invalid under that section, asserting that this area of law \u201c \u2018is beyond the reach of constitutional empowerment.\u2019 \u201d Id., 85 Ohio St.3d at 308, 707 N.E.2d 1107, quoting <em>Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 634, 576 N.E.2d 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">{\u00b6 94} Such an interpretation of Section 35 cannot be reconciled with the plain language of the section or with the historical underpinnings of its enactment. Moreover, <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>interpretation is inconsistent with the later, and more accurate, view of Section 35 expounded in <em>Holeton, </em>92 Ohio St.3d 115, 748 N.E.2d 1111, and in <em>Bickers, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 351, 2007-Ohio-6751, 879 N.E.2d 201. Therefore <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>analysis of Section 35 can have no stare decisis value in our inquiry. Section 35 is simply irrelevant to the constitutionality of R.C. 2745.01. Because Section 35 is not a limitation on the General Assembly\u2019s authority to legislate in the area of employer intentional torts, it necessarily follows that R.C. 2745.01 does not violate Section 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">\n<em>2. Johnson\u2019s Reliance on Other Grounds</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">{\u00b6 95} In addition to relying on <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>interpretation of Sections 34 and 35 of Article II to assert that current R.C. 2745.01 is unconstitutional, Kaminski also raises additional aspects of <em>Johnson </em>touching upon other provisions of the Ohio Constitution. Kaminski specifically invokes the right-to-a-remedy and due-process provisions of Section 16, Article I, even though <em>Johnson </em>did not explicitly and independently rely on those provisions in striking down the statute reviewed in that case. Notably, the court of appeals in this case did not address the constitutionality of R.C. 2745.01 under Section 16, Article I.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">{\u00b6 96} The <em>Johnson </em>court\u2019s conclusion that former R.C. 2745.01 was unconstitutional obviously included additional grounds beyond just Section 34 and 35 concerns. The majority believed that former R.C. 2745.01 was unconstitutional because the burdens it imposed were simply too onerous. The statute made recovery for an employer intentional tort too difficult, in the majority\u2019s assessment, rendering the cause of action too \u201cillusory\u201d to be constitutionally valid. 85 Ohio St.3d at 306-308, 707 N.E.2d 1107. See also <em>Stetter, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 280, 2010-Ohio-1029, \u2014 N.E.2d-, at \u00b6 43-60, in which we specifically consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>constitutionality of current R.C. 2745.01 under the right-to-a-remedy and open-court provisions of Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">{\u00b6 97} The statute we review here differs considerably from the former version of R.C. 2745.01 at issue in <em>Johnson. </em>The General Assembly did not simply reenact the same statute that <em>Johnson </em>held unconstitutional. Because we review here a statute with provisions differing in key aspects from the statute struck down in <em>Johnson, </em>we need not overrule <em>Johnson </em>to limit its precedential value. See <em>Arbino, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, at \u00b6 24 (\u201cThe statutes before us * * * are sufficiently different from the previous enactments to avoid the blanket application of stare decisis and to warrant a fresh review of their individual merits\u201d); <em>Groch, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 192, 2008-Ohio-546, 883 N.E.2d 377, at \u00b6 147. This approach is consistent with <em>Arbino </em>and <em>Groch, </em>which did not overrule previous decisions in similar situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\n<em>E. Additional Considerations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">{\u00b6 98} Because the statute under consideration in this case constrains rather than abolishes an employee\u2019s cause of action for an employer intentional tort, we need not, and therefore do not, consider whether a statute abolishing the common-law tort would be constitutional. Nor do we need to revisit the holding in <em>Blankenship </em>that employer intentional torts are outside the scope of employment in order to evaluate the constitutionality of the instant statute. It is clear from our foregoing analysis herein that the General Assembly is not constitutionally proscribed from legislating in this area of law under Sections 34 and 35, Article II.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">{\u00b6 99} R.C. 2745.01 by no means places Ohio outside the national mainstream relative to employer intentional torts and the exclusivity of the workers\u2019 compensation remedy. Rather, R.C. 2745.01 appears to harmonize the law of this state with the law that governs a clear majority of jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">{\u00b6 100} \u201c[T]he common-law liability of the employer cannot, under the almost unanimous rule, be stretched to include accidental injuries caused by the gross, wanton, wilful, deliberate, intentional, reckless, culpable, or malicious negligence, breach of statute, or other misconduct of the employer short of a conscious and deliberate intent directed to the purpose of inflicting an injury.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Footnote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>omitted.) 6 Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (2008), Section 103.03. Furthermore, \u201cOhio is one of only eight states that have judicially adopted a \u2018substantial certainty\u2019 standard for employer intentional torts.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Talik, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 496, 2008-Ohio-937, 885 N.E.2d 204, \u00b6 32, citing 6 Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (2007) 103-10, Section 103.04[1].</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">{\u00b6 101} Reduced to its most basic level, our decision today is grounded in the recognition that Sections 34 and 35 actually mean what they say. Accordingly, for all the reasons set forth above, we hold that R.C. 2745.01 does not violate Section 34 or 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. To the extent that <em>Johnson </em>misconstrued those sections, we limit its reach to the particular statute that was at issue in that case. We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, which was solely based on <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>erroneous interpretations of Sections 34 and 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">{\u00b6 102} That is not the end of our inquiry, however. R.C. 2745.01 was enacted pursuant to the broad grant of legislative authority under Section 1, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. Although the statute does not violate Sections 34 or 35, it does not necessarily follow from that alone that the statute is constitutional, because it might contravene one or more other provisions of the Ohio Constitution. Having held that <em>Johnson </em>mandated the conclusion that R.C. 2745.01 violated Sections 34 and 35, the appellate court in this case declined to consider additional arguments challenging the statute\u2019s constitutionality. In <em>Stetter, </em>we analyze whether R.C. 2745.01 offends other constitutional provisions, and we determine that it does not. Accordingly, as did the trial court below in this case, we hold that R.C. 2745.01 is constitutional.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">\n<em>F. Application of R.C. 2745.01 to this Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">(\u00b6 103} Because R.C. 2745.01 is constitutional, the standards contained in the statute govern employer intentional-tort actions, and the statutory standards apply rather than the common-law standards of <em>Fyffe. </em>We must consider then whether the trial court properly granted summary judgment to Metal &amp; Wire based on R.C. 2745.01. Under Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment is appropriate when all relevant materials filed in the action reveal that \u201cthere is no genuine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The filed materials must be construed most strongly in the nonmoving party\u2019s favor, and \u201csummary judgment shall not be rendered\u201d unless those materials establish that \u201creasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made * * *.\u201d Id.; <em>Horton v. Harwick Chem. Corp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 679, 686-687, 653 N.E.2d 1196; <em>Sinnott v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., </em>116 Ohio St.3d 158, 2007-Ohio-5584, 876 N.E.2d 1217, \u00b6 29. Our consideration of whether summary judgment is appropriate is de novo. <em>Comer v. Risko, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 185, 2005-Ohio-4559, 833 N.E.2d 712, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">{\u00b6 104} Nothing in this case implicates R.C. 2745.01(C) or (D). Furthermore, construing all materials in a light most favorable to Kaminski, we find nothing in the record demonstrating that Kaminski can prove that her employer committed a tortious act with the intent to injure her or that the employer acted with deliberate intent to cause her to suffer an injury for purposes of R.C. 2745.01(A) and (B). The only conclusion that can be reached on this record under R.C. 2745.01 is that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. Consequently, there is no need to consider remanding this cause to the court of appeals for further consideration. Metal &amp; Wire is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law, and we reinstate the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">{\u00b6 105} In conclusion, for the reasons discussed above, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, and we hold R.C. 2745.01 constitutional on the grounds at issue in this case. We accordingly reinstate the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Metal &amp; Wire.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b471-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b471-10\">O\u2019Connor, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b471-11\">Lanzinger, J., concurs in part.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b471-12\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-10\">.

Like former R.C. 4121.80, R.C. 2745.01 was created to provide immunity for employers from civil liability for employee injuries, disease, or death caused by the intentional tortious conduct of employers in the workplace.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 305, 707 N.E.2d 1107.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">{\u00b6 114} D\u00e9j\u00e1 vu.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">{\u00b6 115} In <em>Johnson, </em>this court held that a statutory scheme that allows an employee to recover civil damages only if his or her employer acts deliberately and intentionally creates only an illusory cause of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\">{\u00b6 116} \u201cBy establishing the foregoing standards in R.C. 2745.01, the General Assembly has created a cause of action that is simply illusory. Under the definitional requirements contained in the statute, an employer\u2019s conduct, in order to create civil liability, must be both <em>deliberate </em>and <em>intentional. </em>Therefore, in order to prove an intentional tort in accordance with R.C. 2745.01(D)(1), the employee, or his or her survivors, must prove, at a minimum, that the actions of the employer amount to criminal assault.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Johnson, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 306, 707 N.E.2d 1107.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">{\u00b6 117} D\u00e9j\u00e1 vu.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">{\u00b6 118} In all pertinent regards, the statute this court addresses today is the same as the one it addressed in <em>Johnson. </em>Only the result in this case is different. As the majority decision points out in its discussion of the history of workplace intentional torts in Ohio, ever since this court recognized an employee\u2019s right to civil damages for injuries suffered due to his or her employer\u2019s intentional acts, the General Assembly has sought to squelch that right. This court\u2019s recognition of the availability of recovery for workplace intentional torts in <em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chems., Inc. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 608, 23 O.O.3d 504, 433 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>N.E.2d 572, and its holding that a specific intent to injure is not necessary to prove intentional misconduct in <em>Jones v. VIP Dev. Co. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 90, 15 OBR 246, 472 N.E.2d 1046, begat former R.C. 4121.80, which begat this court\u2019s response in <em>Brady, </em>which begat another attempt by the General Assembly to foreclose employer liability in former R.C. 2745.01, which begat this court\u2019s strong contrary response in <em>Johnson, </em>which begat the General Assembly\u2019s third legislative attempt to end liability for workplace intentional torts with R.C. 2745.01. In the midst of that tug of war, this court developed in <em>Fyffe v. Jeno\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 115, 570 N.E.2d 1108, a workable common-law test to determine the requisite intent to prove a workplace intentional tort, a test rooted in Section 8(A) of the Restatement of Law 2d, Torts. But today, the cycle ends, as the General Assembly has found a court that agrees with it: workers have no constitutionally protected right to seek redress for injuries suffered from their employer\u2019s intentional torts.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b474-7\">Jeffries, Kube, Forrest &amp; Monteleone Co., L.P.A., David A.

The common law does, necessarily, evolve and change. The common law, however, should not be ignored; its repudiation should at least be acknowledged.
