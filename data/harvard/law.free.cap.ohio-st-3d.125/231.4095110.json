Patricia Clancy currently serves as Hamilton County Clerk of Courts. Greg Hartmann held that office at the time this litigation commenced, and the caption of this ease was <em>Lambert v. Hartmann </em>in the trial court and court of appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b433-13\">. The late Chief Justice Thomas J. Moyer participated in the deliberations in, and the final resolution of, this case prior to his death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b427-16\">Cupp, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b427-17\">{\u00b6 1} In this appeal, we are asked to determine the appropriate R.C. Chapter 2744 political-subdivision-immunity analysis to apply to a lawsuit in which the named defendant holds an elected office within a political subdivision. We conclude that because the allegations contained in the complaint are directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>against the office of the political subdivision, the officeholder was sued in his official capacity rather than in his individual or personal capacity. We also conclude that the three-tiered political-subdivision-immunity analysis set forth in R.C. 2744.02, and not the employee-immunity provision of R.C. 2744.03(A)(6), is to be applied in such a circumstance. Because the appellate court concluded otherwise, we reverse its judgment and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">{\u00b6 2} A traffic-violation citation was issued in September 2003 to plaintiff-appellee, Cynthia Lambert. The ticket recorded Lambert\u2019s name, signature, home address, birth date, driver\u2019s license number, and social security number. After the officer filed the ticket with the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts\u2019 office, the ticket information was published on the county\u2019s website. Lambert alleges that because of a transcription error on the ticket, an incorrect driver\u2019s license number was posted on the website.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">{\u00b6 3} Lambert was notified in 2004 that suspicious credit activity was taking place in her name. Someone made approximately $20,000 in unauthorized charges using Lambert\u2019s personal information. The person was subsequently identified, arrested, and pleaded guilty to federal felony charges related to the theft of Lambert\u2019s identity. Lambert claims that it is evident that this person used the clerk of courts\u2019 website to get her information because the personal information used to make the unauthorized charges included Lambert\u2019s incorrect driver\u2019s license number as posted on the county\u2019s website.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">{\u00b64} From 1999 to 2004, as a matter of policy and practice, the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts\u2019 office published on its website every document filed with the office in its original and unredacted form, except for juvenile records and documents that were filed under seal. This practice continued despite warnings to the clerk of courts that publishing personal and private information on the website provided \u201cfertile ground for identity theft.\u201d Lambert asserts that when she requested that such personal information be removed from the clerk of courts\u2019 website, she was told that such action would require a vast amount of manpower and that the theft of her identity was not necessarily a result of information posted on the clerk of courts\u2019 website. In December 2004, pursuant to the adoption of a new local rule, the clerk of courts\u2019 website ceased offering unrestricted access to documents filed with the clerk of courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">{\u00b6 5} Also in December 2004, Lambert filed a complaint alleging various federal and state claims in a federal district court lawsuit against \u201cGreg Hartmann, in his official capacity as Clerk of Courts,\u201d and the \u201cHamilton County Board of County Commissioners.\u201d The district court dismissed the complaint, concluding that Lambert\u2019s federal claims were not entitled to relief under Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>1983, Title 42, U.S.Code. The district court also declined supplemental jurisdiction on the state claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">{\u00b6 6} After the federal court\u2019s disposition, Lambert filed a complaint in the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court alleging violation of Ohio\u2019s privacy act, invasion of privacy, unlawful publication of private facts, and public nuisance. Lambert filed her complaint against \u201cGreg Hartmann, Hamilton County, Ohio Clerk of Courts.\u201d The trial court dismissed Lambert\u2019s complaint pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6) and (C), without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">{\u00b6 7} Lambert appealed, and the appellate court reversed. As pertinent to this appeal, the court held that Lambert\u2019s claims were not barred by the Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act, R.C. Chapter 2744, under the provisions applicable to employees of political subdivisions. <em>Lambert v. Hartmann, </em>178 Ohio App.3d 403, 2008-Ohio-4905, 898 N.E.2d 67, \u00b6 2. The appellate court stated that \u201cif the trial court dismissed Lambert\u2019s claims because it believed that the clerk had immunity [under R.C. 2744.02], the trial court erred.\u201d Id., \u00b6 13. Thereafter, we accepted review under our discretionary jurisdiction. <em>Lambert v. Clancy, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 1524, 2009-Ohio-614, 901 N.E.2d 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b68} R.C. Chapter 2744 was enacted in 1985 and addresses when political subdivisions, their departments and agencies, and their employees are immune from liability for their actions. Determining whether a political subdivision is immune from liability under R.C. 2744.02, as this court has frequently stated, involves a three-tiered analysis. <em>Elston v. Howland Local Schools, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 314, 2007-Ohio-2070, 865 N.E.2d 845, \u00b6 10; <em>Greene Cty. Agricultural Soc. v. Liming </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 551, 556, 733 N.E.2d 1141. A general grant of immunity is provided within the first tier, which states that \u201ca political subdivision is not liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or omission of the political subdivision or an employee of the political subdivision in connection with a governmental or proprietary function.\u201d R.C. 2744.02(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 9} The second tier in the immunity analysis focuses on the five exceptions to this immunity, which are listed in R.C. 2744.02(B). <em>Elston, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 314, 2007-Ohio-2070, 865 N.E.2d 845, \u00b6 11. If any of the exceptions to immunity are applicable, thereby exposing the political subdivision to liability, the third tier of the analysis assesses whether any of the defenses to liability contained in R.C. 2744.03 apply to reinstate immunity. Id. at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">{\u00b6 10} Immunity is also extended to individual employees of political subdivisions. R.C. 2744.03(A)(6); <em>O\u2019Toole v. Denihan, 118 </em>Ohio St.3d 374, 2008-Ohio-2574, 889 N.E.2d 505, \u00b6 47; <em>Cramer v. Auglaize Acres, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 266, 2007-Ohio-1946, 865 N.E.2d 9, \u00b6 17; <em>Fabrey v. McDonald Village Police Dept. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 351, 356, 639 N.E.2d 31. For claims against individual employees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>the three-tiered analysis used to determine whether a political subdivision is immune is not used. <em>Cramer, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 266, 2007-Ohio-1946, 865 N.E.2d 9, \u00b6 17. Instead, R.C. 2744.03(A)(6) provides that an employee is personally immune from liability unless \u201c(a) [t]he employee\u2019s acts or omissions were manifestly outside the scope of the employee\u2019s employment or official responsibilities; (b) [t]he employee\u2019s acts or omissions were with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner; [or] (c) [c]ivil liability is expressly imposed upon the employee by a section of the Revised Code.\u201d For these purposes, allegations of negligence are insufficient to overcome the immunity granted to an employee of a political subdivision who acts within his or her official duties. <em>Fabrey, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 356, 639 N.E.2d 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">{\u00b6 11} Moreover, if the employee acted in good faith and not manifestly outside the scope of his or her employment or official responsibilities, the political subdivision has a duty to provide a defense for the employee if a civil action or proceeding against the employee for damages is commenced. R.C. 2744.07(A)(1); <em>Whaley v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 574, 576, 752 N.E.2d 267. The political subdivision has a further duty to indemnify and hold harmless an employee if a judgment is obtained against the employee for acts or omissions in connection with a governmental or proprietary function, provided the employee acted in good faith and within the scope of his or her employment or official responsibilities. R.C. 2744.07(A)(2); <em>Whaley, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 578, 752 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 12} As a starting point in this case, we are confronted with a question regarding the effect of the language used in the complaint Lambert filed in the common pleas court. Lambert asserts in briefs and at oral argument that she sued Hartmann in his capacity as an individual employee of Hamilton County. Hartmann, however, contends that Lambert\u2019s suit is in actuality directed against the office of the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts, an office of the political subdivision of Hamilton County. The determination whether Hartmann was sued individually or in his capacity as the elected officeholder of the political subdivision, i.e., in his official capacity, ultimately determines the appropriate R.C. Chapter 2744 immunity analysis to be applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">{\u00b6 13} It is not apparent to us whether the trial and appellate courts considered the status of the defendant as an officeholder of the political subdivision in the context of their immunity analyses. The trial court simply dismissed the complaint without opinion, apparently presuming that the complaint was against the clerk of courts\u2019 office and applying the political-subdivision-immunity analysis of R.C. 2744.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">{\u00b6 14} The appellate court, without any discussion, appears to have assumed that the complaint was brought against Hartmann individually, as an employee of the clerk of courts\u2019 office. That court summarily applied an R.C. 2744.03(A)(6) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>analysis to conclude that Lambert pleaded sufficient allegations that Hartmann acted recklessly, willfully, and purposefully in publishing Lambert\u2019s personal and private information on the county website to overcome a motion to dismiss on the basis of immunity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to the court, it applied the R.C. 2744.03(A)(6) analysis because \u201cthe immunity granted under [R.C. 2744.02] does not apply to elected officials or individual employees of a political subdivision.\u201d <em>Lambert, </em>178 Ohio App.3d 403, 2008-Ohio-4905, 898 N.E.2d 67, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 15} Notwithstanding the appellate court\u2019s conclusion, our review of the complaint leads us to conclude that Lambert asserted her claims against Hartmann in his official capacity as an officeholder of the political subdivision. The complaint filed in the federal court identifies the defendants as Greg Hartmann, in his official capacity as clerk of courts and the Hamilton County Board of County Commissioners. The complaint filed in the state court, however, names \u201cGreg Hartmann, Hamilton County, Ohio, Clerk of Courts\u201d as the only defendant. The complaint does not add the words \u201cpersonally,\u201d \u201cindividually,\u201d \u201can employee of the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts,\u201d or anything similar to denote that he is being sued in his individual capacity as a county employee as opposed to being sued in his official capacity as the clerk of courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">{\u00b6 16} Additionally, the allegations in the state-filed complaint pertain to the policies and practices of the clerk of courts\u2019 office and not to actions taken by Hartmann personally. For example, the complaint alleges that despite the known risks, \u201cthe Clerk of Court\u2019s Office recklessly, willfully and purposefully continued its practice of publishing personal information on the internet.\u201d In fact, some of the allegations pertain to policies and practices employed by the clerk of courts\u2019 office prior to the time Hartmann became the clerk of courts. Moreover, the allegations in the complaint filed in the state court mirror those in the complaint filed in the federal court, and the federal complaint was clearly against Hartmann in his official capacity. Thus, although Lambert\u2019s prayer for relief in the state complaint asks for relief solely from Hartmann and not any public body or office, we conclude that Lambert\u2019s complaint asserts claims against the office of the clerk of the Hamilton County clerk of courts, an elected position within a political subdivision held by Greg Hartmann at the time the complaint was filed. Thus, the complaint is one that asserts its claims against Greg Hartmann in his official capacity as the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Next we must determine whether the political-subdivision-immunity analysis or the employee-immunity provisions apply to lawsuits in which the named defendant holds an elected office within a political subdivision, such as the clerk of courts, and that officeholder is sued in his official capacity. We conclude that the three-tiered political-subdivision-immunity analysis set forth in R.C. 2744.02 applies and not the employee-immunity provisions of R.C. 2744.03(A)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">{\u00b6 18} This conclusion derives from several principles. One principle is that a county is a political subdivision, and the operation of a clerk of courts\u2019 office is a governmental function. See R.C. 2744.01(F) (the term \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d includes counties); R.C. 2744.01(C)(2) (a nonexclusive list of governmental functions).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">{\u00b6 19} A second principle is that many of the governmental functions listed in R.C. 2744.01(C) are performed by political subdivisions through departments, agencies, and offices. When the departments, agencies, and offices perform their assigned governmental functions, each is an integral part and instrumentality of the political subdivision. <em>Wilson v. Stark Cty. Dept. of Human Servs. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 450, 452-453, 639 N.E.2d 105. An office of a clerk of courts is such an office and an instrumentality of a county political subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">{\u00b6 20} By logical necessity, the immunity granted by statute to a political subdivision is also extended to the political subdivision\u2019s departments, agencies, and offices, which implement the duties of the political subdivision. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. See also <em>Rankin v. Cuyahoga Cty. Dept. of Children &amp; Family Servs., </em>118 Ohio St.3d 392, 2008-Ohio-2567, 889 N.E.2d 521, \u00b6 16. Thus, because a clerk of courts\u2019 office is an instrumentality of the county, through which the county\u2019s governmental functions are carried out, the clerk of courts\u2019 office, like the county itself, is cloaked with the immunity granted to the political subdivision under R.C. 2744.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">{\u00b6 21} As a natural extension of these principles, when allegations are made against the elected holder of an office of a political subdivision who is sued in an official capacity, the officeholder is also entitled to the grant of immunity contained in R.C. 2744.02. We recognize that officeholders are employees of political subdivisions and that immunity for the actions of employees or officers sued in their individual capacities is addressed in another section of the Revised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Code. See R.C. 2744.01(B) (the term \u201cemployee\u201d \u201cincludes any elected or appointed official of a political subdivision\u201d); R.C. 2744.03(A)(6) (detailing conditions when employees are personally immune from liability for actions taken). Here, however, the allegations contained in the complaint are ostensively directed against the office and against the named officeholder in the officeholder\u2019s official capacity. This is the equivalent of suing the political subdivision rather than the officeholder in an individual or personal capacity.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b433-11\">Law Office of Marc Mezibov, Marc D. Mezibov, and Stacy A. Hinners, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Agp\">Joseph T. Deters, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and Pamela J. Sears and Michael G. Florez, Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 22} For the reasons set forth herein, we hold that when the allegations contained in a complaint are directed against an office of a political subdivision, the officeholder named as a defendant is sued in his or her official capacity, rather than in his or her individual or personal capacity. Moreover, the political-subdivision-immunity analysis set forth in R.C. 2744.02 applies to lawsuits in which the named defendant holds an elected office within a political subdivision, and that officeholder is sued in his or her official capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 23} We reverse the judgment of the appellate court and remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings to consider the applicable immunity exceptions and defenses under R.C. 2744.02 and 2744.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b433-9\">Moyer, C.J.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b433-10\">Pfeifer, J., dissents and would dismiss the appeal as having been improvidently accepted.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b431-8\">. Noting that this matter was before it on a motion to dismiss, the appellate court did imply that the evidence outside the pleadings, which Hartmann asserted would persuasively rebut the allegations made by Lambert in her complaint, could be considered under a different procedural stance, i.e. summary judgment. <em>Lambert, </em>178 Ohio App.3d 403, 2008-Ohio-4905, 898 N.E.2d 67, \u00b6 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b431-9\">. In November 2008, Patricia Clancy was elected the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts. After Clancy took office, the Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney filed a notice of substitution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Clancy for Hartmann pursuant to Civ.R. 25(D)(1) (\u201cWhen a public officer is a party to an action in his official capacity and during its pendency * * * ceases to hold office, the action does not abate and his successor is automatically substituted as a party\u201d). Lambert did not object to that filing, but in her merit brief to this court, she asserts that substitution is clearly inappropriate. Lambert contends that Civ.R. 25(A) applies so that Hartmann, as an elected official, cannot \u201cescape all personal liability for his willful, wanton and/or reckless actions simply by leaving office.\u201d However, in accordance with our resolution of this case, Civ.R. 25(D), not Civ.R. 25(A), controls here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
