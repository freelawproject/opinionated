Theisler of Youngstown, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0062582, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1993. On October 27, 2005, we suspended respondent\u2019s license to practice for an interim period pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(5)(A)(4) upon receiving notice that he had been convicted of a felony. See <em>In re Theisler, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 1560, 2005-Ohio-5665, 836 N.E.2d 584. At that time, we ordered that the matter be referred to relator, Mahoning County Bar Association, for investigation and commencement of disciplinary proceedings. Id. Nearly a year later, this court found respondent in contempt of our 2005 order for failing to file an affidavit of compliance on or before November 28, 2005. <em>In re Theisler, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1483, 2006-Ohio-4877, 854 N.E.2d 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>{\u00b6 2} The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that as our final disposition in this case, we indefinitely suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice law without any credit for time served during the interim felony suspension. We accept the board\u2019s findings and conclusions that respondent violated ethical standards incumbent on Ohio lawyers. Therefore, we indefinitely suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice law in Ohio, granting no credit for time served under the interim suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">{\u00b6 3} In addition to having been a licensed attorney, respondent was a licensed chiropractor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After over 20 years of chiropractic practice in Youngstown, respondent became a licensed Ohio attorney in 1993. Five years later, respondent graduated from the Grace University School of Medicine in St. Kitts, but did not complete the United States Medical Licensing Examinations and therefore was never a licensed physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">{\u00b6 4} Respondent associated himself with two medical doctors doing business under the name Pain Management Associates. After initially consulting medical doctors at Pain Management, patients returning for follow-up appointments would see respondent, who wrote prescriptions for them on a doctor\u2019s presigned blank prescription form.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">{\u00b6 5} Ultimately, respondent was indicted by the grand jury on 118 counts relating to his activities at Pain Management Associates. The counts included engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, drug trafficking, illegal processing of drug documents, and practicing medicine or surgery without a certificate. A jury found respondent guilty on 98 counts, and respondent served three years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">{\u00b6 6} The Trumbull County Court of Appeals affirmed respondent\u2019s convictions and sentences. <em>State v. Theisler, </em>Trumbull App. No. 2005 T 0106, 2007-Ohio-213, 2007 WL 136102, \u00b6 127. This court declined jurisdiction. <em>State v. Theisler, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 1412, 2007-Ohio-2632, 867 N.E.2d 845. In addition, the Eleventh District Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of respondent\u2019s petition for postconviction relief. <em>State v. Theisler, </em>Trumbull App. No. 2009-T-0003, 2009-Ohio-6862, 2009 WL 5064290, \u00b6 33. Respondent\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus was also denied. Respondent served his three-year term of imprisonment, which ended in September 2008, after which he was placed on probation. That order remains in effect until September 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">{\u00b6 7} After respondent\u2019s 2005 felony license suspension, we ordered that the matter be referred to relator for investigation. Relator charged respondent in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>amended complaint with violating certain Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility, including DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(4) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) and 1-102(A)(6) (engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">{\u00b6 8} A three-member panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard testimony at a hearing and considered the parties\u2019 joint stipulations. Respondent testified that during his employment with Pain Management Associates as a \u201cmedical assistant,\u201d he ceased providing chiropractic services. He also testified that prior to accepting the job, he had reviewed R.C. Chapter 4730 regarding physician assistants and former Ohio Adm.Code 4731-4-04, which addressed physician-assistant prohibitions. From that research, he erroneously concluded that he could perform medical examinations, give injections, and undertake any other clinical work that the physician might delegate to him under supervision. Respondent testified that he performed follow-up exams only and that he was not engaged in the practice of medicine. At the hearing, respondent admitted that he had failed to earn a certificate as a \u201cmedical assistant,\u201d although that option had been open to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">{\u00b6 9} Based on the exhibits submitted and testimony at the hearing before it, the panel found by clear and convincing evidence that respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(4), in that respondent\u2019s felony convictions demonstrated conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, and 1 \u2014 102(A)(6), in that respondent\u2019s convictions adversely reflected on his fitness to practice law.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">(\u00b6 10} In addition, the panel issued findings of fact and conclusions of law and made a recommendation. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings and the recommendation that we indefinitely suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice law without any credit for time served during the interim felony suspension. Respondent objected to the board\u2019s recommended sanction, arguing that it was too harsh, punishes respondent disproportionately to others, and is not necessary to protect the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">{\u00b6 11} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the duties violated by the lawyer in question and sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. Before making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). See <em>Lake Cty. Bar Assn. v. Troy, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 51, 2009-Ohio-502, 901 N.E.2d 809, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>{\u00b6 12} We have identified respondent\u2019s breaches of his duties to his clients, the legal profession, and the judicial system. In respondent\u2019s case, the parties stipulated to and the board found two aggravating factors: respondent\u2019s misconduct involved a pattern of misconduct, BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c), and multiple offenses, 10(B)(1)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">{\u00b6 13} The parties stipulated to the following five mitigating factors: no prior disciplinary violations, BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), a lack of dishonest or selfish motive, 10(B)(2)(b), absence of harm to victims, and his aversion to committing further offenses. Furthermore, the parties stipulated that respondent had cooperated fully with relator and the panel during the investigation and disciplinary proceedings, BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(d), and that respondent has received and served criminal sanctions for his illegal activity, 10(B)(2)(f). However, the panel also noted its doubts about the stipulation that no dishonest motive was involved, and it further noted that no letters attesting to respondent\u2019s good character had been submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">{\u00b6 14} Relator recommended an indefinite suspension with no credit given for the interim suspension. Respondent proposed a two-year suspension with credit for the interim suspension, or in the event that the court imposes an indefinite suspension, that credit be given for time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">{\u00b6 15} The board, echoing the panel, noted that respondent showed remorse during the hearing and that he has already paid a debt to society by virtue of his incarceration and his continued probation. The board found that no medical patients were harmed, but it could not discount that respondent has 98 felony convictions. The board adopted the panel\u2019s recommendation that respondent\u2019s license to practice law be indefinitely suspended without credit for the interim felony suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">{\u00b6 16} In determining the appropriate sanction for professional misconduct, this court considers the duties violated, the actual or potential injury caused, the lawyer\u2019s mental state, existence of aggravated or mitigating circumstances, and sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Linnen, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 507, 2006-Ohio-5480, 857 N.E.2d 539, at \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">{\u00b6 17} As noted in the board\u2019s report, the applicable sanction for serious felony convictions has been either disbarment or indefinite suspension. The board recommends that we indefinitely suspend respondent\u2019s license with no credit for time served on his interim suspension. After reviewing relevant cases, outlined below, we accept this recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">{\u00b6 18} Regarding sanctions in similar cases, we find <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. LoDico, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 316, 2008-Ohio-2465, 888 N.E.2d 1097, to be instructive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>LoDico </em>involved an interim suspension based on the respondent\u2019s felony conviction of carrying a concealed weapon. This court imposed an indefinite suspension with no credit for the interim suspension, despite mitigating factors similar to those in this case. Specifically, <em>LoDico </em>involved stipulated facts, a cooperative respondent, and completion of a court-ordered sentence. LoDico did have a prior disciplinary violation for unprofessional conduct that had warranted an 18-month suspension with six months stayed on conditions. However, LoDico was convicted of only one fourth-degree felony, whereas respondent was convicted of 98 felonies, ranging from the first to fifth degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">{\u00b6 19} Moreover, in <em>Linnen, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 507, 2006-Ohio-5480, 857 N.E.2d 539, the attorney had been convicted of 53 misdemeanors: two first-degree-misdemeanor counts of sexual imposition, one first-degree-misdemeanor count of aggravated trespass, 11 third-degree-misdemeanor counts of sexual imposition, and 39 fourth-degree-misdemeanor counts of public indecency. Id. at \u00b6 5. Unlike respondent\u2019s, none of Linnen\u2019s crimes were felonies, and this court indefinitely suspended Linnen\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">{\u00b6 20} Respondent makes much of the fact that he did not believe at the time that what he was doing when working as a physician\u2019s assistant at Pain Management Associates was wrong, and he relies heavily on <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Margolis, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 165, 2007-Ohio-3607, 870 N.E.2d 1158. Margolis was convicted of two counts of conspiracy to restrain trade. Like respondent, Margolis was found to have violated DR 1-102(A)(4) and 1-102(A)(6). Id. at \u00b6 9. Margolis was suspended from the practice of law for two years. Id. at \u00b6 30. Unlike in this case, however, the board had recommended a two-year suspension. Id. at \u00b6 2. Also, Margolis submitted 92 letters commending him personally and professionally, whereas no letters attesting to respondent\u2019s good character were submitted to the board here. Moreover, the board noted, \u201cThe Panel has doubts about accepting the stipulation that there was no dishonest motive here.\u201d Furthermore, Margolis was convicted of two antitrust crimes as opposed to respondent\u2019s 98 crimes. Respondent\u2019s reliance on <em>Margolis, </em>as well as the other cases cited in his objections to the board\u2019s report and recommendation, is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">(\u00b6 21} Respondent\u2019s 98 felonies, including aggravated trafficking in drugs, illegal processing of drug documents, engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, and practicing medicine or surgery without a certificate, warrant an indefinite license suspension without credit for time served. We are compelled to agree with relator that \u201ca lawyer who (allegedly) researches an issue and, in reliance on that research, is convicted of 98 felonies, is as much of a threat to future potential clients as a lawyer who researches the law and knows his conduct is wrong but nevertheless commits the felonies.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b345-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Ronald E. Slipski and David Comstock Jr., for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AAd\">John B. Juhasz, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">{\u00b6 22} Accordingly, we accept the board\u2019s recommendation. Respondent is therefore indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio without credit for time served during the interim felony suspension imposed on October 27, 2005. Respondent is also required to complete his term of probation before applying for readmission to the practice of law in Ohio. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b345-6\">Moyer, C.J.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-11\">.
