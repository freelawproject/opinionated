Kealy of Cleveland, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0031331, has been admitted to the practice of law in Ohio since 1970. The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice law for 18 months, with six months stayed, based on its findings that he failed to carry out a contract of employment with Ben Davis and neglected several matters during the representation. Further, respondent failed to cooperate in relator\u2019s subsequent investigation and, in doing so, knowingly misrepresented certain facts. In addition, respondent improperly borrowed $20,000 from another client, John Krawulski, from whom he had obtained a power of attorney, and after Krawulski\u2019s death, he failed to disclose the loan in the inventory prepared while also serving as executor for Krawulski\u2019s estate. We accept the board\u2019s findings regarding this professional misconduct, but due to mitigating factors, we modify its recommended sanction to that recommended by the panel and impose an 18-month suspension with 12 months stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Cleveland Metropolitan Bar Association, charged respondent with violations of the Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility, the Rules of Professional Conduct,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) (requiring a lawyer to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation). A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard the case, found that respondent had committed professional misconduct, and recommended an 18-month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>suspension with 12 months stayed. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings but recommended an 18-month suspension with six months stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\n<em>Count I: The Davis Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">{\u00b6 3} On May 6, 2000, Ben Davis was cited for causing an automobile accident involving another driver. On May 2, 2002, the United Services Auto Association (\u201cUSAA\u201d), the other driver\u2019s insurance carrier, sued Davis on a subrogation claim, seeking to recover approximately $13,000 as a result of that accident. Respondent undertook Davis\u2019s representation and filed an answer and counterclaim. But the counterclaim alleged damages for injuries to Davis caused by the other driver, and respondent never joined the other driver as a party to that litigation. Additionally, he never responded to USAA\u2019s requests for admissions or to its motion to dismiss the counterclaim. And on January 16, 2003, respondent failed to appear for the final pretrial hearing. Thereafter, neither respondent nor Davis appeared for the scheduled trial on May 7, 2003, and as a result, the trial court entered a default judgment against Davis in the amount of $13,609.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">{\u00b6 4} The board found by clear and convincing evidence that in failing to properly represent his client, respondent had violated 1-102(A)(5) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), 6-101(A)(3) (neglecting an entrusted legal matter), DR 7-101(A)(2) (intentionally failing to carry out a contract of employment with a client), and 7-101(A)(3) (intentionally prejudicing or damaging a client). We accept the board\u2019s findings as to this representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">\n<em>Count II: Failure to Cooperate and Knowing Misrepresentation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">{\u00b6 5} In October 2007, an investigator for the Cleveland Metropolitan Bar Association interviewed respondent regarding the Davis matter. During that meeting, respondent told the investigator that he had never received notices of the pretrial or trial dates in the Davis ease when, in fact, he had received written notices from the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">{\u00b6 6} As a result of respondent\u2019s deception, the board found clear and convincing evidence that he had violated Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) and Prof.Cond.R. 8.1(a) (knowingly making a false statement of material fact in connection with a disciplinary matter) and 8.4(h) (engaging in conduct adversely reflecting on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law). We also accept these findings of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">\n<em>Count III: The Krawulski Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">{\u00b6 7} Respondent began representing John Krawulski in early 2002. In November 2003, Krawulski developed serious medical problems and signed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>general power of attorney authorizing respondent to act for him. Krawulski also executed a last will and testament naming respondent as executor of his estate. On or about August 23, 2004, respondent and his wife borrowed $20,000 from Krawulski, evidenced by a promissory note agreeing to repay the loan. Respondent signed the check from Krawulski\u2019s account to himself and his wife under the durable power of attorney. Krawulski died on January 10, 2005, and on February 4, 2005, respondent filed an application in the Cuyahoga County Probate Court to administer Krawulski\u2019s estate. In the application, however, respondent failed to disclose the $20,000 promissory note. On July 26, 2005, Krawulski\u2019s heirs filed a motion to remove respondent as the estate\u2019s executor. The next day, respondent filed an inventory and appraisal in connection with the estate and again failed to disclose the existence of the promissory note. Krawulski\u2019s heirs filed exceptions to the inventory and appraisal, and on September 1, 2005, respondent resigned as executor of the estate. The administrator of the Krawulski estate subsequently filed a complaint in probate court against respondent alleging breach of fiduciary duty and seeking an accounting. The new executor filed suit against respondent in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. Respondent and the estate ultimately settled both complaints for $45,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">{\u00b6 8} As a consequence of violating his fiduciary duties as attorney and executor of Krawulski\u2019s estate, the board found clear and convincing evidence that respondent had violated DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(4) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 1-102(A)(5), and 5-104(A) (entering into a business transaction with a client when the lawyer and client have differing interests). We accept these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">{\u00b6 9} Respondent does not object to the board\u2019s findings, but seeks a lesser sanction. Relator had initially recommended an 18-month suspension with 12 months stayed, but now seeks an 18-month suspension with six months stayed, in accord with the board\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">{\u00b6 10} Respondent has breached duties to his clients and to the public. In determining the appropriate sanction for attorney misconduct, \u201cwe consider the duties violated, the actual or potential injury caused, the attorney\u2019s mental state, the existence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and sanctions imposed in similar cases.\u201d <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Ake, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 266, 2006-Ohio-5704, 855 N.E.2d 1206, \u00b6 44. We weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors to decide whether circumstances warrant a more lenient or exacting disposition. See Section 10(B) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg\u201d). Because each disciplinary case involves unique <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>facts and circumstances, we are not limited to the factors specified in the rule and may take into account \u201call relevant factors\u201d in determining which sanction to impose. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\n<em>Aggravating and Mitigating Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 11} In recommending a sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct, the board weighed the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 12} Regarding aggravating factors, the board determined that respondent engaged in a pattern of misconduct and that he refused to completely acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct (although he admitted to engaging in the actions that form the basis of the misconduct). BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c) and (g). The board also found troubling the fact that he was not initially forthcoming in the investigation of his ethical infractions and that he caused actual harm to his clients. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(e) and (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">{\u00b6 13} Regarding mitigating factors, the board noted that respondent was 64 years old at the time of the hearing, had been admitted to the practice of law in 1970, and has not been subject to any prior discipline. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a). Additionally, the board noted that respondent has been active with the local legal aid society for 25 years and does a \u201cstaggering amount\u201d of pro bono work. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(e). It noted that respondent is also active in his community, with a long history of volunteer work for his church, local charities, and other organizations. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 14} We accept the board\u2019s findings as to the aggravating and mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">\n<em>Sanctions Imposed in Similar Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">{\u00b6 15} We have considered sanctions in cases similar to that of the respondent. In <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Larson, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 249, 2009-Ohio-6766, 921 N.E.2d 618, we imposed a two-year suspension with the last year stayed on conditions, where an attorney had engaged in misleading one client about the status of her driver\u2019s license suspension and other traffic citations, failed to perform his duties as counsel for that client and two others, failed to return unearned fees to all three of these clients, and failed to cooperate in two of the ensuing disciplinary investigations. Id. at \u00b6 2. As aggravating factors, we accepted the board\u2019s findings that the attorney had engaged in a pattern of misconduct and had caused all three clients harm, had failed to respond during relator\u2019s investigations until compelled by subpoena, and did not fully accept responsibility for his misconduct. Id. at \u00b6 41. As mitigating factors, we accepted the board\u2019s findings that the attorney had no prior disciplinary record, that he had a debilitating sleep disorder, and that he had received favorable character and competence assessments by three judges. Id. at \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>{\u00b6 16} In <em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Peters </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 348, 349, 721 N.E.2d 26, we suspended an attorney for 18 months with the final 12 months stayed on the condition that he submit to a monitoring program, based on neglect of an entrusted legal matter and commingling his client funds with his own. As mitigating factors, we accepted the board\u2019s findings that the attorney had not been previously disciplined by the court, had freely admitted his wrongdoing, and showed remorse for his misconduct. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>Akron Bar Assn. v. Holder, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 307, 2004-Ohio-2835, 810 N.E.2d 426, we suspended an attorney for two years, with 18 months stayed on the condition that the attorney engage in no further misconduct, based on the attorney\u2019s violations of 12 Disciplinary Rules, including DR 1-102(A)(4), and Gov.Bar R. V(4). As aggravating factors in the case, the board found that the attorney\u2019s client had been harmed by his misconduct and that he had acted entirely from selfish motives. Id. at \u00b6 33. As mitigating factors, the board found that the attorney had practiced law for 37 years and had never before been disciplined for professional misconduct, that his misconduct was directed against only one client, and that he cooperated appropriately with the disciplinary investigation. Id. at \u00b6 32. Although the Akron Bar Association sought the attorney\u2019s disbarment, we accepted the board\u2019s recommendation of a more lenient sanction, stating that the attorney\u2019s 37 discipline-free years of practice, in combination with the depth of remorse he expressed in the proceedings before the court, convinced us that he would not repeat his transgressions. (Holder did not live up to our expectations and was disbarred on December 27, 2006.)</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 18} In <em>Akron Bar Assn. v. Markovich, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 313, 2008-Ohio-862, 883 N.E.2d 1046, we suspended an attorney for one year with six months stayed, on conditions, for committing professional misconduct by, among other things, neglecting two clients\u2019 cases, helping a client violate a civil protection order, filing an unapproved dismissal entry, borrowing money from a client, and misusing his client trust account. Id. at \u00b6 2. The board found one aggravating factor in the case \u2014 that the attorney had committed multiple offenses. As mitigating factors, the board found that the attorney had no previous disciplinary record, had made restitution, and had submitted recommendations as to his good character and reputation apart from the underlying conduct. Id. In accepting the board\u2019s findings, which we stated weighed in favor of leniency, we also noted that the attorney had acknowledged the wrongfulness of his conduct and had expressed genuine remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">{\u00b6 19} Based on a review of the aggravating and mitigating factors in this case, we conclude that respondent\u2019s misconduct warrants a sanction more severe than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>that imposed in <em>Markovich </em>but less exacting than that imposed in <em>Larson. </em>While we recognize respondent\u2019s grievous misconduct, we note that he has worked in private practice for 39 years with no prior disciplinary record, has settled and paid all claims owed to his clients, thereby alleviating their loss, has provided extensive pro bono work with the Legal Aid Society for 25 years, and has volunteered for his church, charities, and other community organizations. This long history and other mitigating circumstances provide a basis to modify the board\u2019s recommended sanction to conform with what relator originally sought and what the panel recommended. Accordingly, respondent is suspended from the practice of law in the state of Ohio for 18 months, with 12 months stayed, on the condition that he commit no further misconduct. If respondent fails to comply with the terms of the stay, the stay will be lifted, and respondent will serve the full 18-month suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">{\u00b6 20} Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b439-7\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b439-8\">Moyer, C.J.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and O\u2019Connor and Cupp, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-12\">. Relator charged respondent with misconduct under applicable rules for acts occurring before and after February 1, 2007, the effective date of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which supersede the Code of Professional Responsibility. When both the former and current rules are cited for the same act, the allegation constitutes a single ethical violation. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Freeman, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 330. 2008-Ohio-3836, 894 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 1, fn. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b439-9\">Moyer, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A6_\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">{\u00b6 21} I respectfully dissent from the majority decision in regard to the sanction imposed on respondent. Respondent neglected a client matter, resulting in a default judgment being entered against the client. He improperly obtained a loan from another client who had hired respondent to execute a last will and testament, a will that named respondent as executor of the estate. Both of these charges are serious in their own right, but respondent\u2019s misconduct is compounded by the pattern of dishonesty and deceit he exhibited. Respondent attempted to deceive the investigator from the Cleveland Metropolitan Bar Association who interviewed respondent about the client matter he neglected. In the other matter, respondent did not disclose the loan he received from the client when he applied for authority to administer the client\u2019s estate and again failed to disclose the client\u2019s loan to him in the inventory and appraisal of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">{\u00b6 22} I conclude that due to the dishonesty displayed by the respondent, he should serve a more severe suspension than that imposed by the majority. The mitigating factors in this case do not warrant modifying the board\u2019s recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>mended sanction. I would therefore adopt the recommendation of the board and impose an 18-month suspension with six months stayed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b440-6\">R. Jeffrey Pollock and Erin K.
