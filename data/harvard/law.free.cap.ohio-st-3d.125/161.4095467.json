Res judicata bars Keith from filing a successive habeas corpus petition insofar as he raises claims that he either raised or could have raised in his previous petition. <em>Amstutz v.

Moreover, as the court of appeals held, Keith\u2019s initial sentence is not void and has not expired, and he has or had an adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>remedy by appeal to raise his claims that the trial court judges were improperly assigned to his criminal cases.
