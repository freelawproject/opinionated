An offender who occupies a \u201cposition of trust\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) and whose offense relates to that position is ineligible to be sentenced under R.C. 2929.13(B)(2)(b) and does not meet the requirements for intervention in lieu of conviction pursuant to R.C. 2951.041(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">{\u00b6 2} A person holding a \u201cposition of trust\u201d for the purpose of R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) is not limited to public officials and public servants. However, it also does not apply to all positions of trust held by private individuals. Rather, a private individual holds a position of trust only if he or she occupies a special relationship of trust and confidence equivalent to a fiduciary relationship. A nurse, by virtue of his or her employment in a hospital, does not occupy a fiduciary relationship with his or her employer. Therefore, a nurse who steals drugs from his or her employer-hospital does not hold a position of trust within the meaning of R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) and is not categorically ineligible for intervention in lieu of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">{\u00b6 3} On May 16, 2008, appellee, Sally Massien, was indicted on two counts of theft of drugs, in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1)(2), felonies of the fourth degree. The state alleged that Massien stole morphine in the course of her employment as a nurse at a hospital in the Summa Health System by signing the drugs out under a patient\u2019s identification number. Massien initially pleaded not guilty but subsequently moved for intervention in lieu of conviction (\u201cILC\u201d). The state opposed Massien\u2019s motion for ILC, arguing that as a nurse who stole drugs from the hospital in which she was employed, Massien occupied a \u201cposition of trust,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>could not be sentenced under R.C. 2929.13(B)(2)(b), and was ineligible for ILC pursuant to R.C. 2951.041(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">{\u00b6 4} In July 2008, the trial court held a hearing and determined that Massien was eligible for ILC. As required by the ILC statute, Massien retracted her initial plea and pleaded guilty to the charges. The court ordered Massien to one year of rehabilitation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 5} The state appealed the trial court\u2019s decision granting Massien ILC to the Ninth District Court of Appeals, which affirmed the trial court and held that Massien did not occupy a position of trust by virtue of her position as a nurse at the hospital from which she stole the drugs. <em>State v. Massien, </em>Summit App. No. 24369, 2009-Ohio-1521, 2009 WL 826410, \u00b6 17-19. The state moved the Ninth District to certify a conflict between its decision in this case and the Tenth District\u2019s decision in <em>State v. France, </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-1124, 2006-Ohio-1204, 2006 WL 648858. In <em>France, </em>the Tenth District held that a nurse entrusted with the care of and duty to dispense highly regulated substances indicted for theft of narcotics in the course of her employment at a hospital occupied a position of trust that related to the offense and was not eligible for ILC. Id. at \u00b6 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">{\u00b6 6} The Ninth District granted the state\u2019s motion and certified the following issue: \u201cWhether a nurse employed by a hospital who in the course of her employment steals drugs from the hospital holds a \u2018position of trust\u2019 under R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) thus making the nurse ineligible for intervention in lieu of conviction.\u201d On review of the order certifying a conflict, we determined that a conflict exists between the Ninth and Tenth Districts and accepted jurisdiction to resolve the conflict. 122 Ohio St.3d 1453, 2009-Ohio-3131, 908 N.E.2d 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">\n<em>Felony-Sentencing Considerations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">{\u00b6 7} In enacting the felony-sentencing guidelines, the General Assembly declared: \u201cThe overriding purposes of felony sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the offender and others and to punish the offender. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>achieve those purposes, the sentencing court shall consider the need for incapacitating the offender, deterring the offender and others from future crime, rehabilitating the offender, and making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or both.\u201d R.C. 2929.11(A). \u201cA sentence imposed for a felony shall be reasonably calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of felony sentencing set forth in division (A) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning to the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct and its impact upon the victim, and consistent with sentences imposed for similar crimes committed by similar offenders.\u201d R.C. 2929.11(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">{\u00b6 8} Consistent with the sentencing principles set forth in R.C. 2929.11, R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a) through (i) sets forth nine factors that a trial court must consider in sentencing an offender for fourth- and fifth-degree felonies. If a trial court does not make any of the findings in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a) through (i), then an offender is sentenced pursuant to R.C. 2929.13(B)(2)(b), and if the court considers it appropriate, community control is the default sentence (except for those offenses identified as mandatory-prison offenses). <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, \u00b6 68. \u201cR.C. 2929.13(B) creates a preference for (but not a presumption in favor of) community control (formerly probation) for lower-level felonies.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 43. However, if the trial court makes any of the findings set forth in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a) through (i), then an offender is sentenced under R.C. 2929.13(B)(2)(a). After considering the seriousness and recidivism factors set forth in R.C. 2929.12, if the court finds that a prison term is consistent with the principles and purposes of felony sentencing and that an offender is not amenable to community control, then the court shall impose a prison term upon the offender. Thus, although it does not preclude the imposition of community-control sanctions, a finding of any of the factors set forth in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a) through (i) weighs against the preference for community control and may justify incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">\n<em>Intervention in Lieu of Conviction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">{\u00b6 9} ILC is a statutory creation that allows a trial court to stay a criminal proceeding and order an offender to a period of rehabilitation if the court has reason to believe that drug or alcohol usage was a factor leading to the offense. R.C. 2951.041(A)(1). If, after a hearing, the trial court determines that an offender is eligible for ILC, then it shall accept the offender\u2019s guilty plea, place the offender under the general control and supervision of the appropriate probation or other qualified agency, and establish an intervention plan for the offender. R.C. 2951.041(C) and (D). The intervention plan shall last at least one year, during which the offender is ordered to abstain from alcohol and illegal drug use, to participate in treatment and recovery-support services, and to submit to regular random testing for drug and alcohol use. R.C. 2951.041(D). If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>the offender successfully completes the intervention plan, the trial court shall dismiss proceedings against the offender without an adjudication of guilt and may order the sealing of records related to the offense. R.C. 2951.041(E). If the offender fails to comply with any term or condition imposed as part of the intervention plan, the court shall enter a finding of guilt and impose the appropriate sanction. R.C. 2951.041(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cIn enacting R.C. 2951.041, the legislature made a determination that when chemical abuse is the cause or at least a precipitating factor in the commission of a crime, it may be more beneficial to the individual and the community as a whole to treat the cause rather than punish the crime.\u201d <em>State v. Shoaf </em>(2000), 140 Ohio App.3d 75, 77, 746 N.E.2d 674 (referring to a previous, but similar, version of R.C. 2951.041). R.C. 2951.041 is not limited to offenders charged with drug offenses. Rather, any offender charged with any qualifying offense may be eligible for ILC so long as the trial court has \u201creason to believe that drug or alcohol usage by the offender was a factor leading to the offender\u2019s criminal behavior.\u201d R.C. 2951.041(A)(1). ILC is not designed as punishment, but rather as an opportunity for first-time offenders to receive help for their dependence without the ramifications of a felony conviction. <em>State v. Ingram, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 84925, 2005-Ohio-1967, 2005 WL 977820, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 2951.041(B) lists the criteria that a criminal defendant must meet to be eligible for ILC. \u201cIf an offender satisfies all of the statutory eligibility requirements for intervention, the trial court has discretion to determine whether a particular offender is a good candidate for intervention.\u201d <em>State v. Geraci, </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-26, 2004-Ohio-6128, 2004 WL 2616660, \u00b6 5. Among other requirements, to be eligible for ILC, an offender must be \u201ccharged with a felony for which the court, upon conviction, would impose sentence under division (B)(2)(b) of section 2929.13 of the Revised Code or with a misdemeanor.\u201d R.C. 2951.041(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">\n<em>R.C. 2929.18(B)(1)(d)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">{\u00b6 12} One sentencing factor that a trial court must consider pursuant to R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) is whether \u201c[t]he offender held a public office or position of trust and the offense related to that office or position; the offender\u2019s position obliged the offender to prevent the offense or to bring those committing it to justice; or the offender\u2019s professional reputation or position facilitated the offense or was likely to influence the future conduct of others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">{\u00b6 13} The state argues that Massien, as a nurse employed at a hospital who had access to highly regulated drugs, held a \u201cposition of trust\u201d under R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d). The state further contends that as an offender who held a position of trust and whose offense related to that position, Massien cannot be sentenced under R.C. 2929.13(B)(2)(b) and is ineligible for ILC. Contrary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>state\u2019s argument, the court of appeals held that the legislature intended the phrase \u201cposition of trust\u201d to apply predominantly to an offender\u2019s public standing and, in limited circumstances, to private professionals traditionally thought to have a special relationship of trust between themselves and their victims. 2009-Ohio-1521, 2009 WL 826410, at \u00b6 16-17. The court of appeals concluded that because Massien was a private individual who, as a nurse, did not occupy a \u201cspecial relationship of trust\u201d with her hospital employer, she did not hold a \u201cposition of trust\u201d for the purpose of R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d). Id. at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\n<em>The Phrase \u201cPosition of Trust\u201d Is Ambiguous</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 2929.13 does not define \u201cposition of trust,\u201d nor is the phrase defined elsewhere in the Revised Code. Appellate courts\u2019 attempts to construe the phrase have resulted in conflicting interpretations. On one hand, a number of appellate courts have held that virtually any public or private individual whose offense relates to a breach of any trust occupies a \u201cposition of trust\u201d for the purpose of R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d). See, e.g., <em>State v. Johnson </em>(Dec. 8, 2000), Crawford App. Nos. 3-2000-15 and 3-2000-16, 2000 WL 1806505, at *7 (holding that a college student entrusted with school property who stole the property occupied a position of trust within the meaning of R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d)); <em>State v. Hall </em>(2000), 137 Ohio App.3d 666, 668, 739 N.E.2d 846 (10th Dist.) (holding that a parent who failed to pay child support held a position of trust with respect to the child); <em>State v. Painter </em>(Mar. 29, 2002), Ashtabula App. No. 2000-A-0093, 2002 WL 479834, at *4 (holding that the mother of minor children who failed to pay child support occupied a position of trust); <em>State v. Bolin </em>(Jan. 12, 1998), Clermont App. No. CA97-06-056, 1998 WL 8683, at *2 (holding that a delivery driver entrusted with others\u2019 property occupied a position of trust).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">{\u00b6 15} On the other hand, in <em>State v. Jones, </em>the Second District held that R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) applies only to public officials and public servants and does not apply to private individuals. <em>State v. Jones </em>(Nov. 13, 1998), Greene App. No. 98CA009, 1998 WL 864761, at *2. In <em>State v. Hall, </em>Montgomery App. No. 22901, 2009-Ohio-6016, 2009 WL 3792359, the Second District applied <em>Jones, </em>holding that a nurse employed at a hospital was a private individual, could not hold a \u201cposition of trust\u201d under R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d), and was not categorically ineligible for ILC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">{\u00b6 16} The First District adopted a third approach, noting that \u201cunrestrained application of the phrase to every breach of ethical, moral, or filial duty by a private individual may distort the purpose of the new sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>State v. Brewer </em>(Nov. 24, 2000), Hamilton App. No. C-000148, 2000 WL 1732335, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>at *2. Consistent with the purposes and principles of felony sentencing, the First District held that the phrase \u201cposition of trust\u201d under R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) applies only to private individuals in professions \u201ctraditionally thought to invoke a special relationship of trust \u2014 such as doctor, lawyer or accountant.\u201d <em>State v. Condon, </em>152 Ohio App.3d 629, 2003-Ohio-2335, 789 N.E.2d 696, \u00b6 104. In holding that the statutory phrase applies only to those private individuals who occupy a \u201cspecial relationship of trust,\u201d the First District adopted the standard used for determining whether a fiduciary relationship exists and equated a \u201cposition of trust\u201d under R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) to a fiduciary relationship. See, e.g., <em>In re Termination of Pratt </em>(1974), 40 Ohio St.2d 107, 115, 69 O.O.2d 512, 321 N.E.2d 603 (defining a fiduciary relationship as one in which \u201cspecial confidence and trust is reposed in the integrity and fidelity of another and there is a resulting position of superiority or influence, acquired by virtue of this special trust\u201d). The Seventh District adopted a similar standard, holding that although the phrase does not apply to \u201cgarden-variety theft\u201d offenses, a family friend and personal secretary who embezzled from her boss occupied a position of trust because of her \u201cspecial position with respect to the victim.\u201d <em>State v. Boland </em>(2002), 147 Ohio App.3d 151, 160, 768 N.E.2d 1250 (analogizing R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) with the federal sentencing guidelines\u2019 commentary relating to positions of \u201cpublic or private trust\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">{\u00b6 17} In this case, the Ninth District essentially adopted the First District\u2019s limited interpretation of R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d), treating the phrase \u201cposition of trust\u201d as meaning a fiduciary relationship and holding that the phrase applies only to public officials and private professionals whose positions are \u201c \u2018traditionally thought to invoke a special relationship of trust\u2019 between the professional-offender and the victim.\u201d 2009-Ohio-1521, 2009 WL 826410, \u00b6 16, quoting <em>Condon, </em>152 Ohio App.3d 629, 2003-Ohio-2335, 789 N.E.2d 696, \u00b6 104.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cWhen a statute is subject to varying interpretations, it is ambiguous and we must construe it in a manner that carries out the intent of the General Assembly.\u201d <em>Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 Internatl. Assn., Local Union No. 33 v. Gene\u2019s Refrigeration, Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc., </em>122 Ohio St.3d 248, 2009-Ohio-2747, 910 N.E.2d 444, \u00b6 29. In construing an ambiguous statute, among other considerations, we look to the language of the statute, the circumstances under which the statute was enacted, and the consequences of a particular construction. Id. Having considered the language of R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) as a whole, the overarching felony-sentencing purposes and principles, and the conflicting analy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>ses employed by the district courts, for the reasons set forth below, we believe that the First District\u2019s interpretation equating a position of trust to a fiduciary relationship is consistent with the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\n<em>A \u201cPosition of Trust\u201d Under R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) Is Not Limited to Public Officials</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) requires trial courts to consider whether \u201c[t]he offender held a public office <em>or </em>position of trust.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statutory language does not illustrate a legislative intent to limit application of the section exclusively to public officials or public servants. Rather, \u201cthe legislature\u2019s use of the word \u2018or\u2019 instead of \u2018and\u2019 in the context of this provision suggests that the provision was intended to apply to both public and private individuals.\u201d <em>Boland, </em>147 Ohio App.3d at 158, 768 N.E.2d 1250. If the legislature intended the phrase \u201cposition of trust\u201d to apply only to public officials or public servants, it would have specified as much in the statutory language. Indeed, the General Assembly did precisely that in the preceding statutory section, R.C. 2929.12(B)(3), identifying as one of the seriousness factors that trial courts must consider whether the offender \u201cheld a public office or <em>position of trust in the community\u201d </em>and the offense related to that office or position. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">{\u00b6 20} By including the phrase \u201cposition of trust in the community,\u201d the legislature reveals its intent that R.C. 2929.12(B)(3) apply only to public officials and other community leaders. <em>State v. Radcliff </em>(Mar. 17, 1998), Franklin App. Nos. 97APA08-1054 and 97APA08-1056, 1998 WL 120304, at *4. Accord <em>State v. Lamb, </em>Wood App. No. WD-03-054, 2004-Ohio-1974, 2004 WL 835977, \u00b6 21 (holding that R.C. 2929.12(B)(3) \u201crefers to a position of trust in the community, not the household\u201d). In contrast to its express limitation of R.C. 2929.12(B)(3), the legislature did not include any language in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) to signal an intent to limit application of the phrase \u201cposition of trust\u201d to public officials and public servants.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">\n<em>The Phrase \u201cPosition of Trust\u201d Applies to Private Individuals Who Occupy Fiduciary Relationships</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">{\u00b6 21} By including the phrase \u201cposition of trust\u201d in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) without limitation, the General Assembly evidenced its intent not to limit its application to public officials. However, we do not believe that the legislature intended the phrase to apply to all individuals who breach any private expectation of trust. An unrestrained application of the phrase \u201cposition of trust\u201d to \u201cevery breach of ethical, moral, or filial duty by a private individual\u201d is not consistent with the sentencing principles set forth by the General Assembly, <em>State v. Brewer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>(Nov. 24, 2000), Hamilton App. No. C-000148, 2000 WL 1732335, at *2, or with the language of R.C. 2929.13(B)(1) as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">{\u00b6 22} The language of R.C. 2929.13(B)(1) as a whole illustrates that the General Assembly intended a narrow application of the phrase \u201cposition of trust.\u201d The section sets forth nine sentencing factors that a trial court must consider in sentencing an offender for a fourth- or fifth-degree felony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(a) In committing the offense, the offender caused physical harm to a person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(b) In committing the offense, the offender attempted to cause or made an actual threat of physical harm to a person with a deadly weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(c) In committing the offense, the offender attempted to cause or made an actual threat of physical harm to a person, and the offender previously was convicted of an offense that caused physical harm to a person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(d) The offender held a public office or position of trust and the offense related to that office or position; the offender\u2019s position obliged the offender to prevent the offense or to bring those committing it to justice; or the offender\u2019s professional reputation or position facilitated the offense or was likely to influence the future conduct of others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c(e) The offender committed the offense for hire or as part of an organized criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-11\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(f) The offense is a sex offense that is a fourth or fifth degree felony violation of [certain enumerated statutes].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-12\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(g) The offender at the time of the offense was serving, or the offender previously had served, a prison term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-13\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(h) The offender committed the offense while under a community control sanction, while on probation, or while released from custody on a bond or personal recognizance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-14\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(i) The offender committed the offense while in possession of a firearm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-15\">{\u00b6 32} Each sentencing factor crafted by the legislature applies to a narrow aggravating circumstance that may justify the imposition of a prison sentence rather than the preferred community control for fourth- and fifth-degree felonies. Each sentencing factor involves a specific, well-defined circumstance. In the same vein, R.C. 2929.12(B)(1)(d) identifies three distinct factors: (1) that the offender held a public office or position of trust and the offense related to that office or position, (2) that the offender\u2019s position obliged the offender to prevent the offense or to bring those committing it to justice, or (3) that the offender\u2019s professional reputation or position facilitated the offense or was likely to influence the future conduct of others. Like the other sentencing factors set forth in R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>2929.12(B)(1), each factor under R.C. 2929.12(B)(1)(d) applies only in a specific and limited circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">{\u00b6 33} Interpreting \u201cposition of trust\u201d so broadly as to eliminate the preference for community control and render an offender categorically ineligible for ILC based upon a finding that the offender, as a private individual, breached any moral, ethical, or filial duty is not consistent with the remaining sentencing factors in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1) or the specific findings in (B)(1)(d). Further, that interpretation is not consistent with the overarching sentencing principles, which require sentencing courts to consider the need for rehabilitating offenders. R.C. 2929.11(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">{\u00b6 34} Given the narrow application of the sentencing factors identified in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1) and (B)(1)(d), the presumption of community control for fourth- and fifth-degree felonies set forth in R.C. 2929.13(B)(2)(b), and the overarching felony-sentencing principles, we believe that the General Assembly intended a limited application of the phrase \u201cposition of trust\u201d in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d). Limiting the application of the section to private individuals who occupy a special relationship of trust and confidence equivalent to a fiduciary relationship and whose offense relates to that fiduciary relationship prevents the disqualification of persons who are not clearly meant to be excluded from ILC. Indeed, the state agrees and asks the court to apply this \u201cspecial relationship\u201d standard. Thus, we turn to whether Massien occupied a special relationship of trust and confidence equivalent to a fiduciary relationship as a result of her employment as a nurse.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\n<em>A Nurse Employed in a Hospital Is Not a Fiduciary of His or Her Employer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c \u2018A \u201cfiduciary relationship\u201d is one in which special confidence and trust is reposed in the integrity and fidelity of another and there is a resulting position of superiority or influence, acquired by virtue of this special trust.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stone v. Davis </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 74, 78, 20 O.O.3d 64, 419 N.E.2d 1094, quoting <em>In re Termination of Pratt, </em>40 Ohio St.2d at 115, 69 O.O.2d 512, 321 N.E.2d 603. \u201cA \u2018fiduciary\u2019 has been defined as \u2018 \u201ca person having a duty, created by his undertaking, to act <em>primarily for the benefit of another </em>in matters connected with his undertaking.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Strock v.

Rather, because the alleged \u201cposition of trust\u201d is born of Massien\u2019s employment with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>victim of the thefts, Summa Health System, to determine whether Massien occupied a \u201cposition of trust,\u201d we must determine whether she was a fiduciary of Summa Health System by virtue of her position as a nurse. Absent specific proof to the contrary, we hold that the relationship between a nurse employed by a hospital and the hospital in which he or she is employed is simply that of an employee and employer, not a fiduciary relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">{\u00b6 37} Although some employees may have fiduciary relationships with their employers, \u201c[n]ot all employees are fiduciaries.\u201d <em>Laurel Valley Oil Co. v. 76 Lubricants Co., </em>154 Ohio App.3d 512, 2003-Ohio-5163, 797 N.E.2d 1033, \u00b6 40.

Job duties that require a great degree of discretion support the existence of a fiduciary relationship, whereas assigned duties of a routine character do not involve the degree of discretion or trust necessary to be considered a fiduciary. Id. at 71-73, 521 N.E.2d 804. A further consideration involves whether the employee\u2019s responsibility includes \u201cdaily discretionary decisions\u201d affecting persons served by the employer that require the employee to be \u201cof higher than normal reliability.\u201d Id. at 73, 521 N.E.2d 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">{\u00b6 38} Nurses are persons of \u201csuperior knowledge and skill,\u201d who have a duty to their patients to employ the degree of care, skill, and diligence that a nurse of ordinary care should employ in like circumstances. <em>Berdyck v. Shinde </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 573, 613 N.E.2d 1014, at paragraph three of the syllabus. However, the duty of care imposed by law on a nurse toward his or her patients does not create a fiduciary relationship between the nurse and his or her employer-hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">{\u00b6 39} Further, a nurse\u2019s job duties are not sufficiently discretionary to transform the relationship with his or her employer-hospital into a fiduciary relationship. \u201cThe practice of medicine, which includes the diagnosis of an adverse health condition and the prescription of a course of treatment for its management and care, is limited by law to licensed physicians.\u201d Id. at 579, 613 N.E.2d 1014. \u201cBecause they are prohibited from practicing medicine, hospitals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>and nurses cannot pass on the efficacy of a course of treatment.\u201d Id. at 580, 613 N.E.2d 1014. Rather, nurses employed by hospitals assist physicians in their treatment of the patient and \u201c \u2018keep the attending physician informed of a patient\u2019s condition so as to permit the physician to make a proper diagnosis of and devise a plan of treatment for the patient.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 580, 613 N.E.2d 1014, quoting <em>Albain v. Flower Hosp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 251, 259, 553 N.E.2d 1038. \u201cThe law imposes on the physician the exclusive duty to diagnose the patient\u2019s adverse health condition and to prescribe a course of treatment for its management and care. Nurse practitioners employed by a hospital to which the patient is admitted by an attending physician are under a duty to support that process.\u201d Id. at 583, 613 N.E.2d 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">{\u00b6 40} A nurse occupies a necessary and important supportive role in caring for patients and administering medication. However, as is illustrated by the respective duties of nurses and physicians, discretion relating to the diagnosis and treatment of a patient is statutorily in the hands of the physician, not the nurse. A nurse employed by a hospital does not occupy a position of discretion and, therefore, does not occupy a fiduciary relationship. Because a nurse is not a fiduciary by virtue of his or her employment with a hospital, he or she does not occupy a \u201cposition of trust\u201d for the purpose of R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d). Therefore, a nurse who steals drugs from the hospital in which he or she is employed is not categorically ineligible for ILC by virtue of his or her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">{\u00b6 41} Although a \u201cposition of trust\u201d for the purpose of R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) is not limited to public officials and public servants, it does not include all positions of trust held by a private individual. Rather, a private individual holds a \u201cposition of trust\u201d if he or she occupies a special relationship of trust and confidence equivalent to a fiduciary relationship. Although a nurse employed by a hospital has a necessary and important supportive role in caring for patients and administering medication, discretionary duties regarding diagnosis and treatment of patients are statutorily in the hands of physicians, not nurses. Consequently, Massien does not occupy a fiduciary relationship with Summa Health System by virtue of her employment as a nurse, does not hold a \u201cposition of trust\u201d under R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d), and is not categorically ineligible for ILC.

In their briefs, both parties note that after this court recognized the certified conflict, but before the order was filed with the trial court, the trial court sealed Massien\u2019s record, finding that she had successfully completed ILC. However, even if Massien\u2019s completion of ILC renders the issue moot with regal'd to this case, the issue before the court involves a matter of great general interest, as is evidenced by the fact that the court accepted jurisdiction over the same issue in <em>State v.

It is the first category that is at issue in this case:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> offenders who \u201cheld a public office or position of trust and the offense related to that office or position.\u201d The statute uses the phrase \u201ca public office or position of trust,\u201d indicating that the \u201coffice\u201d and the \u201cposition of trust\u201d are both of a public nature. In this regard, the article \u201ca\u201d operates as a grammatical signal that both \u201coffice\u201d and \u201cposition of trust\u201d are parallel terms modified by \u201cpublic.\u201d If \u201cposition of trust\u201d had not been intended by the legislative drafters to be modified by \u201cpublic,\u201d the article \u201ca\u201d would have appeared not only before \u201cpublic\u201d but also before \u201cposition of trust.\u201d The construction of the statute makes sense because a public position of trust does not have to be an office to fall within the statute\u2019s ambit. Consequently, I do not believe that positions of trust held by private individuals that are not positions in the nature of a public trust are included within the first category listed in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d). Instead, situations involving a private position of trust, like the one in the present case, could well fall within the third category included in the statutory list, that \u201cthe offender\u2019s professional reputation or position facilitated the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">{\u00b6 48} I do not share the majority\u2019s view that reference to offenders who \u201cheld a public office or position of trust <em>in the community </em>\u201d in R.C. 2929.12(B)(3), a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>different statutory section, shows that the lack of the phrase \u201cin the community\u201d in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) implies a broader meaning of \u201cposition of trust\u201d in the latter statute. The phrase \u201cposition of trust\u201d appears in two separate statutory sections (R.C. 2929.12 and 2929.13). The wording of the two statutes, while similar, does not establish that R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) also applies to private fiduciary relationships as well as public positions of trust. To so hold is to afford R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) a much broader scope than R.C. 2929.12(B)(3).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b413-9\">Sherri Bevan Walsh, Summit County Prosecuting Attorney, and Richard S. Kasay, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A-_\">Brouse Law Office and Karen H. Brouse, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">{\u00b6 49} The majority acknowledges that R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) does not evince an intention by the General Assembly to sweep all positions of trust held by private individuals into the \u201cposition of trust\u201d category in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d). However, the majority then puts its own limitation on the category of \u201cpositions of trust\u201d held by private individuals. The majority holds that only those who hold a position akin to a fiduciary relationship are within the \u201cposition of trust\u201d category. But the majority\u2019s limitation is not expressed in the language of the statute and thus takes an unwarranted creative pen to the actual words used by the legislature. The more natural reading of the language of R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) is one, in my view, in which both \u201coffice\u201d and \u201cposition of trust\u201d are limited by the word \u201cpublic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">{\u00b6 50} When R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) is construed to apply only to public offices and public positions of trust, it is unnecessary to consider, as the majority does, whether a private individual holds a \u201cspecial relationship of trust and confidence equivalent to a fiduciary relationship.\u201d Whether or not Massien held a fiduciary relationship to her employer, the hospital, is not determinative of the question whether R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) covers Massien\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">{\u00b6 51} Because Massien did not hold a public office or position of trust, she is not within the first category of R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d) and thus was not statutorily ineligible for intervention in lieu of conviction on that basis. For this reason, I concur in the judgment affirming the decision of the court of appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b412-12\">. The third category in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(d), that \u201cthe offender\u2019s professional reputation or position facilitated the offense or was likely to influence the future conduct of others,\u201d would appear to be implicated by Massien\u2019s situation, but this is not the category of the statute upon which the state relies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
