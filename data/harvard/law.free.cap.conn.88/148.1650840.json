The accused had offered no evidence of his good character, and the attorney for the State took advantage of this line of enquiry to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>insinuate by suggestions that in the instances referred to the accused was under charges of the same nature, with respect to other boys, as the one for which he was then on trial. <em>Held </em>that under these circumstances the accused, who was convicted, was entitled to a new trial.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b161-6\">Counsel who manifest a wilful disregard for the rulings and suggestions of the trial judge, the rules of court, and the proprieties of the occasion, should be admonished, and upon a continuance of their misconduct should be summarily suspended or disbarred from practice pursuant to the rules of the Superior Court (Practice Book, 1908, p. 206, \u00a7 9).</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b161-7\">Argued January 20th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Auj\">decided March 19th, 1914.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-8\">Information for an indecent assault, brought to the Superior Court in Fairfield County and tried to the jury before <em>Greene, J.; </em>verdict and judgment of guilty, and appeal by the accused.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A27\">\n<em>Error and new trial ordered.</em>\n</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-9\"><em>Howard W.

Probably the defendant would not have been harmed by the questions, as they were answered in the negative, had the State\u2019s Attorney kept within the ruling, but he took advantage of it to indicate by his questions that in the instances mentioned the accused was under charges of the same general character as the one for which he was on trial. This misuse of the opportunity afforded by a ruling, which was itself too favorable to the State, entitles the defendant to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">In the other respects mentioned, the attorney for the State was also guilty of gross impropriety. The record shows on his part, and on the part of the attorney opposed to him, a wilful disregard for the rulings and suggestions of the trial judge throughout the trial, and a similar disregard for the rules of court and the proprieties of the occasion. As soon as it appeared that this misconduct was wilful and not inadvertent, the trial judge should have admonished counsel that a repetition of it would be followed by their suspension or displacement as attorneys. If the admonition was unheeded, such displacement or suspension should have been ordered.
