The complaint claimed a decree for a specific performance of the contract, and for $500 damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-6\">The defendant\u2019s answer admitted the execution of the contract, denied that the lot was as described in the complaint and that the plaintiff had performed his part of the contract, and denied that the defendant had not executed the conveyance as agreed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-7\">In a special defense the defendant pleaded that the lot described in the contract had a frontage of one hundred feet on Milford Point Road and fifty feet on Beach Avenue; that the plaintiff had paid the consideration of the contract but had refused to accept the deed of the same which the defendant had tendered him and was ready to redeliver to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-8\">The plaintiff replied, admitting the tender and his refusal to accept the deed, and denied the other allegations of the special defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-9\">The court rendered judgment for the plaintiff, finding all the allegations of the complaint true, and adjudging that the defendant execute and deliver to the plaintiff a warranty deed of said lot, one hundred feet on Milford Point Road and ninety feet on Beach Avenue, free from all incumbrances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-10\">The court made a finding of facts on the appeal as follows: Before the execution of Exhibit A, the plaintiff and defendant met on the premises and the defendant offered to sell to the plaintiff, and then pointed out, the lot described in the complaint, and the plaintiff agreed to purchase the same for $225 to be paid in instalments according to a written contract to be subsequently executed by the parties, and thereafter Ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>hibit A was executed and delivered pursuant to this agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-6\">About a month or six weeks after the defendant purchased the land at Walnut Beach, he prepared a rough sketch of it and subdivided it into nine thirty-foot lots fronting on Beach Avenue, and numbered from one to nine. No map of these lots, or of the defendant\u2019s land at Walnut Beach, or of lot No. 1, was ever on file in the Town Clerk\u2019s office in Milford, and no map or sketch was shown by the defendant to the plaintiff until he demanded the deed, when the defendant showed him said sketch of these premises containing lot No. 1 having a frpntage of thirty feet on Beach Avenue. When the plaintiff had fully paid for the lot he demanded a deed of the same, and the defendant tendered him a deed of a lot with a frontage of thirty feet on Beach Avenue, which the plaintiff refused to accept.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b562-7\"><em>James A. Peasley, </em>with whom was <em>Clayton L. Klein, </em>for the appellant (defendant).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b562-8\"><em>Michael J.

Her agency was fully established by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">The question asked of the .defendant by his counsel, \"How much did you pay for the whole tract?\u201d, should have been admitted for what it was worth, as relevant evidence of the fair market value of the tract of which lot No. 1 was a part. The ruling was not a material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>error, since better evidence of the market value of this tract and of lot No. 1 was easily available, and evidently was before the court, as it has found, from the evidence of defendant\u2019s witnesses, the fair market value of a lot thirty feet on Beach Avenue and one hundred feet on Milford Point Road to be between $200 and $250.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Complaint is made of the exclusion of the question asked the defendant on his direct examination, \u201cHave you sold the other lots? \u201d The other lots referred to the tract of which lot No. 1, as claimed by the defendant, was a part. The question was claimed for the purpose of showing the good faith of the defendant. He now claims the evidence was admissible because the answer might have shown that the sale of the land made it impossible to decree specific performance of a contract to sell a lot with a frontage on Beach Avenue of ninety feet. No such claim was made on the trial, and it is now too late to make it.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Error is assigned that the court has found, without evidence, the average depth and width of lot No. 1, and that the legal title to it was at the time of the trial in the defendant. These were legitimate inferences from the facts in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Upon the trial the defendant claimed that the facts did not warrant a judgment decreeing specific performance of Exhibit A, but that the judgment should be for the defendant. The foundation of both claims was that the land was so indefinitely described in the contract as to make it unenforceable in equity. The description of the land conveyed in Exhibit A was, \u201cLot No. 1 on map of lots at Walnut Beach and filed at the Town Clerk\u2019s office at Milford, Connecticut.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Reasonable certainty in the description is an indispensable prerequisite for the enforcement by way of specific performance of a contract to convey land. <em>Hurd </em>v. <em>Hotchkiss, </em>72 Conn. 472, 480, 45 Atl. 11. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>the element of certainty is a rule of equity equally applicable, whether the contract be verbal or written. Waterman on Specific Performance (Ed. 1881) \u00a7254. The description is sufficiently definite whenever it is reasonably certain from the contract itself, or can be made certain through reference to record, contract, map or fact, by resort to extraneous evidence thereof, whether oral or written. <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>Kowing, </em>58 Conn. 12, 18 Atl. 979; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>10 Conn. 192; <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>98 Mass. 545; <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>163 Cal. 742, 127 Pac. 71; <em>Romans </em>v. <em>Langevin, </em>34 Minn. 312, 25 N. W. 638; <em>Troup </em>v. <em>Troup, </em>87 Pa. St. 149; <em>Colerick </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>3 Ind. 316; 2 Beach on Equity Jurisprudence, \u00a7 583; 36 Cyc. 593. Evidence would therefore have been admissible to prove the contents of the map referred to in Exhibit A, and thus, by reference to the map, lot No. 1 might have been identified and the description of the lot made certain. But no such map was on file, nor did any map or sketch of lot No. 1 exist at or before the execution of Exhibit A. Acts done in part performance might have taken the case out of the statute of frauds, if these had been done in pursuance of the contract and had changed the situation of the parties to the contract, as, for example, actual possession taken of, or valuable improvements made upon, the land purchased, or both combined. 4 Pomeroy on Equity Jurisprudence (3d Ed.) \u00a7 1409; <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Talcott, </em>60 Conn. 43, 52, 22 Atl. 484; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>71 W. Va. 364, 76 S. E. 804. Acts such as these would, in themselves, have made the description certain and cured its indefiniteness. <em>Keepers </em>v. <em>Yocum, </em>84 Kan. 554, 557, 114 Pac. 1063; <em>Ottumwa, C. F. &amp; St. P. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>McWilliams, </em>70 Iowa, 164, 168, 32 N. W. 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The record does not disclose any acts amounting to part performance; possession was not taken, nor im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>provements made by the purchaser. Payment, even of the full consideration, as in this case, does not amount to an act of part performance taking the case out of the statute of frauds. <em>Lester </em>v. <em>Kinne, </em>37 Conn. 9, 14; <em>Kimberly </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>27 Conn. 307; 36 Cyc. 650. In Delaware and Maine, and perhaps in a few other States, the rule is different; elsewhere it accords with our rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">As the description of lot No. 1 in this complaint was, upon its face, capable of being made definite had the map referred to been on file and had there been delineated upon it this lot, the complaint was not demurrable. The defendant was ready to deed the plaintiff a lot having a frontage of thirty feet on Beach Avenue; the plaintiff claimed the lot was to have a frontage of ninety feet. In the effort to support his claim, the plaintiff offered evidence, as he was entitled to, of all the facts leading up to the sale, including the fact that the defendant had pointed out to him, on the ground, the bounds of lot No. 1 as having a frontage of ninety feet on Beach Avenue. The evidence was not offered in order to make the description of the land in the contract certain, nor has the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, either in brief or argument, made any such claim. What the parties did preceding the execution of the contract does not tend to identify lot No. 1 nor to apply the description. For such purpose oral evidence to avoid the bar of the statute of frauds would have been inadmissible. All authorities so hold. The description might have been made certain had the plaintiff been able to prove that the defendant had only one lot at Walnut Beach. <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>Kowing, </em>58 Conn. 12, 18 Atl. 979; <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>98 Mass. 545; <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>115 Mass. 413, 415; <em>Slater </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>117 Mass. 96, 98; <em>Troup </em>v. <em>Troup, </em>87 Pa. St. 149; <em>Keepers </em>v. <em>Yocum, </em>84 Kan. 554, 557, 558, 114 Pac. 1063; <em>Colerick </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>3 Ind. 316. The note to <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>26 Amer. Dec. 665, 666 (16 Pick. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>227, 33 Mass.), contains numerous instances where courts have permitted indefinite descriptions to be made definite by extraneous evidence. Lot No. 1 was not the only lot the defendant owned at Walnut Beach; he owned a tract having a frontage of two hundred and seventy feet on Beach Avenue. When the reference to the map is eliminated from Exhibit A, the entire description is, \u201cLot No. 1 ... at Walnut Beach.\u201d A description of that character, where it does not appear that the seller owned only one lot in this location, is fatally indefinite. We cite a few of the many instances in the decisions of descriptions too indefinite to support specific performance. \u201cOur land of 1060 acres,\u201d so described in a contract dated \u201cWilkins Ranch, September 22nd, 1909.\u201d <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>163 Cal. 742, 127 Pac. 71. \u201cPart of lot No. 200 in the sixth district and second section of said county, containing fifteen acres more or less.\u201d <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Newberry, </em>138 Ga. 735, 76 S. E. 63. \u201cIn DeKalb county, being part of lot No. 150 and lot 159, containing 160 acres more or less.\u201d <em>Estes </em>v. <em>Winn, </em>136 Ga. 344, 71 S. E. 470. \u201cOne hundred (100) acres of . . . land ... in Fayette county, Illinois,\u201d where there were 600 acres owned by the person referred to. <em>Wetmore </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>253 Ill. 88, 97 N. E. 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The defendant was entitled to have had his claim, that upon the facts specific performance could not be decreed, sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">There is error and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
