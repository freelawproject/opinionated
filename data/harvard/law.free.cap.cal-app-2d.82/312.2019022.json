J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAn\">Helen Ball, suing individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, appeals from a summary judgment entered in favor of the County of Los Angeles (hereafter County) on her complaint alleging that she is entitled to recover interest on property taxes voluntarily refunded to her by the County. The refund was paid by the County upon receipt and verification of information that certain property owned by Ball and upon which she had paid tax was exempt from taxation. The appeal lies. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 437c, 904.1, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The question presented by this appeal is whether a taxpayer is entitled to recover interest on tax payments erroneously collected by the County on exempt property when the County promptly refunds the erroneous payments upon being put on notice of its error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We will answer this question in the negative. A taxpayer has no right to recover interest from the County unless interest is provided for by statute and such is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Facts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">During the three-year period between 1971 and 1974 Ball owned real property which she leased to the City of Los Angeles as a library materials depository. Due to the nature of the property\u2019s use, Ball was entitled to exemption of it from property taxation. (Former Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 202, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, no application for exemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>from property taxes was filed with the County until April 10, 1974, and taxes were collected on the property in each of the three years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The County processed and verified Ball\u2019s exemption claim between April and July of 1974. The County did not dispute Ball\u2019s right to a refund and on August 12, 1974, a warrant was issued to Ball refunding to her taxes paid on the exempt property between 1971 and 1974. No interest was included in the refund payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">1. <em>County Is Liable for Interest Only Where Such Liability Is Created by Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">It is well established that there is no right to interest as payment for the use of money unless the right has been created by statute or by an express or implied contract. (45 Am.Jur.2d, Interest and Usury, \u00a7\u00a7 34-35, pp. 39-40; cf. Civ. Code, \u00a7 1428.) There is a split of authority, however,. on the question of governmental liability for interest on tax refunds. In some jurisdictions it is held that there is an implied contract between the state and the taxpayer that the state will be liable for interest for the period of time it has the use of the taxpayer\u2019s money. Therefore these jurisdictions have adopted the rule that a state or municipal corporation which must refund all or part of a tax which has been paid is liable for interest on the refund even in the absence of a statute which specifically authorizes payment of interest. (Annot., Right to Interest on Tax Refund or Credit in Absence of Specific Controlling Statute (1963) 88 A.L.R.2d 823, 825-827, \u00a7 2, and cases cited.) Other jurisdictions have rejected the implied contract theory and follow the rule that there is no liability for interest on a refund in the absence of a statute that specifically creates a liability for such interest. <em>(Idem., </em>88 A.L.R.2d 823, 835-840, \u00a7 5, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Several rationales have been advanced for the rule requiring specific statutory creation of governmental liability for interest on tax refunds. The rule has been said to be based upon the doctrine that requires the state\u2019s consent before the state becomes liable. <em>(Columbia Steel Co. </em>v. <em>State </em>(1949) 34 Wn.2d 700 [209 P.2d 482, 489]; cf. Sovereign Immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Study (Feb. 1963) 5 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1963) pp. 17-21.) It is suggested that the rule is supported by the theory that a contract for interest is implied only when there is either delay or default on the part of the debtor and such delay or default will not be attributed to the government since it is presumed that the government always stands ready to pay what it owes promptly. <em>(Monarch Mills </em>v. <em>South Carolina Tax Commission </em>(1929) 149 S.C. 219 [146 S.E. 870, 872]; cf. Evid. Code, \u00a7 664; <em>Tripp </em>v. <em>Swoop </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 671, 683 [131 Cal.Rptr. 789, 552 P.2d 749].) The rule has been said to rest upon the practical consideration that the tax collector has no money to pay interest in the absence of statutory authority to establish a fund for that purpose. <em>(Lakefront Realty Corporation </em>v. <em>Lorenz </em>(1960) 19 Ill.2d 415 [167 N.E.2d 236, 240-241].) Finally, several jurisdictions found the rule to be required by state constitutional provisions prohibiting payments from the state treasury in the absence of a legislative act or resolution. <em>(New England Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Reece </em>(1935) 169 Term. 84 [83 S.W.2d 238, 242]; <em>Kaemmerling </em>v. <em>State </em>(1924) 81 N.H. 405 [128 A. 6, 7]; see Cal. Const., art. XVI, \u00a7 7; <em>Richter </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 99, 105 [66 Cal.Rptr. 52].)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">California has adopted the rule which requires a specific statutory provision to create governmental liability for interest. \u201c[W]hatever the law may be elsewhere it has always been the rule in California that there is no implied contract of any kind that the state will pay interest on its indebtedness for it is liable only when made so by statute.\u201d <em>(Gregory </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 700, 703 [197 P.2d 728, 4 A.L.R.2d 924]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Union Oil Co. </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 476, 480 [310 P.2d 409]; <em>Jones-Hamilton Co. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 343, 350 [73 Cal.Rptr. 896].) Therefore the County<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is liable to Ball for interest for the use of her money only if there is a specific statute authorizing the payment of interest on her refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">2. <em>The Statutory Scheme Denies Interest on Ball\u2019s Refund</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Ball contends that accrued interest on her tax refund is authorized by Revenue and Taxation Code section 5107 and former section 5143.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree. We do not believe that these sections authorize the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>payment of interest by the County for the use of a taxpayer\u2019s money. For reasons set forth below, we believe that these sections are merely general definitional sections which make clear that interest collected from the taxpayer in connection with tax payments (i.e. upon delinquent payment of taxes) will be included in any refund of those taxes. Specific sections of the Revenue and Taxation Code govern the payment of interest on tax refunds and indicate a comprehensive plan that denies interest on erroneously collected taxes during the period within which the taxpayer has failed to put the County on notice of the erroneous levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">A cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is that code sections are not to be read in isolation but construed in context. <em>(Tripp </em>v. <em>Swoap, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 679; <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 244, 249 [127 Cal.Rptr. 532].)  Section 5107 and former section 5143 were once both part of the chapter of the Revenue and Taxation Code regarding refunds. Section 5107 remains a part of an article related to refunds generally. Section 5143 was part of the article regarding recovery of taxes paid under protest. These two sections have identical language. They both state that \u201cas used in this article, \u2018tax\u2019 or \u2018taxes\u2019 include penalties, interest, and costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Although both these sections define \u201ctax\u201d as including interest, when read in context, it becomes clear that they refer only to the return of funds collected from the taxpayer. Whenever the word \u201ctax\u201d is used throughout the articles it is modified by the words \u201cpaid,\u201d \u201ccollected,\u201d \u201crecovery,\u201d or \u201crefund.\u201d Each of these modifiers implies that the \u201ctax,\u201d defined to include penalties, interest, and costs, has already been collected from the taxpayer by the County. Thus, these sections define only the scope of tax refunds.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Such definition is necessary since tax refunds under section 5096 include both delinquent and nondelinquent taxes. The former may have interest, costs, and penalties added to the tax assessment itself. (See \u00a7 6591.)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Likewise, an examination of the articles of which these two sections were a part reveals the existence of various sections expressly providing for the payment of interest on tax refunds. (Former \u00a7\u00a7 5105, 5108, 5141;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ehrman &amp; Flavin, Taxing Cal. Property, \u00a7\u00a7 494, 495, 497, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>pp. 474, 477, 479; (1976 supp.) \u00a7 496b, pp. 308-309; Marshall, State and Local Taxation, \u00a7 128, subd. (c), p. 166; (1977 pocket pt.) \u00a7 128, subd. (i), pp. 113-114.) While these last mentioned sections do not apply to the cases at <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the existence of these specific sections negates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>conclusion that a taxpayer\u2019s entitlement to interest is provided for generally. Under the doctrine of \u201cthe expression of one excludes the other\u201d the failure of the Legislature to provide expressly for the payment of interest on certain refunds while expressly providing for such payment on other refunds indicates an intention to exclude from the omitted refunds the obligation of interest. <em>(Hill </em>v. <em>City of Eureka </em>(1939) 35 Cal.App.2d 154, 158 [94 P.2d 1025]; <em>County of Madera </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 665, 670 [114 Cal.Rptr. 283].)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">These sections also reveal a comprehensive legislative plan which authorizes recovery of interest on a tax refund only where the county, <em>with notice of an improper assessment, </em>has failed to grant a tax refund.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under these sections interest is denied on tax refunds unless and until the county receives notice of its error\u2014notice given by refund claim, application for equalization, or payment under protest. Interest does not begin to accrue under former section 5105 until \u201cthe date of the filing of the claim for refund.\u201d Interest accrues pursuant to former section 5108 from \u201cthe date of the payment of tax on property subject to an application for equalization of the assessed value\u201d and not even then if the property is reassessed within 30 days. Former section 5141 authorized payment of interest \u201cfrom the date of payment under protest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Ball is denied interest on her tax refund under such a plan because she received her refund shortly after she presented her application for exemption to the County\u2014shortly after the County had been given notice that these taxes had been erroneously collected from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">This plan is fair. The tax payments at issue were apparently collected by mutual mistake. Neither Ball nor the County seem to have been aware of the applicability of the exemption.  Even where money has been improperly paid by one <em>private party </em>to another under a mutual mistake, interest will not begin to accrue until the mistake is discovered and a demand for restitution made. (Rest., Restitution, \u00a7 156, com. a, p. 619; 45 Am.Jur.2d, Interest and Usury, \u00a7\u00a7 88, 90, pp. 79-81; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Pacific Bank </em>(1896) 112 Cal. 598, 603 [44 P. 1063]; <em>Bank of China </em>v. <em>Wells Fargo Bank &amp; Union Trust Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1953) 209 F.2d 467, 472.) Interest is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>recoverable until and unless an individual has notice of his duty to make restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">This rule applies with even greater force to funds erroneously held <em>by the government </em>due to the extent and nature of governmental activities. Indeed, where the government owes a <em>liquidated claim </em>upon a <em>definite date </em>that claim <em>does not draw interest until demanded </em>based \u201con the consideration that it would be inconvenient and burdensome for the officials of a municipality [or county] to seek its creditors and tender payment of their claims, and also that it would be oppressive and unjust to permit creditors of a municipality [or county] with good credit to turn claims into investments through omitting to present them and then collecting interest thereon.\u201d (56 Am.Jur.2d, Municipal Corporations, Counties, and other Political Subdivisions, \u00a7\u00a7 833, 842, pp. 823-824, 828; <em>South Yuba Water Co. </em>v. <em>Auburn </em>(1911) 16 Cal.App. 775, 780 [118 P. 101]; <em>Engebretson </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1921) 185 Cal. 475, 479 [197 P. 651].) Even in jurisdictions which have adopted the rule that the state has an implied contract to pay interest for the use of tax funds which are eventually refunded, interest does not begin to accrue until the taxpayer puts the state on notice that tax payments have been erroneously collected by making a demand for a refund. <em>(Girard Trust Co. </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of Philadelphia </em>(1948) 359 Pa. 319 [59 A.2d 124, 127-128] <em>Van Hise </em>v. <em>Board of Sup\u2019rs </em>(1897) 21 Misc. 572 [48 N.Y.S. 874, 879] overruled on other grounds, 26 Misc. 750 [57 N.Y.S. 281, 288]; <em>Atwell </em>v. <em>Zeluff </em>(1872) 26 Mich. 118, 119-120; <em>Boston and Sandwich Glass Co. </em>v. <em>City of Boston </em>(1842) 45 Mass. 181, 190.)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The summary judgment for the County of Los Angeles is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AJS\">Allport, J., and Potter, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied August 24, 1978.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Ball raises two additional contentions which need not be dealt with at length. First, she contends that two trial court rulings prior to the summary judgment\u2014overruling demurrers raising the same issue raised by the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment \u2014established her right to interest on the refunds as the law of the case and therefore should have been determinative of the motion for summary judgment. The fatal defect in this contention is that this doctrine applies only to a prior decision in the case determined by an <em>appellate court. </em>The rulings of a <em>trial court </em>during an earlier stage in the proceeding are not conclusive. (See <em>Davies </em>v. <em>Krasna </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 502, 507 [121 Cal.Rptr. 705, 535 P.2d 1161, 79 A.L.R.3d 807]; 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) \u00a7\u00a7 633-634,</p>\n<p id=\"AqAQ\">Ball\u2019s second additional contention is that she is entitled to interest on her refund as a matter of her constitutional right to equal protection of the law. (See U.S. Const., 14th Amend.) In response we need only note that this contention is unsupported by apposite authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b307-10\">The parties agree that there is no dispute between them with regard to the facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b307-11\">This exemption has been recodified as Revenue and Taxation Code section 202, subdivision (a)(2).
