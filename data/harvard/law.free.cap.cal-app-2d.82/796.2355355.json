Shortly thereafter he wrote a book entitled, \u201cQueen op the Flat Tops,\u201d subtitled, \u201cThe U.. S. S. Lexington And The Coral Sea Battle.\u201d The book was published and copyrighted in the United States in 1942 by E. P. Dutton &amp; Company, Incorporated, referred to as \u201cDutton.\u201d It was one of the first books published to treat in detail of the activities of an aircraft carrier and its crew in combat. The book is nonfictional. It relates historical facts, warfare in the Pacific. It does not contain any fictional character or characterization as such, or any plot or theme. The author and Dutton at all times have been the owners of the book referred to in the record as the \u201cliterary property,\u201d and of the copyright. The book became widely known as \u201cQueen op the Flat Tops.\u201d It attained considerable popularity which endowed the title, \u201cQueen op the Flat Tops,\u201d with considerable value. Up to April 14, 1944, Dutton had sold 170,578 copies of the book throughout the world and had expended the sum of $14,669.71 in advertising and publicizing the book. A substantial number of copies of the book were sold in California. About October, 1942, the author and Dutton employed Myron Selznick Agency, referred to as \u201cSelznick,\u201d to vend motion picture rights in the book. Hugh King, acting as \u201cmotion picture literary agent\u201d for Selznick, endeavored to effect a sale, contacting all motion picture companies. King was in exclusive charge of the efforts to sell. Early in 1944, appellant was engaged in the production of a motion picture centered about the operations of an aircraft carrier. The picture, like the book, related to historical facts, warfare in the Pacific. In March or April, 1944, Zanuck, executive vice-president of appellant in charge of production, empowered to make contracts in its behalf, authorized Julian Johnson, appellant's story editor, to purchase the right to the title, \u201cQueen of the Flat Tops.\u201d Johnson contacted King, and on behalf of appellant offered $2,500 for the use of the title alone, telling King that appellant was only interested in buying use of the title. This offer was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>jected by King. After some negotiation, the amount of the offer increasing each time, Johnson, upon authorization of Zanuek, offered King $20,000 for use of the title alone. King told Johnson that that was a fair price and that he would recommend to his principals, respondents, that they accept the offer. In his negotiations with King, Johnson used \u201cthe term \u2018all rights\u2019 and I meant all rights universally in the various countries.\u201d King did not, at that time, have any authority from his principals to accept an offer. It may be inferred from the evidence that, between the $2,500 offer and that of $20,000, Johnson was in constant contact with Zanuek with respect to the amount to be offered. On April 11, 1944, King telegraphed Dutton to the effect that appellant had offered $20,000 for use of the title alone, the material in the book to remain the author\u2019s property. On April 12, Dutton telegraphed King to the effect that it would check with the author immediately regarding the offer. On April 13, the author wrote King to the effect that Dutton and he had agreed that the price was acceptable and authorized King to accept the offer. The letter stated that Dutton was contacting King separately. On April 14, the author telegraphed King to the effect that he had spoken with Dutton and that they were in agreement to sell the title for $20,000. Immediately upon receipt of this telegram and on April 14, 1944, King telephoned Johnson, at appellant\u2019s studio, and told him that the author and Dutton accepted the offer. Johnson replied, \u201cThank God, it\u2019s over.\u201d King then dictated an office memorandum, \u201cthe blue memo, which meant the closing of the deal.\u201d The same day King went to Johnson\u2019s office, at appellant\u2019s studio, and verbally confirmed his telephone conversation, thanked Johnson for the deal, each party telling the other that he had made a good deal at a fair price, Johnson asking King in whose name the contract would be drawn. At that conversation King said, \u201cYou bought the title <em>only; </em>why don\u2019t you buy the whole book and buy the material too?\u201d Johnson replied that their only interest was in the title and \u201cthat they didn\u2019t want the material.\u201d Johnson testified that at that time he regarded the deal \u201cas a good deal for the company and for the author and publisher,\u201d and that the title \u201chad a distinct value because Stanley Johnston had written a book giving the saga or story of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>the \u2018Lexington.\u2019 \u201d On the same day, April 14, Johnson signed and sent to Schreiber, an officer of appellant authorized to make contracts in its behalf, a writing, reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-3\">\u2018 \u2018 Subject Queen of the Flat-Tops (Titie purchased)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-4\">Through the Myron Selzniek Agency (Hugh King representing) we have just purchased all rights to the title of this book. Price, $20,000, which was the figure of our offer\u2014 as we discussed the other day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-5\">This is a book published by E. P. Dutton, written by Stanley Johnston.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-6\">Mr. Wasson should know, in closing his contract, that we purchased the title only. (We were not interested in the literary material)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-7\">I have not notified anyone of this purchase, except Mr. Zanuek.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-8\">On April 17, Schreiber signed and sent to Wasson, resident studio counsel of appellant, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-9\">\u2018 \u2018 Subject Queen of The Flat Tops Title Dear George:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-10\">We have purchased all the rights to the title of the book, Queen of the Flat Tops, for the price of $20,000. We were not interested in the property, but Mr .Zanuek wanted us to purchase the title only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-11\">Lew Schreiber Lew Schreiber</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-12\">Dear George: When the papers are ready</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-13\">will you please contact Hugh King of the Myron Selzniek Agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-14\">Upon receiving this writing from Schreiber, Wasson telephoned Johnson and, in his own handwriting, wrote on the same writing, the following: \u201cJ. Johnson says: Sellers retain no rights to title for mo. pie. [motion picture], telev. [television], radio or dramatic purposes. Stanley Johnston, author\u2014Dutton.\u201d On the same day, Wasson told Ferguson, an employee in the legal department of appellant, to prepare a contract and that the contract should contain a \u201cwaiver of similarity\u201d\u2014a covenant \u201cnot to sue re similarities.\u201d On April 17, Ferguson telephoned King asking in whose name the contract should be drawn. On April 17, King telegraphed Dutton, \u201cClosed at Twentieth Friday <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>on \u2018Queen.\u2019 In whose name should contracts be drawn? Wire.\u201d The same day Dutton telegraphed King that the contracts should be drawn in the names of the publisher and the author. King so informed Ferguson. On April 17, Wasson telegraphed Kilroe, a copyright searcher for appellant in New York, asking Kilroe to register the title with the Hays Office, saying that appellant proposed to use the title for a picture formerly entitled, \u201cWing and a Prayer.\u201d The Hays Office was the office of the \u201cMotion Picture Producers and Distributors of America.\u201d On April 25, Kilroe sent a telegram to Wasson, in which he said that \u201cDutton states deal has been closed through Selznick\u2019s office.\u201d On May 2, Ferguson sent Selznick four copies of a written contract. The proposed written contract transferred to appellant all of the right, title and interest of the author and Dutton in the title, \u201cQueen of the Flat Tops,\u201d including, but not limited to, \u201cthe motion picture, radio, dramatic, television and allied rights throughout the world, provided however, that the owners shall have the right to continue to utilize said title in connection with the publication of said literary property,\u201d without any obligation on appellant to exercise or put to use any of the rights acquired, for a consideration of $20,000. The proposed contract also contained provisions which are referred to in .the record as \u201ccovenant of nonsuit.\u201d This \u201ccovenant of nonsuit\u201d constituted a waiver by respondents of all claims, present or future, against appellant, its successors, licensees and assigns \u201cby reason of any similarity which may exist between any dramatic production, television production, radio broadcast, motion picture or pictures, including a remake, reissue or foreign language version thereof utilizing the title \u2018Queen of the Flat Tops\u2019 . . . and the literary property hereinbefore mentioned and described,\u201d and required the author and Dutton to obtain a similar waiver from anyone to whom they might sell the motion picture, dramatic, radio or television rights in the literary, property itself, exclusive of rights in the title. Under the terms of the \u201ccovenant of nonsuit\u201d appellant could, with impunity, make use of any of the material in the book it desired. Wasson testified that his idea in inserting the \u201ccovenant of non-suit\u201d in the contract was to put the risk of pirating by appellant from the book itself on respondents and no.t on appellant. A few days after receipt of the contract by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>King, one or more conferences were had between Bang, Ferguson and Wasson, at one of which Johnson was present. King insisted that the \u201ccovenant of nonsuit\u201d be deleted from the contract insofar as it related to the material in the book; that appellant had bought rights in the title only; that it had not purchased \u201cthe literary property\u201d; that purchase of the \u201cliterary property\u201d had never been discussed; and that appellant had no right to inject such a clause into the contract. Wasson insisted that the covenant remain in the contract. At the meeting at which Johnson was present, Johnson conceded that appellant had only purchased rights in the title and not any of the material in the book. Neither Wasson nor Johnson made any claim that appellant \u201chad bought anything other than the title to the book.\u201d Wasson told King that either the \u201ccovenant of nonsuit\u201d stayed in the contract or he would recommend to appellant\u2019s officers that the deal be called off. King would not agree to its remaining. Wasson then conferred with Zanuck and Schreiber. Wasson told King, on May 11, 1944, \u201cI have got bad news . . . you ain\u2019t got no deal,\u201d and asked him to return the copies of the proposed contract. Bang told Wasson that so far as he, King, was concerned, \u201cthey had made a deal and they were going to stick by it.\u201d King returned the copies of the proposed contract to Wasson on May 12. On May 11, King advised the author and Dutton, by telegram, of appellant\u2019s insistence upon the insertion of the \u201ccovenant of nonsuit\u201d in the contract and of its effect, that he had refused to accept the contract, and recommended that they not sign the contract as submitted. On May 13, Dutton telegraphed King saying, \u201cWe agreed to accept their price for the title alone\u201d and appellant should be \u201cmade to stick to the deal.\u201d On May 15, the author telegraphed King. \u201cAgree with McCrae [Dutton] that we should insist Fox carry through deal.\u201d The evidence also shows that acquisition of the right to use the title of a book divorced from any material in the book is a common and usual transaction in the motion picture industry; that titles are of such value in the industry that Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America maintains an elaborate system for their registration; that motion picture companies often purchase a title and the literary property with which it is connected in order to obtain use of the title only, without using the literary property.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Respondents commenced this suit, alleging that an oral agreement was made on April 14, 1944, by which appellant had agreed to buy from respondents, and respondents had agreed to sell to appellant, the right to the use of the title, \u201cQueen op the Flat Tops,\u201d for motion picture and all other purposes except that respondents should have the right to continue to use the title in connection with the publication of the book, breach of the agreement by appellant, and damage to respondents in the sum of $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">The trial court, among other things, found that respondents are and were at all times the sole owners of the literary work entitled, \u201cQueen Of The Flat Tops, The U. S. S. Lexington and the Coral Sea,\u201d and the copyright thereon; that \u201cas of and prior to April 14th, 1944, the title, \u2018Queen of the Flat Tops\u2019 had acquired a secondary meaning with which the use of said title by others than plaintiffs for motion picture, radio, dramatic or television productions or uses would unfairly compete\u201d; that on or about April 14, respondents and appellant, through their respective agents duly authorized and empowered to so contract on behalf of their respective principals, entered into an oral contract, all of the essential terms of which were then and there mutually understood and agreed upon, whereby appellant agreed to buy from respondents and respondents agreed to sell to appellant for a consideration of $20,000, the right to the exclusive use of the title, \u201cQueen op the Flat Tops,\u201d for all purposes of any and every nature, subject only to the reservation of the right of the respondents to continue to use said title in connection with the publication of said literary work; that it was the mutual intention of the parties to be, and they were, hound by said oral contract of April 14, 1944, as of the time of the making thereof, although the said oral contract was subsequently to be reduced to writing; that respondents at all times have been ready, willing and able to perform their part of the contract; that appellant had refused to perform the contract unless the respondents, as an express condition of the appellant\u2019s performance, \u201cwould in writing agree to waive all claims and covenant not to sue defendant in the event that any similarity should exist between any motion picture, radio, dramatic or television production by defendant utilizing said title, \u2018Queen of the Flat Tops\u2019, and the material contained in the plaintiffs\u2019 literary work hereinbefore referred to, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>condition the Conrt finds to he contrary to the terms of said oral contract of April 14th, 1944, and therefore unwarranted, and finds defendant\u2019s insistence thereon as a condition to its performance to be a breach of said contract and a repudiation thereof, and finds that the refusal on plaintiffs\u2019 behalf to consent to such condition was justifiable\u201d; that ever since April 14, 1944, appellant had failed and refused to perform and had breached the oral contract and had failed to pay respondents the purchase price; that respondents had been damaged in the sum of $20,000 with interest; that \u201cthe agreement by plaintiffs to grant to defendant the rights as aforesaid to the use of the title \u2018Queen of the Flat Tops\u2019 constituted an agreement by plaintiffs both to confer upon defendant a benefit to which defendant was not lawfully entitled and to suffer a prejudice which plaintiffs were not lawfully bound to suffer and that such an agreement constituted a good consideration for defendant\u2019s promise to pay $20,000 for such rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\">Appellant urges first that there was no consideration for its promise to pay $20,000 because, so it says, respondents \u201chad no vendible property right in the words \u2018Queen of the Flat Tops\u2019 which they could lawfully transfer to\u201d appellant. Appellant says in this behalf that there is no element of property in a literary title or name capable of being transferred separate and apart from the literary work to which it is appended.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Appellant takes the position here inconsistent with, and contrary to, that which it took in the trial court. There it said: \u201cIn the instant case, the contemplated contract was for the sale of a part of a literary property. There is an enormous traffic in literary properties, especially in the motion picture industry. Hundreds of law suits involving literary properties have found their way into conrt. However, we have been unable to discover any reported case dealing with the sale of rights in literary property founded upon an oral contract. . . . Though there are conflicting dicta on the subject, it has long been held that there is a property right in a trade mark or trade name . . . the Supreme Court of California, in <em>Derringer </em>v. <em>Plate </em>(1865) 29 Cal. 292 [87 Am.Dec. 170], holds that a man may acquire, by adoption and use, a property right in a trade name. It has long been recognized that titles to literary and dramatic works are analogous to trade names and are governed by the same principles. <em>Outcault </em>v. <em>Lamar </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>(1909) 135 App.Div. 110; 119 N.T.S. 930; <em>Dickey </em>v. <em>Mutual Film Corp., </em>(1916) 160 N.T.S. 609. Referring to the nature of a title, it was said in <em>National Pictures Theatres, Inc., </em>v. <em>Foundation Film Corp., </em>(CCA (2d) 1920) 266 F. 208, that it is \u2018a right in being, an actual property\u2019 protectible against invasion. ... We apprehend that it will be urged that trade marks and trade names are not vendible in gross, and that, therefore, there was no sale within the meaning of the Sales Act. If this be so, there was a total failure of consideration for defendant\u2019s alleged promise to pay $20,000. However, we think the proper view is that business practice has so developed, and the law must recognize, that certain names and titles have a marketable value and are the subject of commercial traffic. In <em>Benioff </em>v. <em>Benioff </em>(1923) 64 Cal.App. 745 [222 P. 835], the court recognized that the owner of a trade name could grant the exclusive right to another to use it in another locality, although the court held that since no consideration was paid for the right, and since it was not acted upon by the defendant, that it was revocable at plaintiff\u2019s pleasure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">It would be sufficient for us to say that appellant, upon appeal, cannot deviate from the position it took in the trial court. <em>(Merchant etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>Kellogg E. &amp; D. Co., </em>28 Cal.2d 594, 601 [170 P.2d 923]; <em>Ayoob </em>v. <em>Ayoob, </em>74 Cal.App.2d 236, 247 [168 P.2d 462], where it was held that the respondent could not claim illegality of consideration upon appeal when he claimed in the trial court that an oral contract was voidable under the statute of frauds and had not claimed illegality of consideration.) As a special defense, appellant pleaded want of consideration for the oral agreement. It vigorously asserts that it did raise the question of the transferability of the title in the trial court. We are inclined to the opinion that it did not raise that question or the question of the transferability of a right to use the title. However, in view of appellant\u2019s insistence that it did raise the question of the transferability of the title in the trial court, and that it did plead want of consideration, and of the importance of the question, we pass on appellant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">It may be well to emphasize here that what respondents, in fact, granted to appellant, as found by the trial court, was not the title but the exclusive right to use the title for all purposes except in connection with the publication of the book. The author of any product of the mind has an exclusive ownership therein and in the representation or expression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>thereof which continues so long as the product and the representations or expressions thereof made by him remain in his possession. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 980.) There may be ownership of such products of labor or skill as the composition of an author and of rights created by statute. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 655.) The ownership of a thing is the right of one or more persons to possess and use it to the exclusion of others. The thing of which there may be ownership is called property. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 654.) The ownership of property is absolute when a single person has the absolute dominion over it and may use it or dispose of it according to his pleasure subject only_ to general laws. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 679.) A product of the mind is property. (16 Cal.Jur. 665; 21 Cal.Jur. 642, \u00a74.) It is an intangible, incorporeal right. <em>(Italiani </em>v. <em>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Corp., </em>45 Cal.App.2d 464 [114 P.2d 370].)  There cannot be property in an author\u2019s ideas but there may be property in a particular combination of ideas or in the form in which ideas are embodied. <em>(Barsha </em>v. <em>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, </em>32 Cal.App. 2d 556 [90 P.2d 371]; 18 So.Cal.L.Rev. 256.) There can be no property in words which are merely generic or descriptive. <em>(Fidelity etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Federal etc. Co., </em>217 Cal. 307 [18 P.2d 950]; <em>Jaynes </em>v. <em>Weickman, </em>55 Cal.App. 557, 558 [203 P. 828].) However, a person may have a property right and the right to the exclusive use of arbitrary or fictitious or fanciful or artificial or technical names or titles. They have a special significance. They are creations of the mind. Words which are generic and descriptive in their ordinary application may, when not used in a generic or descriptive sense, be the subject of a property right and the right of exclusive use. Words and terms, such as \u201cMechanics,\u201d \u201cWhat Cheer House,\u201d \u201cPhiladelphia,\u201d \u201cHudson Bay,\u201d \u201cCarolina,\u201d while generic and descriptive in their ordinary application may, when not used in their generic or descriptive sense, be the subject of a property right and the right of exclusive use. <em>(Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Brasley-Krieger S. Co., </em>19 Cal.App.2d 257, 259 [64 P.2d 1109].) A word or combination of words may be descriptive when used in one connection, and nondescriptive in other contexts. A descriptive word or combination of words may be used in a nondescriptive sense because unrelated to the subject matter in question. In <em>Gannert </em>v. <em>Rupert, </em>(2 Cir.) 127 F. 962 [62 C.C.A. 594], the word \u201cComfort,\u201d as the title of a magazine, was held to be technical and nondescriptive and entitled to protection as against the title \u201cHome Comfort\u201d of another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>magazine. The following have been held nondescriptive: \u201c Chantecler, \u201d as applied to a play in which every character represented a barnyard fowl or animal, even though the principal character was a rooster. <em>(Frohman </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>68 Misc. 461 [123 N.Y.S. 1090, 1092] ; \u201cChicken of the Sea,\u201d for canned tuna fish <em>(Van Camp Sea Food Co. </em>v. <em>A. B. Stewart Organizations, </em>50 F.2d 976, 979); \u201cCough Cherries,\u201d for a confection of a reddish color and a cherry flavor <em>(Stoughton </em>v. <em>Woodard, </em>39 F. 902); \u201cKaiser,\u201d for beer <em>(J. &amp; P. Blatz Brewing Co. </em>v. <em>Kaiserbrauerei, Beck &amp; Co., </em>(3 Cir.) 74 F. 222, 224 [20 C.C.A. 402]); \u201cPride,\u201d as applied to cigars <em>(Hier </em>v. <em>Abrahams, </em>82 N.Y. 519, 522 [37 Am.Rep. 589]); \u201cRoyal,\u201d for baking powder <em>(Royal Baking Powder Co. </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>70 F. 376, 382 [aff\u2019d, (7 Cir.) 85 F. 231, 236, 29 C.C.A. 245]); \u201cStar,\u201d for hams and bacon <em>(Armour &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Louisville Provision Co., </em>(6th Cir.) 283 F. 42, 45 [cert, den., 260 U.S. 744, 43 S.Ct. 164, 67 L.Ed.492]); \u201cThe Rosary,\u201d as applied to a drama as such <em>(Selig Polyscope Co. </em>v. <em>Unicorn Film S. Corp., </em>163 N.Y.S. 62) ; \u201cQueen,\u201d for shoes <em>(Thomas G. Plant Co. </em>v. <em>May Co., </em>(6 Cir.) 105 F. 375, 378); \u201cQueen Quality,\u201d for shoes <em>(Thomas G. Plant Co. </em>v. <em>May Mercantile Co., </em>153 F. 229).  In our opinion, the title \u201cQueen op the Flat Tops, \u2019 \u2019 is an arbitrary, fictitious, fanciful, artificial, distinctive and nondescriptive combination of words. The words \u201cFlat Tops\u201d alone are descriptive. For a long time aircraft carriers have been referred to commonly as \u201cflat tops.\u201d The word \u201cQueen\u201d may be descriptive. It is ordinarily not descriptive of an aircraft carrier. Some of the synonyms and ordinary meanings of \u201cqueen\u201d are: \u201cwife of a king,\u201d \u201c a female monarch,\u201d \u201ca goddess,\u201d \u201can empress,\u201d \u201ca belle,\u201d \u201ca woman eminent in rank, power or attraction,\u201d \u201ca strikingly attractive girl or woman,\u201d \u201cthe fertile female of bees, ants and termites, \u201d \u201c a female cat, \u201d \u201c a playing card. \u2019 \u2019 No one of these would be used normally to describe an aircraft carrier. The combination of words, \u201cQueen op the Flat Tops, \u2019 \u2019 is purely fanciful. It suggests one flat top. Which one is not disclosed. The title, \"Queen op the Flat Tops, \u2019 \u2019 being nondescriptive, was a product of the mind. Under Civil Code, sections 655 and 980 respondents were the owners of the title and as such owners had the right to its exclusive use for all purposes. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 654, 679.)</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">At common law an author has an exclusive property right in his original intellectual production before it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>published. (Drone, \u201cCopyright,\u201d p. 101.) The common law right is an absolute, incorporeal property right. It is not a privilege conferred by statute. It is a right of the common law wherever that system prevails. <em>(Ferris </em>v. <em>Frohman, </em>223 U.S. 424 [32 S.Ct. 263, 56 L.Ed. 492]; <em>Brunner </em>v. <em>Stix, Baer &amp; Fuller Co., </em>352 Mo. 1225 [181 S.W.2d 643].)  An idea given embodiment in tangible form is the subject of common law property right. <em>(Barsha </em>v. <em>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.2d 556, 561; <em>Yadkoe </em>v. <em>Fields, </em>66 Cal.App.2d 150,159 [151 P.2d 906]; <em>Brunner </em>v. <em>Stix, Baer &amp; Fuller Co., supra; Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Co. </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>101 Ind.App. 420 [194 N.E. 206, 210].)  The copyright of the book does not protect the owner\u2019s exclusive use of the title. <em>(Warner Bros. Pictures </em>v. <em>Majestic Pictures Corp., </em>(2 Cir.) 70 F.2d 310, 311.) A title alone is not copyrightable. <em>(Patten </em>v. <em>Superior Talking Pictures, </em>8 F.Supp. 196, 197.)  Upon publication of the book with the title the owners ceased to have an exclusive common law right to use of the title. <em>(Little </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>18 How. 165 [15 L.Ed. 328]; <em>Keene </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>16 Gray (Mass.) 545, 550 [77 Am.Dec. 426] ; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>DeWitt, </em>47 N. Y. 532, 539 [7 Am.Rep. 480].) While an author may not have any property interest in the use of a title under his common law right after publication, it does not follow that he does not have a property interest in the title and in its use as against a competitor. <em>(International News Service </em>v. <em>Associated Press, </em>248 U.S. 215 [39 S.Ct. 68, 63 L.Ed. 211, 219, 2 A.L.R. 293].)  To protect the author in his property right to the title and its use after publication of the work, the courts have developed the doctrine of secondary Meaning. \u201c Secondary meaning\u2019 is a legal term which deals with the significance, in law, of extensions of the meaning of words and symbols to new uses.\u201d (Nims, Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks, 4th ed. (1947), p. 152.)  A title of a copyrighted book attains a secondary meaning if it acquires a trade significance as an arbitrary designation, and its use is secured to the owner of the copyrighted matter. <em>(Selig Polyscope Co. </em>v. <em>Unicorn Films Corp., supra, </em>163 N.Y.S. 62, 63.) Acquiring a secondary meaning signifies attaining popularity. <em>(G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. </em>v. <em>Saalfield, </em>(6 Cir.) 198 F. 369, 373 [117 C.C.A. 245].) The doctrine of secondary meaning has been extended to catch phrases and slogans. <em>(H. W. Fishel &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Distinctive Jewelry Co., </em>196 App.Div. 779 [188 N.Y.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>633, 639]). The title of a radio program is subject to ownership, and right in it is established by proof that it has been used in radio broadcasts, has been announced and advertised and has reached the public in other ways. (Old Maestro,\" <em>Premier-Pabst Corp. </em>v. <em>Elm City Brewing Co., </em>9 F.Supp. 754; \u201cThe March of Time,\u201d <em>Time, Inc. </em>v. <em>Barshay, </em>27 F.Supp. 870, 873; \u201cInformation Please,\u201d <em>Golenpaul </em>v. <em>Rosett, </em>174 Misc. 114 [18 N.Y.S.2d 889].) The title of a newspaper, magazine or periodical is subject to ownership, and right in it is established by proof of circulation and advertising of the name, although it is not registered as a trademark; \u201cComfort,\u201d <em>Gannert </em>v. <em>Rupert, supra, </em>(2 Cir.) 127 F. 962; \u201cPhotoplay,\u201d <em>Photoplay Pub.

The subject of property is the order of words in the author\u2019s composition. <em>(Jeffreys </em>v. <em>Boosey, </em>4 H.L. 815, 867, 10 Eng.Rep. 681, 702.) When the words \u201cQueen of the Flat Tops,\u201d have acquired a secondary meaning it may be said that such meaning is their primary meaning insofar as their use in connection with the activities of an aircraft carrier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>are concerned. <em>(Eastern Columbia, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waldman, </em>30 Cal.2d 268, 271 [181 P.2d 865].) The facts in <em>Estes </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>21 F. 189, were that one James Johnston of London published a series of juvenile books called \u201cChatterbox\u201d; they became widely known and quite popular in England and in this country; James Johnston did not have a copyright or trademark; <em>he assigned the exclusive right to use and protect the title \u201cChatterbox\u201d in this country to Estes, the orator; </em>defendants began publication in this country of a series of books similar in appearance and style and called them \u201cChatterbox.\u201d In enjoining the use by the defendants of the title \u201cChatterbox,\u201d the court said (p. 190): \u201cJohnston had the exclusive right to put his own. work, as his own, upon the markets of the world. No one else had the right to represent that other work was his. Not the right to prevent the copying of his, and putting the work upon the market, but the right to be free from untrue representations that this other work was his when put upon the markets. This gives him nothing but the fair enjoyment of the just reputation of his own work, which fully belongs to him. It deprives others of nothing that belongs to them. The question then arises whether Johnston could transfer his right, or any part of it, to the orators, so that the defendants, in what they have done and are about to do, trespass upon the orator\u2019s rights, and not upon Johnston\u2019s. He could not do all this himself; he must act by and through others. No reason is apparent why he could not give them the exclusive right to put his work on the market as his, as he had that right. This seems to be what he undertook to do. They had that right, and the profits of its enjoyment would belong to them. The defendants would deprive them, and not Johnston, of the profits. The injury would be to them and not to him, and they are, in this view, entitled to the remedy.\u201d (See, also, <em>Estes </em>v. <em>Leslie, </em>27 F. 22, and <em>Estes </em>v. <em>Worthington, </em>31 F. 154, in each of which the transferee of the right to use the title was awarded an injunction against the use of the title \u201cChatterbox.\u201d) The court, in <em>Hemingway </em>v. <em>Film Alliance of U. S., </em>174 Misc. 725 [21 N.Y.S.2d 827], held that the title of a play, \u201cThe Fifth Column,\u201d had acquired a secondary meaning although it had only run on Broadway for two and one-half months, having opened elsewhere, and had only enjoyed \u201csome measure of success\u201d; that exhibition of a motion picture titled, \u201cFifth Column Squad\u201d should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>be enjoined. The court said (p. 829) that even if the title \u201cFifth Column\u201d had not acquired a secondary meaning \u201cto paraphrase the opinion in <em>Skelly Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Powerine Co., </em>Cust, and Pat. App., 86 F.2d 752, 754, quoted with approval in <em>Philadelphia Storage Battery Co. </em>v. <em>Mindlin, </em>163 Misc. 52, 56, 57 [296 N.Y.S. 176], a vast field of words and phrases is open to a producer who wishes to seek a title to distinguish his play or photoplay from that of another. Consequently, whatever doubts there may be on that score should be resolved in favor of the producer who has already spent time, money and effort to give the title to his production a secondary meaning and against the new comer who, even unintentionally, uses or simulates the title in such a manner as to confuse or mislead the public.\u201d The question whether a title has acquired a secondary meaning is one of fact. <em>(Jenney Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Leader Filling Stations Corp., </em>291 Mass. 394 [196 N.E. 852, 854] ; <em>Little Tavern Shops, Inc. </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(4 Cir.), 116 F.2d 903, 906.)  The evidence recited, showing exclusiveness and priority of use and great popularity, is sufficient to support the finding of the trial court that the title \u2018 \u2018 Queen op the Flat Tops\u201d alone, and divorced from the material in the book, had acquired a secondary meaning. <em>(Shaler Co. </em>v. <em>Rite-Way Products </em>(6 Cir.), 107 F.2d 82, 84 [cert. den. 310 U.S. 634 [60 S.Ct. 1076], 84 L.Ed. 1403]; <em>N.

This exclusive use included: its use as the title of the book, as the title of a silent motion picture, as the title of a speaking motion picture, as the title of a radio broadcast, as the title of a dramatic production, as the title of a television production,\u2014dealing with the activities of an aircraft carrier in combat. As owners of these rights, respondents could grant the exclusive right to use the title for any one or more of those purposes. Civil Code, section 1044, provides that \u201cProperty of any kind may be transferred, except as otherwise provided by this article.\u201d Section 1044 is in article II of chapter I of title IV. The only property which article II says may not be transferred is a \u201cmere possibility, not coupled with an interest.\u201d Many items of property are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>assignable under Civil Code, section 1044, which were not assignable at common law. <em>(Fudickar </em>v. <em>East Riverside I. Dist., </em>109 Cal. 29, 37 [41 P. 1024].) The common law rights are subject to disposition, absolute or qualified, by any mode by which personal property is transferred. <em>(Caliga </em>v. <em>Inter-Ocean Newspaper Co. </em>(7 Cir.), 157 F. 186, 188 [aff\u2019d 215 U.S. 182, 30 S.Ct. 38, 54 L.Ed. 150]; <em>Frohman </em>v. <em>Ferris, </em>238 Ill. 430 [87 N.E. 327, 328, 128 Am.St.Rep. 135, 43 L.R.A. N.S. 639] [aff\u2019d 223 U.S. 424, 32 S.Ct. 263, 56 L.Ed. 492].) Writing of the common law right, the court in <em>Aronson </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>43 N.J.Eq. 365 [12 A. 177, 178], declared: \u201cThe right to literary property is just as sacred, and just as much entitled to the protection of the law, as the right to any other kind of personal property. Its acquisition and succession are governed by the same legal rules which control the acquisition and succession of other property of the same general class, and, if the rights of its owner are violated, he is entitled to the same remedies to which the owner of other personal property may resort for redress. \u2019 \u2019 In <em>Goldwyn Pictures Corp. </em>v. <em>Goldwyn </em>(2 Cir.), 296 F. 391, 397, it was squarely held that \u201cone by contract may deprive himself of his exclusive right to use his name in industry.\u201d (See, also, <em>Brown Chemical Co. </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>139 U.S. 540, 542 [11 S.Ct. 625, 35 L.Ed. 247, 248].)

Ryan &amp; Associates </em>v. <em>Century Brewing Ass\u2019n, </em>185 Wash. 600 [55 P.2d 1053, 104 A.L.R. 1353].) <em>Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Co. </em>v. <em>Meyer, supra, </em>101 Ind.App. 420 [194 N.E. 206], answers appellant\u2019s contention. In that case the plaintiff, Meyer, on December 3, 1925, submitted to defendant, seller of Chesterfield cigarettes, an original advertising scheme to be used in the way of billboard advertising. The idea consisted of this: Two gentlemen, well groomed, in working clothes, or in hunting togs, apparently engaged in conversation, one extending to the other a package of cigarettes saying, \u201cHave one of these,\u201d the other replying, \u201cNo thanks; I smoke Chesterfields.\u201d In submitting the scheme, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>by letter, Meyer said that he trusted the idea would \u201cbe of sufficient value as to merit a reasonable charge therefor.\u201d About two and one-half years later, on July 21, 1928, the defendant used a modification of the advertising scheme in numerous daily papers and magazines. In upholding a judgment for the plaintiff for the reasonable value of the scheme, the court stated (p. 210 [194 N.E.]) : \u201cThis is a common-law action. The rules of the common law are continually changing and expanding with the progress of the society in which it prevails. It does not lag behind, but adapts itself to the conditions of the present so that the ends of justice may be reached. While we recognize that an abstract idea as such may not be the subject of a property right, yet, when it takes upon itself the concrete form which we find in the instant case, it is our opinion that it then becomes a property right subject to sale. Of course, it must be something novel and new; in other words, one cannot claim any right in the multiplication table. [Citing cases.] \u201d The judgment was upheld upon the theory that the plaintiff had made an offer to sell a merchantable idea or scheme, the defendant had accepted, and, in the absence of an express agreement to pay, there was a use of the property from which arose an implied obligation to pay. The recent case of <em>Yadkoe </em>v. <em>Fields, supra, </em>66 Cal.App.2d 150, was an action to recover the reasonable value of literary material submitted by Yadkoe to and used by W. C. Fields. The court quoted with approval from <em>Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Co. </em>v. <em>Meyer, supra, </em>101 Ind.App. 420 [194 N.E. 206], and said that while an abstract idea as such may not be the subject of a property right, yet, when it takes upon itself concrete form it then becomes a property right <em>subject to sale, </em>that there may be literary property in the form in which ideas are expressed, and that whether an idea is expressed in concrete form is a matter of degree. (See <em>Bradbury </em>v. <em>Dickens </em>(Eng.), 27 Beav. 53, 54 Eng.Rep. 21, holding that the title of a magazine was the sole valuable asset of the proprietor and authorizing its sale.)</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">If appellant, before or without the grant of April 14, 1944, had threatened to use or had used the title, \u201cQueen op the Flat Tops\u201d for any purpose, it could have been enjoined. The author is protected from misappropriation by pirates and cheats: <em>(Golenpaul </em>v. <em>Rosett, supra, </em>174 Misc. 114 [18 N.Y.S. 2d 889], in which the publisher of a magazine was enjoined from using \u201cInformation Please,\u201d the title of a radio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>program, as the title of a magazine; <em>Klaw </em>v. <em>General Film Co., supra, </em>154 N.Y.S. 988, holding that the producer of a play-under a certain title was entitled to restrain the production of a dissimilar motion picture under the same title.) (See <em>Frohman </em>v. <em>Payton, </em>34 Misc. 275 [68 N.Y.S. 849]; <em>Frohman </em>v. <em>Morris, supra, </em>68 Misc. 461 [123 N.Y.S. 1090]; <em>Dickey </em>v. <em>Mutual Film Corp., </em>160 N.Y.S. 609, where the sole similarity was in the title; <em>Patten </em>v. <em>Superior Talking Pictures, supra, </em>8 F. Supp. 196.) Appellant concedes the correctness of this principle when, in its closing brief, it says: \u201cWe further agree that title to a literary work achieves a proprietary aspect as the result of its acquiring a secondary meaning and that, having acquired such meaning, it may not be used in connection with any other work, however dissimilar. \u2019 \u2019  The right to the exclusive use of the title was a right of value. Having that right, respondents could, by agreement for a consideration, waive it in whole or in part. There is nothing unlawful in such an agreement. Appellant argues that the title of a book may not be transferred in gross\u2014that is, apart from the book. The argument overlooks the fact that the agreement between the parties here was not a transfer of the title in gross. Under the agreement the title remained in respondents in connection with the publication of the book. Respondents merely permitted appellant to do something it could not otherwise do\u2014that is, use the title for motion picture and other purposes. These were the findings. It is obvious that the title could only be used for those purposes in connection with the activities of \u201cFlat Tops,\u201d aircraft carriers. The title was not transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\">Fairly, it may be inferred from the evidence that the contents of the book, the literary material, had lost its value at the time of the transaction between the parties, that the only value was in use of the title. The book, in evidence, is wholly historical. As has been said, it treats largely of the exploits of the carrier Lexington and its crew in the battle of the Coral Sea, which occurred in May, 1942. Selznick was given the agency to sell the book for motion picture purposes in October, 1942. Results were nil up to the time that appellant made an offer for use of the title alone in March or April, 1944. During the negotiations between King and Johnson, King made repeated efforts to persuade appellant to buy the literary material without avail. After appellant acquired the right to use the title Selznick continued its effort to sell the literary material to other motion picture producers without success.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>The subject matter of the book was <em>publici juris, </em>and, as such, was not protected by the copyright. It was only the manner in which the literary material was set up and the personal reactions of the author which the copyright protected. The fact that the material became valueless was, no doubt, due to the fact that all historical and news events soon lose commercial value as the interest of the public wanes and current news events become the topic of the day and capture the public fancy. The war had progressed about two years between the sinking of the Lexington in the battle of the Coral Sea and the grant to appellant. Numerous exploits of men, aircraft carriers, airplanes and other instruments of war had occurred, been written about, and captured public attention. We cannot say, as a matter of law, that because the literary material probably had lost its value the right to use the title also had lost value and for that reason no consideration passed to appellant. Appellant\u2019s officers, at least, thought that the title alone had substantial value.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">Property rights exist because they promote the general welfore. As society has developed there has been a corresponding evolution in the development of property rights. Matters considered as near revolutionary a few years ago are now accepted as facts. Legal history shows a continual recognition of new interests and a gradual willingness to protect interests in intangible things. (Warren &amp; Brandeis, 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193; 4 Ford. L. Rev. 307; 45 Tale L. J. 520.) The right of transfer is one of the inseparable incidents of property. A title signifies origin and a certain standard of competence. <em>(Warner Bros. Pictures </em>v. <em>Majestic Pictures Corp., supra, </em>(2 Cir.) 70 F.2d 310, 311.) The title, \"Queen op the Flat Tops,\u201d was produced by shrewd calculation. It is an original combination, a catchy phrase. It had sales appeal. Much energy, time and money were spent in popularizing it. A thing of such great value should not only be protected but should be subject to transfer for use. There is no valid reason why it should not be held that a transferable property right exists in nse of a title of a book, such as this, for motion picture and other ends. Any other rule would give the owner of the right an empty shell where the literary material, as a book, has lost value. He could prevent another from using the title for such purposes but could realize nothing upon that right unless he was financially and otherwise in a position to use it for such purposes. There is nothing novel, complex or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>unique about the transaction. Appellant\u2019s studio counsel testified that purchase of the right to use a title divorced from the material with which it has been associated is a most usual transaction in the motion picture industry. We should be realistic. It is common knowledge that since the advent of motion pictures\u2014and particularly since the advent of radio \u2014titles, names, slogans, catch-phrases and the like have become of great value. Agreements for their use in particular fields are common. Large sums are paid for their use in advertising. The law is not quiescent. It progresses. Evolution of the law to meet changing conditions is exemplified by the attitude of our Supreme Court. The earlier cases held that in order to entitle one to an injunction restraining another from using a name or title previously appropriated, a showing had to be made that the name was being used by the infringer in a competing business. In <em>Academy of Motion Picture A. &amp; S. </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>15 Cal.2d 685 [104 P.2d 650], it was held that an injunction should issue even though the infringer was using the name in a noncompeting business. The reasoning of the later cases is that use by another of the name or title results in a dilution of its value to the original appropriator. <em>(Tiffany &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Tiffany Productions, </em>147 Misc. 679 [264 N.Y.S. 459] [aff\u2019d 262 N.Y. 482, 188 N.E. 30].) Modern conditions require our conclusion in the instant case. The law is, and should be, molded to meet the changing requirements of the people. As it was held in <em>Uproar Co. </em>v. <em>National Broadcasting Co., </em>8 F.Supp. 358, that the advertising value of an announcer\u2019s name (Graham McNamee) is an assignable property right, so it must be held here that respondents had vendible property rights in the right to the exclusive use of the title, \u201cQueen of the Flat Tops,\u201d which they could lawfully grant to appellant for motion pictures and other purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-3\">The next phase of appellant\u2019s argument of want of consideration is that there was no counterpromise on the part of respondents which furnished any consideration for appellant\u2019s promise. This is the point which appellant made in the trial court in support of its plea of want of consideration. The point is wholly without merit. The evidence fully supports the trial court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe agreement by plaintiffs to grant to defendant the rights as aforesaid to the use of the title \u2018Queen of the Flat Tops\u2019 constituted an agreement by plaintiffs both to confer upon defendant a benefit to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>defendant was not lawfully entitled and to suffer a prejudice which plaintiffs were not lawfully bound to suffer and that such an agreement constituted a good consideration for defendant\u2019s promise to pay $20,000.00 for such rights.\u201d Respondents had the exclusive right to the use of the title for all purposes. Appellant had no right to its use for any purpose. Respondents granted appellant the exclusive right to use the title for all purposes except in connection with the publication of the book. This was adequate consideration for appellant\u2019s promise to pay $20,000. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1605; <em>Krobitzsch </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>72 Cal.App.2d 804, 809 [165 P.2d 729].) Appellant\u2019s assumption, as the premise for its argument in this connection, that there was no \u201cbenefit or prejudice which is offered or assumed as an inducement to the promisor, \u2019 \u2019 because, so the argument runs, the waiver of respondents of a right which they otherwise would have had to object to appellant\u2019s use of the title was not the inducement for appellant\u2019s offer to pay $20,000, is contrary to the evidence, inferences which the trial judge could draw therefrom, and the findings. In presenting this point, appellant also argues that while copyright does not protect title, rights with respect to the use of a title must be supported by a copyright and follow it, that, therefore, it lay within respondents\u2019 power to destroy the grant \u201cby letting the book fall into the public domain (as by publishing it without the statutory notice of copyright) or by assigning the copyright to a bona fide purchaser for value.\u201d Neither appellant\u2019s premise nor its conclusion is sound.  Rights with respect to the use of a title need not be supported by a copyright. As we have seen, a title alone may acquire a secondary meaning with the right of protection. That right is not dependent upon copyright. Some of the more recent eases cited above hold that a title which is nondescriptive will be protected. That right is not dependent upon copyright. As the learned trial judge pointed out, the agreement carried with it implied obligations upon the part of respondents to fully and adequately protect appellant\u2019s use. (See <em>Uproar Co. </em>v. <em>National Broadcasting Co., </em>(1 Cir.) 81 F.2d 373, 377.) There is always a possibility in any agreement of one or the other of the parties breaching the agreement whether its covenants are express or implied. Appellant was perfectly willing to take the exclusive use of the title without any express obligation on the part of respondents to refrain from letting the book fall into the public domain, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>as by publishing it without the statutory notice of copyright, or by assigning the copyright to a bona fide purchaser for value. Appellant bargained for use of the title only, with the exclusive right to use it as the title of motion pictures, stage performances, radio broadcasts, television broadcasts, and any use whatever throughout the world, except the right in respondents to continue to use it in connection with the publication of the book for so long as such rights existed under the law. Appellant got just what it bargained for. It cannot complain because it did not get more.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\">Appellant next says that \u201c at no time did the parties consummate a binding contract.\u201d It is said, (a) that neither of the negotiating agents was authorized to enter into a binding contract, (b) that even if Johnson made an offer there was no acceptance by Dutton, (c) that the minds of the parties did not meet on essential elements of the proposed contract, (d) that the parties contemplated that any agreement they might reach was to be reduced to writing and until that was done they were not obligated to each other. It is unnecessary to repeat the evidence which we have stated at length. It is without conflict that both negotiating agents were authorized to enter into a binding agreement, and that Dutton accepted appellant\u2019s offer. If there was any question whether King had authority from Dutton to accept Johnson\u2019s offer, which there was not, it is clear that Dutton ratified King\u2019s acceptance before withdrawal of the offer. The same may be said with respect to the contention that the minds of the parties did not meet on essential elements of \u201cthe proposed contract. \u2019 \u2019 The contention is not that the minds of the parties did not meet upon the essential elements of \u201ca contract.\u201d Civil Code, section 1550, says: \u201cIt is essential to the existence of a contract that there should be: 1. Parties capable of contracting ; <em>2. </em>Their consent; 3. A lawful object; and, 4. A sufficient cause or consideration.\u201d All of these elements were present. Because the agreement did not embody other matters does not affect its validity. Neither is its validity affected because it does not contain provisions which a super-technical lawyer for a motion picture producer would have insisted upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The trial court found that the oral agreement of April 14, 1944, was binding on that date, although it was subsequently to be reduced to writing. It has been held repeatedly that when the respective parties orally agree upon all the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>and conditions of an agreement with the mutual intention that it shall thereupon become binding, the mere fact that a formal written agreement to the same effect is to be prepared and signed does not alter the binding validity of the original oral agreement. <em>(Thompson </em>v. <em>Schurman, </em>65 Cal.App.2d 432, 440 [150 P.2d 509] ; <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>De La Salle Institute, </em>66 Cal.App.2d 609, 630 [152 P.2d 774] ; <em>Kreling </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>77 Cal.App.2d 821, 834 [176 P.2d 965]; note: 165 A.L.R. 756.)  Whether it was the mutual intention of the parties that the oral agreement should become binding <em>eo instanti </em>is to be determined by the surrounding facts and circumstances of a particular case and is a question for the trial court. <em>(Thompson </em>v. <em>Schurman, supra; Kreling </em>v. <em>Walsh, supra.) </em>The entire tenor of the argument of counsel for appellant is that the officers of appellant should not have authorized Johnson to make the agreement, that they should have authorized him only to make an offer\u2014conditioned, if it was accepted, upon the making of a written contract. The argument has no merit. At the time of the grant the war was on. Appellant was producing, and had about completed, an historical motion picture dealing with an aircraft carrier in combat, warfare in the Pacific. Its officers wanted a popular, catchy title for the picture. They were willing to pay $20,000 for it. It is a reasonable inference from the evidence that all they wanted was use of the title for that picture and that they were not, in the slightest, concerned with leaving anything else to future negotiation. The finding that the oral agreement of April 14, 1944, became effective immediately is supported by substantial evidence. Upon King\u2019s acceptance of appellant\u2019s offer on April 14,1944, nothing was left to be agreed upon. Indeed, it is difficult to see how any other finding could have been made in the face of appellant\u2019s memoranda that it had \u201cpurchased all the rights to the title of the book Queen oe the Flat Tops/\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">Finally, appellant says that if there was an agreement it was broken through no fault of its own in that respondents refused to execute the written agreement proposed by appellant. This contention is so palpably lacking in merit that it should not be considered. Johnson, appellant\u2019s story editor, testified without equivocation that all he purchased was the right to use the title; that he told King, on several occasions, that all appellant wanted was use of the title; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>it did not want any of the material in the book. Notwithstanding, appellant\u2019s resident counsel, Wasson, inserted in the written contract a provision giving appellant unqualified right to use the material in the book, the so-called \u201ccovenant of nonsuit. \u2019 \u2019 King objected. Appellant, through its resident counsel, then refused to go further with the transaction and refused to pay the purchase price. The oral agreement was breached by appellant. <em>(Gold Mining &amp; Water Co. </em>v. <em>Swinerton, </em>23 Cal.2d 19, 29 [142 P.2d 22].) The trial court no doubt drew many inferences from the evidence unfavorable to appellant. The evidence on the subject left no room for doubt that attorney Wasson conceived the idea of inserting in the contract the \u201ccovenant of nonsuit,\u201d knowing at the time, from the memorandum which he had received from Schreiber, \u201cwe have purchased all the rights to the title of the book Queen op the Flat Tops, for the price of $20,000,\u201d that the purchase had been definitely agreed upon. It would appear clear, also, that it was the insistence of Wasson in this connection which caused the officers of appellant to breach the agreement. Was-son\u2019s testimony that Schreiber told him \u201cthat we were interested in purchasing the right to use the title Queen of the Flat Tops, and I believe he told me for $20,000,\u201d was so directly contradicted by the written memorandum as to justify the court in rejecting it. The finding that respondents were ready, willing and able to perform the oral agreement but appellant refused to perform unless respondents agreed to the \u201ccovenant of nonsuit,\u201d that this covenant was contrary to the oral agreement, and that appellant repudiated and refused to perform the oral agreement, is amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\">No other point is presented for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Shinn, Acting P. J., and Wood, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
