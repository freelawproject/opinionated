Defendant was served with summons on July 3, 1976, and the return of service was filed by plaintiffs almost two weeks later, on July 23. On the motion of defendant, the trial court dismissed the action pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>to Code of Civil Procedure section 581a, based upon the failure of plaintiffs to serve and return summons on the complaint within three years from the commencement of the action. Plaintiffs appeal from the order of dismissal. Concluding that defendant\u2019s absence from the State of California alone did not toll the running of the limitation period contained in section 581a and that plaintiffs did not establish an exception to the operation of the section, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Section 581a requires summons on the complaint be served and return made within three years after the commencement of an action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As used in the section, an action is deemed commenced upon the initial filing of a complaint <em>(Perati </em>v. <em>Atkinson </em>(1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 251, 253-254 [40 Cal.Rptr. 835].)  \u201cSection 581a, Code of Civil Procedure, is part of a statutory scheme, the purpose of which is to compel reasonable diligence in the prosecution of an action after it has been commenced [citations] and \u2018expedite litigation and require it to be brought to conclusion within reasonable time limits.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(McKenzie </em>v. <em>City of Thousand Oaks </em>(1973) 36 Cal.App.3d 426, 429-430 [111 Cal.Rptr. 584].)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Under section 581a, the period in which plaintiffs had to complete service and return summons expired on March 27, 1976, three years after the complaint was filed. The filing of the return of summons on July 23, 1976, occurred nearly four months after this expiration date. Unless the section\u2019s limitations period was tolled or an exception to the section\u2019s operation established, the trial court was under a mandatory duty to dismiss the action. <em>(Busching </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 44, 50 [115 Cal.Rptr. 241, 524 P.2d 369]; <em>Gonsalves </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 169, 172 [105 P.2d 118].)  Under such circumstances, a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing facts which would suspend the effect of section 581a. <em>(Watson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 53, 58 [100 Cal.Rptr. 684].) In this regard, the facts in support of plaintiffs\u2019 contentions on appeal are taken from affidavits attached to their opposition to defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. No reporter\u2019s transcript of the proceedings below was requested by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\n<em>Tolling of the Three-year Limitations Period Under Section 581a, Subdivision (d).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits contain statements which disclose that defendant, though a resident of this state at the time of the accident, moved to Nevada and Idaho and was absent from California throughout the three-year period following the filing of the action. Based solely on defendant\u2019s absence from the state, plaintiffs argue that the limitations period was tolled, pursuant to section 581a, subdivision (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Section 581a contains a tolling provision in subdivision (d) which provides: \u201cThe time during which the defendant was not amenable to the process of the court shall not be included in computing the time period specified in this section.\u201d Subdivision (d) was added in 1970 (Stats. 1970, ch. 582, \u00a7 1, p. 1158.) Prior to 1970, section 581a provided that \u201c. . . no dismissal shall be had under this section as to any defendant because of the failure to serve summons on him during his absence from the state, . . .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The above portion of section 581a was deleted when subdivision (d) was added.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Apparently, under the former version of section 581a, defendant\u2019s absence from California would have tolled the running of the limitation period. (See <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Bray </em>(1968) 262 Cal.App.2d 357, 361 [68 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>649]; <em>Bank of America </em>v. <em>Biren </em>(1957) 156 Cal.App.2d 368, 370 [319 P.2d. 704].) However, in order to sustain plaintiffs\u2019 contention under the present version of section 581a, it would be necessary to construe \u201cnot amenable to process\u201d as being coextensive with \u201cabsence from the state.\u201d Such an interpretation would not only ignore the changes made in the section, but would also contravene the plain meaning of the section as it now stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Pursuant to the 1970 amendments to section 581a the operative factor in determining whether the limitation period is tolled was changed from \u201cabsence from the state\u201d to \u201cnot amenable to process.\u201d  \u201cIt is a settled principle of statutory construction that a material change in the phraseology of a legislative enactment is ordinarily viewed as showing an intention on the part of the Legislature to change the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>(Farmers Ins. Exch. </em>v. <em>Geyer </em>(1967) 247 Cal.App.2d 625, 634 [55 Cal.Rptr. 861].)  The Legislature by enacting subdivision (d) broadened the scope of section 581a to include defendants who, though absent from the state, are nonetheless amenable to process. Thus, under subdivision (d), the limitation period will be tolled only if the defendant is <em>not amenable to process, </em>irrespective of whether he is absent from the state. This is the plain meaning of the statute and should be followed. <em>(Great Lakes Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of El Segundo </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 152, 155 [137 Cal.Rptr. 154, 561 P.2d 244].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\"><em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Cranston </em>v. <em>Bonelli </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 129 [92 Cal.Rptr. 828], cited by plaintiffs is therefore distinguishable. The <em>Bonelli </em>court reversed an order dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The trial court had ordered the dismissal on the basis that, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s absence from California, the section 581a limitation period ran because he was amenable to process. However, in reversing, the <em>Bonelli </em>court found that section 581a as it stood <em>prior </em>to 1970 was controlling. The court refused to imply a right of dismissal based on amenability to process under the former version of section 581a. The court, in explaining its reasoning, indicated that it was influenced by the burden on the plaintiff that a different holding would entail. The court stated at page 135: \u201cThere are many reasons why such an implication should not be read into the statutes at bench, particularly since when the complaint herein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>was dismissed the Legislature had not yet made operative the comparatively simple methods of serving out-of-state residents which, as hereinafter set forth, it provided in 1969 enactments. Such judicial \u2018legislation\u2019 would require a plaintiff having a cause of action against a person who has left the state to keep a constant watch on the absentee\u2019s whereabouts and on the process service laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which the defendant ultimately locates, so that the plaintiff could ascertain whether the defendant was \u2018amenable\u2019 to suit in this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">However, the <em>Bonelli </em>court expressly limited its decision to the law as it stood in 1969, prior to the dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s action, when it noted that \u201c[i]n 1970, by amending section 581a to extend to defendants absent from the state but amenable to service, the three-year limitation of that section, the Legislature recognized for the first time that such right to dismissal had not theretofore existed. . . . [T]he Legislature in 1969 adopted chapter 4 of title 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure (\u00a7 413.10 et seq.), operative July 1, 1970, providing reasonable methods and proof of out of state service. (Stats. 1969, ch. 1610, \u00a7 3.)\u201d <em>(Id., </em>atpp. 135-136.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Code of Civil Procedure section 415.40 provided plaintiffs herein with one means of obtaining service of summons upon defendant. This method was ultimately used by plaintiffs when defendant was served on July 3, 1976. Further, defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss discloses that she possessed a California driver\u2019s license at the time of the accident. Pursuant to Vehicle Code section 17460, defendant was deemed to have consented to receive service of process \u201cat any place where he may be found and whether or not he is then a resident of this state, with the same force and effect as if served within the state in any action brought in the courts of this state upon a cause of action arising in this state out of his operation of a motor vehicle anywhere within this state.\u201d The manner of serving process could have been accomplished pursuant to Vehicle Code section 17461.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Clearly, defendant was amenable to process as it is used in section 581a. (Cf. <em>Hughes &amp; Ladd, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rogue River Paving Co. </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 311, 313-314 [119 Cal.Rptr. 925].)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\n<em>Implied and Statutory Exceptions to Section 581a</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Although section 581a contains mandatory language requiring dismissal of an action, the section is subject to self-contained statutory and implied exceptions. One exception provided for in the statute is where the parties have filed a stipulation in writing that time may be extended. <em>(Highlands Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gurries </em>(1969) 276 Cal.App.2d 694 [81 Cal.Rptr. 273].) The other statutory exception applies where a general appearance has been made within three years following commencement of the action. <em>(Busching </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 12 </em>Cal.3d 44, 52-53.) Implied exceptions to section 581a have been recognized where there is estoppel <em>(Tresway Aero, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 431 [96 Cal.Rptr. 571, 487 P.2d 1211]) or where it is impossible, impracticable or futile to proceed within the statutory period <em>(Wyoming Pacific Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Preston </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 736, 740-741 [329 P.2d 489]; <em>Hunot </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 660, 664, fn. 3 [127 Cal.Rptr. 703]).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Section 581a as amended by subdivision (d) demands greater diligence from a plaintiff than that required under its former version. However, the recognized exceptions to the section provide a plaintiff sufficient protection against an evasive out-of-state defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">In the instant case, plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits set forth no facts establishing an exception to the operation of section 581a. Contrary to plaintiff\u2019s assertions, the record discloses that the failure to effectuate timely service was by the neglect and lack of diligence on the part of plaintiffs. Plaintiffs attempted service upon defendant on the date the complaint was filed, March 27, 1973. Their affidavits reveal no other efforts to effectuate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>service until more than three years later. It was almost a month after the expiration date under the section that plaintiffs again endeavored to serve defendant. On April 21, 1976, plaintiffs secured the services of an investigator. On May 24, 1976, another investigator was retained and within a month thereafter the second investigator discovered defendant\u2019s whereabouts. Notwithstanding, plaintiffs waited until July 3 to serve defendant and delayed the filing of the return until July 23. Responsibility for the failure to comply with the requirements of section 581a rests solely with plaintiffs. (Lack of diligence found in the following cases: <em>Ippolito </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 682, 687-688 [136 Cal.Rptr. 795]; <em>Schering Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 737, 743 [125 Cal.Rptr. 337]; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.3d 53, 59; <em>Bernstein </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 2 Cal.App.3d 700, 704-705 [82 Cal.Rptr. 775]; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Herzer </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 747, 752 [76 Cal.Rptr. 77]; and <em>Chilcote </em>v. <em>Pacific Air Transport </em>(1937) 24 Cal.App.2d 32, 36 [74 P.2d 300].)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits indicate that defendant may have had knowledge of the complaint. However, no showing of actual prejudice is required under section 581a. An action may be properly dismissed notwithstanding defendant\u2019s knowledge of its pendency. <em>(Elling Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 89, 98 [123 Cal.Rptr. 734]; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 746 [59 Cal.Rptr. 768].)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Under the facts of the case at bar, the trial court had no discretion but to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Kaus, P.

But all such actions may be prosecuted, if general appearance has been made by the defendant or defendants, within said three years in the same manner as if summons had been issued and served; provided that, except in actions to partition or to recover possession of, or to enforce a lien upon, or to determine conflicting claims to, real or personal property, no dismissal shall be had under this section as to any defendant because of the failure to serve summons on him during his absence from the state, or while he has secreted himself within the state to prevent the service of summons on him.</p>\n<p id=\"AI7\">\u201cAll actions, heretofore or hereafter commenced [3] shall be dismissed by the court in which the same may be pending, on its own motion, or on the motion of any party interested therein, if summons has been served, and no answer has been filed, if plaintiff fails, or has failed, to have judgment entered within three years after service of summons, where the parties have filed a in that the time be extended.</p>\n<p id=\"AC_\">\u201cA motion to dismiss pursuant to the provisions of this section shall not, nor shall any extension of time to plead after such motion, constitute a general appearance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The only reported case interpreting subdivision (d) came from this court in <em>Polony </em>v. <em>White </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 44 [117 Cal.Rptr. 341], In <em>Polony, </em>we stated that subdivision (d) should be given effect according to its clear language: \u201cWe find no basis for concluding that the 1970 amendment does not mean precisely what it says\u2014that the period of time that a defendant is not amenable to the process of the court is not included in computing the periods of time specified in the section.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 48.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b464-6\">As amended in 1971 (Stats. 1971, ch. 622, \u00a7 3), Vehicle Code section 17461 reads as follows: \u201cIn the event summons is served outside of this state, pursuant to Sections 17459 and 17460, it may be served and proof of service shall be made, in the manner provided by Sections 17454, 17455, and 17456 for service of summons upon a nonresident, or it may be served pursuant to Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 413.10) of Title 5 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ApK\">Section 17454 permits service on the director of motor vehicles as appointed representative to receive summons for defendant. In <em>Polony </em>v. <em>White, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.3d 44, we held that a defendant who dies and for whom no personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>representative is appointed is not amenable to process under section 581a, subdivision (d). Accordingly, we ruled that the three-year period specified in the section was tolled from the date of defendant\u2019s death until an administrator for his estate was appointed. In the instant case, pursuant to Vehicle Code section 17454, and in contrast to <em>Polony, </em>defendant had whom service could have been rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"AdZ\"><em>Wurnitsch </em>v. <em>Nordvik </em>(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 679, 688 [92 Cal.Rptr. 518], wherein the court held that \u201cthe provisions of sections 17460 and 17463 of the Vehicle Code do not expressly or impliedly modify the provisions for tolling found in section 583 of the Code of Civil Procedure,\u201d is distinguishable on the basis that section 583 as relevant to the case contained an \u201cabsent from the State\u201d tolling provision. (See fn. 1, p. 681.) A 1970 amendment to section 583 deleted the words \u201cabsent from the State\u201d and substituted in their place the words, \u201cnot amenable to the process of the court.\u201d (Stats. 1970, ch. 582, \u00a7 2, p. 1159.)
