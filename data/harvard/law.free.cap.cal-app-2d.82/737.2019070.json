Hotel and Lorusso demurred to Union\u2019s complaint on the ground that the state court was without jurisdiction to hear the suit. The trial court sustained the demurrer and afforded Union an opportunity to amend. However, Union chose to stand on its complaint. As a consequence, the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>was dismissed and judgment was entered in favor of Hotel and Lorusso. Union now appeals from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Early in 1977, a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) supervised election was scheduled for April of that year for the purpose of enabling employees of Hotel to choose an exclusive bargaining agent. Union participated in the preelection campaign, hoping to gather sufficient votes to become the employees\u2019 agent. Also, as part of that campaign, Hotel circulated a \u201cStaff Memo,\u201d signed by Lorusso, which stated: \u201cIn the next [few] weeks before the election we will be giving you \u2018Facts\u2019 about Hotel and Restaurants Employees Local 681, and why you don\u2019t need that union here. [\u00b6] Over the years I have felt, and I feel even more strongly now, that the Hotel Union has nothing to offer our people. Both myself and our Hotel feel this way not because we are \u2018against Unions\u2019 but\u2014as \u2018The Facts\u2019 will tell you\u2014Because We Are Pro-Employee. Those \u2018Facts,\u2019 taken from the Union\u2019s own records\u2014will show: . . . What the Union\u2019s connections with organized crime and other \u2018underworld\u2019 elements are...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">On April 11, Union lodged a complaint with the NLRB, charging Hotel with unfair labor practices within the meaning of section 8, subdivision (a) of the National Labor Relations Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the basis for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>charge, Union claimed that \u201c. . . the employer distributed the attached bulletin falsely alleging the Union to be connected with organized crime and the underworld.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The Regional Director of NLRB responded to Union\u2019s charge with a letter stating that an investigation of the charge had been made and \u201c[a]s a result of the investigation, it does not appear that further proceedings on the [charge] are warranted.... [T]he investigation revealed ... that the Employer\u2019s preelection campaign newsletter alleged as unlawful is protected expression, within the meaning of Section 8(c)[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] of the Act. <em>Shopping Kart Food Market, </em>228 NLRB No. 190.1 am, therefore refusing to issue a complaint in these matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">On the same day that Union filed the charge noted, April 11, it also filed suit for defamation against Hotel and Lorusso in the Orange County Superior Court. In its complaint, Union alleged that the statement inferring its connection with organized crime and underworld elements was false, and that Hotel and Lorusso made the statement either knowing it to be false or with reckless disregard for its truth or falsity. Union further alleged that, in publishing the statement, Hotel and Lorusso acted deliberately and with intent to harm it in its efforts to organize the employees. Union then stated, \u201cAs a direct and proximate result of the said misconduct . . . [Union] has been injured in its business and occupation as a collective bargaining agent for employees within the hotel and restaurant industry, has been exposed to hatred, contempt, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>ridicule and has caused [Union] to be shunned and avoided by the employees of [Hotel] so as to create damage to the plaintiff in organizing the said employees and in conducting an election campaign for an election to be held on April 29, 1977 by the National Labor Relations Board [Union] is thereby entitled to general damages.\u201d For these alleged wrongs, Union prayed for punitive damages in the sum of $ 1 million plus costs and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">On April 29, the election was held. Union was not chosen as the employees\u2019 bargaining agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">In May, Hotel and Lorusso filed a demurrer to Union\u2019s complaint, claiming that the state court was without jurisdiction to hear the suit \u201cin that the matters there alleged lie within the exclusive and primary jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board.\u201d The trial court sustained the demurrer, and, as stated above, offered Union an opportunity to amend its complaint. Union declined to amend, and the trial court then dismissed the complaint and entered judgment in favor of Hotel and Lorusso. Union appeals from the judgment. We conclude that the position urged by Union is correct, we, therefore, reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Issue, Discussion and Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">We are presented with one question: whether a state court may hear a defamation action based on particular speech which the NLRB has declared to be \u201cprotected expression within the meaning of section 8(c)\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the National Labor Relations Act (the act), and which, the plaintiff has alleged, exposed it to hatred, contempt and ridicule in the hotel and restaurant industry. Responding to this question first calls for an analysis of the extent to which the jurisdiction of the NLRB over labor relations preempts possible state jurisdiction. The thorough and skillful analysis of this issue by counsel for both parties prompts a review of the development of the law of federal preemption in the field of labor relations, and a description of the present state of that law. This review and description will be accomplished in the first part of the opinion. We will then determine the applicability of the law of preemption to the particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>facts of the case before us. We will conclude by discussing the impact if any on this case of the NLRB\u2019s decision in the <em>Shopping Kart </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Basically, when Congress grants to a federal agency the exclusive power to occupy a specific field of regulation, the law of preemption provides that state regulation of that field is strictly forbidden. Thus, if Congress intended to permit the NLRB, <em>alone, </em>to govern labor relations, state courts could not entertain suits which attempt to penalize conduct within that area. Just where the line is to be drawn in labor-management relations regulations between exclusive federal jurisdiction and federal/ state concurrent jurisdiction has long troubled the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Early cases suggested that states could apply their own common law, but could not apply state rules specifically enacted to regulate labor regulations. <em>(Motor Coach Employees </em>v. <em>Lockridge, </em>403 U.S. 274, 290 [29 L.Ed.2d 473, 484-485, 91 S.Ct. 1909].) Other early decisions allowed the states to interject themselves into labor relations where they could provide a remedy not available under federal law. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 291 [29 L.Ed.2d at p. 485].) Still others allowed state intervention so long as state court decisions were not inconsistent with federal labor law. <em>(Id.) </em>All these approaches were eventually rejected by the court. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">A workable rule finally began to emerge beginning with the 1953 decision in <em>San Diego Unions </em>v. <em>Garmon, </em>359 U.S. 236 [3 L.Ed.2d 775, 79 S.Ct. 773]. There, the union had peacefully picketed the employer and attempted to persuade the employer\u2019s customers to boycott the company as part of the effort to force the employer\u2019s acceptance of a \u201cclosed shop\u201d agreement. In the action that followed, the California Supreme Court upheld a damage award against the union. Both parties conceded that the union\u2019s conduct constituted an unfair labor practice under section 8, subdivision (b) of the act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>When the case reached the United States Supreme Court, it began its opinion by discussing the extent of federal preemption of the labor area:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>\u201c \u2018[T]he Labor Management Relations [<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] \u201cleaves much to the states, though Congress has refrained from telling us how much.\u201d . . . The penumbral area can be rendered progressively clear only by the course of litigation.\u2019 [Citation.] . . . [\u00b6] In determining the extent to which state regulations must yield to subordinating federal authority, we have been concerned with delimiting areas of potential conflict; potential conflict of rules of law, of remedy, and of administration.\u201d <em>(San Diego Unions </em>v. <em>Garmon, supra, </em>359 U.S. 236, 240, 241-242 [3 L.Ed.2d 775, 780-781].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The court then formulated the following general rule: \u201cWhen it is clear or may fairly be assumed that the activities which a State purports to regulate are protected by \u00a7 7 of the National Labor Relations Act,[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>constitute an unfair labor practice under \u00a7 8, due regard for the federal enactment requires that state jurisdiction must yield. To leave the States free to regulate conduct so plainly within the central aim of federal regulation involves too great a danger of conflict between power asserted by Congress and requirements imposed by state law.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 244 [3 L.Ed.2d at p. 782].)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">However, the court recognized two exceptions to this general rule: it would \u201cnot [withdraw] from the States [the] power to regulate [1] where the activity regulated was a merely peripheral concern of the Labor Management Relations Act[,]\u201d and (2) \u201cwhere the regulated conduct touched interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that, in the absence of compelling congressional direction, we could not infer that Congress had deprived the States of the power to act.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 243-244 [3 L.Ed.2d at p. 782].) The court concluded that the peaceful picketing and economic pressure which formed the basis of the suit did not fit within either of the categories excepted. Therefore, under the general rule formulated, it held that the state court could not exercise jurisdiction in the case before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Following <em>Garmon, </em>the Supreme Court handed down its decision in <em>Linn </em>v. <em>Plant Guard Workers, </em>383 U.S. 53 [15 L.Ed.2d 582, 86 S.Ct. 657]. During a campaign to organize employees, the union circulated a leaflet alleging that the employer\u2019s general managers lied to employees. The company had also lodged an unfair labor practice complaint with the NLRB. The board, however, rejected the company\u2019s request for relief because it found that the leaflet had not been distributed by the union or its agents. Linn, a general manager, then filed suit against the union in federal court seeking damages for defamation. The United States District Court dismissed the action stating as its ground, under <em>Garmon, </em>that the NLRB had exclusive jurisdiction because the activity was arguably an unfair labor practice. The circuit court of appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The Supreme Court began its analysis of the case by noting that \u201c[l]abor disputes are ordinarily heated affairs . . . representation campaigns are frequently characterized by bitter and extreme charges . . . vituperations, personal accusations, misrepresentations and distortions.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 58 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 587].) It further noted that federal labor policy favored free debate on issues dividing labor and management, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>that the NLRB had a legitimate interest in uniform regulation of labor relations. On the other hand, the court recognized the states\u2019 interest in protecting its citizens from <em>defamatory </em>attacks. The court stated that its determination of the extent to which the jurisdiction of the NLRB superseded that of state courts in defamation actions represented an accommodation of these conflicting interests. That accommodation was contained in the following rule. \u201c[W]here either party to a labor dispute circulates false and defamatory statements during a union organizing campaign, the court does have jurisdiction to apply state remedies if the complainant pleads and proves that the statements were made with malice[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] and injured <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Linn </em>v. <em>Plant Guard Workers, supra, </em>383 U.S. 53, 55 [15 L.Ed.2d 582, 586].)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">This \u201cdeparture from [the] well-established rule\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 72 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 595]) announced in <em>Garmon </em>was justified on several grounds: First, statements uttered with malice are not entitled to the protection of section 7 of the act, which allows employees to form, join, or assist labor organizations and to bargain collectively and engage in concerted activity, and to refrain from any of the above activities. Because section 7 does not protect the utterance of malicious defamation, state regulation of such defamation is \u201ca \u2018merely peripheral concern of the Labor Management Relations Act[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Linn </em>v. <em>Plant Guard Workers, supra, </em>383 U.S. 53, 61 [15 L.Ed.2d 582, 589].) As stated above, <em>Garmon </em>specifically held that state regulation of matters which peripherally concerned the act constituted an exception to the general rule and was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Second, the opinion declared that the state has \u201can overriding . . . interest\u201d in protecting its citizens from malicious libel, and this interest \u201cis \u2018so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility\u2019 that it fits within the exception specifically carved out by Garmon.\u201d <em>(Linn </em>v. <em>Plant Guard Workers, supra, </em>383 U.S. 53, 62 [15 L.Ed.2d 582, 589].)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Third, it continued, \u201c \u2018[t]o the extent . . . that Congress has not prescribed procedure for dealing with the consequences of tortious conduct already committed, there is no ground for concluding that existing criminal penalties or liabilities for tortious conduct have been eliminated. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>atpp. 61-62 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 589].)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Fourth, \u201c[wjhile the Board might find that an employer or union violated \u00a7 8 [outlawing unfair labor practices] by deliberately making false statements, <em>or </em>that the issuance of malicious statements during an organizing campaign had such a profound effect on the election as to require that it be set aside, it looks only to the coercive or misleading nature of the statements rather than their defamatory quality. The injury that the statement might cause to an individual\u2019s reputation . . . has no relevance to the Board\u2019s function. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 63 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 590]; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Fifth, \u201c[t]he Board can award no damages, impose no penalty, or give any other relief to the defamed individual. [H] On the contrary, state remedies have been designed to compensate the victim and enable him to vindicate his reputation. The Board\u2019s lack of concern with the \u2018personal\u2019 injury caused by malicious libel, together with its inability to provide redress to the maligned party, vitiates the ordinary arguments for pre-emption.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 63-64 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 590].) \u201cThe fact that the Board has no authority to grant effective relief aggravates the State\u2019s concern since the refusal to redress an otherwise actionable wrong creates disrespect for the law and encourages the victim to take matters into his own hands. The function of libel suits in preventing violence has long been recognized.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 64, fn. 6 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 590].)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Sixth, \u201c \u2018damages for personal injuries may be assessed without regard to the merits of the labor controversy . . . .\u2019 [\u00b6] Judicial condemnation of the alleged attack [on plaintiff\u2019s character] would reflect no judgment upon the objectives of the union. It would not interfere with the Board\u2019s jurisdiction over the merits of the labor controversy.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 64 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 591].)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\"><em>Linn </em>was followed in 1974 by <em>Letter Carriers </em>v. <em>Austin, supra, </em>418 U.S. 264. During the Letter Carriers\u2019 organizational drive, a list of postal workers who refused to join the union was published in the union\u2019s newsletter, along with a description of these individuals as \u201cscabs,\u201d \u201ctwo-legged animal[s] with . . . corkscrew soul[s], . . . water brainfs], . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>combination backbonefs] of jelly and glue\u201d and other noncomplimentary terms. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 268 [41 L.Ed.2d at p. 752].) A libel action in state court followed. A demurrer was interposed to the complaint on the ground that the suit sought regulation of speech that was protected by the First Amendment and federal labor law. However, the trial court overruled the demurrer, relying on <em>Linn. </em>An award of damages was returned by the jury and affirmed by the state\u2019s supreme court. The United States Supreme Court, after it heard the case, reaffirmed much of its earlier analysis in <em>Linn </em>and concluded, although the state courts had jurisdiction to proceed in defamation actions, that in this particular action the language did not constitute libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The last decision, <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>Carpenters, </em>430 U.S. 290 [51 L.Ed.2d 338, 97 S.Ct. 1056], was handed down in March 1977. There, a union member sued the union in the Los Angeles Superior Court for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The member alleged that the union discriminated against him in making referrals for employment because of his unpopular views and that it had thereby breached its. collective bargaining agreement with him. He further claimed that the union \u201cengaged in outrageous conduct, threats, and intimidation, and had thereby caused him to suffer grievous emotional distress . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 293 [51 L.Ed.2d at p. 345].)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">A demurrer was filed by the union in which it claimed that the suit was preempted by the NLRB\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction. The trial court sustained the demurrer as to the discrimination and breach of the collective bargaining contract causes of action, but denied it as to the emotional distress allegation. The case went to trial on that issue, and both general and punitive damages were awarded by the jury on that theory. The Court of Appeal reversed, stating that the \u201ccrux\u201d of the action was conduct which was <em>arguably </em>subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the NLRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The United States Supreme Court accepted the case, and after hearing it, began its unanimous opinion by discussing the exceptions to the <em>Garmon </em>rule which had developed over the years by means of both congressional action<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and court decision. As to the latter salient, state actions involving mass picketing and threats of violence, wrongful expulsion from union membership, and \u201cmalicious libel\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 297 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>[51 L.Ed.2d at p. 348]) came to be permitted because they concerned the act only peripherally and were deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility. The court stated that these exceptions \u201chighlight our responsibility ... to determine the scope of the general rule by examining the state interests in regulating the conduct in question and the potential for interference with the federal regulatory scheme.\u201d <em>(Farmer </em>v. <em>Carpenters, supra, </em>430 U.S. 290, 297 [51 L.Ed.2d 338, 348].) \u201c[Inflexible application of the <em>[Garmon] </em>doctrine is to be avoided, especially where the State has a substantial interest in regulation of the conduct at issue and the State\u2019s interest is one that does not threaten undue interference with the federal regulatory scheme.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 302 [51 L.Ed.2d at p. 351].)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In applying some of the factors present in the <em>Linn </em>case to the case before it, the court stated that the act did not protect the \u201coutrageous conduct\u201d which was the subject of the suit. \u201c[Tjhere is no federal protection for conduct on the part of union officers which is so outrageous . . . .\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The court recognized the state\u2019s interest in keeping its people free from emotional distress as analogous to its interest in regulating defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">From this progression of decisions, it is clear that there is a willingness to subordinate the <em>Garmon </em>rule of preemptive NLRB jurisdiction where other more pressing state interests are present. Whether or not the rule is to be bypassed in a particular situation \u201cmust depend upon the nature of the particular interests being asserted and the effect upon the administration of national labor policies of concurrent judicial and administrative remedies.\u201d <em>(Vaca </em>v. <em>Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 180 [17 L.Ed.2d 842, 852, 87 S.Ct. 903].) Therefore, in deciding whether or not to subordinate the <em>Garmon </em>rule in this instance requires our review of the interests at stake and of the effect of such subordination on national labor policies.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>(Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Carpenters, </em>436 U.S. 180 [56 L.Ed.2d 209, 98 S.Ct. 1745].)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">As to the first point, <em>Linn </em>recognizes that the NLRB has an interest in maintaining a uniform labor policy and in promoting the free exchange <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>of ideas during an election. The state, however, has a cognizable interest in protecting its citizens from malicious defamation. The court in <em>Linn </em>labeled this latter interest \u201coverriding\u201d and \u201c \u2018so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility\u2019 that it fits within the exception specifically carved out by Garmon.\u201d <em>(Linn </em>v. <em>Plant Guard Workers, supra, </em>383 U.S. 53, 62 [15 L.Ed.2d 582, 589].) Thus, according to <em>Linn, </em>the state interest in this area of activity outweighs competing federal interests. We must now decide if the state interest in protecting individual citizens from malicious defamation applies with equal force to defamatory-type statements directed at a labor union.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">We turn then to an application of the foregoing principles and inquiries to the facts before us. Hotel and Lorusso assert that the Union\u2019s interest in remaining free from malicious defamation is \u201cnot and never [has] been held to be cognizable under state law . . . .\u201d They add that unlike an individual, a union and an employer have the resources and forum available to defend themselves against such defamation,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that <em>Linn </em>applies only to individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">As to the first point, the California Supreme court has concluded that \u201c[t]he social and economic realities of the present-day organization of society has . . . led [courts] to recognize the suability of unions. [Fn. omitted.] . . . If, however, we hold that these organizations are thus subject to suit but that they cannot sue, we create a gross anomaly. We cannot arbitrarily split so obvious an equation. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d <em>(Daniels </em>v. <em>Sanitarium Assn., Inc., </em>59 Cal.2d 602, 607-608, 610 [30 Cal.Rptr. 828, 381 P.2d 652].) Thus, the court ruled that a labor union, as an entity, could sue another for defamation. This pronouncement by our Supreme Court clearly indicates that the Union\u2019s interest in remaining free from defamation is indeed cognizable. The nature of the Union\u2019s interest can be analogized to that of a corporation which has an interest in preserving its good business reputation. Accordingly, \u201clanguage which casts aspersions upon its business character is actionable.\u201d <em>(Di Giorgio Fruit Corp. </em>v. <em>AFL-CIO, </em>215 Cal.App.2d 560, 571 [30 Cal.Rptr. 350].) We therefore can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>find no basis for the proposition that the Union\u2019s interest in remaining free of malicious libel is not protected by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Next, Hotel and Lorusso claim that resources to combat defamation are readily available to unions and employers, but not to individuals. They fail to tell us what those resources are, or how effective they may be; however, we note that <em>Linn </em>has been applied without hesitation to allow suits by corporations for activities occurring during union organizational campaigns. <em>(Farah Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Amalgamated Clothing Wkrs., etc., supra, </em>483 S.W.2d 271; <em>Mooi Roofing Company </em>v. <em>De Young, supra, </em>156 N.W.2d 617; <em>R. H. Bouligny, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers of Amer., supra, </em>154 S.E.2d 344.) In light of this, it would be unfair to deny a union the same privilege. Surely, Hotel and Lorusso cannot argue that a union somehow has resources to defend itself which an employer does not have.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The final contention, that <em>Linn </em>does not apply to unions and employers but only to individuals, is also without merit. An identical contention was made in <em>Mooi Roofing Company </em>v. <em>De Young, supra, </em>156 N.W.2d 617. Therein, the Michigan court concluded: \u201cTo restrict the <em>Linn </em>decision in such a manner would result in an incongruity\u2014a State court could entertain a defamation suit arising out of a labor dispute where a natural person is maliciously injured, but not where an employer or union is defamed.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 620.) Indeed, the language found in <em>Linn </em>indicates that it was intended to apply to unions, employers, and employees alike. The court stated: \u201cWe conclude that where <em>either party </em>to a labor dispute circulates false and defamatory statements during a union organizing campaign, the court does have jurisdiction to apply state remedies if the complainant pleads and proves that the statements were made with malice and injured him.\u201d <em>(Linn </em>v. <em>Plant Guard Workers, supra, </em>383 U.S. 53, 55 [15 L.Ed.2d 582, 586]; italics added.) The court also discussed and dismissed the possibility that <em>\u201cemployers and unions </em>[would] spurn appropriate administrative sanctions\u201d if state suits were available. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 66 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 592]; italics added.) It is apparent that the court wished to make <em>Linn </em>equally applicable to suits brought by unions, employers and individuals. Hotel and Lorusso have presented us with no persuasive reason to draw distinctions between the three.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Having determined that the state interests in permitting suits are sufficiently strong, we must examine the effect that subordination of the <em>Garmon </em>rule in this instance would have on national labor policy. Hotel and Lorusso argue that permitting a state suit in this instance would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>interfere with uniform federal labor policy and would stifle the free flow of debate which that policy seeks to promote.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The consistency of federal labor policy may well not be as important as Hotel and Lorusso believe it is. \u201c[T]he . . . fact that Congress and this Court have deferred to the States in these areas indicates a subordination of the interest in uniformity to the interests of the States. . . . [T]he interest in uniformity is subordinated to the larger interests that persons injured . . . have preserved to them whatever remedies state law may authorize. . . . [T]he \u2018rule\u2019 of uniformity that the Court invokes today is at best a tattered one, and at worst little more than a myth.\u201d <em>(Motor Coach Employees </em>v. <em>Lockridge, supra, </em>403 U.S. 274, 317-318 [29 L.Ed.2d 473, 500-501], White, J. dis.)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Hotel and Lorusso first claim that, in its complaint, Union \u201crequests the court below to assess the effect of [the] pre-election conduct upon the election.\u201d They further assert that \u201cthe nature of [Union\u2019s] injury [is] the effect that pre-election conduct had upon its reputation among the employee-electorate,\u201d and that the complaint \u201cseeks damages, or the \u2018value\u2019 of its injury, equal to the \u2018value\u2019 of the loss of the election.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Because of the nature of Union\u2019s claims, Hotel and Lorusso argue that the substance of their complaint cannot be decided without regard to the merits of underlying labor controversy, \u201can impermissible inquiry.\u201d However, close scrutinization of the complaint reveals that the Union claims to have been injured \u201cin its business and occupation as a collective bargaining agent for employees within the <em>hotel and restaurant industry. </em>\u201d (Italics added.) Union also claims further injury in that it has \u201cbeen exposed to hatred, contempt, and ridicule <em>and </em>[the defamation] has caused the plaintiff to be shunned and avoided by the employees of the [Hotel].\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">The first two of these claims are totally unrelated to the labor dispute between Union and the Hotel employees. The initial claims state that Union\u2019s reputation in the general business community has been injured and that Union has been exposed to hatred, etc., before <em>all </em>observers, and not merely workers at Hotel. Because we are obliged to give liberal construction to the Union\u2019s pleadings, we cannot ignore these allegations of injury which are unrelated to the labor dispute between the Union and Hotel.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Additionally, the complainant could not possibly have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>seeking damages for \u201cthe \u2018value\u2019 of the loss of the election,\u201d as Hotel and Lorusso claim it did. The complaint was filed on April 11 and the Union did not lose the election until April 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Contrary to the position urged by Hotel, <em>Linn </em>established, in its review, that the NLRB \u201clooks only to the coercive or misleading nature of the statements rather than their defamatory quality. The injury that the statements might cause to . . . reputation . . . has no relevance to the Board\u2019s function. . . . \u2018[D]amages for personal injuries may be assessed without regard to the merits of the labor controversy. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Linn </em>v. <em>Plant Guard Workers, supra, </em>383 U.S. 53, 63-64 [15 L.Ed.2d 582, 590-591].) We see no reason, nor have Hotel and Lorusso given us one, not to apply the court\u2019s analysis of the issue as stated in <em>Linn </em>to a defamation action brought by the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Next, Hotel and Lorusso contend, because the NLRB has already decided that the so-called libelous speech is protected under the act, that the state court in the interests of uniformity may not hear a case involving such speech. However, both the fact that the conduct is or may be covered by the act and the NLRB\u2019s declaration that it is do not displace state jurisdiction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In <em>Farmer </em>and <em>Linn, </em>the court while anticipating NLRB review in the form of an unfair-labor-practices complaint, was not deterred from concluding that the state court could, in each case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>entertain an action for the tortious conduct committed. As a consequence, in the case now before us, we view the NLRB\u2019s decision not to take jurisdiction because the alleged defamatory statement is protected speech under section 8, subdivision (c) to be the equivalent of assuming, as the court has done in numerous cases, that the conduct there at issue was either protected by section 7 of the act or prohibited by section 8. In all of those cases, the court proceeded to allow state court actions where the interest in permitting such actions so required, this despite the fact that the conduct was also otherwise cognizable under the act. The only significance we can see in the NLRB\u2019s decision as noted is to foreclose further proceedings to have the election set aside by the NLRB, or to be \u201cmade whole\u201d by the NLRB because an unfair labor practice had been committed. This in no way precludes a state court action, which as <em>Linn </em>pointed out has an entirely different focus than does a proceeding before the NLRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Finally, Hotel and Lorusso argue, if state courts are permitted to hear such suits, that \u201c50 different standards of propriety during an organizational campaign\u201d would be created, and thus uniformity would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>suffer. However, in such instances, \u201cthe Court has required that, in the interests of uniform development of the law, state courts must apply federal law.\u201d <em>Motor Coach Employees </em>v. <em>Lockridge, supra, </em>403 U.S. 274, 314 [29 L.Ed.2d 473, 499].) Accordingly, California had adopted the rule, enunciated in <em>Linn, </em>that the plaintiff, in order to make out a case for relief, in any action for defamation arising out of a labor dispute, must prove that the statement was made with malice and injured him. <em>(Gregory </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>17 Cal.3d 596, 600 [131 Cal.Rptr. 641, 552 P.2d 425]; <em>Emde </em>v. <em>San Joaquin County etc. Council, </em>23 Cal.2d 146, 154 [143 P.2d 20, 150 A.L.R. 916].) Thus, the danger of a standard of propriety different from that established in <em>Linn, </em>is nonexistent if suit is brought in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We must also determine if allowing a suit in state court would interfere with the free exchange of ideas which federal labor policy seeks to promote. This question has been sufficiently answered by the court in <em>Linn. </em>Therein, the court emphasized that application of the \u201cmalicious defamation with resulting injury\u201d requirement represented an accommodation of the free exchange of ideas and the prevention of defamation. We can find no better way to accommodate these conflicting interests. As in the \u201cyelling \u2018fire\u2019 in a crowded theatre\u201d approach to First Amendment rights, free speech in the context of labor relations cannot go unbridled if it confronts an equally important interest militating against it. Therefore, we conclude that allowing state court actions for defamation will not impermissibly interfere with the free exchange of ideas in the labor relations arena.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Our examination of the interests at stake in allowing a state court action and the effect such a suit would have on federal labor policy compels us to conclude that the union should be allowed to bring suit for defamation. An excellent statement of our position herein is contained in <em>Mooi Roofing Company </em>v. <em>De Young, supra, </em>156 N.W.2d 617: \u201c \u2018Since the board is unconcerned with the defamatory character of the statement, a judicial determination that the statements were libelous in character would have no effect upon the board\u2019s jurisdiction over the merits of the labor dispute itself. Thus the injury caused ... by a defamatory statement is merely incidental to the board\u2019s inquiry and the application of state remedies would be a \u201cmerely peripheral concern of the labor management relations act.\u201d [1f] [T]he states\u2019 concern with redressing malicious libel is \u201cso deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility \u2018that an overriding state interest\u2019 . . . should be recognized.\u201d [Fn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>omitted.] The traditional justification for libel actions, namely the tendency of libel or slander to cause a breach of the peace, is closely related to the breach of the peace line of cases recognized in <em>Garmon. </em>The Supreme Court itself has recognized maintenance of the peace as one of the purposes of civil actions for libel. Moreover, the state is traditionally concerned with providing a peaceful forum to which [those] whose reputations have been damaged . . . can bring their claims. Balanced against such meaningful State interests, the use of the known lie as a tool has so little social utility that it should be afforded the minimum protection consistent with national labor policy.\u2019 [Fn. omitted.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 622.) We believe that the six factors justifying the <em>Linn </em>decision apply with equal force where a defamation suit is brought by a union. Therefore, such a suit must be permitted.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">We turn finally to the impact of the NLRB\u2019s decision in the <em>Shopping Kart Food Market, supra, </em>94 LRRM 1705, case on this case. We begin with <em>Shopping Kart\u2019s </em>predecessor, <em>Hollywood Ceramics Co., </em>51 LRRM 1600, also an NLRB decision. In the latter case, the employer distributed a handbill to employees the day before the election which contained substantial misrepresentations. The NLRB concluded that the election should be set aside \u201c \u2018only where there [had] been a misrepresentation or other similar campaign trickery, which involves a <em>substantial </em>departure from the truth, at a time which prevents the other party or parties from making an <em>effective reply, </em>so that the misrepresentation, whether deliberate or not [fn. omitted], may reasonably be expected to have a <em>significant impact </em>on the election.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1601; italics added.) The crux of the NLRB\u2019s decision was that such misrepresentations interfered with the employees\u2019 free choice; therefore, the election was set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">In April 1977, the NLRB decided the <em>Shopping Kart Food Market </em>case. The company vice-president, on the eve of the election, had misrepresented to employees the amount of profit the company made. The NLRB stated, \u201c[W]e decide today that the Board will no longer probe into the truth or falsity of the parties\u2019 campaign statements. Accordingly, we hereby overrule Hollywood Ceramics.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1705.) The NLRB stated that use of the <em>Hollywood Ceramics </em>rule had resulted in \u201cextensive analysis of campaign propaganda, restriction of free speech, variance in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>application as between the Board and the courts, increasing litigation, and a resulting decrease in the finality of election results.\u201d <em>{Shopping Kart Food Market, supra, </em>94 LRRM 1705, 1706.) This resulted from the fact that \u201c \u2018[determinations regarding the <em>substantiality </em>and <em>materiality </em>of particular misrepresentations are necessarily highly subjective. It would be difficult for any tribunnal [sic] ... to reach uniform and consistent results in the application of such standards. The <em>timing </em>test. . . may raise vexatious issues of fact regarding what is required for an \u201ceffective\u201d opportunity for reply.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1706.) It is precisely because the NLRB must, whenever an election is challenged, apply each of these \u201cvague and flexible standards\u201d before it may set aside an election and because a court could then pass upon the NLRB\u2019s determination in each case that confusion and lack of uniformity resulted. Court review of the NLRB\u2019s decisions was primarily responsible for inconsistent decisions and long delays.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The NLRB further stated that <em>Hollywood Ceramics Co., supra, </em>51 LRRM 1600, was based on the NLRB\u2019s unwillingness \u201cto leave the voters \u2018to sort out, with no protection from us, from among a barrage of flagrant deceptive misrepresentations,\u2019 \u201d and on its \u201cassumption that misleading campaign propaganda will interfere with employees\u2019 freedom of choice. Implicit in such an assumption is a view of employees as naive . . . whose decision ... is easily altered by the self-serving campaign claims of the parties.\u201d <em>(Shopping Kart Food Market, supra, </em>94 LRRM 1705, 1707.) However, the NLRB found that workers were no longer naive and should be allowed to assess precampaign statements for themselves. It concluded that \u201cwe will no longer set elections aside on the basis of misleading campaign statements.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1708.)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Hotel and Lorusso now claim, even if <em>Linn </em>permits the exercise of state court jurisdiction over this case, that \u201cthe major policy shift of the NLRB announced in <em>Shopping Kart </em>has expanded the scope of absolutely protected pre-election speech to such a degree that the preemption exception of <em>Linn </em>cannot apply to a cause of action by a union for libel . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, they forget that <em>Shopping Kart </em>merely held, <em>for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number><em>purposes of affirming or rejecting election results, </em>that the NLRB would not look into the truth or falsity of the subject statements. The confusion and lack of uniformity inherent in the former approach necessitated the holding in <em>Shopping Kart. </em>In fact, the case did not at all deal with the issue of preemption, nor did it declare that the NLRB may not review the truth or falsity of a campaign statement when an unfair labor practice charge is brought based on the statement. Clearly, the focus of <em>Linn, </em>malicious injury to reputation, is far removed from the focus of <em>Shopping Kart, </em>the employees\u2019 ability to exercise free choice in an election.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Hotel and Lorusso add that in <em>Linn </em>the court commented, \u201c[I]f experience shows that a greater curtailment, even a total one, should be necessary [on defamation suits] . . . the Court will be free to reconsider today\u2019s holding.\u201d <em>(Linn </em>v. <em>Plant Guard Workers, supra, </em>383 U.S. 53, 67 [15 L.Ed.2d 582, 592].) They argue that this paved the way for what they allege is <em>Shopping Kart\u2019s </em>\u201ccurtailment\u201d of defamation suits. However, we note that the United States Supreme Court said that <em>it, </em>and <em>not the NLRB, </em>may limit such suits when necessary. Despite the position urged upon us, the United States Supreme Court remains the final authority on the meaning and construction of the act <em>(R. H. Bouligny, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers ofAmer., supra, </em>154 S.E.2d 344, 357), and as recently as May 15, 1978 reiterated its support of <em>Linn. </em>(See <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Carpenters, supra, </em>436 U.S. 180.) Additionally, as we stated above, we can see no inconsistency between <em>Linn </em>and <em>Shopping Kart </em>because the two cases dealt with the distinctly different issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Finally, Hotel and Lorusso argue that the high court has expanded the freedom of parties involved in elections to engage in \u201cuninhibited, robust, and wide-open debates,\u201d citing <em>Letter Carriers </em>v. <em>Austin, supra, </em>418 U.S. 264. Therein, as we have noted, the union newsletter had printed several uncomplimentary comments about nonunion postal workers. The court reiterated the holding in <em>Linn </em>that if the plaintiff alleged malicious defamation and injury to himself, he could maintain his action. The court went on to find, based on past <em>Supreme Court </em>decisions, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>comments were, as a matter of law, not defamatory. The court\u2019s recognition of the importance of \u201cuninhibited, robust and wide-open debate\u201d in <em>Austin </em>was, by no means, new. Indeed, it was recognized in <em>Linn </em>as one of the factors to be balanced against the state\u2019s interest in penalizing defamation. The end result of this balancing process was, of course, the rule requiring the plaintiff to allege malicious defamation and injury to himself. We can carry <em>Austin </em>no further than this, and particularly we cannot agree with Hotel and Lorusso that <em>Austin </em>alters the effect of <em>Linn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The judgment is reversed, with directions to the trial court to afford defendants, Anaheim Operating, Inc. and Pete Lorusso, an opportunity to answer Union\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Tamura, Acting P.

This position is simply a restatement of the general rule enunciated in <em>Garmon. </em>However, <em>Linn, </em>which was decided after <em>Weber, </em>carved out an exception to the <em>Garmon </em>rule for malicious defamation lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"A6q\">During oral argument, Hotel and Lorusso cited <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Carpenters, supra, </em>436 U.S. 180, as further questioning this assertion. In <em>Sears, </em>the union peacefully picketed one of Sears\u2019 stores, on store property. Sears brought an action to enjoin the trespass. On the basis of <em>Garmon\u2019s </em>exception for \u201cconduct which touches interests \u2018so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility,\u2019 \u201d the lower court deemed that jurisdiction properly rested with the state, and granted the injunction. The California Supreme Court reversed, finding that the picketing was arguably protected by section 7 of the act, thus, the state could not assume jurisdiction. The United States Supreme Court reversed the California Supreme Court, stating that, although the conduct was both arguably protected by section 7 and prohibited by section 8, the same factors which we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>have discussed in the text of this opinion militated against foreclosure of state jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"AP_\">The only reference made in <em>Sears </em>to a situation in which review by the NLRB precedes a state court action was the following dicta: \u201cThe primaiy jurisdiction rationale justifies preemption only in situations in which an aggrieved party has a reasonable opportunity ... to invoke the Board\u2019s jurisdiction . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 201 [56 L.Ed.2d at p. 228].) We assume that it is this passage which Hotel and Lorusso believe countermands all that we have previously said. However, a careful reading of <em>Sears </em>demonstrates otherwise. Therein, the court explained that the theory of primary jurisdiction \u201cis used to refer to the various considerations articulated in <em>Garmon </em>. . . that militate in favor of pre-empting state court jurisdiction . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 199, fn. 29 [56 L.Ed.2d at p. 226].) <em>Garmon, </em>like <em>Sears, </em>spoke of conduct which is protected by section 7 or prohibited by section 8, subdivisions (a) and (b). In the case now before us, the NLRB declared that Hotel\u2019s commentary was \u201cprotected . . . within the meaning of Section 8(c). . . .\u201d That section grants no substantive rights, as does section 7, nor does it prohibit certain types of conduct, as does section 8, subdivisions (a) and (b). Rather, it merely states that certain expression shall not be deemed an unfair labor practice. We view the NLRB\u2019s use of the word \u201cprotected\u201d in connection with section 8, subdivision (c) to be most unfortunate, for the section protects absolutely nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"A_Hd\">The primary jurisdiction theory relates solely to conduct which is protected by section 7 or prohibited by section 8, subdivisions (a) and (b), and has no application to conduct within the meaning of section 8, subdivision (c). For conduct which is neither protected by section 7 nor prohibited by section 8, subdivisions (a) and (b), the test is whether Congress intended that conduct be regulated <em>exclusively </em>by the federal government. <em>(Machinists </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Comm\u2019n, 427 </em>U.S. 132, 146 [49 L.Ed.2d 396, 406-407, 96 S.Ct. 2548].) The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Linn, </em>which was cited with approval in <em>Sears, </em>indicates the court\u2019s belief that Congress did not intend to exclusively occupy the field of defamatory conduct. Thus, there is nothing in <em>Sears </em>that can be construed as prohibiting state jurisdiction over the Union\u2019s suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\">A suit for defamation may be brought on the ground that damage has been done to an entity\u2019s business reputation. <em>(De Giorgio Fruit Corp. </em>v. <em>AFL-CIO, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.2d 560, 571.)

Relying on cases other than <em>Hollywood Ceramics, </em>the court also stated that the NLRB would not tolerate <em>malicious </em>defamation. The malicious defamation test was imposed because of this and because it was necessary to accommodate the conflicting interests of federal labor policy and the state\u2019s interest in permitting defamation suits. However, in no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>wise can it be asserted that the holding in <em>Linn </em>is substantially or even notably dependent on the distinction formerly made by the NLRB between ordinary defamation and malicious defamation.

Defendants did not challenge the sufficiency of these allegations by a demurrer on the ground no cause of action was stated or by special demurrers for uncertainty or ambiguity.
