The record reveals that defendant was driving south on Alameda Street in Los Angeles and made a left-hand turn at 134th Street. At the time the turn was made defendant\u2019s car was in low gear; the proper signal was given; no violations of the motor vehicle laws were committed. At the same time, \u201cAn automobile of a third person, Mrs. Anderson, was in the intersection of 134th Street prior to making a left turn into a gas station at the northwest corner of 134th Street, and was between plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s ears\u201d; Mrs Anderson\u2019s car was traveling north on Alameda. The car in which plaintiff was a passenger was driven by Mrs. Laseter and was also traveling north on Alameda. The defendant\u2019s car and Mrs. Laseter\u2019s car collided at the intersection. Defendant was traveling 5 or 7 miles per hour; Mrs. Laseter about 25 miles per hour. At the time defendant made the turn, Mrs. Laseter\u2019s car was 175 or 180 feet from the intersection. The accident occurred about 8 a. m. Plaintiff suffered a broken rib.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">Appellant\u2019s contention on appeal that, \u201cThe judgment is against the law\u201d and \u201cis not supported by the evidence,\u201d is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">It is also contended that the trial court erred in \u201cexcluding defendant\u2019s admission that the accident occurred through his fault.\u201d The alleged error refers to the exclusion of defendant\u2019s statement, said to have been made to plaintiff at the scene of the accident, namely, \u201cI have insurance, I am covered.\u201d In the light of the many decisions on the subject of insurance in connection with actions for damages, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ruling was proper. The instructions on the subject about which appellant complains, were not misleading in the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The only evidence of the collision consisted of the testimony of plaintiff and defendant; Mrs. Laseter did not testify. The question of fact for the jury\u2019s determination was not complicated and the verdict is supported by the evidence as a matter of law. The record presents no prejudicial errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">York, P. J., and White, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
