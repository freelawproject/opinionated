J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVX\">The question presented by this appeal is whether an employee\u2019s civil action against his employer and fellow employees for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>intentional infliction of emotional distress is barred by the exclusive remedy provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Lab. Code \u00a7 3200 et seq.). We hold that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Plaintiff filed a complaint in the court below alleging that he is an investigator for the Orange County Department of Social Services and that defendants, his employer and fellow employees, treated plaintiff in a rude and degrading manner, placed him under surveillance, subjected him to lengthy interrogations, and discriminated against plaintiff because of his Mexican-American descent, \u201cwith the object and intent to force or cause plaintiff to suffer humiliation, mental anguish and emotional and physical distress, and to cause plaintiff to resign his position of employment or to be fired or dismissed therefrom.\u201d Plaintiff requested compensatory and punitive damages for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, damages for a violation of the California Fair Employment Practices Act, and an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Defendants demurred to the complaint on several grounds, but the court sustained the demurrer on the single ground that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board had exclusive jurisdiction to provide a remedy for the wrongs alleged in the complaint. On plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the ensuing judgment of dismissal, the only issue presented is whether the demurrer was properly sustained on that ground. Since a demurrer admits all well-pleaded allegations, plaintiff\u2019s allegations are deemed true for purposes of this appeal. <em>(Alcorn </em>v. <em>Anbro Engineering, Inc., </em>2 Cal.3d 493, 496 [86 Cal.Rptr. 88, 468 P.2d 216].)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Labor Code section 3600 provides that where certain \u201cconditions of compensation\u201d occur an employer is liable for workers\u2019 compensation for any injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of the employment, and that this liability is \u201cin lieu of any other liability whatsoever to any person. . . .\u201d Labor Code section 3601 provides that the right to recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits is \u201cthe exclusive remedy for injury or death of an employee against the employer or against any other employee of the employer acting within the scope of his employment. . . .\u201d Labor Code section 5300 declares that proceedings to recover workers\u2019 compensation shall be instituted before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board and not elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">As background to the discussion which follows, we will review cases which have discussed an employee\u2019s remedies for intentional physical assaults by an employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>The first California case to deal with this issue was <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Globin, </em>105 Cal.App.2d 495 [233 P.2d 612]. There an employee appealed from a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer on the ground that the employee\u2019s action was subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Industrial Accident Commission, predecessor of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board. The complaint sought compensatory and punitive damages for a wilful and unprovoked attack on plaintiff by his employer, during which two of plaintiff\u2019s teeth were broken. The Third District Court of Appeal concluded that an employee intentionally assaulted by his employer could maintain a civil action for damages because such an intentional assault was not a \u201crisk or condition incident to employment.\u201d To hold otherwise, the court observed, \u201cwould be not only to sanction indirectly conduct of the employer which is both tortious and criminal, but also would be to permit the employer to use the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act to shield him from his larger civil liability, which liability would exist independent of the common law defenses to personal injury actions by employees which prevailed prior to the advent of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d <em>(Conway </em>v. <em>Globin, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.2d 495, 498.)</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Fifteen years later, in <em>Azevedo </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Commission, </em>243 Cal.App.2d 370 [52 Cal.Rptr. 283] (hereafter <em>Azevedo 1), </em>the Third District Court of Appeal overruled its decision in <em>Conway. </em>In <em>Azevedo I </em>an employee who had been assaulted by her employer commenced both a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding and a civil action against the employer. The Industrial Accident Commission dismissed the employee\u2019s application, relying on <em>Conway. </em>The court in <em>Azevedo I </em>concluded that the Industrial Accident Commission did have jurisdiction to award compensation to an employee for injuries intentionally inflicted by an employer which were fairly traceable to an incident of employment and not attributable to a personal grievance. <em>(Azevedo </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Commission, supra, </em>243 Cal.App.2d 370, 376-377.)</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The court noted that the workers\u2019 compensation laws were to be liberally construed to extend their benefits to injured employees, that the Constitution in article XX, section 21, speaks of a \u201ccomplete system\u201d of compensation \u201cirrespective of the fault of any party,\u201d and that there are penalty provisions in Labor Code section 4553 for \u201cserious and wilful misconduct\u201d by an employer. Having determined that the Industrial Accident Commission did have jurisdiction of the employee\u2019s application for benefits, the court left open the question whether the commission\u2019s jurisdiction was exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>The question left open in <em>Azevedo I </em>was decided in <em>Azevedo </em>v. <em>Abel, </em>264 Cal.App.2d 451 [70 Cal.Rptr. 710] (hereafter <em>Azevedo II). </em>After the decision in <em>Azevedo I, </em>the petitioner, Mrs. Azevedo, was awarded temporary and permanent disability benefits, medical expenses, and further medical treatment. Her employer moved to dismiss the civil action pending against him on the ground that the commission\u2019s jurisdiction was exclusive. The motion was granted and the employee appealed. On the appeal, the employee contended that for an employer\u2019s intentional torts there existed \u201c. . . a concurrent pair of liabilities and concurrent jurisdiction on the part of the two tribunals in this limited class of cases, the ultimate damage award to be diminished by the compensation award.\u201d <em>(Azevedo </em>v. <em>Abel, supra, </em>264 Cal.App.2d 451, 458.) The court rejected the contention, stating that Labor Code section 3600 clearly provided that the compensation remedy was exclusive. \u201cA damage suit as an alternative or additional source of compensation, becomes permissible only by carving a judicial exception in an uncarved statute.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 459.) The court also noted that the exclusive remedy provision was a reasonable policy choice made by the Legislature: \u201cThe policy choice is to provide employees economic insurance against disability in exchange for the speculative possibility of general damages; to offer the augmented award for serious and willful misconduct in trade for the relatively rare award of punitive damage.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 459-460, fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The most recent case to consider this issue in depth is the First District Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in <em>Magliulo </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>47 Cal.App.3d 760 [121 Cal.Rptr. 621]. There the court concluded that an employee intentionally injured by an employer had the cumulative or at least alternative remedies of a civil suit for damages or an application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The court began its analysis by noting the recent Supreme Court decision in <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board, </em>6 Cal.3d 719 [100 Cal.Rptr. 301, 493 P.2d 1165], which held that the constitutional provision establishing a system of compensation \u201c \u2018 irrespective of the fault of any party\u2019. . . was intended only to give the Legislature power to grant benefits unhampered by common law tort concepts of negligence; it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>has never been construed as prohibiting the Legislature from increasing, decreasing or even eliminating awards based upon the <em>wilful wrongdoing </em>of a party.\u201d (6 Cal.3d at p. 728.) <em>(Magliulo </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.3d 760, 768.) The court concluded: \u201cIt may therefore be proper to say that the provisions of section 3601 . . . should be read in the light of section 3600 which refers to \u2018without regard to negligence,\u2019 and that in the absence of a controlling statute the courts are free to determine whether the employer loses his immunity from civil suit in the event he personally intentionally inflicts an injury on the person of his employee.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 769.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The court further observed that Labor Code section 3601 permits an employee injured by the physical aggression of a fellow employee to pursue concurrent remedies. The court stated: \u201cIf the employee can recover both compensation and damages caused by an intentional assault by a fellow worker, he should have no less right because the fellow worker happens to be his boss.\u201d <em>(Magliulo </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 47 </em>Cal.App.3d 760, 773.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Finally, with regard to the penalty provisions of Labor Code section 4553, the court declared that the phrase \u201cserious and wilful misconduct\u201d had been construed as embracing a degree of fault greater than ordinary negligence but less than intentional wrongdoing. In view of this fact, and also because the penalty was only for compensation and did not constitute exemplary damages, the court concluded there were no grounds for supposing that the Legislature intended section 4553 to be a complete substitute for damages recoverable in a civil action for intentional tort.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The issue on this appeal, as we view it, is the narrow one of an employee\u2019s remedies for intentional infliction of emotional distress. We do not address the broader question, discussed in the two <em>Azevedo </em>decisions and <em>Magliulo, </em>of an employee\u2019s remedies for intentional injuries as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">The <em>Conway, Azevedo </em>and <em>Magliulo </em>cases all involved physical aggression\u2014assaults and batteries. Although at least three appellate decisions have permitted an employee to maintain a civil action for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>emotional distress intentionally inflicted by an employer and fellow employees, the issue of workers\u2019 compensation as an exclusive remedy was apparently not raised in any of them. <em>(Alcorn </em>v. <em>Anbro Engineering, Inc., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 493; <em>Agarwal </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>81 Cal.App.3d 513 [146 Cal.Rptr. 521]; <em>Toney </em>v. <em>State, </em>54 Cal.App.3d 779 [126 Cal.Rptr. 869].) The exclusive remedy issue as applied to the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, therefore, would appear to be one of first impression.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">In a law review note criticizing the holding in <em>Azevedo II </em>that workers\u2019 compensation is the exclusive remedy for an employee intentionally injured by an employer, the author made the following comment, which is of relevance to the issue before us: \u201c[T]here is a situation in which the denial of the right to sue in tort could work a hardship upon an employee. It is well settled that, to be compensable, an injury must be disabling. But what if the employer commits a work-related intentional tort that is not disabling? The workman cannot collect workmen\u2019s compensation benefits and because that is his exclusive remedy, he cannot maintain a tort action. Thus, if an employer slanders an employee, does not batter him seriously enough to cause a disabling injury, or defames him in front of his co-workers, then that employee\u2014given that the tort is work-connected\u2014has no remedy.\u201d (Note, <em>Azevedo </em>v. <em>Abel: Denial of Employee\u2019s Right to Sue His Employer For an Intentional Tort </em>(1970) 21 Hastings L.J. 683, 695-696.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Defendants maintain that damages for emotional distress are recoverable in a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding, and therefore workers\u2019 compensation should be the exclusive remedy. An examination of the cases relied upon by defendants, however, reveals that they do not stand for the cited proposition. We are aware of no decisional or statutory authority for the proposition that mental suffering, <em>as such, </em>is a compensable injury. The cases cited by defendants allow compensation for physical injuries, such as a disabling heart condition, caused by the mental and emotional strains of employment (e.g., <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., </em>18 Cal.App.3d 852 [96 Cal.Rptr. 279]), or disabling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>mental illness caused by job pressures (e.g., <em>Burnight </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Commission, </em>181 Cal.App.2d 816 [5 Cal.Rptr. 786]).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">In a civil action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, recovery may be given for mental suffering alone, without consequent physical injuries, in cases involving extreme and outrageous intentional invasions of one\u2019s mental and emotional tranquility. <em>(Alcorn </em>v. <em>Anbro Engineering, Inc., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 493, 498; <em>State Rubbish Collectors etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>Siliznoff, </em>38 Cal.2d 330, 337-338 [240 P.2d 282].) In the case at bench, plaintiff has not alleged that the mental distress caused any accompanying physical or mental illness, or that it resulted in any employment disability. Plaintiff apparently has suffered damages which would be recoverable in a civil action but which are not compensable in a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding. (See 2 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1973) Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 159, p. 985.)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The existence of a noncompensable injury does not, by itself, abrogate the exclusive remedy provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>50 Cal.App.3d 116 [123 Cal.Rptr. 812], an employee who suffered injury to his genital organs, groin and thighs while operating a spraying machine in the course of his employment brought a civil action against his employer which was dismissed on the ground that workers\u2019 compensation was the employee\u2019s exclusive remedy. On appeal, the employee argued that the action should be permitted because loss of sexual functioning could not be compensated in a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding. The court replied: \u201cPlaintiff is correct in arguing that the statutory emphasis on occupational disability as a rating factor denigrates the compensability of nonoccupational handicaps. Decisions in other states hold that the workers\u2019 compensation law provides the exclusive remedy for industrial injury even though the resulting disability\u2014for example, sexual impotence\u2014is noncompensable. (See cases cited, 2 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 65.20.) No California decision in point has been cited. The theory underlying the out-of-state decisions is that the workers\u2019 compensation plan imposes reciprocal concessions upon employer and employee alike, withdrawing from each certain rights and defenses available at common law; the employer assumes liability without fault, receiving relief from some elements of damage available at common law; the employee gains relatively unconditional protection for impairment of his earning capacity, surrendering his common law right to elements of damage unrelated to earning capacity; the work-connected injury engenders a single remedy against the employer, exclusively cognizable by the compensation agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>and not divisible into separate elements of damage available from separate tribunals; a failure of the compensation law to include some element of damage recoverable at common law is a legislative and not a judicial problem. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.3d 116, 122.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">The case at bench is distinguishable from <em>Williams </em>in two respects. We have here not an isolated instance of a physical injury which is noncompensable, but an entire class of civil wrongs outside the contemplation of the workers\u2019 compensation system. (See generally, Larson, <em>Nonphysical Torts and Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>(1975) 12 Cal.Western L. Rev. 1.) Moreover, this class of civil wrongs involves intentional injury. Intentional wrongdoing in an employment setting has provided many difficult issues for resolution by the courts of this state, as illustrated by the <em>Conway-Azevedo-Magliulo </em>line of cases discussed above. (See also, <em>Unruh </em>v. <em>Truck Insurance Exchange, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d 616, 629-630; <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d 719.) The resulting decisions have evidenced continuing concern that the essentially \u201cno-fault\u201d workers\u2019 compensation system would not provide a sufficient deterrent to intentional wrongdoing. In <em>Azevedo II, </em>the court noted with satisfaction that the penalty provided by Labor Code section 4553 for an employer\u2019s serious and wilful misconduct was not subject to insurance coverage but must be paid from the employer\u2019s own pocket. <em>(Azevedo </em>v. <em>Abel, supra, </em>264 Cal.App.2d 451, 456-458.) However, the penalty takes the form of a 50 percent surcharge. Where there is no compensable injury, 50 percent of nothing is still nothing, and Labor Code section 4553 cannot function as a deterrent.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">While it is possible to believe that the Legislature intended that employees lose their right to compensation for certain forms of negligently or accidentally inflicted physical injuries in exchange for a system of workers\u2019 compensation featuring liability without fault, compulsory insurance, and prompt medical care, it is much more difficult to believe that the Legislature intended the employee to surrender all right to any form of compensation for mental suffering caused by extreme and outrageous misconduct by an employer. It would indeed be ironic if the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, created to benefit employees, were to be interpreted to shield the employer from all liability for such conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We decline to interpret it in this fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>We conclude that an employee\u2019s cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress constitutes an implied exception to the exclusive remedy provisions of Labor Code section 3601. We note that our conclusion is in accord with that of a distinguished commentator, who states: \u201cIf the essence of the tort, in law, is non-physical, and if the injuries are of the usual non-physical sort, with physical injuries being at most added to the list of injuries as a makeweight, the suit should not be barred. But if the essence of the action is recoveiy for physical injury or death, the action should be barred even if it can be cast in the form of a normally non-physical tort.\u201d (2A Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 68.34, pp. 13-31, 13-32.)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The judgment is reversed with directions to vacate the order sustaining the demurrer and enter a new order overruling the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Tamura, J., and McDaniel, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Although our Supreme Court has never addressed the issue of whether workers\u2019 compensation benefits are the exclusive remedy for injuries intentionally inflicted by an employer, it cited <em>Azevedo II </em>with approval in <em>Unruh </em>v. <em>Truck Insurance Exchange, 1 </em>Cal.3d 616, 629-630 [102 Cal.Rptr. 815, 498 P.2d 1063], and again in <em>Busick </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board, </em>7 Cal.3d 967, 976, footnote 11 [104 Cal.Rptr. 42, 500 P.2d 1386].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b690-8\">In <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>E. &amp; J.
