J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axc\">Thomas E. McGue appeals from a judgment denying petition for writ of mandamus. If issued, the writ would have directed respondent Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles (hereinafter DMV) to set aside its decision suspending appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license for a period of six months pursuant to Vehicle Code section 13353. That section creates an implied consent to a chemical test\u2014blood, breath or urine\u2014on the part of a driver suspected of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">Officer Philip Koyl of the Novato Police Department saw appellant driving southbound on Highway 101 at approximately 40 miles per hour. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>Appellant was weaving between lanes, having crossed between lanes four times in approximately one-half mile. He was also weaving within his own lane. When the officer stopped appellant, he noticed a moderate odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from his person. Appellant\u2019s eyes were bloodshot, his speech was slurred, and his balance unsteady. The officer administered some roadside sobriety tests, which appellant failed. The officer then placed appellant under arrest for violation of Vehicle Code section 23102, subdivision (a) (driving a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol). Appellant was advised of the nature of the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">In the police car, while still at the scene of the crime, the officer read appellant the standard implied consent admonition<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to Vehicle Code section 13353. Appellant stated that he did not understand the warning. At the Marin County Civic Center, the officer advised appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and again read the implied consent warning to him. Appellant indicated that he understood the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, but did not understand the implied consent admonition. He stated that he wanted to see an attorney. The officer read from the same preprinted form a third time, at which time appellant stated that he still did not understand and wanted to see an attorney before taking any test. The officer then explained briefly in his own words that a failure to take any of the three chemical tests would result in an automatic suspension of his driver\u2019s license for a period of six months. At that point appellant stated, \u201cLet them take my license.\u201d A second officer explained the section to appellant, and appellant read the printed admonition form himself. He nevertheless insisted on seeing an attorney before submitting to any chemical tests. Appellant never submitted to a chemical test.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">\n<em>A Driver\u2019s License Is Not a Fundamental Right</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred by applying the substantial evidence test in reviewing the decision of the DMV to suspend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>his driver\u2019s license. Appellant relies upon cases which hold that, if the order of a legislatively created administrative agency (see <em>James </em>v. <em>Dept. of Motor Vehicles </em>(1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 750, 752 [73 Cal.Rptr. 452]) substantially affects a fundamental vested right, the trial court, in determining under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, whether there has been an abuse of discretion because the findings are not supported by the evidence, must exercise its independent judgment on the evidence and find an abuse of discretion if the findings are not supported by the weight of the evidence. <em>(Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143, 144 [93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 481 P.2d 242]; see <em>Strumsky </em>v. <em>San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 28, 34 [112 Cal.Rptr. 805, 520 P.2d 29].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He argues that a driver\u2019s license is both a vested and a fundamental right, and that a six-month suspension thereof constitutes substantial interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The courts must decide on a case-by-case basis whether an administrative decision substantially affects a fundamental vested right. If an administrative decision affects such a right, then a full and independent <em>judicial </em>review of that decision is indicated because \u201c[t]he abrogation of the right is too important to the individual to relegate it to exclusive administrative extinction.\u201d <em>(Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d at p. 144.)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">We may assume that appellant\u2019s asserted right to drive is vested. (See <em>James </em>v. <em>Dept. of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>267 Cal.App.2d at p. 752.) However, there is no merit in his contention that such right is fundamental.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">\u201cIn determining whether the right is fundamental the courts do not alone weigh the economic aspect of it, but the effect of it in human terms and the importance of it to the individual in the life situation.\u201d <em>(Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 144.) Furthermore, in analyzing the fundamental nature of the right asserted, the courts manifest \u201cslighter sensitivity to the preservation of purely economic privileges,\u201d and have permitted the legislative and executive branches of government to deal with economic and social problems with less judicial interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The immediate purpose of Vehicle Code section 13353 is to obtain the best evidence of blood-alcohol content at the time of the arrest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>person believed to be driving while intoxicated. <em>(Goodman </em>v. <em>Orr </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 845, 852 [97 Cal.Rptr. 226].) \u201cThe long-range purpose of Section 13353 is to inhibit intoxicated persons from driving on the highways [citations] and thus reduce the carnage and slaughter on California freeways and byways caused by drunk drivers [citations] which \u2018now reaches the astounding figures only heard of on the battlefield\u2019 [citations].\u201d <em>(Anderson </em>v. <em>Cozens </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 130, 143-144 [131 Cal.Rptr. 256]; see also <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Orr, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">In weighing the relative importance to individuals in the life situation, we are of the opinion that the public\u2019s interest in strict enforcement of traffic laws designed to eliminate drunken driving far outweighs the right of an individual to drive. (Cf. <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 293, 305 [130 Cal.Rptr. 814].) Enforcement of this rule does not effectively deny an individual transportation, not even by private automobile. At most, it puts an economic burden on him by requiring that he use other means of transportation. The resulting expense and inconvenience are not sufficient to raise the right to drive to the stature of a fundamental right.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Appellant, however, reasons that, as a driver\u2019s license is a necessary prerequisite for operation of a private automobile, loss or suspension thereof constitutes a substantial interference with the fundamental constitutional right of an individual to travel. (See <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Dulles </em>(1958) 357 U.S. 116, 125-126 [2 L.Ed.2d 1204, 1210, 78 S.Ct. 1113]; <em>Aptheker v. Secretary of State </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 500, 505-506 [12 L.Ed.2d 992, 996-998, 84 S.Ct. 1659] [right to international travel]; <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 618, 630 [22 L.Ed.2d 600, 612-613, 89 S.Ct. 1322] [right to interstate travel].) But, as appellant concedes, the right to travel cases concern themselves solely with the right of an individual to reach a given destination; they do not establish a constitutional right to travel by a particular mode of transportation. As previously noted, suspension of a driver\u2019s license does not prevent an individual from travelling wherever and whenever he chooses. It merely limits his options as to his mode of transportation. Thus the right of an individual to operate a private automobile cannot be equated with the fundamental constitutional right of an individual to travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the trial court properly applied the substantial evidence test in reviewing the decision of the DMV to suspend appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">\n<em>The Decision of the DMV Is Supported by Substantial Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Appellant maintains that he was confused by the juxtaposition of the implied consent warning (no right to refuse a test, or to have an attorney present prior to or during administration of test) with the <em>Miranda </em>admonition (right to refuse interrogation and to have an attorney present at all stages of police interrogation). He therefore contends that his refusal to submit to a chemical test until he had consulted an attorney was not a refusal within the meaning of Vehicle Code section 13353.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">California courts have excused refusals to take a chemical test on the ground of officer-induced confusion resulting from the juxtaposition of the two warnings and the officer\u2019s failure to clarify and explain the difference. <em>(Rust </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1968) 267 Cal.App.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>545, 547 [73 Cal.Rptr. 366].) The question of officer-induced confusion is one of fact. <em>(McDonnell </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 653, 658 [119 Cal.Rptr. 804].) When a driver who has been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights manifests confusion by asserting his alleged right to an attorney, it is incumbent upon the officer to explain that the right does not apply to the decision that he must make concerning the three chemical tests. <em>(Id.) </em>However, mere insistence on an attorney because the driver wants to consult one about which test to take does not establish officer-induced confusion. Neither does being too drunk to understand the proffered information or explanation. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 658-659.) \u201cIn determining whether an arrestee\u2019s refusal is the result of confusion, the crucial factor is not the state of the arrestee\u2019s mind; it is the fair meaning to be given his response to the demand that he submit to the chemical test.\u201d <em>(Cahall </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 491, 497 [94 Cal.Rptr. 182].) \u201cThere is no requirement \u2018that a refusal of the test be \u201cintelligent\u201d in order to trigger the sanction of suspension of the driver\u2019s license.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Goodman </em>v. <em>Orr, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.3d 845, 857, quoting <em>Maxsted </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 982, 987 [92 Cal.Rptr. 579].)  A review of the administrative record in the instant case reveals substantial evidence to support the decision of the DMV that appellant refused to submit to a chemical test within the meaning of section 13353.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights only once. There was no embellishment or overly broad phrasing of <em>Miranda </em>which rendered it irreconcilable with the implied consent admonition. (Cf. <em>Rust </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>267 Cal.App.2d at p. 546 [officer advised driver that he had a right to an attorney \u201cbeginning at that moment\u201d]; <em>Plumb </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 256, 258 [81 Cal.Rptr. 639] [officer said driver \u201c \u2018had a right to counsel . . . present at all stages of the proceedings\u2019 \u201d].) Appellant manifested confusion by insisting upon an attorney. However, there was no evidence that any police action or statement contributed to whatever confusion may have existed in appellant\u2019s mind. He was advised on three separate occasions that he did not have the right to talk to an attorney or to have an attorney present before stating whether he would submit to a test, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>before deciding which test to take, or during the administration of the test; In addition, two officers explained the implied consent admonition in their own words, and allowed appellant to read it for himself. (See <em>McDonnell </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.3d at p. 659.)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Rattigan, J., and Christian, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 20, 1978.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-7\">\"You are required by state law to submit to a chemical test to determine the alcoholic content of your blood.
