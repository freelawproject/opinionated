J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4m\">Allied Fidelity Insurance Company appeals from an order denying its motion to vacate the forfeiture of a bail bond posted to secure the release from custody of Wayne Sallman in criminal proceedings pending against him. The order is appealable. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wilcox </em>(1960) 53 Cal.2d 651, 655 [2 Cal.Rptr. 754, 349 P.2d 522].)</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The undertaking of the corporate bail bond was that the defendant would appear on the date set for arraignment and would at all times hold himself amenable to the orders and process of the court, and \u201cif convicted, will appear for pronouncement of judgment or grant of probation; ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">On January 26, 1977, probation and sentence proceedings were conducted in Sallman\u2019s case. He had pled guilty pursuant to a plea bargain, and a probation report had been received which recommended against probation. Counsel for Sallman requested a two-weeks\u2019 continuance to inquire into the work furlough program. When this was denied with the suggestion that a subsequent application could be made, Sallman\u2019s counsel indicated that there was no legal cause not to pronounce sentence or grant probation. The court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">\u201cIn the matter of Wayne Sallman, proceedings are suspended and the defendant is placed on probation for a period of four years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">\u201cI am going to pass the matter for approximately five minutes or so and have the probation officer in this case consider some appropriate [conditions] for probation in view of the fact that the original recommendation that probation be denied has not had the benefit of any such thinking and I think that this matter may take a little thinking in that connection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-10\">\u201cLet me pass it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">At that point, Sallman\u2019s counsel reminded the court that at the time the \u201cplea was taken we mentioned no promises but we mentioned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>consideration of weekends for Mr. Sallman so that he could continue his employment.\u201d The court responded to this that he \u201cwould suggest to [him] that the defendant\u2019s time is going to be that substantial that it could never be served on weekends.\u201d The court\u2019s final statement was: \u201cLet\u2019s pass the matter and get some probation conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">At no time in the course of the proceedings was there any assertion of custodial authority over the defendant; nor was there any express exoneration of bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Though the reporter\u2019s transcript does not contain any further entries for that date, the minutes of the court contain an entry as follows: \u201cDefendant no longer present in court at the second call of the calendar.\u201d The further entry in the minutes was \u201cDefendant fails to appear without sufficient excuse. Bail forfeited. Bench warrant ordered issued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Thereafter, appellant\u2019s motion to vacate the order of forfeiture was timely filed pursuant to Penal Code section 1305. The showing in support of the motion was by declaration which stated that \u201cdefendant Wayne Sallmen [57'c] . . . appeared in court for sentencing\u201d and \u201cwas formally sentenced and the case was passed to determine how much time the defendant was to serve. After a short recess the case was called again and defendant failed to answer,. . .\u201d There was no showing made of any facts which would justify discharge of the forfeiture;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant\u2019s sole contention was that \u201cwhen the defendant was formally sentenced, the bail should have been ordered exonerated.\u201d The motion was submitted to the court without any further factual showing.</p>\n<p id=\"A-k\">Appellant argued that the court\u2019s statement that proceedings were suspended and that Sallman was placed on probation for four years constituted a sentence and exonerated the bail. The court found this contention unpersuasive and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">In its brief on appeal, appellant takes a slightly different position than that urged in the trial court. In addition to claiming that the defendant\u2019s nonappearance occurred \u201cafter being sentenced,\u201d it also asserts that \u201cthe defendant appeared for sentencing, which was the very condition that the bond called for.\u201d The only authority cited by appellant is <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilshire Ins. Co. </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 521 [136 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>693], Neither of appellant\u2019s arguments support its appeal and the authority upon which it relies is not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The condition of the bond that Sallman \u201cappear for pronouncement of judgment or grant of probation\u201d was not satisfied by Sallman\u2019s being there for a portion of that process.  The California Constitution requires that defendants in noncapital cases \u201cshall be released on bail by sufficient sureties.\u201d (Art. I, \u00a7 12.) The statutes implementing this requirement provide for two kind of bail bonds. Penal Code section 1271 provides that the defendant \u201cmay be admitted to bail before conviction, as a matter of right.\u201d The conditions of the bond in this event are governed by Penal Code section 1287 which provides in pertinent part that the bond shall guarantee that the defendant \u201c. . . if convicted, will appear for pronouncement of judgment or grant of probation.\u201d A second kind of bond is applicable when the defendant is admitted to bail \u201c[ajfter conviction . . . [a]s a matter of discretion . . .\u201d in felony matters. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1272.) The condition of the bond in such cases is governed by Penal Code section 1292 which provides: \u201c. . . [T]he undertaking must be conditioned as prescribed in section 1273, for undertakings of bail on appeal.\u201d Section 1273 provides that the condition of the bond is that the defendant \u201c. . . will surrender himself in execution of the judgment, upon its being affirmed or modified, or upon the appeal being dismissed ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">If the coverage of the first type of bond terminates upon the defendant appearing for the commencement of proceedings for pronouncement of sentence or grant of probation, a defendant is obliged to remain in custody during any interruption in the sentencing process<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> unless (1) the court in its discretion admits him to bail, pursuant to Penal Code section 1272, as amended in 1971, as \"... a defendant who has made application for probation or who has appealed, . . .\u201d and (2) the defendant incurs the expense of an additional bail bond premium. This would severely limit bail (it would not be available \u201c[a]s a matter of right\u201d) and burden (by increasing the cost) the defendant\u2019s constitutional right, a result which should be avoided. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Surety Ins. Co. </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 197, 202 [127 Cal.Rptr. 451].)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The 1971 amendment to Penal Code.section 1272<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> extending discretionary bail on appeal to defendants who have applied for probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>should not be construed to require this result. Before such amendment, only defendants who had appealed were eligible for such bail. The amendment was, therefore, clearly intended to facilitate release on bail, not obstruct it. There is no need for a defendant who is already on bail to \u201cbe admitted to bail\u201d pending the pronouncement of judgment upon the verdict. The amendment operates to extend the right to bail during this interval to defendants who have not previously posted bail (for example, those who have been unable or unwilling to incur the expense of a bond premium or who have been free on their own recognizance). It was not accompanied by any change in the form of bond specified in Penal Code section 1278, which continues in effect in the interval between the verdict and pronouncement of judgment. In any event, section 1272 makes no distinction between the time prior to the commencement of the pronouncement of sentence or grant of probation and the completion thereof. It does not, therefore, support a construction of Penal Code section 1278 as limiting the effectiveness of the bond to the commencement of the sentencing proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">The foregoing considerations impel us to the conclusion that a preconviction bail bond in the form specified by Penal Code section 1287 remains in effect until completion of the \u201c. . . pronouncement of judgment or grant of probation ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The record is clear in this case that Sallman did not remain in court for the completion of the grant of probation. A grant of probation may be made which does not state conditions, in which event they are implied. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lippner </em>(1933) 219 Cal. 395, 398-400 [26 P.2d 457].) But it is patent that no such grant of probation was intended in this case. The court clearly stated that it was going to impose a condition of county time that was so \u201csubstantial that it could never be served on weekends. . .\u201d and that a complete set of conditions would be imposed once the court had the benefit of the probation officer\u2019s recommendations. The defendant was under no misapprehension. He knew that there was more to come and fled to escape the expected imposition of a substantial jail term as a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number><em>People </em>v. <em>Wilshire Ins. Co., supra, </em>67 Cal.App.3d 521, does not support appellant\u2019s position. In that case, defendant surrendered himself for execution of judgment after affirmance on appeal. After defendant\u2019s motion for a stay of execution was denied, the court declared <em>(id., </em>at p. 525): \u201c \u2018The defendant is remanded. Bail is exonerated.\u2019 \u201d According to the opinion, \u201c[t]he reporter\u2019s transcript indicates that, following the quoted statement of the trial judge, the proceedings in the Marr\u00f3n case were concluded . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Further facts were that Marr\u00f3n was taken into custody by the sheriff who \u201c. . . placed him in the lockup ...\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 530) but released him later in the day, advising him that he was to return to court in two weeks. The clerk\u2019s minutes contained two contradictory entries: one stating that Marron\u2019s motion for stay of execution to permit filing of petition for writ of certiorari was denied; the other was \u201c. . . to the effect that defendant\u2019s request for a stay of execution of judgment was granted . . .\u201d with the additional entry \u201c \u2018B1 on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 525.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The court in <em>Wilshire Ins. Co. </em>held that although the court\u2019s clear order placing Marr\u00f3n in custody and exonerating his bail could have been vacated by making a different ruling on the same day, the record did not establish any such action had been taken by the court. No such problem is posed in the instant case. The court never exercised any custodial authority over Sallman and took no action which could conceivably be construed as an exoneration of the bail; both of these facts are clear from the reporter\u2019s transcript of the judge\u2019s remarks. Nothing in the clerk\u2019s minutes in any respect suggests the contrary. It is thus apparent that the decision in the <em>Wilshire </em>case is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Cobey, J., and Allport, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b237-9\">There was no attempt to show that the defendant had been surrendered to custody nor that there was any excuse for his nonappearance.

(a).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b238-7\">For example, in the case at bench, it would have been appropriate for the court to continue the matter for a period of days to permit the probation officer to recommend appropriate conditions of probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Penal Code section 1272, as amended in 1971, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5_\">\u201cAfter conviction of an offense not punishable with death, a defendant who has made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>application for probation or who has appealed may be admitted to bail;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArG\">\u201c1.
