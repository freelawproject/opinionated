In 1970 and 1971, CSUH permitted two students to represent it in intercollegiate athletic competition. The NCAA took exception and imposed a penalty upon CSUH. Several years and two appeals later, the consequences are still in litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">CSUH commenced the litigation to enjoin the NCAA from enforcing the penalty. The superior court initially granted a preliminary injunction. On appeal by the NCAA, the order granting the preliminary injunction was affirmed. <em>(California State University, Hayward </em>v. <em>National Collegiate Athletic Assn. </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 533 [121 Cal.Rptr. 85].) After a subsequent trial on the merits of the action, the superior court found in favor of CSUH and entered a judgment granting it a permanent injunction. The NCAA appealed again, this time from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Although some of the material facts are stated in the previous decision as they had been pleaded (47 Cal.App.3d 533 at pp. 537-539), they should be restated as established at the trial. The trial court found, or the evidence otherwise supports recitals, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">CSUH is a member institution of the California State University and Colleges system. The NCAA is a voluntary unincorporated association of some 700 colleges and universities in the United States. It supervises and coordinates intercollegiate competition in seasonal sports, and directly sponsors certain post-season athletic events in which its members compete on a selective basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">CSUH has been an \u201cactive\u201d member of the NCAA since 1962. An \u201cactive\u201d member is a four-year college or university. An \u201callied\u201d member is an athletic conference or association composed of active members. The Far Western Conference (FWC) is a voluntary unincorporated association of California colleges and universities which sponsors and coordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>nates athletic competition among them on a regional basis. The FWC is an \u201callied\u201d member of the NCAA. CSUH is a member of the FWC.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The NCAA functions pursuant to a constitution and bylaws. The FWC has its own constitution. As pertinent to this case, the eligibility of students to participate in intercollegiate athletic competition is covered in two provisions of the NCAA constitution which generally defer control of the subject to its members.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Article VI, section 3(e), of the FWC constitution covers the subject in more specific terms as to freshman students only.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The FWC provision is a variation of language which the NCAA amended into article <em>4 </em>of its bylaws (bylaw 4) in 1965, effective in 1966. The language became known as the \u201c1.6 rule\u201d because of its reference to a freshman student\u2019s \u201cpredicted\u201d grade point average (GPA) at that figure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The 1.6 rule caused confusion and differing interpretations among NCAA members. Some of them interpreted it to apply to post-season <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>athletic competition only, to permit a student\u2019s eligibility for in-season play to be regulated by the conference to which his college or university belonged, and to permit a freshman \u201csub-predictor\u201d (see fn. 3, <em>ante) </em>to be eligible for in-season competition so long as he was not allowed to participate in post-season events. The FWC shared this interpretation, which was reflected in article VI, section 3(e), of its constitution. (See fn. 2 and the accompanying text, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Everett Shelton was the commissioner of the FWC, and Arthur Bergstrom was the assistant executive director of the NCAA, at pertinent times. In a letter written to Bergstrom on October 21, 1969, Shelton noted his impression that the rules of \u201csmall\u201d athletic conferences frequently deviated from those of the NCAA. He further stated: \u201c. . . This December [1969] meeting we [the FWC] are going to tiy to get the whole thing straightened out. ... I want to know if you can use an ineligible player and qualify for a Post-Season game and then drop him for that game. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Shelton\u2019s letter made no reference to the NCAA constitution or bylaws. In a reply written on October 30, 1969 (the Bergstrom letter), Bergstrom answered Shelton\u2019s inquiry in affirmative <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At that time, the FWC did not change the student eligibility standards prescribed in its constitution. (See fn. 2 and the accompanying text, <em>ante.) </em>The contents of the Bergstrom letter were made known to CSUH.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Ronald McFadden was admitted to CSUH, as a freshman, in the fall of 1969. Melvin Yearby was admitted as a freshman in the fall of 1970. Upon entrance, each was a \u201csub-predictor\u201d for purposes of the 1.6 rule. (See fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>Each nevertheless achieved a GPA of more than 2.0 by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>the midpoint of his freshman year. CSUH accordingly permitted McFadden to represent it in some intercollegiate track meets during the 1970 season, and Yearby to play on its baseball team in some intercollegiate games in the 1971 season, while each was in the after part of his respective freshman year. In each instance, CSUH acted with knowledge of the FWC\u2019s current student eligibility standards (see fn. 2) and of the Bergstrom letter (fn. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">At some point not shown in the record, the NCAA published an \u201cOfficial Interpretation\u201d (O.I. 418) which imported that the 1.6 rule made a sub-predictor <em>student </em>ineligible to compete in intercollegiate athletics.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bergstrom testified that he orally interpreted the rule to this effect in a conversation with James L. Comer, the CSUH athletic director, prior to June 3, 1970. Bergstrom expressed the same interpretation in a letter he wrote Shelton (but not CSUH) on that date. This letter quoted Comer as having \u201creported\u201d that the FWC permitted freshman sub-predictors to play in \u201cregular, inseason competition.\u201d It also informed Shelton that such practice would constitute a \u201cviolation\u201d of the 1.6 rule, but it did <em>not </em>state that Bergstrom had told Comer this. Neither Comer nor Shelton testified at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">At a meeting conducted later in 1970, after Shelton had heard from Bergstrom as just described, the faculty board of the FWC amended section 3(e) of article VI of the FWC constitution. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em>The minutes of the meeting are apparently the only evidence of this amendment. They do not show the amended language, but they state that it was adopted \u201cto satisfy NCAA requirements.\u201d They also show that the amendment did not take effect until the fall of 1971, which was after both McFadden and Yearby had been permitted to compete for CSUH during their respective freshman years. CSUH was unaware of an eligibility problem, with regard to either student, until after the NCAA had published a memorandum concerning the 1.6 rule in February 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>The NCAA was subsequently informed that McFadden and Yearby had competed for CSUH while they were sub-predictor freshmen. In November 1972, it demanded that CSUH declare both young men <em>currently </em>ineligible, for one year, pursuant to \u201cthe provisions of Official Interpretation 418\u201d (see fn. 5, ante) and subject to an appeal by CSUH for restoration of their eligibility. CSUH at first declared the two ineligible and took the appeal, which was denied by an NCAA subcommittee.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">CSUH then took a further appeal to the NCAA Council (the association\u2019s body of last resort), but declared McFadden and Yearby to be eligible while the appeal was pending. The latter action was taken upon the stated grounds that McFadden would otherwise lose eligibility during the track season of his senior year and that it would be \u201cunjust\u201d to impose current ineligibility on either student. The council denied the appeal in May of 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">An NCAA official had meanwhile treated the two students\u2019 continuing eligibility as a further violation of \u201cthe requirements of NCAA legislation\u201d and reported CSUH to the committee on infractions. In December of 1973, after a hearing, that committee produced a report in which it (1) made a finding that McFadden and Yearby had played \u201cwhile ineligible\u201d under the 1.6 rule; (2) made further findings to the effect that CSUH had defied the NCAA by declining to comply with its decisions regarding the two students\u2019 eligibility in and after 1972; and (3) proposed a penalty whereby CSUH would be \u201cpublicly reprimanded and censured, and placed on probation for an indefinite period\u201d (but for not less than two years) during which it would not be permitted to participate in NCAA \u201cchampionship\u201d or other post-season events.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">CSUH did not challenge the committee\u2019s findings, but appealed the major parts of the \u201cproposed penalties\u201d to the NCAA Council. After another hearing, the council denied this appeal in January of 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">At every stage of these various proceedings, CSUH admitted the essential facts but stressed its reliance upon the Bergstrom letter and the former FWC eligibility rules as the bases for having permitted McFadden and Yearby to compete in 1970 and 1971. None of the several NCAA bodies mentioned either factor in its decision. Throughout the proceedings, it was made clear that the exclusive or principal reason for the penalty was the refusal of CSUH to declare McFadden and Yearby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>ineligible upon demand. At the final hearing before the council, this position was characterized as \u201csheer defiance of NCAA rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The probation penalty took effect when the council denied the final appeal in January 1974.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> CSUH commenced this action about two months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">After submission of the cause upon the foregoing evidence, the trial court filed a memorandum decision in which it (1) rejected CSUH\u2019s argument that the suspension imposed by the NCAA \u201cwas a penalty which exceeded the authority granted it by O.I. 418\u201d; (2) expressed the determination that the NCAA was \u201cestopped\u201d from imposing the penalty by reason of the Bergstrom letter and CSUH\u2019s reasonable reliance upon it; (3) stated that it declined to consider whether the NCAA\u2019s demand pursuant to O.I. 418 had been \u201cviolative\u201d of state or federal law; and (4) ordered the issuance of a permanent injunction as prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">At the NCAA\u2019s request, the court made formal findings of fact which covered most of the evidence summarized above. Some of the findings, and other evidentiary points, are specifically mentioned below. As conclusions of law, the court said: \u201cI. Petitioners have exhausted their administrative remedies. II. CSUH\u2019s conduct was reasonable and proper in light of the above facts and equity. III. NCAA is estopped by it's conduct from imposing any sanction whatsoever arising out of or a part of the events, transactions and facts of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Consistent with the position taken by the court in its memorandum decision, the findings and conclusions do not mention whether NCAA\u2019s actions had violated state or federal law in any respect. They also failed to mention whether the NCAA had followed its constitution and bylaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"> On appeal from the judgment granting a permanent injunction, the NCAA first contends that the trial court \u201cexceeded the permissible scope of judicial review of a private voluntary association\u2019s action.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n                   The court expressly found, and it is undisputed, that when CSUH became a member of the NCAA it \u201cagreed to comply with all the requirements of the NCAA constitution and bylaws.\u201d The finding expresses the fact that the relationship between the parties was one of <em>contract, </em>between the NCAA as a voluntary association and CSUH as a member, evidenced by the constitution and bylaws. <em>(Lawson </em>v. <em>Hewell </em>(1897) 118 Cal. 613, 618-619, 621 [50 P. 763]; <em>DeMille </em>v. <em>American Fed. of Radio Artists </em>(1947) 31 Cal.2d 139, 146 [187 P.2d 769, 175 A.L.R. 382]; <em>Sevey </em>v. <em>American Federation of State etc. Employees </em>(1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 64, 69 [121 Cal.Rptr. 341].)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The language of the constitution providing for discipline of a member (see fn. 6, <em>ante) </em>thus permits the NCAA to impose a penalty for the member\u2019s breach of the underlying contract. If CSUH breached it as the NCAA contended, the penalty was properly imposed pursuant to the contract. If not, the action imposing it was taken by the NCAA in violation of the contract: i.e., of its constitution and bylaws.  Courts will intervene in the internal affairs of a private voluntary association to nullify substantial disciplinary action taken against a member in violation of its constitution and bylaws. <em>(California State University, Hayward </em>v. <em>National Collegiate Athletic Assn., supra, </em>47 Cal.App.3d 533 at pp. 539-540, 542-543 and cases cited.)  The trial evidence established\u2014as CSUH\u2019s complaint had portended\u2014that the effect of the suspension upon the university, its athletic program and its reputation was sufficiently substantial to warrant judicial intervention here. (See <em>id., </em>at pp. 540-542. See also fn. 6, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The NCAA also asserts that judicial intervention should have been denied because CSUH appealed only the penalty to the council and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>not challenge the findings of the Committee on Infractions. This is in effect an argument that CSUH failed to exhaust the internal administrative remedy which was available to it as a member of the NCAA.  The exhaustion doctrine applies within a voluntary association <em>(Westlake Community Hosp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 465, 474-475 [131 Cal.Rptr. 90, 551 P.2d 410]), but its purpose is to permit the association \u201c. . . quickly to determine through the operation of its internal procedures that it has committed error . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 476.) The internal appeals successively taken by CSUH presented all the circumstances of its reliance upon the Bergstrom letter, and afforded the NCAA full \u201copportunity\u201d to review the merits of its proposed disciplinary action in light of that fact. The purpose of the exhaustion doctrine having thus been served, it will not be applied to bar a remedy to CSUH.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Once the trial court had undertaken to intervene, the question presented was whether the NCAA had been entitled to penalize CSUH for the latter\u2019s breach of their contract.  The NCAA\u2019s right to do this arose under the same contract. The doctrine of equitable estoppel may be applied to prevent a person from asserting a right which has come into existence by contract. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 178, 188 [79 Cal.Rptr. 257].) CSUH squarely asserted the doctrine in the second cause of action stated in its complaint. The trial court was therefore warranted in applying the doctrine if the evidence established the existence of its requisite elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u201c \u2018Generally speaking, four elements must be present in order to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel: (1) the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts; (2) he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon, or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended; (3) the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts; and (4) he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Long Beach </em>v. <em>Mansell </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 462, 489 [91 Cal.Rptr. 23, 476 P.2d 423] [quoting <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 297, 305 (61 Cal.Rptr. 661, 431 P.2d 245)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">The trial court made findings which explicitly or in substance established the existence of the first, third and fourth elements, and the alternative factor of the second. The NCAA does not challenge the language of these findings, or their adequacy to support the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>application of the estoppel doctrine, but contends that the evidence is insufficient to support them. This contention rests in part upon Bergstrom\u2019s uncorroborated testimony that he gave a correct oral interpretation of the 1.6 rule to Comer before Yearby was permitted to play baseball in 1971. The contention is also addressed to the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the Bergstrom letter, of the evidence of various persons\u2019 conduct before and after it was written, and of the trial testimony of some of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The first point involves the assessment of Bergstrom\u2019s credibility as a witness, which was within the exclusive province of the trial court. <em>(Nestle </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 920, 925 [101 Cal.Rptr. 568, 496 P.2d 480].)  The others challenge findings made from evidence which was in conflict, or which would support opposing inferences, and some of which pertained to the Bergstrom letter as extrinsic evidence bearing upon its interpretation. These findings are to be sustained on appeal if there is any substantial evidence supporting them. <em>(Foreman &amp; Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Fallon </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 875, 881 [92 Cal.Rptr. 162, 479 P.2d 362]; <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Bristol Development Co. </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 861, 865 [44 Cal.Rptr. 767, 402 P.2d 839].) We need not detail the evidence beyond the summary which appears above; it suffices to state that we find substantial evidence in support of the findings relative to the elements of equitable estoppel. <em>(City of Long Beach </em>v. <em>Mansell, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 462 at p. 489.) It is also apparent that the trial court perceived the real equities when it made these findings. (See, e.g., fn. 6, <em>ante.) </em>There is no occasion to disturb them.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The NCAA contends that the court erred in several instances where it sustained objections to evidence. The evidence thereby excluded was not relevant; no error appears. The judgment is accordingly to be affirmed upon the basis that the NCAA is estopped from imposing the penalty. Because the trial court terminated its inquiry when it reached the estoppel point, it did not address the question whether the NCAA had complied with its constitution and bylaws in imposing the penalty. Having examined those sources (which we have quoted at length for the purpose), we conclude that it did not. We affirm the judgment upon that alternate ground of decision, as next discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The eligibility of a \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d to represent an NCAA \u201cinstitution\u201d in intercollegiate athletic competition is governed by section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>3 of article III of the 1969 NCAA constitution, which provides in effect that a student is eligible if regularly admitted, in good academic standing, and pursuing a course of study toward a degree. (See fn. 1, <em>ante.) </em>McFadden and Yearby met these requirements when they were freshmen at CSUH. Section 2 of article 3 vested the \u201ccontrol and responsibility for the conduct of intercollegiate athletics\u201d in CSUH and in the FWC. (See <em>ibid.) </em>McFadden and Yearby met the FWC\u2019s eligibility requirements according to its standards when they competed for CSUH as freshmen. (See fn. 2.) They were therefore eligible in their freshman years, sub-predictors or not, within the explicit meaning of section 3 and consistent with section 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The fact that they were sub-predictors invoked the 1.6 rule stated in section 6(b) of NCAA bylaw 4. That rule, however, did not make either of them ineligible during their respective freshman years: it provided only that <em>CSUH, </em>as an \u201cinstitution,\u201d would be ineligible to participate \u201cin an NCAA-sponsored event\u201d (meaning a post-season championship event) <em>if il </em>did not declare them ineligible pursuant to the authority vested in it by section 2 of article III of the constitution. (See fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>Exercising that authority to the contrary, CSUH treated both young men as eligible. It thereby incurred the automatic consequences of the rule, as applied to it (CSUH) alone, but it did not field athletes who were \u201cineligible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The only basis for the assertion that McFadden and Yearby <em>had been </em>ineligible, when they competed as sub-predictors, is O.I. 418 (quoted in fn. 5, <em>ante). </em>O.I. 418 calls for the imposition of a penalty upon a student-athlete to whom it refers as having practiced or competed \u201cwhile ineligible\u201d under the 1.6 rule. It thus assumes that sub-predictors are or were \u201cineligible,\u201d but it does not say so. If it produced that effect by implication when the NCAA membership ratified it in 1972 (see fn. 5, <em>ante), </em>it did not retroact to make McFadden and Yearby ineligible when they competed before that. No provision of the constitution or bylaws had that effect when they competed. Absent any such effect from a valid and contemporaneous source, O.I. 418 is simply wrong to the extent that it purports to declare that a sub-predictor is or was \u201cineligible\u201d to compete.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">These interpretations of the 1.6 rule and O.I. 418 are not at variance with those reached in the two federal appellate decisions which have considered one or both. One of the decisions, which involves the 1.6 rule only, supports our conclusion that it pertains to the eligibility of <em>institutions </em>for post-season NCAA competition but not of <em>students </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>competing in season. <em>(Parish </em>v. <em>National Collegiate Athletic Association </em>(5th Cir. 1975) 506 F.2d 1028, 1030-1031 [text and fn. 3].)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The other decision treated O.I. 418 as an authoritative declaration that sub-predictors were ineligible under the 1.6 rule, but only because it and other \u201cofficial interpretations\u201d were \u201cbinding\u201d upon NCAA members, when published, pursuant to an explicit provision (\u201cArticle Six, \u00a7 2\u201d) of the <em>1972 </em>NCAA constitution. <em>(Associated Students, Inc., Etc. </em>v. <em>National Col. Ath. Assn. </em>(9th Cir 1974) 493 F.2d 1251, 1253.) The decision is wholly distinguishable because no such provision appears in the <em>1969 </em>constitution which controls the present case. (See fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>Lacking it as a valid source, O.I. 418 was no more than a unilateral misinterpretation of the 1.6 rule which did not reach McFadden or Yearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Since both students were eligible by NCAA standards when they competed for CSUH, and O.I. 418 did not change their status, CSUH did not violate any NCAA rule by permitting them to compete. It follows that the NCAA is itself in violation of its constitution and bylaws by imposing a penalty for the asserted breach of O.I. 418 or any other rule. Judicial intervention is warranted on this independent basis. <em>(California State University, Hayward </em>v. <em>National Collegiate Athletic Assn., supra, </em>47 Cal.App.3d 533 at pp. 539-540, 542-543 and cases there cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">CSUH argued this ground for affirmance in its reply brief. The NCAA replied that the ground was unavailable because it was not supported by factual findings. However, the pertinent provisions of the NCAA constitution and bylaws, and O.I. 418, are subject to interpretation as they read; there is no extrinsic evidence, attending the enactment or promulgation of any of them, which bears upon their construction. For these reasons, their interpretation is \u201csolely a judicial function\u201d which this court must independently perform on the appeal. <em>(Parsons </em>v. <em>Bristol Development Co., supra, </em>62 Cal.2d 861 at pp. 865-866.) It therefore produces a conclusion of law which is not to be expressed in a finding of fact. Having reached it as an alternative ground for affirming the judgment, we need not write it into the conclusions of law reached below: the judgment itself reflects it. (4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Trial, \u00a7 304, p. 3113.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Other points raised in the briefs need not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>The purported appeal from the order denying a motion for a new trial is dismissed.

The determination of eligibility rules for regular, <em>inseason competition </em>is the responsibility of the certifying institution or the athletic conference in which it may hold membership.

O.I. 418 was apparently ratified by the members at their annual meeting in 1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b410-9\">The disciplinary proceedings were conducted, and the penalty was imposed, pursuant to various provisions of the NCAA constitution, its bylaws, and a documented \u201cEnforcement Program\u201d adopted by its full membership. Section 6(b) of article IV of the constitution provides that a member may be expelled or suspended, by a two-thirds vote of the full membership in convention, for \u201cfailing to maintain the academic or athletic standards required for membership or failing to meet the conditions ... of membership.\u201d Section 6(c) provides that \u201c[d]isciplinary or corrective actions other than termination of membership or suspension may be effected by a two-thirds vote of the members of the Council present and voting\u201d at a duly noticed meeting. Section 6(c) does not specify any grounds upon which the council is authorized to impose discipline, and the enforcement program does not regulate its actions in this regard. A section of the program provides that a \u201cNCAA penalty should be broad if the violation or violations [by a member] reflect a general disregard for the governing rules.\u201d Another section indicates that \u201c[p]robation for more than one year\u201d is about as \u201cbroad\u201d a penalty as a member may incur, short of expulsion or suspension by the full NCAA membership. The sum of these provisions vests the council with virtually unlimited and uncontrolled power to punish NCAA members who resist its actual or professed authority. The power may be exercised by two-thirds of the council \u201cpresent and voting,\u201d which means that a decisive disciplinary vote may be cast by a very few persons. In the present case, the terminal vote was apparently cast by no more than four men.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\">We here quote the opening brief.
