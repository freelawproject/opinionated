Egeria Hobart Taft, the claimant in the heirship proceedings, is the appellant herein. The main question to be decided is the correctness of the court\u2019s construction of Probate Code, section 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">The petition for letters of administration filed by Edward F. Hagist sets forth \u201cThat Elsie Hobart, also known as Elsie Vogel Hobart, . . . died on the 26th of August, 1945 . . .; that deceased left estate . . . consisting of real and personal property.\u201d Bertha Hagist was named the only heir. Two brothers and one sister were named as relatives. The petitioner, one of the brothers of the deceased, was appointed administrator of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">The statement of claim of heirship alleged that \u201ca true and correct inventory and appraisement\u201d had been filed by the administrator and \u201cThat said Egeria Hobart Taft was and is a sister of Melmouth F. Hobart, who was the pre-deceased husband of said Elsie Hobart, the above named decedent; that said pre-deceased spouse of said decedent at the time of death of said decedent left him surviving no issue, no parent and no brother, sister, niece or nephew, excepting said Egeria Hobart Taft, only surviving sister, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>and claimant above named; that said Elsie Hobart, decedent herein, left her surviving no spouse, and no issue and that her estate was partially community property of said deceased and said pre-deceased spouse and belonged to or went to said decedent by virtue of its community character on the death of said pre-deceased spouse or came to the decedent from said pre-deceased spouse by gift, descent, devise or bequest, or became vested in said decedent on the death of said predeceased spouse by right of survivorship in a homestead or in a joint tenancy between such predeceased spouse and the said decedent or was separate property of said predeceased spouse and came to said decedent from such predeceased spouse by gift, descent, devise or bequest. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The property of the estate consisted of cash, securities and real estate. By consent of the parties the cash was divided equally between the claimant and the respondent Bertha \u2022 Hagist. The court found that securities should be distributed to the same respondent. The court also found that certain real estate was the separate property of Fred Hobart prior to his marriage to Elsie and was conveyed to her thereafter as sole grantee and that there was a good and valuable consideration for the particular conveyances and that none of \u2022it came to Elsie Hobart in the manner and method described in Probate Code, section 229. Other listed properties -were found to be without the purview of the same probate section because of an insufficiency of evidence to uphold the \u2022 claim of the sister of the deceased husband. Finally, as to \u2022 two items, it was found that the property was the separate property of Elsie Hobart and did not come to her through Fred Hobart, whose full, name was Melmouth Frederick Hobart.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">The burden of establishing a claim of heirship under section 229 is placed upon the claimant. <em>(Estate of Beaty, </em>27 Cal.App.2d 745 [81 P.2d 1002]. A narration of the relationship of the parties appears in the following summary of the testimony of Bertha Hagist, the mother and heir of 'the decedent, Elsie Vogel Hobart. The witness first met Fred Hobart and his first wife 10 or 15 years previous to the trial. \u2019The back yards of the Hobart and Hagist houses were adjoining. Her daughter Elsie lived with her husband, Art \u2022Vogel, and the families were very friendly. When Fred Hobart\u2019s first wife was sick, Elsie took care of her. She died . approximately 10 years ago. After her death Fred Hobart became sick, and Elsie\u2019s first husband told her, \u201cTake care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>of him, he is alone.\u201d Fred Hobart lived alone in his house, with Elsie taking care of him; this arrangement lasted for about two years. Fred Hobart then moved in with Art and Elsie Vogel. Art Vogel died in 1938. Fred Hobart continued living in the Vogel home, with Elsie caring for him. Fred and Elsie were married in July, 1939. The following is from the transcript of the testimony of Bertha Hagist: \u201cQ. . . . Why did he want Elsie to have the property ? A. She should have the property because he didn\u2019t have nothing to do with his sister, that is what he said to me. Q. Anything else ? A. He says that she didn\u2019t treat him right, she wasn\u2019t all right, she was\u2014I can\u2019t say the word. Q. You can\u2019t say the word? A. No. He was just against her, wouldn\u2019t talk to her. Q. Well, how many conversations do you think you heard about property matters? A. Oh, many, you know, on a couple of times when I just came in, that they were talking. . . . Yes, he said nobody did so much for him than she did and for his wife, the first wife, yes.\u201d Edward F. Hagist supplemented his mother\u2019s testimony in relation to the location of the respective homes, the illness of Hobart\u2019s first wife and the subsequent condition of Fred Hobart. He testified: \u201cFred said he had\u2014 well, he did say definitely he had everything taken care of to go to Elsie and that she would have no trouble and would avoid certain fees and court appearances, I believe is what they meant, that he wanted her to have everything he had, since there was no other people on earth that took care of Fred as Elsie and Art while he was living, and he would take care of the will before he was ever married to Elsie. . . . Well, there was the family discussed at times and he stated had he not married Elsie he would have bequeathed everything to the Mason\u2019s Home. ... We often asked about family affairs and at that time he hadn\u2019t seen or heard anything for about 17 years, 15 or 17 years, of his nearest relation besides his wife. He did receive two letters and he kept them and showed them and we asked him, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t you answer them?\u2019 and he says, \u2018No, I will wait a few days,\u2019 and he waited a few days and he said no, and threw it down and said, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t answer it,\u2019 and he did not answer it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">It was agreed by the respective parties as to history and dates of transfer, that all of the securities should be considered in accordance with the evidence in reference to certain shares of preferred stock of the Pacific Gas and Electric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Company. The evidence discloses that prior to 1931, the securities stood in the name of Fred Hobart. In 1931, they were reissued in the names of Fred Hobart and his first wife, Elena Hobart, as joint tenants. Approximately a month after Elena\u2019s death, in March of 1937, they were reissued in the name of Fred Hobart. Subsequently Fred Hobart married Elsie Vogel. In October, 1937, approximately 20 months prior to the marriage of Fred and Elsie, they were reissued in the names of Fred Hobart and Elsie Vogel as joint tenants. After the marriage they were reissued in the names of Fred Hobart and Elsie Hobart. Fred Hobart died. On July 26, 1943, approximately two years before Elsie\u2019s death they were reissued in the name of Elsie Hobart. The court found \u201cthat these Securities were issued to Fred Hobart and Elsie Vogel, as joint tenants, more than twenty months before they were married, and are therefore not affected by Section 229 of the California Probate Code; that the reissuance of said Securities from Fred Hobart and Elsie Vogel, as joint tenants, to Fred Hobart and Elsie Hobart, as joint Tenants, on August 15, 1939, was a re-issuance of said Securities from the holders thereof to themselves, the only change being in the name of Elsie Vogel being changed to Elsie Hobart, her new married name. The Court finds that said Securities should be distributed to Respondent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u201cIf the decedent leaves neither spouse nor issue, and the estate or any portion thereof was separate property of a previously deceased spouse, and came to the decedent from such spouse by gift, descent, devise or bequest, or became vested in the decedent on the death of such spouse by right of survivorship in a homestead or in a joint tenancy between such spouse and the decedent, such property goes in equal shares to the children of the deceased spouse and to their descendants by right of representation, and if none, then to the parents of the deceased spouse in equal shares, or if either is dead to the survivor, or if both are dead, in equal shares to the brothers and sisters of the deceased spouse and to their descendants by right of representation.\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7 229.) The origin or source of the property determines its distribution <em>(Estate of Abdale, </em>28 Cal.2d 587 [170 P.2d 918]; <em>Estate of Rattray, </em>13 Cal.2d 702 [91 P.2d 1042] ; <em>Estate of Taitmeyer, </em>60 Cal.App.2d 699 [141 P.2d 504]) if section 229 is applicable as the basis of the order. Section 229 does not cover a transfer for a consideration. If there is a consideration exchanged for the transfer, then that portion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>of the property so obtained did not come to the deceased spouse \u201cby gift, descent, devise or bequest.\u201d Homestead proceedings or joint tenancy are not involved in the distribution of the real estate. The section does not refer to transfers between parties who are not spouses.  Courts are not permitted to supply words which do not appear in the statute (50 Am.Jur., \u00a7 234) in order to rule in accord with the contentions of a litigant.  Plaintiff proved that the securities originally stood in the name of Melmouth P. Hobart (Fred Hobart) and that they stood in his name at the time that there was a transfer of certificates to Hobart and Elsie Vogel. Elsie Vogel\u2019s interest as a joint tenant was complete though the interest in the joint tenancy may have been a gift. If Elsie Vogel had changed her name by marriage to someone other than Fred Hobart, her interest as a joint tenant would have continued if Fred Hobart had caused the stock to be reissued in his name and the newly adopted or acquired name of the former Elsie Vogel no greater title or less interest would have been conveyed to Elsie. The reissuance of the stock under such circumstances would be only a confirmation of the previous transfer to joint tenancy and perhaps a convenience as notice to the stock issuing corporations. Likewise, the transfer in joint tenancy of the certificates in the names of Fred Hobart and Elsie Hobart after she became the wife of Fred Hobart added nothing to the validity of the previous transfer. The interest vested in Elsie through the previous joint tenancy transfer could not be destroyed by a second transfer to the same parties under another name.  Upon the death of Fred Hobart, his wife, Elsie Hobart, in view of the facts of this case, did not become the sole owner of the joint tenancy interest in the securities by descent but by survivorship in the original grant creating the tenancy. (7 Cal.Jur. 334-335.)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Appellant cites Civil Code, section 683 on the subject of joint interest. \u201cA joint interest is one owned by two or more persons in equal shares, by a title created by a single . . . transfer, when expressly declared ... to be a joint tenancy . . . from a husband and wife when holding title as community property or otherwise to themselves . . . when expressly declared in the transfer to be a joint tenancy. . . .\u201d The use of the word \u201cotherwise\u201d relates to a holding of title otherwise than as community property, in the sense that joint t\u00e9nancy is otherwise than community property; however, it does not follow that any change results from a trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>fer from a husband and wife of property held in joint tenancy to themselves in joint tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The answer to appellant\u2019s contention on the joint tenancy, assuming that Elsie obtained her interest as a gift, is that the gift was not made from one spouse to the other but from one unmarried person to another. So far as the evidence discloses the joint tenancy transfer was not made in contemplation of wedlock.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in awarding the real property formerly owned by Fred Hobart to Elsie Hobart\u2019s heir, Bertha Hagist, the respondent herein. There does not seem to be any claim that the particular parcels of property declared to be the separate property of Elsie Hobart prior to her marriage to Fred Hobart were not in fact her separate property. These items may be passed without further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">As in the claim for the securities, so in the claim for the real estate, the burden of proof rested with the appellant. On appeal appellant merely mentions that the brother of Elsie Hobart testified that Fred Hobart stated the deed was made to Elsie to avoid probate proceedings. Appellant claims this was the only evidence produced upon the subject, and that under such circumstances the property should be awarded to the sister of the predeceased husband. These particular deeds and the contents thereof appeared from the records of the county recorder\u2019s office and were marked as exhibits in the ease. The statement of Fred Hobart does not negative the issue of consideration. In the absence of further proof by appellant, the personal care and nursing given by the wife prior to her marriage, language used in the deed and the internal revenue stamps on the deed are sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the transfer of certain parcels of real estate was based upon a valuable consideration and that any presumption that the deeding of the property was merely a gift was overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">For the deeds to be effective, delivery was required. The deed of property in Oakland was not recorded until the day after Hobart\u2019s death. Whether the grantor intended to transfer the title is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court from a consideration of all the evidence bearing upon the question. <em>(Hinshaw </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>37 Cal.App.2d 230, 237 [99 P.2d 283]; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Trott, </em>162 Cal. 268 [122 P. 462].) There is in the record the testimony of Mrs. Hagist and Edward Hagist that Hobart said \u201cEverything belongs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>to [Elsie Hobart].\u201d The court found that the deed conveying certain property in Alameda County was a grant deed. There is evidence from which the trial court could infer that Fred Hobart relinquished control of the property as his sole property in fee simple. The fact that he intended to keep a life estate in himself would not prevent the fee from vesting in Elsie Hobart. <em>(Bury </em>v. <em>Young, </em>98 Cal. 446 [33 P. 338, 35 Am.St.Rep. 186]; <em>Wilkerson </em>v. <em>Seib, </em>20 Cal.2d 556 [127 P.2d 904].) It was still the duty of appellant to prove lack of delivery and that the facts brought the case within the purview of Probate Code, section 229. In <em>Vanasek </em>v. <em>Pokorny, </em>73 Cal.App. 312, 318 [238 P. 798], the court said: \u201cIt may fairly be inferred from the cross-complaint that the conveyance to appellant was by deed of grant. Such a deed is supported by a presumption of consideration, the burden of proving want of consideration is upon the one seeking to avoid it, and the presumption in its effect applies to the pleadings as well as to the proof (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1614, 1615; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1963, subd. 39).\u201d (See, also, <em>Banducci </em>v. <em>Banducci, </em>63 Cal.App.2d 600 [147 P.2d 73].)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">During argument before the trial judge the attorney for appellant stated his position as follows: \u201cNow, I have in mind that our having filed the petition that the burden is on us to show not only the relationship of our client but also the source from which the property came.\u201d The inventory and appraisement in the matter of the estate of Elsie Hobart was admitted in evidence but does not appear in the record on appeal. Whatever the trial court found therefrom must be considered accurate and final so far as this appeal is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">There was some property evidently located in Lake County which must be assumed to have been deeded by Fred Hobart to his wife Elsie, as all parties so treated it. The attorney for the appellant agreed that he would supply that deed for the record. The trial court found that as to certain real estate items the claimant \u201chas failed to prove by a sufficiency of evidence that either or any of said Items came to Elsie Hobart by any manner or method prescribed by California Probate Code Section 229.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The general rule is that matters not contained in the record will not be considered on appeal. Under such circumstances the findings are considered conclusive. Here the trial court definitely found a lack of proof to sustain the conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>tion of claimant. <em>(Sutro Heights Land Co. </em>v. <em>Merced Irr. Dist., </em>211 Cal. 670 [296 P. 1088].)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">It would be a futile act on this appeal to augment the record relative to the missing deed covering property in Lake County. Augmentation of the record is permitted only when an exhibit has been actually \u201con file in or lodged with the superior court.\u201d (Rules on Appeal, rule 12.) In the present case the deed was not filed or lodged with the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The order determining heirship is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Peters, P. J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied December 20, 1947, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 19, 1948. Carter, J., and Schauer, J., voted for a hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
