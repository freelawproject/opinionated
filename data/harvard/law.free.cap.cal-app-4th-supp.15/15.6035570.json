J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ5\">Appellant contests the judgments of the trial court finding him guilty of various parking violations of the Los Angeles Municipal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">I, II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-11\">Appellant contends that Vehicle Code section 42001, subdivision (a) does not apply to parking violations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant contends that Penal Code section 1463 (disposition of fines and forfeitures collected in municipal courts) does not include enhancements within the definition of \u201ctotal parking penalty\u201d and therefore the Legislature did not intend to include parking violations within the reach of Vehicle Code section 42001. Appellant\u2019s argument is totally without merit. First, Penal Code section 1463 deals solely with <em>distribution </em>of parking fines, and does not even discuss what fine may be imposed for a parking violation. Second, Vehicle Code section 42001 states plainly on its face that any violation of the Vehicle Code or any ordinance adopted pursuant to the Vehicle Code may be subjected to a fine not to exceed $100.  \u201cThe fundamental rule of statutory interpretation is to \u2018 \u201cascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] In determining intent, the court looks first to the words themselves. [Citation.] \u2018When the language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for construction.\u2019 [Citation.] The court will decline to follow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 18\">*Supp. 18</page-number>the plain meaning of a statute only when to do so would inevitably frustrate the manifest purposes of the legislation as a whole or lead to absurd results. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Ge M. </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1519, 1522-1523 [277 Cal.Rptr. 554].)  We cannot agree with appellant\u2019s assertion that using the plain wording of Vehicle Code section 42001, subdivision (a), would frustrate the purpose of the statute or lead to absurd results. Accordingly, the trial court was free to impose any fine it found to be appropriate, up to $100. There is no evidence in this case that the trial court abused that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">Appellant further contends that the $100 fine imposed by the court under Vehicle Code section 42001 violates his constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because it penalizes the exercise of his fundamental right to a trial. Appellant states that if he merely pled guilty and paid the fine he would have been subjected to a fine substantially less than the $100 he faced by pleading not guilty and proceeding to trial. He contends that the option to pay a minimum penalty in exchange for abandoning his constitutional right to trial has a chilling effect on the exercise of that right by threatening a greater penalty if convicted after trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">This argument is also without merit. Many cases have recognized that \u201c[w]hile confronting a defendant with the risk of more severe punishment clearly may have a \u2018discouraging effect on the defendant\u2019s assertion of his trial rights, the imposition of these difficult choices [is] an inevitable\u2019\u2014and permissible\u2014\u2018attribute of any legitimate system which tolerates and encourages the negotiation of pleas.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bordenkircher </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(1978) 434 U.S. 357, 364 [54 L.Ed.2d 604, 611-612, 98 S.Ct. 663].) As the United States Supreme Court stated in another case: \u201cWe have squarely held that a State may encourage a guilty plea by offering substantial benefits in return for the plea.\u201d <em>(Corbitt </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(1978) 439 U.S. 212, 219 [58 L.Ed.2d 466, 474, 99 S.Ct. 492].) California courts have similarly recognized that \u201cunder appropriate circumstances a defendant may receive a more severe sentence following trial than he would have received had he pleaded guilty; the trial itself may reveal more adverse information about him than was previously known.\u201d <em>(In re Lewallen </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 274, 281 [152 Cal.Rptr. 528, 590 P.2d 383, 100 A.L.R.3d 823].) The trial court in this case was presented with evidence at trial adverse to appellant which indicated that the increased fine was suitable. The prosecutor stated to the court, when requesting an increased fine, that appellant had suffered numerous convictions for parking violations and that the increased fine was therefore appropriate. The court then agreed and imposed a fine of $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 19\">*Supp. 19</page-number>IV, V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">Soven, J., and Watai, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1049-12\">See footnote, ante, page Supp. 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1049-13\">Vehicle Code section 42001, subdivision (a) states in pertinent part;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-14\">\u201c[E]very person convicted of an infraction for a violation of this code or of any local ordinance adopted pursuant to this code shall be punished as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-15\">\u201c(1) By a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100) . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-16\">This subdivision lists certain Vehicle Code sections which are exempted from this schedule of fines.
