The district court sentenced him to concurrent terms of 151 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, five years\u2019 supervised release on Counts 1 and 13, and three years of supervised release on Count 7. Booker appeals the order granting a sentence reduction that is less than the one he sought based on the amendments to the crack cocaine guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-19\">The website of the Bureau of Prisons shows that Booker was released from prison on March 3, 2010. Where a defendant has begun serving a term of supervised release, the appeal of the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is moot. <em>United States v. Boston, </em>No. 08-10341, 419 Fed.Appx. 505, 505-07, 2011 WL 1057563, at *1-*2, 2011 U.S.App. LEXIS 6036, at *4-*6 (5th Cir. Mar. 23, 2011) (per curiam) (unpublished). Here, as with the defendant in <em>Boston, </em>Booker makes no mention of his term of supervised release and does not argue that it should be terminated; his arguments pertain only to relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any termination of supervised release must be sought by a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(1). <em>Boston, </em>419 Fed.Appx. at 506-07, 2011 WL 1057563, at *2, 2011 U.S.App. LEXIS 6036, at *5-*6.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-20\">The judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-17\">. Booker's motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED. His motion to remand for evidentiary hearing is DENIED. His motion for bail pending appeal is DENIED. The government's motion for summary affirmance is DENIED as unnecessary. The government\u2019s motion for extension of time to file its brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
