On July 30, 1992, Davis filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, alleging that he was an employee of Neustrom\u2019s at the time of the accident and was therefore entitled to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The Department determined that Neustrom did not have workers\u2019 compensation insurance at the time of Davis\u2019s accident, and accordingly transferred Davis\u2019s claim to the Department\u2019s Uninsured Employers Fund (UEF). On May 30, 1993, after it unsuccessfully attempted to obtain employee information from Neustrom, UEF sent Neustrom a letter informing him that it had decided to accept Davis\u2019s claim for benefits. However, on July 18,1993, Neustrom filed a \u201cFirst Report of Injury\u201d regarding Davis\u2019 accident in which Neustrom expressly denied that Davis was an employee. On September 17,1993, UEF sent Davis a letter informing him that the Department had determined that he was not an employee and therefore was not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">On November 2, 1994, Davis filed an independent action against Neustrom in the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Custer County. Section 39-71-515, MCA, provides for an independent cause of action against an employer for failure to be enrolled in one of the three workers\u2019 compensation plans required by Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Later, by letter dated July 17, 1995, Davis\u2019s attorney informed UEF that during discovery in the Custer County District Court action it had been established that Davis was Neustrom\u2019s employee at the time of Davis\u2019s injury. In the same letter, Davis\u2019s attorney inquired as to whether Davis could at that time still appeal from UEF\u2019s September 17, 1993 decision rejecting Davis\u2019s claim. On August 2, 1995, UEF responded by letter stating that the 1991 version of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act applied to Davis\u2019s claim and that the current 90-day appeal requirement of \u00a7 39-71-520, MCA did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Thereafter, on September 7,1995, Davis\u2019s claim was mediated and UEF reversed its earlier decision by concluding that Davis was in fact Neustrom\u2019s employee at the time of Davis\u2019 injury. By letter dated November 30,1995, UEF informed Neustrom of its decision, and also informed Neustrom that its decision would become final if not appealed within 90 days. Neustrom indicated to UEF his disagreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>with UEF\u2019s decision, contending in a December 21, 1995 letter that the matter had already become final and could not be reconsidered, but did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">In July, 1996, the Department issued to Neustrom an \u201cAccounts Receivable Invoice,\u201d a document which indicated that Neustrom was obligated to reimburse the Department for $13,576.67 it had paid on Davis\u2019s claim for benefits. By letter dated July 19, 1996, Neustrom objected to the action taken by UEF and requested that the invoice by withdrawn. The Department responded through its legal counsel, informing Neustrom by letter dated August 1,1996 that UEF had an obligation to pay on Davis\u2019s claim pending the outcome of the district court litigation, that Neustrom was required to reimburse UEF or face a collection action, and that if Neustrom disagreed with the decision made by UEF he could proceed to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">On August 7,1996, Neustrom petitioned the Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Ravalli County for a writ of mandate or prohibition directing the Department to vacate and set aside its November 30, 1995 decision. After a hearing, the District Court on October 10,1996, issued its opinion and order, dismissing Neustrom\u2019s petition on the grounds that it had no jurisdiction over the dispute, that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court had exclusive jurisdiction, and that therefore Neustrom had a \u201cplain, speedy and adequate remedy\u2019 in that court. Neustrom appeals from the District Court\u2019s opinion and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Did the District Court correctly conclude that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court had exclusive jurisdiction to consider the substantive matters contained in Neustrom\u2019s petition for alternative writs of mandate and prohibition?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court had jurisdiction over the matters presented in Neustrom\u2019s petition is a conclusion of law. We review a district court\u2019s conclusion in order to determine if it correctly interpreted the law. <em>CNA Ins. Companies v. Dunn </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 295, 298, 902 P.2d 1014, 1016.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">In its opinion and order, the court made two interrelated determinations in disposing of Neustrom\u2019s petition. First, the court engaged in a jurisdictional analysis and concluded that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court had jurisdiction over the substantive matters contained in the petition. Based on this first conclusion, the court then also concluded that dismissal of Neustrom\u2019s petition was proper because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>he had a \u201cplain, adequate and speedy remedy\u201d in appealing UEF\u2019s actions to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax\">Neustrom petitioned the District Court for writs of mandate and prohibition, pursuant to \u00a7 27-26-102, MCA (writ of mandate), and \u00a7 27-27-102, MCA (writ of prohibition). The statutes explain that the writs should be issued in cases in which \u201cthere is not a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\u201d Section 27-26-102(2), MCA; \u00a7 27-27-102, MCA. To determine the propriety of the court\u2019s dismissal of Neustrom\u2019s petition on the ground that he has \u201ca plain, speedy, and adequate remedy\u201d in an appeal to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, we must first determine whether the court\u2019s conclusion that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court had exclusive jurisdiction over the matters presented in Neustrom\u2019s petition is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Neustrom contends that the court\u2019s jurisdictional conclusion is incorrect because Montana statutes and case law dictate that where, as here, a party files an \u201cindependent action\u201d in district court against an employer for lack of workers\u2019 compensation insurance, the district court has jurisdiction over that action and all of its \u201cintegral elements.\u201d Neustrom argues that the matters presented in his petition for writs of mandate and prohibition are \u201cintegral elements\u201d of Davis\u2019s Custer County District Court action, and are therefore within the jurisdiction of the district courts, not the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The \u201cindependent action\u201d to which Neustrom refers is found in \u00a7 39-71-515(1), MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">An injured employee or the employee\u2019s beneficiaries have an independent cause of action against an uninsured employer for failure to be enrolled in a compensation plan as required by this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATi\">The district courts have jurisdiction over these actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">An injured employee or an employee\u2019s beneficiaries pursuing an independent cause of action pursuant to 39-71-515 shall bring the action in the district court in the district where the claimant resides or where the alleged violation occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Section 39-71-516, MCA. Finally, \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA, explains that district court jurisdiction over \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, \u201cindependent actions\u201d is an exception to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising under chapter 71:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">After parties have satisfied dispute resolution requirements provided elsewhere in this chapter, the workers\u2019 compensation judge has exclusive jurisdiction to make determinations concerning dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>putes under Chapter 71, except as provided in 39-71-317 and 39-71-516.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Neustrom contends that we have previously interpreted these statutes to mean that once an \u201cindependent action\u201d is filed in district court, the district court maintains exclusive jurisdiction over that action and its \u201cintegral elements.\u201d In <em>Bohmer v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 289, 880 P.2d 816, an injured employee sued his employer in district court pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-515 and -516, MCA. After the employer agreed that it was uninsured, the employee petitioned the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to determine the benefits to which he was entitled. We addressed the issue of \u201cwhether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court had jurisdiction to determine the compensation to which an employee is entitled from an uninsured employer pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-515(4), <em>MCA.\u201d Bohmer, </em>880 P.2d at 817. In that case, we concluded that the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over such actions, and refused to \u201cinsert a [jurisdictional] limitation into \u00a7 39-71-516, MCA] where none exists.\u201d <em>Bohmer, </em>880 P.2d at 818. We were not persuaded by Bohmer\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s jurisdiction was limited to liability issues raised in \u00a7 39-71-515(2), MCA, and explained that \u201c[s]uch an interpretation would limit the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction to questions relating to [the employer\u2019s] failure to enroll in a compensation plan and would exclude the damages issue which is an integral element of the cause of action.\u201d <em>Bohmer, </em>880 P.2d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">In <em>Dunn, </em>the injured employee sued his allegedly uninsured employer in district court, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-515 and -516, MCA. Then, CNA Insurance filed a petition with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, seeking a determination that its policy provided workers\u2019 compensation insurance to the employer for the injury suffered by Dunn, the employee. <em>Dunn, 902 P.2d </em>at 1016. On appeal, CNA Insurance argued that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court had jurisdiction over its petition because, unlike the situation in <em>Bohmer, </em>where the extent of benefits was at issue, at issue in the present case was the uninsured status of the employer. <em>Dunn, </em>902 P.2d at 1017. We disagreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">These distinctions make no difference. In <em>Bohmer, </em>we found that once an independent action pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, is brought in district court, that district court has exclusive jurisdiction over any issues which are an integral part of the cause of action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Section 39-71-515, MCA, provides a cause of action which includes as an essential element the employer\u2019s failure to insure itself against workers\u2019 compensation claims. In order for Dunn to prevail in the District Court, he must prove that [his employer] was uninsured at the time of his injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><em>Dunn, </em>902 P.2d at 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Neustrom contends that, pursuant to <em>Bohmer </em>and <em>Dunn, </em>the District Court erred in concluding that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court has jurisdiction over the matters contained in his petition for writs of mandate and prohibition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Generally, the matters contained in Neustrom\u2019s petition relate to Neustrom\u2019s dispute <em>with UEF. </em>Particularly, Neustrom disputes UEF\u2019s jurisdiction to reverse its prior finding that Davis was not Neustrom\u2019s employee, and therefore disputes UEF\u2019s issuance of the \u201cAccounts Receivable Invoice\u201d and its stated requirement that Neustrom reimburse UEF for payments made on Davis\u2019s claim. These matters are unrelated to Davis\u2019s \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA, \u201cindependent action.\u201d Instead, they are the basis of a separate dispute over the propriety, jurisdictionally and otherwise, of actions taken by UEF in regard to Davis\u2019s pursuit of a remedy through that agency. Section 39-71-508, MCA, recognizes that an injured employee may concurrently pursue remedies according to separate causes of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">An employee who suffers an injury arising out of and in the course of employment while working for an uninsured employer as defined in 39-71-501 or an employee\u2019s beneficiaries in injuries resulting in death may pursue all remedies concurrently, including but not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">(1) a claim for benefits from the uninsured employers\u2019 fund;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">(3) an independent action against an employer as provided in 39-71-515; ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Neither <em>Bohmer </em>nor <em>Dunn </em>is inconsistent with the relevant statutory provisions, as neither case involved a concurrent claim for benefits from UEF and an \u201cindependent action\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-515, MCA. In <em>Bohmer, </em>we considered whether the \u201cindependent action\u201d could be decided in piecemeal fashion with the district court deciding the issue of liability and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court deciding the amount of compensation that was due. <em>Bohmer, </em>880 P.2d at 817. We held that pursuant to the plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-516 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>and -2905, MCA, the district court had exclusive jurisdiction to decide all issues related to the \u201cindependent action.\u201d <em>Bohmer, </em>880 P.2d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">In <em>Dunn, </em>the claimant had filed an \u201cindependent action\u201d in district court and the employer\u2019s insurer filed a petition in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to have the integral issue of whether the employer was, in fact, uninsured decided in a separate venue. <em>Dunn, </em>902 P.2dat 1016. Pursuant to <em>Bohmer, </em>and the plain language of the same two statutes, we correctly held that the \u201cindependent action\u201d cannot be split up and decided in piecemeal fashion. <em>Dunn, </em>902 P.2d at 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Neither <em>Bohmer </em>nor <em>Dunn </em>involved a claim for benefits from UEF, which the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act clearly provides must initially be made to the Department and appealed to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 39-71-503, MCA; \u00a7 39-71-204, MCA. Neither case discusses the specific provision in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act that the UEF claim can be filed concurrently with the \u201cindependent action\u201d over which the district court has exclusive jurisdiction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-71-508, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Neustrom\u2019s procedural and jurisdictional dispute with UEF over its handling of Davis\u2019s claim for benefits, and Davis\u2019s \u201cindependent action\u201d against Neustrom because of Neustrom\u2019s alleged failure to insure himself and his workers, are two separate disputes. Montana\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act allows these disputes to proceed along two separate tracks. Section 39-71-508, MCA. Neustrom\u2019s procedural and jurisdictional dispute with UEF is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, while Davis\u2019s \u201cindependent action\u201d against Neustrom is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the District Court. Section 39-71-2905, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The Act\u2019s plain requirement that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court decide issues related to UEF claims and the district court decide issues related to the \u201cindependent action\u201d will not, as is impliedly argued in the briefs, create potentially inconsistent results. The claimant must initiate both claims and is bound by principles of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel by the decision of the first venue to arrive at a decision. The claimant must take that reality into consideration when making a decision about which claim to file, or the timing of each claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The court correctly concluded that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court had exclusive jurisdiction over the matters contained in Neustrom\u2019s petition for writs of mandate and prohibition, and therefore correctly dismissed Neustrom\u2019s petition because he had a \u201cplain, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>speedy, and adequate remedy\u201d through an appeal to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b213-5\">JUSTICES GRAY, LEAPHART, NELSON and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
