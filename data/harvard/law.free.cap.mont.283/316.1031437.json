On July 21, 1995, the District Court entered an order denying Defendant Hanson\u2019s motion for new trial following a jury conviction of one count of sexual assault and one count of deviate sexual conduct. Subsequently, the District Court sentenced Hanson to two concurrent terms in the Montana State Prison. Hanson, through new counsel, appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">We restate the following issues raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">1. Are Defendant Hanson\u2019s claims of error reviewable under the common law plain error doctrine or alternatively under the cumulative error doctrine?</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">2. Was Defendant Hanson denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of trial counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">Emmy Gregg (Emmy) and her then four-year-old son, Aaron, lived across the street from Defendant Hanson (Hanson) in Whitefish, Montana. Emmy and Hanson met during the summer of 1990 and began dating in October 1990. By May 1991, Emmy and Aaron moved into Hanson\u2019s home. In June 1992, Emmy and Aaron moved out of Hanson\u2019s home; however, Emmy and Hanson continued dating until the fall of 1993. Aaron testified at trial that during the time they all lived together, Hanson sexually abused him. Apparently, at Hanson\u2019s request, all three would shower together to conserve hot water. And, at times, only Hanson and Aaron would shower together. Aaron testified at trial that during the times that he and Hanson showered alone, Hanson would wash Aaron\u2019s genital area and Aaron would wash Hanson\u2019s genital area. Also, Aaron testified that Hanson would tell Aaron to perform oral sex on him, which Aaron did on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>In the fall of 1993, Emmy became concerned about Aaron\u2019s behavior. In particular, Emmy noticed that Aaron was having nightmares about Hanson and expressed anger toward Hanson. Furthermore, Emmy noted that Aaron began wetting the bed, locking the door when he took baths, and hiding under the bed and in closets when the phone rang or someone came to the door. Emmy testified that when she asked Aaron on different occasions about any improper contact with Hanson, Aaron denied that it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">However, on March 24, 1994, Emmy met Detective Maxine Lamb of the Flathead County Sheriff\u2019s Department and discussed her concerns. That same day Detective Lamb went to Aaron\u2019s school to interview him. During her one-half hour interview with Aaron, he disclosed incidents involving Hanson which Detective Lamb believed described sexual abuse. On April 14, 1994, Hanson was charged by Information in the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, with one count of sexual assault and one count of deviate sexual conduct, both felonies, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-502(1) and \u00a7 45-5-505(1), MCA, respectively. At his May 27,1994 arraignment, Hanson plead not guilty. A jury trial commenced on March 6, 1995. On March 9, 1995, the jury returned a verdict of guilty to both counts. Hanson filed a motion for a new trial on April 7, 1995. The District Court denied Hanson\u2019s motion for a new trial on July 21, 1995, holding that the testimony of Aaron, Detective Lamb and Beatrice Rowe, Aaron\u2019s therapist, was all properly placed before the jury. On July 24, 1995, the District Court sentenced Hanson to twenty years in the Montana State Prison for the offense of sexual assault and ten years for the offense of deviate sexual conduct, both sentences to run concurrently. Hanson, now represented by different counsel, appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">1. Are Hanson\u2019s claims of error reviewable under the common law plain error doctrine or alternatively under the cumulative error doctrine?</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Hanson, through new appellate counsel, has raised numerous issues for the first time on appeal. Hanson contends that his trial was fundamentally unfair in violation of his rights under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and under Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution, and, therefore, his convictions should be reversed. Hanson concedes that these issues were not properly preserved for appellate review. However, Hanson alterna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>tively argues under both the plain error doctrine and under the cumulative error doctrine that this Court should, nonetheless, exercise its inherent power of appellate review conferred by the Montana Constitution to address the merits of his arguments and reverse his convictions. The State responds that neither doctrine is applicable in this case. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">In <em>State v. Finley </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 126, 137, 915 P.2d 208, 215, we explained that we employ the common law plain error doctrine only on a case by case basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">[T]his Court may discretionarily review claimed errors that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights, even if no contemporaneous objection is made and notwithstanding the inapplicability of the \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, criteria, where failing to review the claimed error at issue may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Furthermore, the doctrine of cumulative error refers to a number of errors which prejudice a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>State v. Close </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 229, 245, 623 P.2d 940, 948. However, \u201c[w]hile Montana recognizes that the accumulation of errors may prejudice a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, mere allegations of error without proof of prejudice are inadequate to satisfy the doctrine.\u201d <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 323, 329, 787 P.2d 329, 333 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Hanson begins by raising the three issues he previously presented to the District Court in his motion for new trial. First, Hanson asserts that Aaron\u2019s testimony was tainted and unreliable, and, therefore, should not have gone to the jury. Specifically, Hanson argues that Aaron\u2019s testimony was not reliable because Detective Lamb used coercive or suggestive interviewing techniques when she interviewed Aaron. Second, Hanson claims that Detective Lamb deliberately failed to preserve exculpatory evidence vital to the defense when she did not record her interview with Aaron, and, therefore, Hanson asserts the charges against him should be dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Yet, upon consideration of these two arguments, we note, as did the District Court, that Hanson failed to object to Aaron\u2019s testimony at the time of trial. Furthermore, as the District Court noted, Hanson himself called Detective Lamb to the witness stand in an effort to discredit her by questioning Detective Lamb about the deficiencies in her interviewing techniques and the absence of any video recording of her interview with Aaron. We agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>District Court\u2019s July 21,1995 Order wherein the court ruled that both the evidence of Detective Lamb\u2019s failure to preserve a record of her interview with Aaron as well as the effect of her interviewing techniques on the reliability of Aaron\u2019s testimony were properly considered by the jury. Consequently, Hanson\u2019s arguments that the District Court should have held a pretrial hearing to determine Aaron\u2019s reliability and that Detective Lamb\u2019s failure to videotape her interview with Aaron resulted in suppression of exculpatory evidence in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, are not properly before us on appeal and we decline to address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Third, Hanson argues that the State improperly presented the testimony of Beatrice Rowe (Rowe), Aaron\u2019s therapist, on rebuttal. Specifically, Hanson asserts that the defense never questioned Aaron\u2019s credibility, and, therefore, Rowe was precluded from testifying about her assessment of Aaron\u2019s credibility. While, on appeal, Hanson concedes that he did not properly preserve this issue for appeal, we note that his trial counsel did in fact make an objection to Rowe\u2019s rebuttal testimony which the District Court addressed in its July 21, 1995 Order denying Hanson\u2019s motion for a new trial. Consequently, we will review the merits of Hanson\u2019s argument on this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">We agree that an expert witness is generally not allowed to comment on the credibility of an alleged victim. However, an exception to this general rule is made in cases involving sexual abuse of a minor child when that child testifies and the child\u2019s credibility has been questioned. <em>State v. Harris </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 405, 410, 808 P.2d 453, 455. In this case, Aaron, who was eight years old at the time of trial, testified in person and Hanson, as apart of his defense strategy, questioned Aaron\u2019s credibility to show that Aaron had falsely accused him. In an effort to do this, Hanson elicited testimony from Jack Oakwright, Ph.D., an expert witness. Dr. Oakwright testified that a situation such as the bitter relationship between Emmy and Hanson, which Aaron witnessed, would raise a \u201cred flag\u201d that a child might make a false accusation. Accordingly, we agree with the District Court\u2019s July 21, 1995 Order, wherein the court ruled that Rowe\u2019s rebuttal testimony concerning Aaron\u2019s credibility was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Next, for the first time on appeal, Hanson specifies four errors made by the State which allegedly violated Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., and the due process clauses of the Montana Constitution and the United States Constitution. Specifically, Hanson asserts that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>State introduced testimony and evidence of other acts in violation of Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">First, Hanson argues that Emmy\u2019s testimony regarding the animosity present in their relationship is irrelevant to the question of whether Hanson abused Aaron. We decline to address this argument because Hanson not only failed to object to this testimony at trial, but, moreover, because Hanson himself elicited similar evidence regarding the bitter relationship between Emmy and himself as a part of his defense strategy to demonstrate that Emmy had a motive to encourage Aaron to make false claims against him regarding sexual abuse. Furthermore, Hanson asserts that the State demonstrated its ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant evidence as demonstrated by its objection to Hanson\u2019s testimony concerning Emmy\u2019s alleged propensity to deceive. Specifically, Hanson explains that he attempted to introduce evidence of a situation when Emmy purportedly called Hanson on three consecutive occasions requesting a ride home thereby causing him to drive repeatedly to a specific location when she was actually home the entire time. Hanson notes that the State objected to this testimony on the basis that this information was irrelevant to the question of whether Aaron was sexually abused. Consequently, Hanson argues that this proves that the only reason the State introduced Emmy\u2019s testimony regarding Hanson\u2019s actions during the course of their relationship was \u201cto destroy Dale Hanson\u2019s reputation and credibility with the jury.\u201d We disagree. After reviewing the record, we conclude that the District Court properly struck from the record and admonished the jury to disregard Hanson\u2019s testimony concerning this incident because Hanson failed to lay the proper foundation that Aaron was present when Emmy made these alleged phone calls to Hanson. The court properly reasoned that because Aaron did not witness these alleged interactions between Emmy and Hanson, it would not, contrary to Hanson\u2019s claim, affect Aaron\u2019s propensity to testify falsely against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Second, Hanson argues that Detective Lamb\u2019s answers to the State\u2019s questions concerning previous criminal investigations of Hanson regarding his relationship with Emmy constituted inappropriate comments on Hanson\u2019s character. Yet, Hanson failed to object to this testimony at trial. In fact, as the State points out, it was Hanson who called Detective Lamb to the stand, and, consequently, the State\u2019s cross-examination questions pertaining to these investigations merely responded to the testimony that Hanson previously elicited from Detective Lamb during direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Third, Hanson asserts that the State\u2019s cross-examination of him went beyond the scope of direct examination. Hanson contends that the State suggested that he fit the profile of an abuser by asking Hanson questions which implied that Hanson had been sexually abused himself as a child. Additionally, Hanson contends that the State attempted to portray him as a racist by asking questions regarding Hanson\u2019s alleged thoughts concerning the connection between Emmy\u2019s drinking history and her Native American heritage. Again, Hanson failed to object to the State\u2019s cross-examination questions. Moreover, as the State notes, Hanson put before the jury the issue of his relationship with Emmy as a part of his defense strategy, and, therefore, the prosecution properly cross-examined Hanson regarding a number of different issues to further illuminate the nature of his relationship with Emmy.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Fourth, Hanson claims that the State improperly impeached him by introducing hostile notes that Hanson had left on Emmy\u2019s car. Hanson argues that the State only introduced these notes to show that Hanson was a \u201cbad man.\u201d Yet, upon review of the record, we note that Hanson denied being jealous of Emmy, and, consequently, the hostile notes were properly introduced to impeach Hanson\u2019s prior testimony. Furthermore, Hanson was given the opportunity to object to the introduction of these notes when the State made a sidebar offer of proof and Hanson expressly stated he had no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">We recognize that under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., \u201c[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d However, we again note that Hanson failed to object to any of this evidence during the trial. Moreover, the strategy of the defense was to show that Emmy was vindictive toward Hanson and that this animosity would have caused her to compel Aaron to testify falsely against Hanson, and, consequently, much of the testimony regarding the bitter relationship between Emmy and Hanson was elicited by Hanson himself as a part of his defense strategy. Accordingly, we agree with the State that the evidence to which Hanson now objects on appeal was not evidence of other acts prohibited by Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Finally, Hanson argues that the State made inappropriate remarks in its closing argument. Specifically, Hanson refers to a portion of the State\u2019s closing argument in which he claims that the prosecutor inappropriately accused the defense expert, Jack Oakwright, Ph.D., of lying. We note that in one part of the closing argument, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>prosecutor said to the jury, \u201cI don\u2019t think [Dr. Oakwright] was being honest with you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">We have stated numerous times that \u201cit is highly improper [for an attorney] to characterize either the accused or the witnesses as liars or offer personal opinions as to credibility\u201d because it improperly invades the province of the jury. <em>State v. Stringer </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 367, 380, 897 P.2d 1063, 1071 (citations omitted). However, we will not consider it reversible error every time an attorney comments on the credibility of a witness. <em>Stringer, </em>897 P.2d at 1071. As we stated in <em>Stringer, </em>a prosecutor may comment on contradictions and conflicts in the testimony, however, \u201cit [is] the task of the jury to determine which testimony and evidence was more believable.\u201d <em>Stringer, </em>897 P.2d at 1071 (citation omitted). Here, the prosecutor erred by offering a personal opinion as to Dr. Oakwright\u2019s credibility, yet Hanson failed to make a contemporaneous objection to the prosecutor\u2019s statements. Moreover, based upon our review of the prosecutor\u2019s entire closing argument, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s isolated comment concerning Dr. Oakwright\u2019s credibility, in context, is not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In summary, after considering Hanson\u2019s arguments and reviewing the record, we agree with the State that much of the error about which Hanson now complains was a part of his own defense strategy to demonstrate that Aaron falsely accused Hanson of sexual abuse due to Emmy\u2019s antagonism and ill will toward Hanson. In fact, with the exception of Hanson\u2019s objection to Rowe\u2019s rebuttal testimony, Hanson not only failed to object to this evidence at trial, but in some instances actually solicited the evidence about which he now complains. Consequently, we conclude that these alleged errors do not rise to the level of a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial system. See <em>Finley, </em>915 P.2d at 215. Therefore, we decline to invoke the plain error doctrine to review the issues that Hanson raises for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Additionally, Hanson has failed to prove he was prejudiced by either the challenged testimony or the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing argument. Rather, we agree with the State that these alleged errors were either trial strategy, proper rebuttal, or appropriate comments contrasting evidence. Consequently, we conclude that the doctrine of cumulative error also is not applicable in this case. See <em>Campbell, </em>787 P.2d at 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Because we decline to apply the plain error doctrine, and because the doctrine of cumulative error is not applicable, we decline to address Hanson\u2019s allegations of error further.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">2. Was Hanson denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of trial counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Despite Hanson\u2019s failure to preserve the previously discussed issues for appeal and despite our refusal to review the merits of his arguments on the basis of plain or cumulative error, he asserts that we should also review these same issues within the context of his ineffective assistance of counsel argument. We evaluate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel using the two-part test as set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. <em>State v. Boyer </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 143, 147, 695 P.2d 829, 831. First, a defendant must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance was so deficient that it fell below the level of competency reasonably demanded of attorneys under the Sixth Amendment. Second, a defendant must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s deficient performance was so prejudicial that he was denied a fair trial. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. The first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis is based upon an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-65. Moreover, \u201cjudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. Accordingly, the United States Supreme Court warned against \u201csecond-guessing\u201d counsel\u2019s assistance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time. Because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation, a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u201cmight be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d There are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case. Even the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajs\"><em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Hanson first argues that his counsel was ineffective because he did not object to Aaron\u2019s testimony and he failed to request a pretrial hearing to assess the reliability of Aaron\u2019s testimony to determine its admissibility as required by <em>State v. Michaels </em>(N.J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>1994), 642 A.2d 1372. Yet, as the State points out, Hanson\u2019s counsel\u2019s trial strategy was to demonstrate that Aaron\u2019s testimony was unreliable, which he attempted to do through the testimony of Detective Lamb and Dr. Oakwright. Testing a witness\u2019s credibility through the presentation of other witnesses and cross-examination is a traditional and widely accepted method. Furthermore, Hanson\u2019s counsel had no duty to rely on <em>Michaels, </em>which is not the law in Montana in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Hanson next argues that his counsel was ineffective because he did not object to Detective Lamb\u2019s testimony or the testimony of Beatrice Rowe, Aaron\u2019s therapist. Again, as previously discussed, Hanson\u2019s counsel called Detective Lamb to the stand and he did so in accordance with his trial strategy to show that Aaron\u2019s testimony was unreliable because Detective Lamb used suggestive or coercive interviewing techniques during her interview with Aaron. Furthermore, as previously noted, Hanson\u2019s counsel did in fact object to Rowe\u2019s rebuttal testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Additionally, Hanson argues that his counsel was ineffective because he made no objection to the attacks on Hanson\u2019s character. Again, because the essence of the defense strategy was to demonstrate that Aaron testified falsely against Hanson due to the bitter and vindictive relationship between Emmy and Hanson, Hanson\u2019s original counsel made no objection. Finally, Hanson claims that his counsel was ineffective because his counsel failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks. We previously concluded that, in context, the prosecutor was merely comparing and contrasting evidence in her closing arguments. While the one reference to Dr. Oakwright\u2019s honesty may have been improper, trial counsel\u2019s failure to object does not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">While Hanson argues that he was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, we note that his complaints actually center on his disapproval of his original counsel's trial strategy. Under the circumstances, we will not second guess his counsel\u2019s assistance. See <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. While Hanson\u2019s trial counsel's strategy was not successful, we are not prepared to hold that as a matter of law it was ineffective for Sixth Amendment purposes. Counsel\u2019s strategy might well have prevailed with some other jury; it simply did not persuade the trial jury in this case. We conclude that Hanson has failed to demonstrate that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was so deficient that it fell below the level of competency reasonably demanded of attorneys under the Sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Amendment. See <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. Because we reach this conclusion, there is no need to address the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. Accordingly, we hold that Hanson was not denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">In summary, we decline to address, under the plain error doctrine or under the cumulative error doctrine, Hanson\u2019s arguments that his trial was fundamentally unfair in violation of his rights under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and under Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. Additionally, we hold that Hanson was not denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b355-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES REGNIER, GRAY and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
