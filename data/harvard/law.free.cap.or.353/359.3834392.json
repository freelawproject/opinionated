The questions arise out of an action for personal injury brought in federal district court against defendant Boyle and his employer, the City of Beaverton, for injuries that plaintiff suffered in an automobile collision with a police car that defendant Boyle drove. A jury found that plaintiff and Boyle were equally at fault and that plaintiff\u2019s damages totaled approximately $1 million. The trial court reduced the award by half, in accordance with the jury\u2019s findings of comparative fault. Defendants then moved to reduce the award further, to the $200,000 limit of the Oregon Tort Claims Act in existence at the time. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that the application of the statutory limitation would violate the remedy clause of Article I, section 10, of the Oregon Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Defendants appealed, and the Ninth Circuit certified the following questions to this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">\u201c1. Is [plaintiff\u2019s] negligence action constitutionally protected under the Oregon [C]onstitution\u2019s remedy clause, Or. Const, art. I, \u00a7 10, irrespective of the jury\u2019s finding of comparative negligence? To what extent, if any, do the common[-]law defenses to contributory negligence of last clear chance, the emergency doctrine, and gross negligence [a]ffect this determination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\"><em>\u201c2. </em>If [plaintiff\u2019s] action is protected, is $200,000 an unconstitutional emasculated remedy despite the jury\u2019s finding of comparative negligence? To what extent, if any, do the common[-]law defenses to contributory negligence of last clear chance, the emergency doctrine, and gross negligence [a]ffect this determination?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">We address the second question only, because its answer is dispositive. Even assuming for the sake of argument that, under the circumstances of this case, plaintiff\u2019s negligence action is constitutionally protected by Article I, section 10, the $200,000 limitation on her recovery is constitutionally permissible. Under this court\u2019s case law, the constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>requires that any remedy that remains after the imposition of a modern limitation on it be \u201csubstantial.\u201d In this case, the $200,000 judgment that plaintiff received satisfies that constitutional requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">To provide context for the Ninth Circuit\u2019s questions and our answer, we begin with a more detailed description of the facts and the procedural history of the case. In 2007, defendant Boyle, a City of Beaverton police officer, drove a motor vehicle west on the Tualatin Valley Highway. He struck plaintiff as she attempted to cross the highway at an unmarked crosswalk. As a result of that incident, plaintiff suffered serious injuries leading to permanent disability and significant medical expenses. Plaintiff brought a diversity action in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, naming as defendants both Boyle and his employer, the City of Beaverton. Plaintiff alleged $4,779,529.25 in economic damages and up to $1 million in noneconomic damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Defendants answered, alleging that, among other things, plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused by her own negligence because she had been \u201cdarting\u201d across an unsafe intersection late at night while wearing dark clothes. In addition, defendants alleged that plaintiff\u2019s claims are subject to the \u201cconditions, limitations, procedures and immunities contained in the Oregon Tort Claims Act.\u201d Specifically, defendants alleged that, because Boyle had acted within the course and scope of his employment, plaintiff could not maintain a claim against him and, under ORS 30.265(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was required instead to substitute the City of Beaverton. They also alleged that, in any event, to the extent that they are found liable, such liability is limited by the version of the Oregon Tort Claims Act then in effect to a maximum of $200,000. ORS 31.270(l)(b) (2007).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Defendants moved to dismiss Boyle from the case pursuant to ORS 30.265(1). Plaintiff opposed the motion on the ground that, under this court\u2019s decision in <em>Clarke v. OHSU, </em>343 Or 581, 175 P3d 418 (2007), to preclude the action against Boyle would violate plaintiff\u2019s right to a remedy guaranteed by Article I, section 10, of the Oregon Constitution. The trial court agreed and denied defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The case was tried to a jury, which determined that plaintiff and Boyle each were 50 percent at fault. The jury further found that plaintiff had incurred $765,000 in economic damages and $250,000 in noneconomic damages, for a total of $1,015,000. In accordance with the jury\u2019s findings of comparative fault, the court reduced plaintiff\u2019s damages by 50 percent and entered judgment against defendants for $382,500 in economic damages and $125,000 in noneconomic damages, for a total of $507,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Defendants then moved to amend the judgment to reduce the amount of damages to the $200,000 statutory limit. Plaintiff opposed the motion on the ground that applying the Oregon Tort Claims Act limit to this case \u201cemasculated\u201d her common-law remedy against defendants in violation of the remedy clause of Article I, section 10, of the Oregon Constitution. The trial court agreed with plaintiff and denied defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Defendants appealed to the Ninth Circuit, contending that the trial court had erred in denying their motion to reduce the judgment to the limits provided in ORS 31.270(1) (b) (2007). They advanced two arguments in support of that contention. First, they argued that, under this court\u2019s decision in <em>Lawson v. Hoke, </em>339 Or 253, 119 P3d 210 (2005), Article I, section 10, does not even apply because plaintiff\u2014 having been found 50 percent at fault \u2014 would not have been able to recover anything under common-law negligence as it existed at the time of the framing of the Oregon Constitution. According to defendants, under the law prevailing at that time, contributory negligence in <em>any </em>amount on the part of the plaintiff operated as a complete bar to recovery. Second, they argued that, even if Article I, section 10, otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>applies, the $200,000 cap is a constitutionally adequate remedy under this court\u2019s recent precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">In response to defendants\u2019 first argument, plaintiff asserted that whether her fault would have precluded recovery under the law that existed at the time of the adoption of the state constitution is irrelevant. The sole and determinative issue, she argued, is whether she could have stated a claim for negligence, not whether the law at the time would have entitled her to a remedy. In the alternative, plaintiff argued that, even if it were appropriate to take into account defenses to a negligence action that would have applied in 1857, such as contributory negligence, the fact remains that the law recognized exceptions to that defense in cases of gross negligence, conditions of emergency, and circumstances in which the defendant had the \u201clast clear chance\u201d to avoid the injury. In response to defendants\u2019 second argument, plaintiff asserted that the limits established in ORS 31.270(l)(b) (2007) failed to provide a constitutionally adequate remedy because that statute indisputably prevented her from recovering the full amount of her damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Following the filing of the parties\u2019 briefing on the foregoing points, the Ninth Circuit entered an order certifying the two questions to which we have referred. This court accepted the certified questions and allowed further briefing. Before this court, the parties essentially reprise the arguments that they made to the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Article I, section 10, of the Oregon Constitution provides, in part, that \u201cevery man shall have remedy by due course of law for injury done him in his person, property, or reputation.\u201d The provision is commonly referred to as the state constitutional \u201cremedy clause.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Juarez v. Windsor Rock Products, Inc., </em>341 Or 160, 164, 144 P3d 211 (2006) (referring to Article I, section 10, as containing a \u201cremedy clause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>A. <em>Prior Case Law on the Constitutional Adequacy of a Remedy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">This court has confronted constitutional challenges to various types of statutory remedy limitations in several previous cases, dating back at least to its 1901 decision in <em>Mattson v. Astoria, </em>39 Or 577, 65 P 1066 (1901). In that case, the plaintiff initiated an action against the City of Astoria for injuries that were said to have been caused by the city\u2019s negligent maintenance of its public streets. The city invoked a provision of its charter, adopted pursuant to legislative authorization, exempting it and any of its council members from liability for such negligence. The lower court held the charter provision unconstitutional, and this court affirmed. The court explained that it is \u201cunquestioned\u201d that \u201cit is within the power of a legislature to exempt a city from liability to persons receiving injuries on account of streets being defective or out of repair.\u201d Id. at 579. The injured party, the court explained, \u201cis not wholly without remedy,\u201d because he or she may proceed against city officers or employees who have been delegated the duty of keeping the streets in repair. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, the court continued, the City of Astoria\u2019s charter purported to exempt both the city and its officers and employees, thus amounting to \u201ca denial of any remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580. Under Article I, section 10, the court explained, the legislature cannot \u201cdeny a remedy entirely.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AuE\">In <em>Evanhoff v. State Industrial Acc. Com., </em>78 Or 503, 154 P 106 (1915), the court took a similar approach to the adequacy of remedies under Article I, section 10. In that case, the plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of an early version of this state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation legislation. Among other things, he contended that it violated the remedy clause of Article I, section 10. The court dismissed that particular argument summarily, noting that, at that time, the workers\u2019 compensation system was entirely voluntary. <em>Id. </em>at 517. Then, in <em>dictum, </em>the court went on to observe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">\u201cMany of the states for many years have had statutes fixing the liability with precision in cases of death, and in no instance has any court held such statute invalid. And why a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>statute cannot fix with certainty the damages to be allowed in case of the loss of an arm, leg, eye or other injury is not perceived, and counsel fail to state any legal or constitutional objection thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 518 (quoting <em>Hawkins v. Bleakley, </em>220 Fed 378, 381 (SD Iowa 1914)).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The following year, in <em>Humphry v. Portland, </em>79 Or 430, 154 P 897 (1916), the court more explicitly cited <em>Mattson </em>for the proposition that Article I, section 10, prohibits only legislation that leaves a plaintiff wholly without a remedy. Under that constitutional provision, the court stated, \u201ca right of action to recover damages for an injury *** sustained cannot be so abridged by legislation as to deprive the injured party of all remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440. <em>Noonan v. City of Portland, </em>161 Or 213, 88 P2d 808 (1939), followed suit. In that case, the court upheld a city charter granting immunity to the city itself, but not to city officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">In <em>Hale v. Port of Portland, </em>308 Or 508, 523, 783 P2d 506 (1989), the court again held that Article I, section 10, prohibits limitations on common-law actions that leave a plaintiff \u201centirely without a remedy.\u201d In that case, the plaintiff suffered injuries in a motor vehicle collision. He sued several defendants, including the City of Portland, which the plaintiff alleged was negligent in maintaining the road where the accident occurred. He sought more than $600,000 in damages. The city moved to strike the claim for damages in excess of the $100,000 limitation that the Oregon Tort Claims Act then imposed. The trial court granted the motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. On review, the plaintiff argued that, among other things, the statutory damage limitation violated Article I, section 10. This court rejected the argument. Reviewing its prior cases \u2014 in particular, <em>Noonan </em>and <em>Evanhoff </em>\u2014 the court explained that those decisions \u201cheld only that Article I, section 10, is not violated when the legislature alters * * * a cause of action, so long as the party injured is not left entirely without a remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523. \u201c[I]t is enough,\u201d the court declared, \u201cthat the remedy is a substantial one.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">In determining that the limitation on the plaintiff\u2019s damages did not deprive him of a \u201csubstantial\u201d remedy, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>court observed that the statutory damage limitation applied regardless of whether the damages that a plaintiff suffered arose out of a governmental or proprietary function. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court noted, the challenged statute represented a <em>quid pro quo. </em>On the one hand, it limited the amount of damages that could be recovered, while on the other hand, it expanded the types of cases that could trigger municipal liability by eliminating the traditional immunity that applied when damages arose as a result of a municipality performing a governmental function:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\">\u201cThe class of plaintiffs has been widened by the legislature by removing the requirement that an injured party show that the municipal corporation\u2019s activity that led to the injury was a proprietary one. At the same time, however, a limit has been placed on the size of the award that may be recovered. A benefit has been conferred, but a counterbalancing burden has been imposed. This may work to the disadvantage of some, while it will work to the advantage of others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\"><em>Id. </em>The court did not say that such a <em>quid pro quo </em>was <em>required </em>to satisfy the requirements of Article I, section 10. But it concluded that such a \u201cnew balance\u201d was clearly within the legislature\u2019s authority, notwithstanding the limitations of the remedy clause. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">In <em>Neher v. Chartier, </em>319 Or 417, 879 P2d 156 (1994), this court again addressed the constitutionality of a statutory limitation on damages. In that case, the plaintiff\u2019s daughter was killed when she was struck by a Tri-Met bus driven by the defendant, Chartier. The daughter was acting within the scope of her employment at the time of the accident, and, under existing workers\u2019 compensations statutes, the estate recovered the maximum $3,000 burial benefit. The plaintiff, as the representative of the estate, then initiated an action against Chartier and Tri-Met. The defendants, however, moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that they were immune under a provision of the Oregon Tort Claims Act that granted immunity to public bodies and their employees for claims arising out of injuries that were covered by workers\u2019 compensation law. The trial court granted the motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the substitute remedy of workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>compensation benefits for tort damages did not leave the plaintiff wholly without a remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">This court disagreed, in part. Citing its earlier decision in <em>Hale, </em>the court first noted that Article I, section 10, \u201cis not violated \u2018so long as the party injured is not left entirely without a remedy/\u201d and that remedy is \u201c\u2018substantial.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426 (quoting <em>Hale, </em>308 Or at 523). With that standard in mind, the court concluded that the estate itself had not been left wholly without a remedy, as it was entitled to $3,000 in burial expenses under the workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>Neher, </em>319 Or at 426. But, the court said, the estate was not the only real party in interest in a wrongful death action; the decedent\u2019s parents also were parties, and they were not entitled to those benefits. \u201cThus,\u201d the court concluded, \u201calthough the decedent\u2019s estate (for which a parent happens to serve as a personal representative) has not been left \u2018wholly without remedy/ the surviving parents of the decedent, who otherwise would be entitled to recover, * * * <em>have </em>been left wholly without a remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426-27 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">In <em>Greist v. Phillips, </em>322 Or 281, 906 P2d 789 (1995), the court addressed the constitutionality of another statutory limitation on damages, in that case ORS 18.560(1), which imposed a $500,000 limitation on noneconomic damage awards.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff had been awarded economic damages of $100,000 and noneconomic damages of $1.5 million, but the trial court reduced the award of noneconomic damages in accordance with the statutory limitation. On review, the plaintiff argued that the limitation on the noneconomic damage award violated Article I, section 10. Specifically, the plaintiff argued that the statutory limitation \u201cwholly denies a remedy for legitimate losses that exceed $500,000.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290. This court rejected the argument. Citing both <em>Hale </em>and <em>Neher, </em>the court held that \u201c[p]laintiff has not been left without a remedy. She has received $600,000, comprised of $500,000 in noneconomic damages and $100,000 in economic damages. * * * Although that remedy is not precisely of the same extent as that to which plaintiff was entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>before the enactment of ORS 18.560(1), that remedy is substantial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291. The court held that the remedy was substantial, among other things, \u201cbecause 100 percent of economic damages plus up to $500,000 in noneconomic damages is a substantial amount.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court\u2019s holding in <em>Greist </em>prompted a concurring opinion from Justice Unis, who took the court to task for applying a substantial remedy test, which he argued was \u201cvague and gives no guidance to legislators, litigants, or ordinary citizens as to how courts will apply the standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311 (Unis, J., concurring in part, specially concurring in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">In <em>Smothers v. Gresham Transfer, Inc., </em>332 Or 83, 124, 23 P3d 333 (2001), the court engaged in a wholesale reevaluation of its remedy clause jurisprudence. The court engaged in an extended historical analysis of the scope and effect of the remedy clause and established a new method of analysis of claims arising under it. 332 Or at 123-24. In that case, the plaintiff had been injured in a work-related accident. He filed a claim under the state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statutes, but that claim was denied. He then filed a claim for negligence against his employer. <em>Id. </em>at 86. The employer responded with a motion to dismiss the claim on the face of the pleadings on the ground that the workers\u2019 compensation statutes provided the exclusive remedy for work-related injuries. The trial court granted the employer\u2019s motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>Smothers v. Gresham Transfer, Inc., </em>149 Or App 49, 941 P2d 1065 (1997). This court reversed, holding that the trial court should not have granted the employer\u2019s motion to dismiss because the statute providing that the workers\u2019 compensation law is the exclusive remedy for work-related injuries violated the remedy clause. <em>Smothers, </em>332 Or at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">In brief, the court explained that the remedy clause of Article I, section 10, was \u201cintended to preserve common-law right[s] of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119. The court summarized its analysis in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">\u201cDrafters of remedy clauses in state constitutions sought to protect absolute common-law rights by mandating that a remedy always would be available for injury to those rights. The drafters of the Oregon remedy clause identified abso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>lute rights respecting person, property, and reputation as meriting constitutional protection under the remedy clause. As to those rights, the remedy clause provides, in mandatory terms, that remedy by due course of law shall be available to every person in the event of injury. The word \u2018remedy\u2019 refers both to a remedial process for seeking redress for injury and to what is required to restore a right that has been injured. Injury, in turn, is a wrong or harm for which a cause of action existed when the drafters wrote the Oregon Constitution in 1857. A common-law cause of action is a constitutionally adequate remedy for seeking redress for injury to protected rights. However, the remedy clause does not freeze in place common-law causes of action that existed when the drafters wrote the Oregon Constitution in 1857. The legislature may abolish a common-law cause of action, so long as it provides a substitute remedial process in the event of an injury to the absolute rights that the remedy clause protects.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 124.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court then articulated a method of analyzing claims brought under the remedy clause that consists of answering two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">\u201c[I]n analyzing a claim under the remedy clause, the first question is whether the plaintiff has alleged an injury to one of the absolute rights that Article I, section 10 [,] protects. Stated differently, when the drafters wrote the Oregon Constitution in 1857, did the common law of Oregon recognize a cause of action for the alleged injury? If the answer to that question is yes, and if the legislature has abolished the common-law cause of action for injury to rights that are protected by the remedy clause, then the second question is whether it has provided a constitutionally adequate substitute remedy for the common-law cause of action for that injury\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Turning to the particulars of that case, the court determined that the plaintiff\u2019s action for negligence against his employer would have been recognized at common law in 1857 and that, because the exclusive remedy provision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the workers\u2019 compensation statutes completely eliminated that common-law remedy, the statute was unconstitutional: \u201cHaving alleged an injury of the kind that the remedy clause protects, and having demonstrated that there was no remedial process available under present workers\u2019 compensation laws, plaintiff should have been allowed to proceed with his negligence action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Thus, under <em>Smothers, </em>the initial question is whether, under the circumstances of the case, the common law of Oregon would have recognized a cause of action for the claimed injury. If the answer to that question is no, then the remedy clause is not implicated, and the matter is at an end. If the answer to the first question is yes, then we must determine whether a challenged limitation renders the common-law remedy constitutionally inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"><em>Smothers </em>did not supply much in the way of explanation as to how we are to determine the adequacy of a remedy under Article I, section 10. The court noted that, in its prior cases, it had never held \u201cthat the remedy clause prohibits the legislature from changing a common-law remedy or form of procedure, attaching conditions precedent to invoking the remedy, or perhaps even abolishing old remedies and substituting new remedies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119. That said, the court declared that neither can the legislature substitute an \u201c\u2019emasculated remedy\u2019 that is incapable of restoring the right that has been injured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119-20. In that regard, the court explicitly noted that, in <em>Hale, Neher, </em>and <em>Greist, </em>it had concluded that a remedy is adequate under Article I, section 10, so long as it is \u201csubstantial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120 n 19. The court stated that it was simply \u201cbeyond the scope of this opinion to address issues relating to the adequacy of the amount of damages that may be available under a legislatively substituted process.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\"><em>Clarke v. OHSU, </em>343 Or 581, 175 P3d 418 (2007), was the first post <em>-Smothers </em>decision to address the constitutionality of a statutory damage limitation in any detail.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In that case, the plaintiff suffered permanent brain damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>as a direct consequence of the negligence of Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) and certain of its employees and agents. <em>Id. </em>at 586. The damages resulting from his injuries totaled more than $17 million. <em>Id. </em>The defendants, however, admitted negligence and, invoking the damage limitation of the Oregon Tort Claims Act, moved for entry of judgment against them for $200,000. <em>Id. </em>at 587. The trial court granted the motion and entered judgment accordingly. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">On review, the plaintiff argued that the statutory damage limitation of $200,000 violated Article I, section 10. <em>Id. </em>The court held that, because OHSU was an instrumentality of the state that would have been immune from liability at common law, the limitation of its liability posed no issue of constitutional adequacy under the remedy clause. As to the individual defendants, however, the court concluded that the statutory damage limitation was unconstitutional on the facts of that case. <em>Id. </em>at 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The court began its opinion in <em>Clarke </em>by recapitulating its prior cases on the subject, including <em>Hale, Neher, Greist, Smothers, </em>and <em>Jensen. Id. </em>at 601-06. Among other things, the court quoted with approval the portion of <em>Hale </em>that described the proper analysis of the adequacy of a remedy under Article I, section 10, as depending on whether the existing remedy \u201cis a <em>substantial one;\u201d </em>indeed, the <em>Clarke </em>court added its own emphasis to the words \u201csubstantial one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602. Consistently with that emphasis, the court summarized the significance of its prior cases in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u201c[A]s our review of the cases demonstrates, Article I, section 10, does not eliminate the power of the legislature to vary and modify both the form and the measure of recovery for an injury, as long as it does not leave the injured party with an \u2018emasculated\u2019 version of the remedy that was available at common law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 606. The court acknowledged that neither the constitution itself nor the prior case law provides a precise test for determining whether a particular remedy has been \u201cemasculated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Having said that, the court concluded that the disposition of the case before it was \u201crelatively simple,\u201d given the fact that the statutory damage limitation deprived the plaintiff of all but a very small portion of the over $17 million in damages that he suffered. <em>Id. </em>at 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">To the defendants\u2019 argument that even the relatively small amount allowed by the statutory limitation was sufficient under <em>Hale </em>and <em>Greist, </em>the court replied that those cases were distinguishable on their facts. In Clarke\u2019s case, the court held, the claim of the plaintiff against the individual defendants had been essentially eliminated. The court reiterated that \u201cthe legislature is authorized under Article I, section 10, to vary or modify the nature, the form, or the amount of recovery for a common-law remedy,\u201d but added that \u201cthat authority is not unlimited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In a concurring opinion, Justices B aimer and Kistler emphasized that, although <em>Hale </em>and <em>Greist </em>were distinguishable on their facts, \u201cnothing in the majority opinion undermines the holdings in those cases that the [r]emedy [c]lause does not prohibit the legislature from imposing caps on tort damages as long as those caps do not deprive a plaintiff of a \u2018substantial remedy.\u2019\u201d Id. at 615-16 (Balmer, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The foregoing case law consistently holds that the legislature is authorized to enact a limitation on tort claim recovery so long as the remaining remedy is \u201csubstantial.\u201d As the court declared \u2014 twice\u2014in <em>Clarke, </em>Article I, section 10, does not deprive the legislature of the authority \u201cto vary and modify both the form <em>and the measure of recovery </em>for an injury,\u201d so long as the legislature does not leave the injured party with an \u201cemasculated\u201d remedy. 343 Or at 606 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>(emphasis added); <em>id. </em>at 609 (the legislature is authorized \u201cto vary, or modify the nature, the form, <em>or the amount of recovery </em>for a common-law remedy\u201d (emphasis added)). The reference to \u201cemasculated\u201d remedies is unfortunate, if not sexist,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and we discourage its further use in favor of the references in the case law to the necessity that remaining remedies be \u201csubstantial.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">B. <em>Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">With those considerations in mind, we turn to this case. Under <em>Smothers, </em>we confront two questions. First, we must determine \u201cwhether an \u2018absolute common-law right\u2019 that existed when the Oregon Constitution was drafted in 1857 would have provided plaintiff with a remedy for the injuries that she sustained in the accident with defendant.\u201d <em>Lawson, </em>339 Or at 259. For the purposes of this opinion, we assume, without deciding, that the answer to that question is, yes. <em>See Jensen, </em>334 Or at 418 (assuming, without deciding, that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was protected by Article I, section 10, \u201cbecause the second step of the <em>Smothers </em>analytical framework is dispositive\u201d). That triggers a second question; namely, whether the legislatively adopted limitation on that remedy is \u201cconstitutionally adequate.\u201d <em>Smothers, </em>332 Or at 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">As we have noted, under this court\u2019s prior case law, the constitutional adequacy of a modern remedy may be established by the fact that the modern remedy is \u201csubstantial\u201d and does not leave the plaintiff \u201cwholly without remedy.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>In this case, defendants contend that plaintiff\u2019s remedy of $200,000 is constitutionally adequate under that test. Defendants are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The cases make clear that the mere fact that the statutory limitation resulted in a reduction in the amount that plaintiff otherwise would have been awarded, by itself, does not establish a violation of Article I, section 10. As this court explained in <em>Clarke, </em>Article I, section 10, does not deprive the legislature of the authority \u201cto vary and modify both the form <em>and the measure of recovery </em>for an injury,\u201d so long as the legislature leaves the plaintiff with a substantial remedy. 343 Or at 606 (emphasis added). Likewise, in <em>Hale, </em>the court declared that \u201cArticle I, section 10, is not violated when the legislature alters * * * a cause of action, so long as the party injured is not left entirely without a remedy. * * * [I]t is enough that the remedy is a substantial one.\u201d 308 Or at 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">This court has never spelled out the precise contours of such a determination. Such precision is perhaps impossible. <em>See Clarke, </em>343 Or at 613 (Balmer, J., concurring) (\u201cThis court has not articulated a precise test, and it probably is not possible to do so.\u201d). As this court has stated in another context, determining whether an award of damages is \u201csubstantial\u201d requires \u201cflexibility and a consideration of the facts and circumstances that each case presents.\u201d <em>Hamlin v. Hampton Lumber Mills, Inc., </em>349 Or 526, 537, 246 P3d 1121 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">This court has concluded that a legislative limitation on damages is constitutionally inadequate in only two cases, <em>Neher </em>and <em>Clarke. </em>In the former case, the court held that, although the estate of the victim had not been completely deprived of a remedy by virtue of the existence of a $3,000 burial benefit under workers\u2019 compensation law, the parents of the victim had been <em>totally </em>deprived of any remedy. In the latter case, this court held that, when the statutory limitation of $200,000 deprived the plaintiffs of all but one percent of the more than $17 million in damages that they would have otherwise recovered, the limitation left them with a constitutionally inadequate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>In this case, but for the $200,000 damage limitation of ORS 31.270(l)(b) (2007), plaintiff would have recovered a total of $507,500, consisting of $382,500 in economic damages and $125,000 in noneconomic damages. The damage limitation thus does not leave plaintiff \u201cwholly without a remedy\u201d as was the case for the parents of the plaintiff in <em>Neher. </em>And it represents a far more substantial remedy than the paltry fraction that remained after the imposition of the limitation in <em>Clarke.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The facts of this case are much more like those of <em>Hale, </em>in which the court found that a statutory damage limitation of $100,000 left the plaintiff with a substantial remedy even though the plaintiff had alleged more than $600,000 in damages. To be sure, this court observed that the legislature, in adopting the statutory damage limitation at issue in that case, had in effect exchanged the limitation for a statutory expansion of the class of persons who are permitted to sue. 308 Or at 523. But the distinction is of no moment in this case, in which a similar <em>quid pro quo </em>may be seen to apply. As to defendant City of Beaverton, in fact, the same \u201cbalance\u201d that the court mentioned in <em>Hale </em>applies. As to defendant Boyle, under ORS 30.265(1) and 30.285(1), the city remains liable for the torts of its employees committed within the scope of employment. Thus, while the legislature limited the amount that may be recovered from individual defendants who are municipal employees, it substituted the \u201cdeep pocket\u201d of the municipality itself as the ultimate payor. Plaintiffs, in other words, have been conferred a substantial benefit in exchange for the damage limitation. As <em>Hale </em>makes clear, that is a permissible legislative decision under Article I, section 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">This case is even more like <em>Greist, </em>in which the court held that the plaintiff was not left without a remedy when the tort claim limitation left her with a total of $600,000 in damages, compared with the initial award of $1.5 million. \u201cAlthough that remedy is not precisely of the same extent as that to which plaintiff was entitled\u201d before the imposition of the limitation, the court explained, \u201cthat remedy is substantial.\u201d 322 Or at 291. The same is true in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Plaintiff insists that her common-law right to recover damages for negligence has been inadequately remedied with the $200,000 tort claim limitation. She reasons that, \u201cunder the common law, the plaintiff had the right to obtain a full recovery for damages from the individual tortfeasor who negligently caused the injuries \u2014 in other words, she was entitled to be made whole.\u201d It is that common-law right \u2014 the right to be made whole \u2014 that she contends has been eliminated with the imposition of the statutory damage limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">The dissent takes a similar approach.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> According to the dissent, the remedy clause guarantees plaintiff \u201cthe full amount of economic damages attributable to defendant.\u201d 353 Or at 359 (De Muniz, J. pro tempore, dissenting). The dissent states that, as such, Article I, section 10, does not countenance \u201cpartial\u201d remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 393 (De Muniz, J. pro tempore, dissenting).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Plaintiffs and the dissent\u2019s interpretation of Article I, section 10, is essentially the same interpretation that the plaintiff asserted in <em>Greist, </em>and that this court explicitly rejected. <em>See Clarke, </em>343 Or at 615 (Balmer, J., concurring) (noting that <em>Greist </em>rejected the argument that Article I, section 10, guarantees a right to be made whole). Indeed, plaintiff\u2019s and the dissent\u2019s interpretation cannot be squared with <em>any </em>of the foregoing cases dating back at least to 1901 \u2014 cases that consistently hold that Article I, section 10, \u201cdoes not eliminate the power of the legislature to vary and modify both the form <em>and the measure </em>of recovery for an injury,\u201d <em>Clarke, </em>343 Or at 606 (emphasis added), but rather guarantees that plaintiffs not be left with less than a \u201csubstantial\u201d remedy. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 605; <em>Greist, </em>322 Or at 291; <em>Hale, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>308 Or at 523. Plaintiff\u2019s and the dissent\u2019s interpretation essentially inverts that longstanding interpretation of the remedy clause from one that guarantees that plaintiffs not be left \u201cwholly without remedy\u201d to one that guarantees that plaintiffs obtain a whole remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The dissent acknowledges that we have correctly described our prior case law as holding that the remedy clause does not limit legislative authority to alter a remedy so long as the remaining remedy is \u201csubstantial.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But it insists that our understanding of the meaning of the word \u201csubstantial\u201d is in error. According to the dissent, that term, as used in remedy clause cases, has acquired a special meaning that is somewhat different from what it ordinarily means. The dissent asserts that a \u201csubstantial\u201d remedy is one that wholly restores a plaintiff\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In asserting that the notion of a \u201csubstantial\u201d remedy is limited to one that is wholly restorative of a plaintiff\u2019s injury, the dissent claims support from this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Hale </em>and <em>Greist. </em>The dissent\u2019s reading of those decisions, however, does not bear careful scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">As we have noted, in <em>Hale, </em>the court upheld the application of a damage limitation that had the effect of reducing $600,000 in claimed damages to $100,000. The court held that Article I, section 10, does not deprive the legislature of authority to alter a cause of action or reduce damages. \u201c[T]he remedy need not be precisely of the same type or extent\u201d as those existing at common law, the court explained. 308 Or at 523. \u201c[I]t is enough that the remedy is a substantial one.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The dissent deftly describes the court\u2019s analysis in <em>Hale </em>without mentioning the fact that the court specifically stated that the remedy clause leaves the legislature free to alter the \u201ctype <em>or </em>extent\u201d of damages that may be recovered. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Instead, the dissent embarks on a detailed analysis of two earlier cases that the court in <em>Hale cited </em>\u2014 Noonan and <em>Evanhoff </em>\u2014 which the dissent reads as holding that the remedy clause is not violated when an alternative remedy remains available. 353 Or at 392-96 (De Muniz, J. pro tempore, dissenting). The dissent then boldly declares that, because \u201c[n] either of those cases can be read for the proposition that a partial remedy *** is capable of satisfying the [r]emedy [c] lause,\u201d <em>Hale </em>cannot be read to countenance such a partial remedy, either. <em>Id. </em>at 393 (De Muniz, J. pro tempore, dissenting). That makes no sense. Even assuming for the sake of argument that the dissent fairly characterizes <em>Noonan </em>and <em>Evanoff </em>as not involving the issue of the constitutionality of partial remedies, the fact remains that <em>Hale </em>did. And it simply cannot be denied that <em>Hale </em>upheld the constitutionality of a partial remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The dissent\u2019s reading of <em>Greist </em>is similarly unavailing. As we have noted, in that case, the court upheld a statutory damage limitation that reduced the plaintiff\u2019s initial award from $1.5 million to a total of $600,000, consisting of $100,000 in economic damages and $500,000 in noneconomic damages. The court held that, even though $600,000 was only slightly more than one third of the original award, that total amount nevertheless was constitutionally adequate because it was a substantial amount:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">\u201cPlaintiff has not been left without a remedy. She has received $600,000, comprised of $500,000 in noneconomic damages and $100,000 in economic damages. There was no statutory limit on the latter category of damages. <em>Although that remedy is not precisely of the same extent as that to which plaintiff was entitled before the enactment of ORS 18.560(1), that remedy is </em>substantial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">322 Or at 291 (emphasis added). The dissent ignores the court\u2019s holding in <em>Greist. </em>According to the dissent, the decision actually was predicated on the fact that recoveries for wrongful death historically were quite low. 353 Or at 395 (De Muniz, J. pro tempore, dissenting). But that is simply not what the court in <em>Greist </em>said. Rather, as the foregoing quotation makes clear, the court held that the amount of plaintiff\u2019s award of $600,000 was a substantial award, in and of itself. The court then offered <em>an additional </em>reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>for its decision, observing that the award was substantial <em>\u201calso </em>because the statutory wrongful death action in Oregon has had a low limit on recovery.\u201d 322 Or at 291 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The dissent also suggests that, in any event, <em>Greist </em>has limited precedential value because it involved the application of the remedy clause to claims for wrongful death, which this court has subsequently determined are not subject to the remedy guarantee of Article I, section 10. 353 Or at 394 n 5 (De Muniz, J. pro tempore, dissenting). That is a curious criticism. That this court later held that its remedy clause analysis does not apply to wrongful death claims, <em>see Hughes v. PeaceHealth, </em>344 Or 142, 151-52, 178 P3d 225 (2008), in no way suggests that the remedy clause analysis itself was wrong. In fact, in subsequent Article I, section 10, cases, this court has continued to cite and discuss <em>Greist </em>\u2014 and <em>Neher, </em>also a wrongful death case \u2014 in describing its remedy clause analysis. <em>Clarke, </em>for example, contains extensive discussions of both <em>Greist </em>and <em>Neher </em>without any suggestion that either has limited precedential value. <em>Clarke, </em>343 Or at 603-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The dissent also complains that we have observed that this case is unlike other cases, such as <em>Clarke, </em>in which the court concluded that a remedy was constitutionally inadequate. According to the dissent, we have engaged in logically fallacious reasoning in deducing that, because this case is not like <em>Clarke, </em>the remedy is constitutionally adequate. If that were what we actually said, the dissent would have a point. But nowhere in our opinion have we concluded that, merely because this case is unlike <em>Clarke </em>or any other prior decision, it follows that the result in this case must be different. The dissent\u2019s complaint, in other words, amounts to no more than attacking a straw person.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The dissent also complains that our conclusion that a partial remedy may be constitutionally adequate under Article I, section 10, fails to adhere to the \u201ctext and context\u201d of the remedy clause. 353 Or at 389 (De Muniz, J. pro tempore, dissenting). Interestingly, the dissent offers nothing to support that assertion. In that regard, however, we note that nothing in the wording of the remedy clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>says anything about a right to be <em>wholly </em>restored. It guarantees remedy \u201cby due course of law.\u201d <em>Smothers, </em>332 Or at 121-22. It is the dissent\u2019s reading of Article I, section 10, that fails to comport with the text of the constitution. If, as the dissent suggests, Article I, section 10, requires that all remedies must be \u201cfully restorative,\u201d 353 Or at 406 (De Muniz, J. pro tempore, dissenting), then the \u201cdue course of law\u201d clause is rendered superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The dissent nevertheless claims support for its position from <em>Smothers, </em>relying on this court\u2019s description of the term \u201cremedy\u201d as including, in part, \u201cthat which is \u2018required to restore a right that has been injured.\u2019\u201d 353 Or at 399 (De Muniz, J. pro tempore, dissenting) (quoting <em>Smothers, </em>332 Or at 124). The dissent leaves out the following sentence from its quotation, which states that, \u201c[i]njury, in turn, is a wrong or harm for which a cause of action existed when the drafters wrote the Oregon Constitution in 1857.\u201d <em>Smothers, </em>332 Or at 124. Thus, what must be \u201crestored\u201d is an injury that would have been recognized as the basis for a cause of action <em>in 1857. </em>In that regard, the dissent fails to mention that, in the mid-nineteenth century, negligence claims were subject to the doctrine of contributory negligence, which operated as a complete bar to a plaintiff\u2019s recovery. <em>See generally Lawson, </em>339 Or at 262 (noting \u201cthe indisputable proposition that, in the early years of this state\u2019s history, a plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was an absolute bar to recovery for the negligent acts of another\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Moreover, under the prevailing law at the time that the state\u2019s constitution was adopted, a plaintiff was required to prove not only that his or her injuries were caused by a defendant\u2019s negligence but also that his or her own actions did not contribute to those injuries. Contributory negligence, in other words, was a principle of causation that constituted a part of a plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Although we are aware of no pertinent case law from the courts of this state dating precisely to the time of the adoption of the constitution, there are several cases dating to a few short years later that strongly suggest that Oregon\u2019s courts followed the established rule.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See Smothers, </em>332 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>at 129 (relying on other-state and post-1870s case law to determine the state of negligence at the time of the adoption of the Oregon Constitution). In <em>Kahn v. Love, </em>3 Or 206 (1870), the occupant of a building sued the owner for damages for injuries caused by the unsafe condition of the building. The owner demurred to the complaint because, among other things, the plaintiff had failed to allege that his injuries were not caused by his own lack of care. The trial court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the complaint. This court affirmed, explaining that \u201c[t]he plaintiff in an action for damages, occasioned by the defendant\u2019s negligence, must so frame his complaint as not to leave an inference that he was guilty of negligence that contributed to the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">To similar effect is <em>Walsh v. Oregon Ry. &amp; Navigation Co., </em>10 Or 250 (1882). In that case, the plaintiff was injured as he stuck his head out of a moving train as it passed by a water tower. The trial court dismissed the action before trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>This court reversed, holding that there was a jury question about whether plaintiff\u2019s injuries were a result of his own negligence. In reaching that conclusion, the court described the burden of proof in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-4\">\u201cIn actions for negligence, the burden of proof always rests upon the party charging it. He must prove that the accident was caused by the wrongful act, omission, or neglect of the defendant, and that the injury of which he complains was not the result of his own negligence and the want of ordinary care and caution. Although the evidence may disclose the defendant to have been guilty of negligence, it will not excuse negligence or the want of proper care and precaution on the part of the plaintiff. The law will not permit a recovery where the plaintiff, by his own negligence or carelessness, has contributed to produce the injury from which he has suffered. To entitle, then, the plaintiff to recover (conceding the negligence of the defendant in not removing the water-tank to the proper distance after widening the track) it was incumbent on him to prove, when the accident occurred, that he exercised that ordinary care which a party ought to observe under the particular circumstances in which he was placed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 253-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">By the 1880s, a number of courts began to voice objections to the notion that a plaintiff should be required to negate contributory negligence as part of his or her case. <em>See, e.g., O\u2019Brien v. Tatum, </em>84 Ala 186 (1887); <em>Robinson v. Western P. R. Co., </em>48 Cal 409 (1874); <em>Benson v. Goodwin, </em>147 Mass 237 (1888). A number of treatise writers, after noting the general rule, similarly suggested that a better one would be to regard contributory negligence as an affirmative defense. <em>See, e.g., </em>Seymour D. Thompson, 2 <em>The Law of Negligence </em>1175 (1880) (\u201cGenerally, contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff will bar a recovery. It would seem, therefore, to be a matter of defence, and that it would devolve upon the defendant to prove it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Oregon, however, did not join that particular chorus until 1885. As Judge Matthew Deady observed in <em>Conroy v. Oregon Constr. Co., </em>23 F 71, 72 (D Or 1885), at that point, the state courts had become \u201cnearly evenly divided on the question whether \u2018contributory negligence\u2019 is a part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s case or a matter of defense.\u201d As for Oregon, Judge Deady observed, <em>Walsh </em>appeared to indicate that the state supreme court \u201cdecided that it is a part of the plaintiff\u2019s <em>case.\u201d Id. See also </em>Charles Fisk Beach, Jr., A <em>Treatise on the Law of Contributory Negligence </em>425-26 (1885) (citing <em>Kahn </em>and <em>Walsh, </em>as well as Deady\u2019s opinion in <em>Conroy, </em>as examples of cases in which the burden is placed on the plaintiff to prove an absence of negligence).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">In <em>Grant v. Baker, </em>12 Or 329, 7 P 318 (1885), this court changed course. In that case, the plaintiff initiated an action for the wrongful death of an individual, who was killed when he fell over the edge of a poorly designed roadway. The trial court nonsuited the case on contributory negligence grounds. The Supreme Court reversed. The court began by noting that its earlier decision in <em>Walsh </em>\u201cmight justify the impression\u201d that it is the plaintiff who bears the burden of disproving contributory negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 332. The court quickly disavowed such a rule and confined <em>Walsh </em>to its facts. The description of the burden of proof in <em>Walsh, </em>the court in <em>Grant </em>held, \u201cwas intended to apply to the state of facts mentioned, and not to lay down any general rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333. The better rule, the court concluded, has always been that \u201ccontributory negligence is a defense and must be averred as such.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Thus, even assuming that the dissent is correct that the \u201crestorative\u201d quality of a remedy is controlling, under this court\u2019s case law, plaintiff in this case \u2014 who did not plead that she had exercised due care and who the jury found to have been 50 percent at fault \u2014 -would have been entitled to recover nothing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Under the circumstances, it is difficult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>to understand the dissent\u2019s complaint that the $200,000 in damages that plaintiff was awarded was not fully \u201crestorative\u201d of her common-law negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The dissent nevertheless disputes what this court in <em>Lawson </em>declared to be \u201cindisputable\u201d; namely that, in the mid-nineteenth century, a plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence barred recovery on a negligence claim. At the least, the dissent contends, we cannot say \u201cwith the certainty that should be required for a decision of this magnitude\u201d what the state of the law was in 1857, because, at that time, there existed no Oregon appellate court decisions on the subject of contributory negligence. 353 Or at 403 (De Muniz, J. pro tempore, dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Of course, the dissent is correct that it is exceedingly difficult to determine the state of Oregon law over 150 years ago. Nevertheless, that is what <em>Smothers </em>requires. Indeed, the court in <em>Smothers </em>confronted the same difficulty and resolved it, as we do here, by making the best of the limited historical resources at the court\u2019s disposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">In <em>Smothers, </em>the court addressed the question whether the common law at the time of the adoption of this state\u2019s constitution would have recognized a cause of action for negligence against an employer. The court found no case law \u2014 it bears repeating, no case law \u2014 anywhere in the nation recognizing such a cause of action at that time. 332 Or at 128-29. Undaunted, the court stated that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>\u201c[a]\u00a1though no Oregon cases addressed the common-law rights of employees to bring such negligence actions against their employers in the years immediately surrounding the creation of the Oregon Constitution, the content of the common law in 1857 may be divined from a wide range of sources. <em>Cases from other jurisdictions, as well as Oregon cases decided within a relatively short period after 1857, are instructive\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 129 (emphasis added). The court then referred to four cases, three from other jurisdictions and a single decision of this court, all published more than two decades after the adoption of the Oregon Constitution. The earliest of the cases was the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hough v. Ry. Co., </em>100 US 213, 25 L Ed 612 (1879). The three other cases were <em>Atchison, T. &amp; S.F.R. Co. v. Moore, </em>29 Kan 632 (1883); <em>Wilson v. Willimantic Linen Co., </em>50 Conn 433 (1883); and <em>Anderson v. Bennett, </em>16 Or 515, 19 P 765 (1888). Of the 1888 Oregon decision, the court in <em>Smothers </em>observed that, because \u201cnothing in the court\u2019s opinion in that case suggested that the holding was novel or that the decision marked a departure from any previous decisions or jurisprudence on the subject,\u201d it was permissible to infer from that decision that, \u201cin 1857, the common law of Oregon would have recognized\u201d the claim. 332 Or at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Thus, based on a handful of cases decided 20 to 30 years after the adoption of the state constitution, this court inferred the existence of the law decades earlier. The fact is that this court has never insisted on the sort of \u201ccertainty\u201d that the dissent demands in Article I, section 10, cases. <em>See, e.g., Lawson, </em>339 Or at 261-62 (citing <em>Smothers </em>and relying on \u201cvarious other sources to determine the content of the common law at the time of the drafting of the Oregon Constitution, including roughly contemporaneous cases from other jurisdictions, as well as Oregon cases decided in the decades shortly after the adoption of the constitution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Moreover, unlike the court in <em>Smothers, </em>we are not merely relying on four cases decided well after the adoption of this state\u2019s constitution. As we have noted, there are numerous cases from around the country dating from <em>before </em>the time of the adoption of the Oregon Constitution reflecting what scholars \u2014 both in the mid-nineteenth century and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>now \u2014 agree was the widespread acceptance of the doctrine of contributory negligence as a component of a plaintiff\u2019s case at that time. It is in that context that we have examined the later Oregon case law for any suggestion that Oregon courts saw the law differently. We have found no such case law. To the contrary, the earliest Oregon cases were consistent with what we have described as the well-established rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The dissent rejoins that, regardless of who has the better of the argument about Oregon\u2019s legal history, <em>Smothers </em>cannot be read to \u201cfreeze in place [] every repealed, overruled or outmoded argument that a defendant might have relied on in 1857 to resist an injured person\u2019s claim.\u201d 353 Or at 404 (De Muniz, J. pro tempore, dissenting). <em>Smothers, </em>however, requires that the \u201cinjury\u201d that a modern remedy must restore is \u201ca wrong or harm for which a cause of action existed when the drafters wrote the Oregon Constitution in 1857.\u201d 332 Or at 124. As we have noted, plaintiff\u2019s injury in this case \u2014 as pleaded and determined by a jury \u2014 is not the sort for which a cause of action existed at that time. <em>Smothers </em>does not give us liberty to pick and choose which causes of action that existed in 1857 we now regard as \u201coutmoded.\u201d It requires us to take the law as we find it as of that time. That is what we have endeavored, in good faith, to accomplish.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Finally, the dissent complains that the \u201csubstantial\u201d remedy test that we recognize in this case is standardless and lacks a \u201cguiding principle.\u201d 353 Or at 404-06 (De Muniz, J. pro tempore, dissenting). The dissent, of course, echoes precisely the same criticism that Justice Unis leveled in <em>Greist, </em>and that this court rejected. The fact is that not every constitutional provision can be reduced to a neat formula that avoids the necessity of applying careful judgment to the facts and circumstances of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the challenged $200,000 damage limitation does not leave plaintiff with a constitutionally inadequate remedy under Article I, section 10, of the Oregon Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Certified question answered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-7\"> ORS 30.265(1) provides, in part, that \u201c[t]he sole cause of action for any tort of officers, employees or agents of a public body acting within the scope of their employment or duties and eligible for representation and indemnification *** shall be an action against the public body only.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b402-8\"> The Oregon Tort Claims Act has since been amended to increase the limitation of liability.

Whitlow, </em>334 Or 412, 51 P3d 599 (2002), the plaintiff challenged, in federal district court, the constitutionality of the statutory damage limitation imposed by the Oregon Tort Claims Act both facially and as applied. The federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>district court submitted to this court the question whether the damages limitation, \u201con its face or as applied,\u201d violates several provisions of the state constitution, including Article I, section 10. <em>Id. </em>at 415. This court declined to answer the question to the extent that it pertained to as-applied challenges to the damages limitation because the record was inadequate to enable the court to answer the question. <em>Id. </em>As for the facial challenge to the damages limitation, the court framed its analysis in terms of the two <em>Smothers </em>questions. <em>Id. </em>at 418. It then assumed, without deciding, that the answer to the first question was that the injury at issue was one for which Article I, section 10, guarantees a remedy. <em>Id. </em>Turning to the second question, concerning the adequacy of the modern remedy, the court concluded that, \u201cbecause a damages award has yet to be determined in this case, the damages \u2018cap\u2019 does not render the remedy available to plaintiff \u2018incapable of restoring the right that has been injured.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421 (quoting <em>Smothers, </em>332 Or at 119-20).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b414-7\"> <em>Webster\u2019s </em>defines \u201cemasculate\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">\u201c1: to deprive of virile or procreative power: CASTRATE, GELD 2 : to deprive of masculine vigor or spirit: weaken or attenuate by removal or alteration of potent qualities as a: to divest (language) of vigor and freedom (as by excision, euphemism, or weakening of sense) b : to deprive (a law) of force or effectiveness (as by amendment or interpretation).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-9\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>738 (unabridged ed 2002).

By 1860, nearly every state had expressly recognized the doctrine of contributory negligence, most often as a matter of the plaintiff\u2019s affirmative burden. As one modern scholar has observed, \u201c[i]n the space of a few decades, the doctrine of contributory negligence gained almost unanimous acceptance within the United States.\u201d Peter N. Swisher, <em>Virginia Should Abolish the Archaic Tort Defense of Contributory Negligence and Adopt a Comparative Negligence Defense in its Place, </em>46 U Rich L Rev 359, 361 (2011).

As early as 1811, Selwyn\u2019s treatise on <em>nisi prius </em>stated that a plaintiff seeking to recover damages must show that he acted with \u201ccommon and ordinary caution.\u201d 2 W. Selwyn, <em>An Abridgment of the Law </em>of Nisi Prius 1092 n 5 (1811). Hilliard\u2019s 1866 treatise on the law of torts declared that \u201cit is the prevailing doctrine, that, to sustain an action on the case for negligence, <em>the burden of proof </em>is on the plaintiff to show negligence, wil[l]ful or otherwise, on the part of the defendant, and ordinary care on his own part.\u201d Francis Hilliard, 1 <em>The Law of Torts or Private Wrongs </em>125-26 (3d ed 1866) (emphasis in original). <em>See also </em>Theodore Sedgwick, <em>A Treatise on the Measure of Damages </em>493 (3d 1858) (\u201c[T]he party seeking legal redress must not only show his adversary to be in the wrong, but must also be prepared to prove that no negligence of his own has tended to increase or consummate the injury\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b422-6\"> Over 100 reported early nineteenth-century cases reflect the widespread adoption of the doctrine of contributory negligence, most often as a matter of the plaintiff\u2019s affirmative burden. <em>See, e.g., Crommelin v.

Those doctrines, however, are not applicable to this case. To begin with, plaintiff did not raise either of them before the trial court, although she had opportunity to do so. Particularly in light of the fact that each of the doctrines that she now invokes requires particular factual showings, we are disinclined to entertain any consideration of those doctrines at this stage in the proceedings. <em>See Peeples v. Lampert, </em>345 Or 209, 219-20, 191 P3d 637 (2008) (appellate courts must exercise \u201cutmost caution\u201d when addressing unpreserved arguments because, among other things, \u201cpreservation fosters full development of the record, which aids the trial court in making a decision and the appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>court in reviewing it\u201d). Indeed, gross negligence ordinarily must be pleaded as a separate claim, which plaintiff did not do in this case. <em>See generally Fassett v. Santiam Loggers, Inc., </em>267 Or 505, 508, 517 P2d 1059 (1973) (describing differences between claims). Our review in this case is limited to the claim that plaintiff actually asserted. <em>Hughes v. PeaceHealth, </em>344 Or 142, 152, 178 P3d 225 (2008). As for last clear chance, there is no evidence of its widespread recognition by 1857. The origins of the doctrine are ordinarily attributed to the English case of <em>Davies v. Mann, </em>10 M &amp; W 546, 152 Eng Rep 588 (1842). As Professor G. Edward White has observed, however, <em>Davies </em>was not read to have adopted such a categorical exception to the rule of contributory negligence in this country until the 1880s. G. Edward White, <em>Tort Law in America: An Intellectual History </em>45-46 (2d ed 2003). According to White, \u201cthe doctrine had not in fact originated in <em>Davies v. Mann, </em>at least as a principle of negligence law; it was the creation of later treatise writers who extracted it from the <em>Davies </em>case and others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The first case in this country even to mention <em>Davies </em>is an 1852 Vermont case, <em>Trow v. Vermont C. R.R., </em>24 Vt 487 (1852). This court did not cite <em>Davies </em>until 1890, in <em>Moses v. S. P. R. R.

OHSU, </em>343 Or 581, 610, 175 P3d 418 (2007), this court held that the same statutory damage cap at issue in this case violated the Remedy Clause because we were unable to discern anything</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">\u201cfrom our state\u2019s history, or from the nature, the form, or the amount of recovery available for the preexisting common law claim, that would permit this court to conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>limited remedy for permanent and severe injury caused by medical negligence that is now available under the OTCA meets the Article I, section 10, remedy requirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">That same reasoning applies with equal force to plaintiff\u2019s common-law claim in this case and the result should be the same; <em>i.e., </em>as applied here, the damage cap at issue in this matter violates the Oregon Constitution\u2019s Remedy Clause. By essentially limiting our holding in <em>Clarke </em>to its facts, however, the majority sidesteps the reasoning in that case and, in doing so, significantly undermines the Remedy Clause protections that, until this day, were enjoyed by all Oregonians.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">According to the majority, the court explained in <em>Clarke </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">\u201cArticle I, section 10, does not deprive the legislature of the authority \u2018to vary and modify both the form <em>and the measure of recovery </em>for an injury,\u2019 so long as the legislature leaves the plaintiff with a substantial remedy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">353 Or at 375 (quoting <em>Clarke, </em>343 Or at 606) (emphasis supplied by the majority). What the court actually wrote in <em>Clarke, </em>however, was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">\u201cArticle I, section 10, does not eliminate the power of the legislature to vary and modify both the form and the measure of recovery for an injury, <em>as long as it does not leave the injured party with an \u2018emasculated\u2019 version of the remedy that was available at common law.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-9\"><em>Clarke, </em>343 Or at 606. The majority\u2019s efforts to replace the phrase \u201cemasculated version of the remedy\u201d with \u201csubstantial remedy\u201d is not an accident; it is necessary to the majority\u2019s conclusion. In <em>Clark, </em>the court referred to an \u201cemasculated version of the remedy\u201d advisedly because our case law had imbued the phrase with a clear meaning; <em>i.e., </em>a remedy that was \u201cincapable of restoring the right that has been injured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Smothers v. Gresham Transfer, Inc., </em>332 Or 83, 124, 23 P3d 333 (2001)). The steps that the majority has taken to now eliminate that phrase for the purpose of purging \u201can unfortunate, if not sexist\u201d term from the judicial lexicon does far more than substitute a nonsexist term; it abrogates <em>Clarke </em>or, at a minimum, severely limits its holdings. Only by inserting the term \u201csubstantial\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>into the court\u2019s holding in <em>Clarke </em>is the majority able to construe the Remedy Clause to permit the truncated remedy at issue here; <em>i.e., </em>a limited cause of action and a limited scope of recovery that, applied in tandem, are incapable of restoring plaintiff\u2019s economic injuries. Nothing in our case law supports that construction; indeed, our precedents make clear that the Remedy Clause prohibits legislative limitations that are <em>\u201cincapable </em>of restoring the right that has been injured.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Analyzing legislative limitations on remedies under that standard is quite different from analyzing \u2014 as the majority does \u2014 whether an award of damages is, in some way or another, quantitatively \u201csubstantial.\u201d Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Reduced to its essential elements, the majority\u2019s position appears to be that Article I, section 10, does not prohibit the legislature from enacting any limitation on civil recoveries \u2014 regardless of whether the result is capable of restoring an injured right or not \u2014 so long as the remedy that remains is \u201csubstantial.\u201d 353 Or at 375. The basis for that proposition can be summed up in three broad points drawn from the majority\u2019s opinion: (1) under this court\u2019s case law, the \u201cconstitutional adequacy of a modern remedy may be established by the fact that the modern remedy is \u2018substantial\u2019 and does not leave the plaintiff \u2018wholly without remedy.\u2019\u201d 353 Or at 374-75; (2) under that principle, $100,000 in economic damages \u2014 contrasted against a $382,500 jury award for the same \u2014 is, as a matter of law, a \u201csubstantial\u201d award; and (3) plaintiff was only entitled to restoration of \u201can injury that would have been recognized as the basis for a cause of action in 1857\u201d and, in 1857, plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence would have been a complete bar to recovery. I address each of those points in turn below.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">I. USE OF THE WORD \u201cSUBSTANTIAL\u201d IN OREGON\u2019S REMEDY CLAUSE JURISPRUDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">With regard to statutory caps on civil damages, this court has used the word \u201csubstantial\u201d in its analysis in only two cases: <em>Hale v. Port of Portland, </em>308 Or 508, 783 P2d 506 (1990), and <em>Greist v. Phillips, </em>322 Or 281, 906 P2d 789 (1995). Neither case, however, supports application of the term \u201csubstantial\u201d to what plaintiff has been forced to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>accept here: a truncated remedy that is incapable of restoring plaintiff\u2019s injured rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">A. <em>Hale v. Port of Portland</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In <em>Hale </em>\u2014 -a personal injury case involving both the Port of Portland and the City of Portland \u2014 this court upheld an early version of the Oregon Tort Claims Act (OTCA) that capped tort damages in actions instigated against public bodies. In doing so, the court cited two <em>cases </em>\u2014 Noonan <em>v. City of Portland, </em>161 Or 213, 88 P2d 808 (1939) and <em>Evanhoff v. State Industrial Accident Commission, </em>78 Or 503, 154 P 106 (1915) \u2014 for the proposition that the resulting remedy must be substantial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\"><em>\u201cNoonan </em>and <em>Evanhoff </em>held only that Article I, section 10, is not violated when the legislature alters (or even abolishes) a cause of action, so long as the party injured is not left entirely without a remedy. <em>Under those cases, the remedy need not be precisely of the same type or extent; it is enough that the remedy is a substantial one.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-7\"><em>Hale, </em>308 Or at 523 (emphasis added). The court never explained what, exactly, constituted a substantial remedy, only that <em>Noonan </em>and <em>Evanhoff </em>required as much. Importantly, however, at the time <em>Hale </em>was decided, the OTCA did not eliminate \u2014 as it does now \u2014 the individual liability of public employees for their negligent acts. And that factor \u2014 the availability of an alternative remedy that allowed a plaintiff to fully recover damages available at common law \u2014 was a central component in both <em>Noonan </em>and <em>Evanhoff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">In <em>Noonan, </em>the legislative limitation at issue was a Portland municipal ordinance that completely immunized the city from liability for personal injuries caused by defective city sidewalks. The provision, however, specifically provided that injured persons could maintain a common-law action against the individual officers and employees who were responsible for maintaining the sidewalks. From the court\u2019s perspective, the existence of that alternative remedy proved to be key. Affirming the validity of the immunity provision, the court wrote that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>\u201call of our decisions have recognized that a city may be given, not absolute, but conditional immunity from liability for street <em>accidents </em>\u2014 conditioned <em>upon liability reposing in someone who owed a duty to maintain them.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><em>Noonan, </em>161 Or at 247 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In <em>Evanhoff, </em>the court upheld an early iteration of Oregon\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation program. Under the program, participating workers injured on the job were, among other things, precluded from bringing negligence actions against their employers to obtain damages beyond their medical expenses. The program, however, was not compulsory; both employers and workers could elect not to participate in it and opt, instead, to pursue the remedies and defenses for work-related injuries that existed outside the workers\u2019 compensation framework. Again, the existence of an alternative remedy in the wake of a truncated one was the dispositive factor in the court\u2019s Article I, section 10 analysis. The court described it thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u201cThe state says to the employer and employ\u00e9 [sic] alike:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">\u201c\u2018We present to you a plan of accident insurance which you may accept or reject at your own pleasure. If you accept, you must be bound by its terms and limitations; if you reject it, <em>the courts are open to you with every constitutional remedy intact. Take your choice between our plan and such remedies as the statute gives </em>you.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-8\"><em>Evanhoff </em>78 Or at 517-18 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Neither of those cases can be read for the proposition that a partial remedy \u2014 like the one the majority considers \u201csubstantial\u201d here \u2014 is capable of satisfying the Remedy Clause. Rather, both cases upheld legislative provisions that had eliminated <em>one </em>potential source of recovery, while leaving another <em>equivalent </em>source intact. In that respect, <em>Hale </em>is no different from the cases it relied on: Although the OTCA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>had placed a cap on the amount of civil damages available in tort from a public body, the officers, employees, and agents of those bodies remained liable for the damages caused by their negligent actions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, under <em>Hale, </em>requiring a \u201csubstantial\u201d remedy for purposes of Article I, section 10, means that, when the legislature alters or abolishes a cause of action, it must provide an equivalent remedy that is as capable of restoring a plaintiff\u2019s injuries as was the original. That standard has not been met here.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">B. <em>Greist v. Phillips</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\"><em>Greist </em>was a wrongful-death case not cognizable at common law, and this court has since disavowed the application of the Remedy Clause to the circumstances of that case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, even assuming that <em>Greist </em>retains some precedential value, the analysis in <em>Greist </em>was quite different from the analysis used by the majority in this case. In <em>Greist, </em>a jury had awarded the plaintiff $1.5 million in non-economic damages as the representative of her deceased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>son\u2019s estate. This court nevertheless upheld against a Remedy Clause challenge a statute that capped the plaintiff\u2019s recovery for noneconomic damages at $500,000. In doing so, the court noted that the plaintiff had not been left without a remedy: she had received $500,000 in noneconomic damages, plus a 100 percent recovery of her economic damages in the sum of $100,000 \u2014 a category of damages to which no statutory limit applied. The court went on to acknowledge that, although that remedy was less than what the plaintiff would have been entitled to before the noneconomic damages cap was put in place, it was nevertheless \u201csubstantial.\u201d <em>See </em>322 Or at 291 (citing <em>Hale).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">The court, however, explained exactly why that was so. It wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">\u201cThe remedy for wrongful death is substantial, not only because 100 percent of economic damages plus up to $500,000 in noneconomic damages is a substantial amount, but also because the statutory wrongful death action in Oregon has had a low limit on recovery for 113 years of its 133-year history. See 322 Or at 294, 906 P2d at 796, below (discussing history of wrongful death action in Oregon). As noted there, the wrongful death claim came into existence with a limitation, and the highest previous limitation (1961-1967) was $25,000. In relation to that history, the present remedy is substantial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Consequently, in <em>Greist </em>\u2014 like Hale\u2014 the metes and bounds of a \u201csubstantial\u201d remedy were clearly defined: Where a plaintiff had no common-law remedy aside from a legislatively created statutory claim that, historically, had been accompanied by low limitations on recovery, damage caps that allowed the plaintiff full economic damages, plus up to $500,000 in noneconomic damages, provided a remedy that was \u201csubstantial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">My point is that, if the new constitutional bellwether for Remedy Clause controversies is now the presence of a \u201csubstantial\u201d remedy, the remedy afforded plaintiff in this case falls woefully short of that mark as defined by our case law. Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Greist, </em>plaintiff in this case cannot pursue a wrongful death action for the injuries she has suffered; consequently, there is no possibility for full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>recovery of her economic damages and no possibility of a $500,000 maximum in noneconomic damages. Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Hale, </em>plaintiff\u2019s recovery against the city has been statutorily capped, <em>and </em>she cannot pursue a common law claim against the negligent city employee Consequently, plaintiff is caught coming and going \u2014 squeezed from one end by a statutory damages cap that arbitrarily limits her recovery and on the other by the complete elimination of a claim that would have permitted her a full recovery. There is nothing \u201csubstantial\u201d about that predicament. Under Oregon law, plaintiff has been left with a constitutionally inadequate remedy that is incapable of restoring her injured rights, a circumstance that no amount of linguistic fiddling on the majority\u2019s part can change or conceal.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">II. QUANTIFYING THE \u201cSUBSTANTIAL\u201d REMEDY</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">According to the majority, quantifying an award of damages as \u201csubstantial\u201d with any degree of precision is probably impossible. 353 Or at 374. Undeterred by its own observation, however, the majority decides that, in this case, the sum of $200,000 has, indeed, provided plaintiff with a \u201csubstantial\u201d remedy. To reach that result, the majority seeks support by negative implication, asserting that the remedy available to plaintiff in this case is \u201cfar more substantial\u201d than the remedies that this court previously has determined to be constitutionally inadequate. To that end, the majority compares the limited total damages that plaintiff was allowed to recover here \u2014 $200,000\u2014with the respective remedies that this court held to be unconstitutional under the Remedy Clause in <em>Neher v. Chartier, </em>319 Or 417, 879 P2d 156 (1994), and <em>Clarke v. OHSU, </em>343 Or 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Under the majority\u2019s reading of Neher,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>353 Or at 375 (emphasis in original). In its reading of <em>Clarke, </em>the majority posits that, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>\u201calthough the estate of the victim had not been completely deprived of a remedy by virtue of the existence of a $3,000 burial benefit under workers\u2019 compensation law, the parents of the victim had been <em>totally </em>deprived of any remedy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>\u201cthe statutory limitation of $200,000 deprived the plaintiffs of all but one percent of the more than $17 million in damages that they would have otherwise recovered, the limitation left them with a constitutionally inadequate remedy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-5\"><em>Id. </em>Those observations lead the majority to tacitly conclude that, because plaintiff in this matter has (1) not been totally deprived of a remedy, as was the case in <em>Neher, </em>and (2) recovered more than the \u201cpaltry fraction\u201d at issue in <em>Clarke, </em>the $200,000 cap on her recoverable damages does not offend the Oregon Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">As a matter of both logic and law, however, the majority\u2019s position fails. First, the conclusion that the limited remedies at issue in <em>Neher </em>and <em>Clarke </em>were <em>unconstitutional </em>does not make the remedy at issue in this case <em>constitutional.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Second, neither <em>Neher </em>nor <em>Clarke </em>were cases in which the court sought to quantify a damage award as constitutionally \u201csubstantial.\u201d Instead, both cases presented the court with the same two problematic points: The law had recognized a right of recovery for the injuries of each respective plaintiff and, at the same time, abolished remedies that would have facilitated that recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">In <em>Neher, </em>this court invalidated statutory provisions that had immunized public bodies and their employees from the statutory wrongful death claims of persons covered by the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. The court did so reasoning that the statutes in question had left the parents\u2014 and sole heirs- \u2014 of 25-year-old Julie Neher without <em>any legal remedy at all </em>after their daughter was negligently struck and killed by a Tri-Met bus. To that end, the court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">\u201cORS 30.010 recognizes the existence of a right of recovery for surviving parents for damages to compensate them \u2018for pecuniary loss and for loss of the society companionship and services of the decedent.\u2019 ORS 30.265(3)(a), however, <em>operates to abolish the parents\u2019 remedy under circumstances such as those present in this case, not only </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>against the municipality, but against the municipality\u2019s negligent employees. </em>Such a result is irreconcilable with this court\u2019s holdings!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><em>Neher, </em>319 Or at 428 (emphasis added; internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In <em>Clarke, </em>this court held that an OTCA damages limitation violated the Remedy Clause. The plaintiff had instigated a medical negligence action against Oregon Health Sciences University and a number of individual physicians that it employed. The plaintiff brought that action on behalf of her son who had suffered total and permanent disability as the result of the negligent treatment he had received while in the hospital\u2019s care. The child\u2019s economic damages alone exceeded $12 million, a sum that was undisputed by OHSU, as was its negligence in the matter. At the time, however, the OTCA immunized the individual doctors from liability and capped the damages recoverable from OHSU at $200,000. This court held that the elimination of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the hospital\u2019s doctors and the substituted and limited remedy against the hospital violated the Remedy Clause as an \u201cemasculated version of the remedy that was available at common law.\u201d <em>Clarke, </em>343 Or at 610. In reaching that conclusion, the court emphasized that the legislature had eliminated the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cpreexisting right to obtain a full recovery\u201d for the injuries sustained by her son. The court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">\u201cWe view plaintiff\u2019s economic damages of over $12 million as <em>representative </em>of the enormous cost of life-time medical care currently associated with permanent and severe personal injuries caused by the medical negligence of a state officer, agent, or employee. Defendants do not argue that those damages do not constitute an \u2018injury\u2019 within the meaning of the constitution. Nor does anything in the legislation suggest such a conclusion by the legislature. Yet, the legislature has <em>completely eliminated an injured person\u2019s preexisting right to obtain a full recovery for those damages from the individual tortfeasors </em>who negligently caused the injuries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 609 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">In short, the court\u2019s decisions in <em>Neher </em>and <em>Clarke </em>both turned on the lack of a restorative remedy. And those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>two cases do not exist in a vacuum. This court has frequently referred to that restorative quality as the benchmark of a remedy\u2019s constitutionality. <em>See Smothers v. Gresham Transfer, Inc., </em>332 Or 83, 124, 23 P3d 333 (2001) (noting that the term \u201cremedy\u201d refers, in part, to that which is \u201crequired to restore a right that has been injured\u201d); <em>Davidson v. Rogers, </em>281 Or 219, 222, 574 P2d 624 (1978) (noting that, in an action for libel, the remedy of a retraction did not offend the Remedy Clause because \u201cretraction can come nearer to restoring an injured reputation than can money\u201d); <em>Holden v. Pioneer Broadcasting Co., </em>228 Or 405, 419, 365 P2d 845 (1961) (noting that the \u201cremedy afforded through retraction would seem to come closer to providing an effective means of repairing the harm\u201d resulting from act of defamation).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">The majority\u2019s contrary application of <em>Neher </em>and <em>Clarke </em>scrubs the restorative purpose of the Remedy Clause from this court\u2019s jurisprudence. Moreover, it suggests that any recovery for damages is \u201csubstantial\u201d so long as the amount awarded falls somewhere between the sum of zero and a figure that, while not \u201cenough,\u201d is, in the court\u2019s estimation, nevertheless \u201csubstantial,\u201d whatever that means. Untethered to a restorative purpose, that standard is both arbitrary and unworkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The majority, however, does not rely solely on its conclusion that the award in this case was \u201csubstantial\u201d to justify its decision here. It goes on to opine that the remedy provided in this case also constitutes a <em>\u201cquid pro quo\u201d </em>because, with regard to the police officer who struck plaintiff,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">\u201cthe city remains liable for the torts of its employees committed within the scope of employment. Thus, <em>while the legislature limited the amount that may be recovered from individual defendants who are municipal employees, </em>it substituted the \u2018deep pocket\u2019 of the municipality itself as the ultimate payor. Plaintiffs, in other words, have been conferred a substantial benefit in exchange for the damage limitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">353 Or at 376 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Let me be absolutely clear: the legislature did not \u201climit\u201d the amount that could be recovered from Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Boyle when it amended the OTCA in 1991; it <em>abolished any </em>option for plaintiff to recover <em>any </em>amount from Officer Boyle, by immunizing him from tort liability for negligent acts occurring in the course of his employment. And in 1991, the legislature did not confer any additional benefit to compensate for that deprivation. The legislature previously had granted a class of plaintiffs access to the \u201cdeep pockets\u201d of the municipality for torts arising out of governmental functions, but that benefit had already served as a <em>\u201cquid pro quo\u201d </em>for the cap on tort damages arising out of muncipalities\u2019 proprietary functions. Having been \u201cspent\u201d for that purpose, municipal \u201cdeep pockets\u201d could not then serve as a benefit for a subsequent deprivation \u2014 elimination of employee liability. Further, the \u201cdeep pockets\u201d of the municipality supposedly substituted in Officer Boyle\u2019s stead are only as deep as the statutory damages cap, which, in this case, is not very deep at all. Consequently, there is no \u201cthis for that\u201d exchange in evidence here. Plaintiff\u2019s common-law remedy against Officer Boyle has been abolished, and the remedy that has been left to her is insufficient to restore her injured rights as determined by the jury. She has not, contrary to the position taken by the majority, \u201cbeen conferred a substantial benefit in exchange for the damage limitation.\u201d In positing otherwise, the majority is simply wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">In any event, the majority takes <em>Hale\u2019s \u201cquid pro quo\u201d </em>rationale far beyond its application in that case. In <em>Hale, </em>the court did not hold that the legislative damage limitation at issue before it was constitutional based on a determination that the remedy was \u201csubstantial.\u201d Instead, the court reasoned, in part, that the legislature had conferred a benefit to a \u201cclass of plaintiffs\u201d to which the plaintiff belonged in exchange for imposing a \u201ccounterbalancing burden.\u201d In that trade-off, the court noted, the legislature had capped previously unlimited municipal liability for torts arising out <em>ofproprietary </em>functions in exchange for partially waiving what had been complete municipal immunity for torts arising out of <em>governmental </em>functions. That legislative scheme, the court wrote \u201cmay work to the disadvantage of some, while it will work to the advantage of others. But all who had a remedy continue to have one.\u201d 308 Or at 523. That legislative scheme did not prevent <em>any </em>plaintiff from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>seeking damages from the individual municipal employees who caused their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">The majority, however, assumes that, if the legislature has provided any sort of remedy with regard to municipal torts, that fact makes subsequent legislative limitations constitutional, even when the substituted remedy prevents a plaintiff from obtaining a full recovery from anyone. In that regard, the majority\u2019s position begs the question of what constitutes a constitutionally adequate remedy. Must the <em>quid pro quo fairly </em>trade \u201ccounterbalancing\u201d benefits for burdens, or can the legislature satisfy the constitution by providing any benefit at all? If a balanced trade between burdens and benefits is required, then a <em>quid pro quo </em>results only when a plaintiff receives a remedy that is substantially equivalent to the one that has been taken away \u2014 and which would, presumably, be capable of restoring the right that was injured. If, however, a <em>quid pro quo </em>need not be substantially equivalent to the remedy taken away, then what relationship, if any, must it bear to the common-law remedy? If the Remedy Clause requires only a \u201csubstantial\u201d remedy, then presumably a \u201csubstantial\u201d <em>quid pro quo </em>\u2014 whatever that is \u2014 is all that is required. But if the Remedy Clause requires a restorative remedy, then a <em>quid pro quo </em>will be satisfactory only to the extent that the benefit it confers is restorative as well. I fail to see the utility of that tautological digression.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">But, as I have already noted, there is no <em>quid pro quo </em>at play here. For torts arising out of governmental functions, plaintiffs had access to municipal \u201cdeep pockets\u201d by virtue of the preexisting statutory waiver of municipal immunity. The 1991 OTCA amendments eliminated individual municipal employee liability without conferring any <em>additional </em>benefit to injured plaintiffs. The majority ignores that fact in favor of permitting the preexisting statutory waiver of municipal immunity to serve as a <em>quid pro quo </em>for the later, additional deprivation of individual municipal employee liability. According to the majority\u2019s interpretation of <em>Hale, </em>however, that benefit has already been \u201cspent\u201d to justify the cap on municipal liability for proprietary functions. If that supposed \u201cbenefit\u201d is also the acceptable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>trade-off for the remedy plaintiff has been deprived of in this case, then that \u201cbenefit\u201d is capable of justifying <em>virtually any future reduction </em>in the remedies available to plaintiffs injured by the acts of a public body. That, in my view, is not an equitable exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">III. HISTORY AND THE LEGISLATURE\u2019S AUTHORITY UNDER OREGON\u2019S REMEDY CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The majority acknowledges that the Remedy Clause requires the restoration of a right that has been injured, and asserts that what must be \u201crestored\u201d is an \u201cinjury that would have been recognized as the basis for a cause of action <em>in 1857.\u201d </em>353 Or at 381 (emphasis in original). The majority then relies on a historical analysis of the contributory negligence doctrine as practiced in the nineteenth century for its conclusion that, even if I am correct that the Remedy Clause mandates a restorative remedy, this plaintiff \u201cwould have been entitled to recover nothing\u201d in 1857. 353 Or at 385. The majority\u2019s position is that, from a historical perspective, (1) contributory negligence was, at one time, an absolute bar to a plaintiff\u2019s recovery in tort, and (2) establishing the absence of contributory negligence was part of a plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof. Therefore, the majority concludes that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">\u201cunder the prevailing law at the time that the state\u2019s constitution was adopted, a plaintiff was required to prove not only that his or her injuries were caused by a defendant\u2019s negligence but also that his or her own actions did not contribute to those injuries. Contributory negligence, in other words, was a principle of causation that constituted a part of plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">353 Or at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">There are, of course, multiple pitfalls associated with the kind of historical analysis that the majority undertakes. As Justice Landau has cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">\u201cHistorical analysis, even done well, often will fail to establish with anything approximating probability what the framers of a constitutional provision intended. It may even show that there were multiple and conflicting intentions. Judges should be prepared to accept that and not try to make history tell us more than it fairly does.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Jack L. Landau, <em>A Judge\u2019s Perspective on the Use and Misuse of History in State Constitutional Interpretation, </em>38 Val U L Rev 451, 486-87 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">That warning is appropriate here. As the majority acknowledges, when the Oregon Constitution was adopted, this court had not decided that contributory negligence was a bar to a plaintiffs claim or that a plaintiff was required to plead a lack of contributory negligence as an affirmative element of his or her cause of action. The first Oregon case to discuss those issues was decided in 1870, and by 1885 the court had made clear that it had \u201calways understood\u201d contributory negligence to be a defense that a defendant must plead. <em>Grant v. Baker, </em>12 Or 329, 333 (1885); <em>see also Johnston v. Oregon Short Line &amp; U.N. Ry. Co., </em>23 Or 94, 99, 31 P 283 (1892) (discussing contrary position set out in <em>Walsh </em>as a <em>\u201clapsus linguae\u201d </em>(a slip or fault of the tongue)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the majority cannot say, with the certainty that should be required for a decision of this magnitude, that, in 1857, plaintiff would not have had a cause of action for her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Furthermore, even if defendant could have made arguments in 1857 that had the potential to defeat plaintiff\u2019s claim had she filed it in 1857 rather than in 2007, plaintiff also could have raised legal rules, such as last clear chance or that defendant had acted with gross negligence\u2014 rules that could have defeated defendant\u2019s contributory negligence arguments. The majority declines to address the theoretical or practical significance of those rules because, according to the majority, plaintiff failed to preserve below arguments regarding those rules. That is true, but it is unsurprising: As noted, contributory negligence ceased to be a part of Oregon law decades ago and plaintiff therefore had no obligation to plead claims in reply to that nonexistent doctrine. It is fundamentally unfair for the majority to consider how plaintiff\u2019s claim theoretically would have fared in 1857 based only on arguments that a defendant could have made and at the time refuse to consider, on preservation grounds, the counter arguments that a plaintiff could have made.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">In any event, regardless of who has the better argument about Oregon\u2019s legal history, because the Oregon legislature abolished the contributory negligence doctrine decades ago, it was not part of the \u201cdue course of law\u201d that governed plaintiff\u2019s right to a remedy at the time of <em>her </em>injury. Relying on <em>Smothers, </em>however, the majority, nevertheless insists that the legislature constitutionally may deprive a plaintiff of a remedy that otherwise would be guaranteed to her if a court is able to determine that the plaintiff\u2019s negligence contributed to her injury. <em>Smothers </em>does not stand for such a strained proposition. Article I, section 10, guarantees a restorative remedy for <em>injury </em>done to one\u2019s person; it does not mention, let alone freeze in place, every repealed, overruled or outmoded argument that a defendant might have relied on in 1857 to resist an injured person\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Finally, I take issue with the majority\u2019s resolution of this matter for its lack of any guiding principle capable of aiding both bench and bar in future Remedy Clause cases. Will the requirement that a remedy be \u201csubstantial\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>that it provide a <em>\u201cquid pro quo\u201d </em>prohibit the legislature from limiting all plaintiffs to a recovery of $200,000 regardless of injury? What about $20,000? $2,000?<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Will a limitation to 25 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>percent of the damages awarded by a jury be deemed constitutionally sound? Ten percent? Five percent? The majority does not say, and the lack of analytical rigor in its discussion does not help answer the question. The only limitations suggested by the majority\u2019s opinion are that (1) plaintiffs cannot be left \u201cwholly without a remedy,\u201d or without recourse of any value whatsoever, and \u2014 in what is essentially the same proposition stated differently \u2014 that (2) some benefit must be conferred as a <em>\u201cquid pro quo\u201d </em>in exchange for the remedy taken away, regardless of the quantity, quality, or substance of the new benefit conferred. Those propositions, however, are as applicable to a remedy of $10 as they are to a remedy of $10,000,000 and will ultimately prove unhelpful in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">In my view, there are no plausible arguments for holding that the Remedy Clause can be satisfied by a remedy that is not capable of restoring a plaintiff\u2019s injured rights and, even if there were, there are no principled bases upon which a court could find the remedy in this case to be \u201csubstantial\u201d \u2014 unless, of course, every remedy short of no remedy at all is, indeed, \u201csubstantial.\u201d Here, because the constitution plainly requires that plaintiff have a fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>restorative remedy and because the legislative limitation on that remedy is so patently insufficient to serve that purpose, I cannot join the majority in upholding its constitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b447-5\">Walters, J., and Durham, Justice, pro tempore, join in this dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-7\"> The Remedy Clause affords plaintiff, and every person in this state, the right to a remedy by due course of law for personal injuries. The analysis of that right set out in our cases, and discussed in this dissent, does not differentiate between economic or noneconomic damages. As a matter of both history and logic, both kinds of damages comprise the remedy that is reasonably calculated, so far as possible, to restore or repair the right that defendant injured. I draw particular attention to the effect of the majority\u2019s holding on plaintiff\u2019s right to recover her economic injuries for only one reason. Plaintiff\u2019s economic damages reflect her out-of-pocket expenses, such as for medical bills, that is the result of defendant\u2019s conduct. Assuming that causal link, the calculation of plaintiff\u2019s economic damages requires only simple arithmetic and includes no evaluation by a factfinder of plaintiff\u2019s mental or emotional injuries, such as her pain and suffering. Thus, in focusing momentarily on the topic of plaintiff\u2019s economic damages, we perhaps can see the majority\u2019s error in clearest relief. According to the majority, Article I, section 10, does not guarantee plaintiff a right to recover a remedy reflecting even the amount of plaintiff\u2019s monetary expenses, including her medical bills, directly attributable to defendant\u2019s conduct. As this dissent demonstrates, the majority\u2019s novel interpretation of Article I, section 10, departs sharply from our case law and deprives the constitutional guarantee of a remedy by due course of law of any practical meaning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b429-8\"> This case does not call upon us to consider \u2014 and the majority has not considered \u2014 the constitutionality of the trial court\u2019s action or that of the legislature under Article I, section 17, of the Oregon Constitution. That provision prohibits interference with the jury\u2019s assessment of damages in a common-law negligence action like this one. <em>Lakin v.

Consequently, much of <em>Greist </em>is no longer substantively applicable as a matter of Oregon law. That said, as we acknowledged in <em>Clarke v.

The majority correctly notes that Judge Deady observed in <em>Conroy </em>that, at least in 1885, the states were \u201cnearly evenly divided on the question whether \u2018contributory negligence\u2019 is a part of the plaintiff\u2019s case or a matter of defense.\u201d And with regard to Oregon, Judge Deady also observed that the <em>Walsh </em>case indicated that plaintiff had the burden to prove the plaintiff\u2019s absence of negligence. I would note, however, that in doing so Judge Deady appeared skeptical of the rule, pointing out that \u201c[t]he law does not presume that anyone is negligent; especially when such negligence may or will result in his own personal injury.\u201d 23 F at 72. Moreover, Judge Deady characterized the court\u2019s reference to the rule stated in <em>Walsh </em>as \u201ca <em>dictum </em>to that effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72. Judge Deady\u2019s observations are consistent with Oregon statutory law at the time the constitution was adopted. At that time, with regard to civil matters, there was a presumption that, \u201ca person takes ordinary care of his own concerns.\u201d General Laws of Oregon, Civil Code, ch VIII, title VII, \u00a7 766, p 337 (Deady 1845-1864). With regard to the Beach treatise, I would point out that in the third edition of the treatise in 1899 Beach still recognized <em>Walsh </em>as controlling almost 15 years after that was clearly no longer the case. <em>See </em>Charles Fisk Beach, Jr., <em>A Treatise on the Law of Contributory Negligence </em>\u00a7 422, 599-601 (3rd ed 1899) (listing Oregon as one of the states requiring a plaintiff to prove the absence of his own negligence).

I write separately to draw attention to an issue concerning Article I, section 10, of the Oregon Constitution that likely will come before this court in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">The key facts are that the jury in this case found that plaintiff and defendant Boyle were each 50 percent at fault for the personal injuries that plaintiff suffered. The trial court accepted the jury\u2019s finding that plaintiff had suffered economic damages in the sum of $765,000 and noneconomic damages in the sum of $250,000. The court reduced those sums by 50 percent to account for plaintiff\u2019s comparative negligence and entered a judgment against defendants for $382,500 in economic damages and $125,000 in noneconomic damages, for a total judgment for plaintiff in the sum of $507,500. Finally, the trial court rejected defendants\u2019 motion to reduce further plaintiff\u2019s total damages to $200,000, in accordance with ORS 31.270(l)(b) (2007). According to the trial court, that further reduction would deprive plaintiff of her constitutionally guaranteed \u201cremedy by due course of law for injury done [her] in [her] person,\u201d as provided in Article I, section 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">The majority today rejects that ruling. It concludes that Article I, section 10, does not prevent the legislature from imposing a \u201ccap\u201d of $200,000 on the jury\u2019s decision that plaintiff suffered damages (adjusted for her comparative negligence) in the sum of $507,000. According to the majority, Article I, section 10, entitles plaintiff not to the damages that actually would restore and, thus, remedy her personal injury, but only to whatever lesser sum that the legislature may designate if the court can say that that sum is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>\u201csubstantial\u201d remedy. <em>Howell v. Boyle, </em>353 Or at 359 (majority concludes that state constitution requires any limited remedy to be \u201csubstantial,\u201d and the capped judgment that plaintiff received \u201csatisfies that constitutional requirement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The majority opinion demonstrates just how far the majority has strayed from the remedy guarantee that Article I, section 10, embodies. The text of that provision guarantees a \u201cremedy by due course of law;\u201d the adjective \u201csubstantial\u201d does not appear in any form in the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">As Justice De Muniz capably demonstrates in his dissent, the adjective \u201csubstantial\u201d is unworkable as a legal standard because it is ambiguous and amorphous in the extreme. It is telling that the majority does not attempt to define or explain the meaning or limits of that term in this context; that would be a fool\u2019s errand. Like the meaning of \u201cbeauty,\u201d the meaning of \u201csubstantial\u201d in this context exists only in the eye of the beholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">How did the court\u2019s interpretive focus shift from the constitutional text (particularly the term \u201cremedy\u201d) to the adjective \u201csubstantial\u201d? The answer appears in <em>Hale v. Port of Portland, </em>308 Or 508, 783 P2d 506 (1989). That case reviewed (somewhat inaccurately, as Justice Linde correctly noted in his concurring opinion) earlier cases that discussed the legislature\u2019s authority to alter statutory and common law claims and remedies as long as the constitutionally significant underlying interests in person, property, and reputation are protected. The <em>Hale </em>court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">\u201cUnder those cases, the remedy need not be precisely of the same type or extent; it is enough that the remedy is a substantial one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">It is that sentence that has pulled the majority away from the constitutional text of Article I, section 10. That sentence does not purport to construe any constitutional term. But the majority now uses the adjective \u201csubstantial\u201d to conclude that the guarantee of a remedy for the injury to plaintiff\u2019s person is satisfied by a cropped sum of money that, in legal terms, does not restore or repair (and thus does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>not remedy) the injury inflicted by defendant to plaintiff\u2019s body and pocketbook. Instead of focusing on the real issue\u2014 whether plaintiff has received her guaranteed remedy by due course of law \u2014 the majority addresses whether the capped judgment awards a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount. I submit that there will never be a satisfactory answer to that issue because it asks the wrong question. Apparently, the majority has now condemned this court to repeat, over and over, that same fruitless quarrel over how to apply a standard based on a mere adjective used in one unexplained sentence in <em>Hale.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">I conclude by inviting this court to reassess its approach to the remedy guarantee by returning to the words of the constitution itself and the interests of the people described therein. Those who drafted the remedy guarantee did not wish to tie the legislature\u2019s hands in abolishing older forms of action and remedy so long as the people\u2019s interests in person, property, and reputation remain protected through remedies provided by due course of law, including the constitutional right to trial by jury. They did not conceive, I submit, of a remedial scheme that would allow the legislature to cut personal injury damages by more than half, as here, with no hint of an adequate or alternative remedy to make up for that cut. That approach grants an unjustified windfall to the wrongdoer here and defeats the principle of responsibility for injury caused to others that Article I, section 10, embodies. Only in the topsy-turvy world occupied by the majority does a capped award of $200,000 constitute a remedy for the $507,000 injury that plaintiff suffered as a result of defendants\u2019 tortious conduct here.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Counsel who wish to invite the court to engage in that reassessment of Article I, section 10, should preserve that argument at the appropriate stage and advance the arguments, suggested in this court\u2019s case law, that justify a reconsideration of today\u2019s unfortunate decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
