Withrow, plaintiff-appellee, was involved in an automobile accident on September 8, 1988. The vehicle involved in the accident was a van owned by Wayne Backus for use in Backus\u2019s business. Withrow drove the van for the business on a daily basis for over one and one half years. However, at the time of the accident, Withrow was driving the van to his home from a bar where he had been drinking that evening after work.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-20\">Withrow was aware that the van was not insured, but did not ask his insurance agent to cover the vehicle in his personal automobile policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Following the accident, Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company, defendant-appellant, denied Withrow coverage for the accident based on an exclusion clause for the \u201cregular use\u201d of another automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Withrow filed declaratory judgment action, and the case went to trial on May 29, 1990. The trial court found in favor of Withrow. Appellant raises a single assignment of error in this appeal. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred in finding that personal automobile policy exclusion for non-owned vehicles \u2018furnished or available for regular use\u2019 was not applicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred when it failed to apply the personal automobile policy exclusion for a non-owned vehicle which is furnished or available for an insured\u2019s regular use.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">The exclusion clause in the appellee\u2019s personal automobile insurance policy with the appellant states in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">\u201cEXCLUSIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">\u201cB. We do not provide liability coverage for the ownership, maintenance or use of:</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">\u201c2. Any vehicle, other than your covered auto, which is:</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">\u201cb. Furnished or available for your regular use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">The general purpose of this type of provision is to cover occasional or incidental use of vehicles without the payment of an additional premium, but to exclude the habitual use of other cars, which would increase the risk on the insurance company without a corresponding increase in the premium. 58 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1985) 391, Insurance, Section 892; American Jurisprudence 2d (1980, Supp.1990), Automobile Insurance, Section 244. See, also, Annotation (1981), 8 A.L.R.4th 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">When called upon to interpret insurance contracts, a court is required to construe provisions strictly against an insurer only when the provisions are ambiguous. See <em>Dairyland Ins. Co. v. Finch </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 360, 513 N.E.2d 1324. Otherwise, undefined words used in an insurance policy are to be given their common meaning unless an absurdity results. See <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">Past decisions have defined the phrase \u201cfurnished for regular use\u201d as found in individual or family automobile insurance policies as a frequent, steady or constant use over a substantial period of time. <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Travelers Indemn. Co. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 94, 95, 71 O.O.2d 69, 71, 326 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>N.E.2d 263, 264, citing <em>Kenney v. Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corp. </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St.2d 131, 34 O.O.2d 259, 214 N.E.2d 219; <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sandford </em>(1966), 8 Ohio App.2d 259, 37 O.O.2d 249, 221 N.E.2d 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">In the instant case, the trial court found that appellee Withrow drove the employer-owned van on a daily basis, transporting workers and himself to and from job sites. The trial court also found that Withrow had his own set of keys for the van and was allowed to take the van to his home on numerous occasions. Further, the trial court found that Withrow had used the van on occasion for his personal use. However, in its conclusions of law, the trial court did not conclude that these findings constituted a regular use and, thus, declared that Withrow\u2019s policy must cover the accident. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In support of its conclusions of law the trial court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">\u201cAn employee\u2019s use of the employer\u2019s vehicle for transportation \u2018on the way to work or on the way home from work does not constitute the operation of a motor vehicle in one\u2019s business or occupation.\u2019 <em>National Mutual Insurance Co. v. Reiser </em>(1984), 15 Ohio App.3d 21 [15 OBR 43, 472 N.E.2d 375].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">We find the trial court\u2019s reliance on <em>Reiser, supra, </em>misplaced. The holding cited from that case referred to a \u201cbusiness or occupation use\u201d policy exclusion clause in an automobile insurance policy. Thus, the reasoning cited in <em>Reiser, supra, </em>does not apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Based on our review of the record, we find that the company\u2019s vehicle had been furnished for Withrow\u2019s \u201cregular use\u201d within the meaning of the exclusionary clause found in Withrow\u2019s personal automobile coverage and as defined in <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Travelers Indemn. Co., supra, </em>and cases cited therein. There was no coverage under Withrow\u2019s personal automobile insurance policy for the accident, whether or not he had been on a social rather than a business function at the time the accident occurred. Withrow had a constant or \u201cregular\u201d use of the company vehicle over a substantial period of time, for both business and personal use. Thus, the exclusion clause found in his personal automobile insurance policy was unambiguous and should have controlled the disposition of this case. See, also, <em>Romano v. Girlinghouse </em>(La.App.1980) 385 So.2d 352; <em>Economy Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Gorman </em>(1980), 84 Ill.App.3d 1127, 40 Ill.Dec. 468, 406 N.E.2d 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Accordingly, we sustain appellant\u2019s assignment of error. The judgment of the trial court is reversed and judgment is hereby rendered for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b626-11\">Baird, P.J., and Victor, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>William H.
