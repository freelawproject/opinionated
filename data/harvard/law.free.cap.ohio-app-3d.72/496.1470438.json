Defendant\u2019s single assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">\u201cWhere a trial court imposes an indefinite sentence for a violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(7), a criminal defendant has been denied due process of law and has been illegally sentenced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">Defendant entered a guilty plea to one count of aggravated trafficking in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(7). Pursuant to R.C. 2925.03(C)(6), defendant\u2019s conviction is a felony of the first degree, and the court \u201cshall impose a sentence of actual incarceration of five years and if the offender has previously been convicted of a felony drug offense, the court shall impose a sentence of actual incarceration of at least seven years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">In accordance with the foregoing, as well as R.C. 2929.11, the trial court imposed an indefinite sentence of five to twenty-five years, with actual incarceration of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">Appellant filed for post-conviction relief, contending that he should have received a definite, rather than indefinite, sentence. The trial court overruled defendant\u2019s request for post-conviction relief, and defendant appeals therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">Essentially, defendant contends that R.C. 2925.03, the specific sentencing statute for convictions of aggravated trafficking in drugs, controls the general felony sentencing statute found in R.C. 2929.11(B). Specifically, defendant points to the language of R.C. 2929.11(B), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b529-14\">\u201cExcept as provided in * * * Chapter 2925. of the Revised Code, terms of imprisonment for felony shall be imposed as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b529-15\"><em>U </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b529-16\">\u201c(4) For a felony of the first degree, the minimum term shall be four, five, six, or seven years, and the maximum term shall be twenty-five years[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Given the foregoing language, including the exception noted at the beginning of R.C. 2929.11(B), defendant contends that the trial court erred in imposing any sentence pursuant to R.C. 2929.11, arguing that \u201c[i]f the legislature had intended R.C. 2925.03 and 2929.11 to be read together, then they would have provided for such a reading in R.C. 2925.03 and would not have expressly exempted R.C. [Chapter] 2925 from the sentencing guidelines of R.C. 2929.11.\u201d Hence, defendant contends that R.C. 2925.03 \u201cmust prevail as an exception to R.C. 2929.11,\u201d and that the trial court erred in sentencing defendant to a term of indefinite imprisonment pursuant to R.C. 2929.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">This court considered a similar argument in <em>State v. Jarrell </em>(May 24, 1990), Franklin App. No. 90AP-220, unreported, 1990 WL 71012. Therein, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\u201cAs indicated above, the word \u2018except\u2019 does not mean that the R.C. Chapter 2925 penalties are to be applied instead of an indefinite sentence under R.C. 2929.11. Moreover, the word \u2018except\u2019 does not mean that a sentence of actual incarceration is to be served in addition to an indefinite sentence. Compare R.C. 2929.71(A). <em>The word \u2018except\u2019 as used in R.C. 2929.11(B) can only mean that the general sentencing provisions in R.C. 2929.11 apply to drug offenses under R.C. Chapter 2925 except to the extent that the specific provisions for a given drug offense are inconsistent with the general sentencing statute.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Finding the <em>Jarrell </em>decision to be controlling herein, we find, as did the court therein, that \u201cactual incarceration\u201d as used in R.C. 2925.03 is not inconsistent with an indefinite term of imprisonment under R.C. 2929.11. Rather, \u201cthe term \u2018actual incarceration\u2019 may serve as a substitute for or a portion of the minimum term provided in R.C. 2929.11.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">As a result, in accordance with the <em>Jarrell </em>decision, we overrule appellant\u2019s single assignment of error, finding no error in the trial court\u2019s imposing a term of actual incarceration as part of the indefinite term specified in R.C. 2929.11. Having overruled defendant\u2019s single assignment of error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b530-12\">Whiteside and Martin, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b530-13\">William J.
