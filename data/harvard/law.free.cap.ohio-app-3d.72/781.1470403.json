Baus from the judgment of the Wayne County Court of Common Pleas. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">Appellee, Michael F. Baus, and appellant Mary were married on July 19, 1980. Michael adopted Mary\u2019s son, William. William graduated from high school in June 1990, and he was eighteen years old at the time of the parties\u2019 child support hearing. Ronald, age five, and Daniel, age three, were bom as issue of the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-13\">On December 28, 1989, the parties were granted a divorce on Mary\u2019s complaint. Issues of alimony, division of property, and support and custody of the minor children were reserved for trial at a future date. On March 15, 1990, the trial court issued an order dividing the parties\u2019 property, awarding Mary alimony in the amount of $2,500 per month for forty-six consecutive months, and awarding custody of all three children to Mary, subject to Michael\u2019s visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-14\">On April 18 and April 19, 1990, a hearing was held before the trial court on the issue of child support. The trial court found that Mary earned no gross income, and calculated Michael\u2019s gross income as a self-employed dentist to be $121,262 for the purposes of determining child support. After taking into consideration Michael\u2019s extensive visitation schedule, alimony payments, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>contributions to the minor children\u2019s college funds, the trial court ordered Michael to pay as child support $650 per month, per child, for three children from December 1, 1989 through May 81, 1990, and $725 per month, per child, for two children thereafter. In addition, Michael was ordered to deposit $1,200 per child, per year, in a custodial account for the education of the two minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Mary now appeals the trial court\u2019s award of child support and raises two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Assignment of Error I</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred, as a matter of law, in computing the defendant\u2019s gross income (upon which child support was computed) by deducting costs already included in depreciation from the defendant\u2019s self-employment gross receipts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">The parties agree that R.C. 3113.215, effective April 12, 1990, governs the computation of child support in the instant case. Pursuant to R.C. 3113.215, the court must first determine the parents\u2019 combined gross income. \u201cGross income\u201d is defined as, <em>inter alia, </em>self-generated income. R.C. 3113.-215(A)(2). \u201cSelf-generated income\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">\u201c * * * gross receipts received by a parent from self-employment, proprietorship of a business, joint ownership of a partnership or closely held corporation, and rents minus ordinary and necessary expenses incurred by the parent in generating the gross receipts. * * * \u201d R.C. 3113.215(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">Finally, the statute defines \u201cordinary and necessary expenses incurred in generating gross receipts\u201d as actual items expended by the parent or his business. R.C. 3113.215(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">It is Mary\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in computing Michael\u2019s gross income, because it held that equipment costs and leasehold improvements for Michael\u2019s dental office were ordinary and necessary business expenses, and subtracted them from his self-generated income. Thus, Mary argues, the trial court wrongfully excluded $66,062 from Michael\u2019s gross income for the purposes of computing child support. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">Mary argues that because the equipment costs and leasehold improvements were included on Michael\u2019s 1989 federal tax Schedule C \u2014 Detail Depreciation Schedule, they must be included in his gross income under that portion of R.C. 3113.215(A)(4) which excludes from ordinary and necessary business expenses \u201cdepreciation expenses and other noncash items that are allowed as deductions on any federal tax return.\u201d Mary\u2019s argument ignores the fact that the equipment costs and leasehold improvements were not \u201cnoncash items,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>but were actual cash items, expended in 1989 by Michael for the generation of income in his dental practice, which reduced his self-generated income. That portion of R.C. 3113.215(A)(4) which excludes depreciation expenses and noncash deductions from ordinary and necessary business expenses is designed to ensure that a parent\u2019s gross income is not reduced by any sum that was not actually expended in the year used for computing child support. As such, it is inapplicable to the facts of this case, and the trial court did not err when it deducted the equipment costs and leasehold improvements as ordinary and necessary business expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Assignment of Error II</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred, as a matter of law, in computing the defendant\u2019s gross income (upon which child support was computed) by deducting from the defendant\u2019s self-employment gross receipts a voluntary Keogh retirement plan contribution made by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Mary also argues that the trial court erred when it held that Michael\u2019s 1989 contribution of $21,391 to his Keogh plan was an ordinary and necessary business expense and deducted the cost of the contribution from his self-generated income. Essentially, Mary is arguing that the trial court\u2019s finding was against the manifest weight of the evidence. When asked to reverse the verdict based on the manifest weight of the evidence, this court\u2019s standard of review is limited:</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">\u201cJudgments supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed by a reviewing court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 280, 8 O.O.3d 261, 262, 376 N.E.2d 578, 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">Mary argues that the trial court\u2019s ruling was inconsistent with its findings of fact, in which the trial court described the Keogh plan as a \u201cplan for [Michael\u2019s] personal benefit to which he can make a non-mandatory contribution of up to $30,000 per year.\u201d However, we note that the trial court also specifically found that \u201cthe Keogh contribution is an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in generating gross receipts for the dental practice.\u201d Furthermore, we find ample support for this finding in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">Both Mary and Michael, as well as Michael\u2019s accountant, David Wilson, testified that the Keogh plan was offered as an employee benefit to Michael\u2019s employees in his dentistry practice. Furthermore, both Michael and Wilson testified that the maintenance of a Keogh plan was a necessary employee benefit in order to attract and keep good employees. Wilson testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>although contributions to the Keogh plan were termed \u201cdiscretionary,\u201d the value of the plan to maintaining good employees made the contributions a \u201cnecessary cost of doing business.\u201d Finally, Wilson explained that, because employees could not \u201cget contributions until [Michael] makes a contribution,\u201d Michael\u2019s contributions were, in fact, mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Upon our review of the record, we do not find that the trial court\u2019s conclusion, that the Keogh plan contribution was a necessary and ordinary business expense, was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Therefore, the trial court properly excluded Michael\u2019s Keogh plan contribution from his self-generated income, pursuant to R.C. 3113.215(A)(3) and (4). Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b817-8\">Cacioppo, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b817-9\">Quillin, P.J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b817-10\">Quillin, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ak2\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">I concur in the disposition of Assignment of Error I, but dissent from the disposition of Assignment of Error II.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
