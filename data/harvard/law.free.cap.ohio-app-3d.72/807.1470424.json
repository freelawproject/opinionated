Proffitt, on one count of gross sexual imposition, in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(3). At appellant\u2019s trial, the eight-year-old victim testified appellant stuck his fingers inside her as she sat with him on a couch in the home of her mother\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s parents. The victim also drew a circle on a picture of a little girl, indicating that appellant had touched her sexual organ.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Dr. Susannah K. Sutphin, an emergency room physician at Middletown Regional Hospital, testified that she examined the victim\u2019s vaginal area several hours after the alleged incident. According to Dr. Sutphin, the examination revealed a fairly recent abrasion on the outside of the vagina and a recent redness of the opening of the vagina. Over objections, the doctor opined that the injuries were consistent with the victim\u2019s allegation of sexual abuse. After the state rested, appellant made a Crim.R. 29 motion to dismiss, which the court overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Following the close of evidence, the jury found appellant guilty as charged. At final disposition on June 21, 1990, the court sentenced appellant to a one and one-half year prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">Appellant appealed in a timely manner and presents the following assignment of error for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant by failing to grant defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss under Rule 29, after allowing impermissible expert testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">Appellant\u2019s assignment of error raises two issues concerning Dr. Sutphin\u2019s expert testimony. First, it is argued that Sutphin\u2019s opinion failed to comply with the requirements of Evid.R. 705. Evid.R. 705 concerns the disclosure of facts underlying an expert\u2019s opinion and states: \u201cThe expert may testify in terms of opinion or inference and give his reasons therefor after disclosure of the underlying facts or data. The disclosure may be in response to a hypothetical question or otherwise.\u201d Specifically, appellant asserts that the state failed to produce testimony regarding the victim\u2019s statement to Sutphin prior to the promulgation of the doctor\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">A review of the transcript of the hearing shows the following dialogue transpired during the questioning of Dr. Sutphin:</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number><em>\u201cQ. </em>Okey [sic]. Now, doctor based upon a reasonable degree of medical certainty do you have an opinion as to what the probable cause of those injuries was?</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, I felt that * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\"><em>\u201cMR CRIST: </em>I\u2019m going to object, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\"><em>\u201cBY THE COURT: </em>Overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I felt that the injuries were consistent with the story that the child told me.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>That she was sexually molested?</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">Sutphin\u2019s affirmative response to the prosecutor\u2019s question implies that the victim told Sutphin that she (the victim) had been sexually abused. Moreover, the doctor stated earlier that she conducted the examination to determine the validity of the victim\u2019s sexual assault complaint. The disclosure of these facts indicates Sutphin\u2019s opinion substantially complied with Evid.R. 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">Appellant\u2019s second issue argues that <em>State v. Boston </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 545 N.E.2d 1220, prohibits an expert from testifying on the veracity of a child-declarant\u2019s statement in a sexual abuse case. It is asserted that Sutphin\u2019s statement regarding the consistency of the victim\u2019s allegations with her injuries amounts to an opinion on the victim\u2019s truthfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">The facts in <em>Boston </em>show that the victim\u2019s refusal to testify in court resulted in no real examination or cross-examination of her statements implicating the alleged perpetrator. As a result, the court refused to allow a doctor to testify that the victim did not fantasize her own abuse and that she had not been programmed to make the accusations. Such opinion evidence was improper, the court concluded, since it \u201c \u2018acted as a litmus test of the key issue in the case and infringed upon the role of the fact finder, who is charged with making determinations of veracity and credibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128-129, 545 N.E.2d at 1240, quoting <em>State v. Eastham </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 307, 312, 530 N.E.2d 409, 414 (H. Brown, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-14\">The facts in the case <em>sub judice </em>can be distinguished from <em>Boston. </em>The record shows that appellant had full opportunity to cross-examine the victim. This permitted the jury to perceive the victim and gauge her credibility. In <em>Boston, </em>the doctor\u2019s opinion intruded upon an essential task of the jury since the three-year-old victim refused to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>Furthermore, unlike the expert\u2019s psychological evaluation of the victim in <em>Boston, </em>Sutphin's opinion was premised on objective, medical evidence and contained a guarantee of trustworthiness. This cohrt recently addressed the issue of the admissibility of expert testimony in a sexual abuse case in <em>State v. Garrett </em>(July 16, 1990), Clermont App. No. CA90-08-070, unreported, 1990 WL 98222. In that case, a social worker testified that the behavior of the four-year-old victim was consistent with that of other sexually abused children. On appeal, the defendant alleged that the social worker\u2019s testimony amounted to an inadmissible opinion as to the victim\u2019s credibility. This court found the testimony admissible since it did not have the sole effect of bolstering the victim\u2019s veracity, by noting:</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">\u201cThis court has consistently rejected efforts by the prosecution to present testimony asserting the reliability of the victim\u2019s story, particularly where physical or medical evidence of abuse is scant. * * * However, in the instant case, ample medical evidence existed that the victim had been sexually abused * * *. Thus, the concern that a social worker\u2019s testimony might be a bald attempt to assert the believability of the victim\u2019s story is nonexistent. * * * \u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">In the present case, Sutphin provided objective medical evidence which showed the victim had been sexually abused. The existence of such reliable evidence extinguished the danger that the jury would view Sutphin\u2019s comment regarding the consistency between the victim\u2019s story and her injuries as an assertion that the victim should be believed. As a result, we find Sutphin\u2019s testimony admissible and overrule appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b842-8\">Koehler, P.J., and William W.
