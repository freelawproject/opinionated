We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-13\">Plaintiffs-appellants, Larry and Anita Hornacek, were married on November 1, 1985. On November 20, 1985, Anita was injured in an automobile accident while driving a 1985 Ford which Anita purchased prior to the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-14\">Anita filed a claim for her injuries with the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance company and was paid the limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage. Anita then filed a claim with defendant-appellee, Travelers Insurance Company (\u201cTravelers\u201d), requesting coverage for her injuries under the uninsured (which by definition included underinsured) motorist coverage in the policy. Larry had purchased the policy prior to his marriage to Anita. At the time of the accident, the policy\u2019s declaration page did not list Anita as a named insured or the 1985 Ford as an insured vehicle. Travelers denied the claim asserting that Anita\u2019s injuries were not covered under the uninsured motorist provision of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>The Hornaceks filed this action requesting a declaratory judgment as to whether Anita\u2019s injuries were covered under the Travelers uninsured motorist provision. The trial court found in favor of Travelers\u2019 denial of coverage. The Hornaceks now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u201cI. The trial court erred by failing to properly consider appellant\u2019s testimony and supporting evidence stating Anita Hornacek\u2019s vehicle was an insured under plaintiff Larry Hornacek\u2019s insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u201cII. The trial court abused its discretion by first asserting it could not address appellants\u2019 contention that appellant\u2019s insurance agent bound coverage on Anita Hornacek\u2019s vehicle then citing the agent\u2019s testimony as argument against appellants\u2019 contention the coverage was orally confirmed. The court failed to consider any of appellants\u2019 arguments addressing the issues of agency and/or respondeat superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">\u201cHI. The trial court erred in holding that appellants\u2019 failure to include the insurance agent as a named defendant prohibited the court from considering any arguments by appellants as to the agent\u2019s involvement in binding appellee to providing and/or extending insurance coverage to Anita Hornacek\u2019s vehicle under Larry Hornacek\u2019s insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">\u201cIV. The trial court erred by failing to consider the fact that at no time did either appellee or it\u2019s <em>[sic </em>] agent rebut appellant\u2019s testimony that he received oral confirmation of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">\u201cV. The trial court erred in rendering a decision that is inconsistent with existing case law or statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">The Travelers uninsured motorist policy provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\"><em>\u201cWe </em>will pay damages that the <em>insured </em>is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an <em>uninsured motor vehicle </em>because of bodily injury suffered by the <em>insured </em>and caused by accident. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">\u00ab * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b65-14\"><em>\u201cYou </em>and a <em>relative </em>are <em>insureds.\u201d </em>(Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-15\">The policy defines \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d as:</p>\n<p id=\"b65-16\">\u201c * * * the person named in Item 1 of the declarations page. They also mean that person\u2019s spouse if residing in the same household.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-17\">Therefore, Anita, as Larry\u2019s spouse, is an insured under the policy. However, the policy contains an exclusion which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b65-18\">\u201cThis insurance does not cover bodily injury suffered in certain situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>\u201c1. It does not cover bodily injury suffered by the insured while <em>occupying </em>* * * a <em>highway vehicle </em>which <em>you </em>or a <em>relative </em>owns but does not insure for uninsured motorists coverage under this policy.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The trial court found that the 1985 Ford was owned by an insured (Anita), but was not an insured vehicle under the uninsured motorist coverage because the 1985 Ford was not listed on the declarations page. As a result, the trial court ruled that Travelers properly denied coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The policy defines \u201cyour car\u201d as:</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\"><em>\u201cYour car </em>means any vehicle described on the declarations page of this policy with premium charge showing which coverages apply. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\"><em>\u201cYour car </em>also means a vehicle of the following type of which you acquire ownership during the policy period provided <em>you </em>tell <em>us </em>about it within 30 days after <em>you </em>acquire it:</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">\u201c(a) a four wheel private passenger car[.]\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">The Hornaceks contend that Larry \u201cacquired ownership\u201d of Anita\u2019s 1985 Ford upon their marriage, and the accident occurred within the thirty-day grace period for notifying Travelers of the newly acquired vehicle. Therefore, they contend, the 1985 Ford was an insured vehicle regardless of whether it was listed on the declarations page.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">R.C. 3103.04 provides in part that:</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">\u201cNeither husband nor wife has any interest in the property of the other * * * <em>\u00bb</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">Accordingly, Larry did not \u201cacquire ownership\u201d of the 1985 Ford, because he had no interest in property Anita purchased prior to the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-15\">The Hornaceks contend that R.C. 1302.42(B) is to be used to determine whether Larry \u201cacquired ownership\u201d of the 1985 Ford for insurance coverage purposes. However, R.C. 1302.42(B) is to be used to identify the owner of a vehicle when the vehicle is purchased. See <em>Smith v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 150, 524 N.E.2d 507. Larry did not purchase the 1985 Ford and R.C. 1302.42(B) is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-16\">The Hornaceks also assert that the trial court erred in failing to find that an agent for Travelers orally bound Travelers to provide coverage for Anita and the 1985 Ford under Larry\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-17\">The Hornaceks, however, have failed to provide a transcript of the proceedings or a statement of the evidence pursuant to App.R. 9(C). In absence of an adequate record, we must presume the regularity of proceedings in the trial court. <em>Frishe v. Rios </em>(Dec. 26, 1990), Summit App.No. 14708, unreported, 1990 WL 235951. The Hornaceks concede that if the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>did not believe the Homaceks\u2019 testimony concerning the oral binder, we must affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment as a finding of fact within the trial court\u2019s province. Absent an adequate record, we must presume that the trial court properly considered all the evidence and chose not to believe the Homaceks\u2019 testimony in concluding that an oral binder did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We hold that the trial court did not err in its determination that the Travelers uninsured motorist policy did not cover Anita\u2019s injuries. The assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b67-8\">Baird and Cacioppo, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
