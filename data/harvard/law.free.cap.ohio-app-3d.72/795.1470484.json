Hoffman, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b828-18\">Plaintiffs-appellants are Elizabeth B. Snyder <em>et al. </em>and defendants-appellees are David C. Ash, D.D.S., <em>et al.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-19\">On October 14, 1985, Dr. Ash examined Snyder and advised her to undergo a wisdom tooth extraction involving three impacted molars. Plaintiff returned to Ash\u2019s office on October 21, 1985, and with the assistance of Ash\u2019s office assistant (Echman), completed a standard consent form. (Appendix A.) Included on the form was a \u201cline item\u201d (12) that a fractured jaw could result from the extraction, along with other complications such as brain damage and/or death. There is conflicting testimony as to the extent of any preextraction discussion (as to complications) between Snyder and Ash.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>During the extraction performed by Ash on October 23, 1985, Snyder\u2019s jaw was fractured. Ash located the fracture (specifically a left mandible fracture) and took immediate \u201cemergency\u201d steps, including the placement of \u201carch bars\u201d and alignment wires in the patient\u2019s mouth. As a result of both the extraction and alignment measures performed by Ash, Snyder sought treatment from an oral surgeon, Dr. Sandel. Sandel performed a \u201cbilateral ostetomy\u201d whereby Snyder\u2019s jawbone was cut and realigned, and her mouth was wired shut a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">Appellant filed suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Stark County, and the matter came on for jury trial. At the conclusion of trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendant Ash. The jury also returned specific interrogatories stating that defendant was not negligent in the care and treatment of Snyder, and answered affirmatively that Ash \u201cgave an informed consent to the surgical procedure undertaken.\u201d The court entered its judgment entry on the verdict on May 10, 1990, and it is from that judgment that appellant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Snyder raises the following three assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">\u201cA. The trial court erred as a matter of law as the statutory informed consent instruction was the incorrect law as applied to appellee dentist and misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">\u201cB. The trial court committed reversible error in refusing to admit appellee Ash\u2019s office records into evidence, as the office records are admissible under the business record exception to hearsay and the exclusion from evidence is prejudicial to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">\u201cC. It was error for the trial court to exclude the jury instruction of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>upon the jury\u2019s request of a definition of negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">Before discussing this assigned error, we note that it is unchallenged that plaintiffs\u2019 case was grounded on alternative theories of recovery: negligence and/or failure of informed consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">Appellants argue that the trial court gave an erroneous instruction on informed consent. The record reveals that both parties timely provided the court with their proposed jury instructions in accord with Civ.R. 51(A). As to the question of informed consent, plaintiffs requested an instruction based upon the common-law instruction found in <em>Nickell v. Gonzalez </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 136, 17 OBR 281, 477 N.E.2d 1145, syllabus. (Appendix B.) On the other hand, defendants filed citations to Ohio Jury Instructions, citing, but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>delineating, both the common-law instruction of <em>Nickell </em>and the OJI instruction based upon R.C. 2317.54. (Appendix C.)</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Plainly, the difference between the two instructions is that the statutory instruction carries with it the presumption that a written consent is valid, absent bad faith or fraudulent misrepresentation. See second paragraph of R.C. 2317.54.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The common-law instruction requires only that plaintiff demonstrate a \u201cfailure to disclose\u201d material risks and dangers to find a lack of informed consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Based upon the well-established principle <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>R.C. 2317.54 does not apply to appellee-dentist. Notwithstanding that the statute does not cover dentists, the trial court gave a hybrid, statutory/common-law instruction, <em>viz., </em>to show a lack of informed consent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>plaintiffs were required to prove a lack of good faith or the presence of fraudulent misrepresentation of material facts in the obtaining of said consent. The trial court stopped short of instructing that the statutory \u201cpresumption\u201d of validity was created by the written consent form executed by Snyder, as suggested in the Comments to 3 OJI 331.05, paragraph 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Appellants timely objected, pursuant to Civ.R. 51(A), to the court\u2019s charge, on the straightforward grounds that the instruction was confusing and misleading. The trial court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">At this juncture, we note that neither party has provided us with controlling authority that the court below acted either properly or improperly in providing the instruction as given. <em>Niekell, </em>cited by both parties and cited <em>supra, </em>is a pre-statute decision involving a <em>physician. </em>(We say \u201cpre-statute\u201d because this 1985 opinion arose out of thoracic surgery which took place in 1970. There is no mention of R.C. 2317.54 [effective July 28, 1975] in <em>Niekell.) </em>Notwithstanding that <em>Niekell </em>deals with informed consent as to a <em>physician, </em>this court believes the standard enunciated in <em>Niekell </em>applies equally to the practice of dentistry.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">We therefore conclude that the charge, as given, improperly added an additional element of proof to appellants\u2019 cause of action, <em>viz., </em>the proof of bad faith or fraudulent misrepresentation. The subject charge impeded plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action (sounding in informed consent) in a manner sufficiently prejudicial to constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Accordingly, we sustain appellants\u2019 first assigned error.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">Prior to oral argument, appellant withdrew this assignment of error, providing notice to appellee. Said withdrawal is accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">Evidence at trial indicated that at all times during Snyder\u2019s tooth extraction by Ash, Ash was the only person present and that Ash was in exclusive control of the operation. The trial court appropriately instructed the jury in its initial general charge on negligence, including <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>language. It did not, however, use the specific designation <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">During deliberations, the jury asked to have the instructions on negligence reread to them. The trial court did so, but deleted that portion containing the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>language which had been part of the original instruction. Appellants timely objected to the deletion.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>In <em>Marshall v. Gibson </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 10, 19 OBR 8, 482 N.E.2d 583, the Supreme Court declared: \u201cIt is thus clear that an incomplete charge will constitute grounds for reversal of a judgment where the charge as given misleads the jury.\u201d Appellees factually distinguish <em>Marshall. </em>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the complete and proper instruction on negligence was given to the jury in the initial general charge by the trial court, whereas in <em>Marshall, </em>the jury never received the complete instruction (on comparative negligence). It is obvious the jury in the case <em>sub judice </em>intended further deliberations on the issue of negligence by their very propoundment of the specific request for reinstruction. Appellees would have us condone answering the jury with supplemental, incomplete, or misleading specific instructions as long as the jury had been given the proper instruction as part of the initial general charge. We are not willing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">We conclude that failing to include the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>language of the negligence instruction in the court\u2019s reinstruction on negligence effectively minimized, if not abolished, appellants\u2019 potential cause of action on the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>theory. Such failure constituted prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Accordingly, appellants\u2019 third assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">The judgment of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b832-9\">Putman, P.J., and Smart, J., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>APPENDIX B</p>\n<p id=\"AIR\">Informed Consent</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">This is a civil action brought by the plaintiff to recover damages for injury claimed to have been caused by the failure of the defendant to inform the plaintiff about risks of injury in the surgical procedure undertaken by the defendant. To recover on this claim, the plaintiff must prove to you by the greater weight of the evidence that:</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">A. The defendant failed to disclose to and discuss with the plaintiff the material risks and dangers inherently and potentially involved with respect to the proposed surgical procedure and;</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">B. The undisclosed risks and dangers that should have been disclosed by the defendant did in fact happen and are the direct cause of injury to the plaintiff and;</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">C. A reasonable person in the plaintiffs position would have decided against the surgical procedure if the material risks and dangers inherently an <em>[sic </em>] incidental to it had been disclosed to her prior to the surgical procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">(OJI Section 331.04(1), Pg. 191, 192)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">MATERIAL RISK. A risk is material when a reasonable person, while in the condition that the physician knows or should have known he was in, would be likely to consider important the risk in deciding whether or not to refuse the proposed surgical procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">(OJI Section 331.04(2), Pg. 192)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">Plaintiff signed a written consent to the surgical procedure used by defendant, and that written consent would be valid and effective except where the evidence showed that the surgical procedure offered a different degree of risk than that which was explained to the patient. (Bruni [v.] Tatsumi (1976) 46 Ohio St.2d 127, 136-137.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">A physician owes to his patient the duty to disclose in a reasonable manner all significant medical information that the physician possesses or reasonably should possess that is material to an intelligent decision by the patient whether to undergo a proposed procedure. (Harnish v. Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center, 439 N.E.2d 240.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">The physician failed to disclose a material risk associated with the procedure and the Plaintiff would have not undergone the procedure had she known of the risk of harm that in fact occurred. (Arena v. Gingerich, 748 P.2d 547 (OR.1988.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-15\">The duty to disclose serious risks should not be based upon the doctors <em>[sic </em>] practices but on the patient\u2019s need for full disclosure of serious risks and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>feasibility of alternatives in order for the patient to make an intelligent and informed choice. (Congrove, et al. v. Homes, 308 N.E.2d 765 (1973).)</p>\n<p id=\"b838-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>APPENDIX C</p>\n<p id=\"AfD\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-7\">.
