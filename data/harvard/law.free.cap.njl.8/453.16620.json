He contended that after there had been one trial, the defendant could never have judgment as in case of non-suit, for any subsequent laches upon the part of the plaintiff in not bringing the cause to trial; but if he wish to dispose of the action, he must take it down for trial by proviso; and cited 2 <em>Tidd. Pra. </em>703; 2 <em>Arch. Pra. </em>214; <em>Rev. Laws, </em>422, <em>sec. </em>84; <em>King v. Pippett, </em>1 <em>T. Rep. </em>492; <em>Mewburn </em>v. <em>Langley </em>3 <em>T. Rep. </em>1.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b461-10\"><em>Jeffers </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Al6\">contended that the present application was too late, it should have been made during the term in which the judgment was entered.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number><em>Dayton </em>replied.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b462-5\">By the Chief Justice</author>\n<p id=\"A2K\">The present application is too late. What is the ground of it? Merely that the court made an erroneous order at the last term, and that counsel did not take a legal objection to it, which they might have taken at that time. There is no new fact stated. We must suppose the counsel to have been as well apprised of the legal objection then as they are now; and to permit them to come forward at a subsequent term and apply to set aside an order of this court upon a legal objection which they had an opportunity, but omitted, to urge when the order was made,, would be opening the door to endless litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">As to the point whether the Court can order a judgment as in case of nonsuit where there has been a trial, we express no opinion.</p>\n<author id=\"b462-7\">Ford, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADmh\">The decision of the last term did not settle the question now raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Motion refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
