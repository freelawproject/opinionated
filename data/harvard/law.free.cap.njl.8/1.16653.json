That if tho plaintiffs have sustained any damage by the non-performance of the condition of the said writing obligatory, by the said E. B. D., by reason of the said checks or drafts of the said A. 0., it was occasioned by their not removing tho said E. B. 1)., from the said office of cashier, when such damage was first discovered, and by continuing him in office for the space of three months thereafter, thereby admitting and allowing that he had well and honestly and faithfully performed all the duties of said office of cashier, and in all respects performed the condition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>said bond, and by afterwards permitting and allowing the said E. B. D. to withdraw from the said Bank the sum of one thousand dollars, and by allowing him to apply and appropriate the same and his other property to the payment and satisfaction of other demands, and also by not demanding or obtaining from him satisfaction for such damage while he was solvent and able and willing to pay and satisfy the same. And that he is now insolvent and unable to pay and satisfy the same; and also, by taking insufficient security from the said A. 0. for the said checks, when more security might have been obtained; and by delay and neglect in selling the property taken as such security and by selling large parts thereof for cash; and also, by neglecting to give a proper credit for the same; and also, by selling other large parts upon unusual terms; and also, by not selling the said property sooner, arid before the same fell in value and became injured by neglect; and by giving the said A. 0. further time to pay the said checks or drafts ; and also, by not taking possession of the said property ; and also, by still neglecting to sell parts of the said property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-5\">21. That the plaintiffs neglected to appoint a committee to examine the cash and accounts in the hands of the said E. B.

That the plaintiffs gave notice to the defendant of their agreements and settlements with the said A. 0., respecting his said checks or drafts, and of the securities received by them and from him, also herein before mentioned, and that the plaintiffs did not give due notice to the said defendant of any damage, if any has been sustained by them, by the said E.

And tlie said defendant will further give in evidence, under the general issue above pleaded, the several special matters hereinbefore mentioned, as ho shall be able and think necessary to prove on the trial of this cause, in such other order and connection as he shall be advised by his counsel: and also, that he is not, if at all answerable to the plaintiffs, otherwise answerable than as a surety for the said E. B. 1).; which said several special matters the said defendant intends to give in evidence under the general issue, pleaded in this cause on the trial thereof, or such of them as he shall be able and advised to prove in bar of the plaintiffs\u2019 said action in pursuance of the statute in such case made and provided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-5\">At the term of May, 1824, the counsel for the plaintiffs moved the court to strike out the whole of the notices attached to the defendant\u2019s pleas.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-6\"><em>Wood </em>for tlie plaintiffs</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9z\">in support of the motion. The defendant may either plead specially or he may under the statute \u201c <em>to facilitate pleadings,\u201d Rev. Laws, </em>403, plead the general issue and give notice of any special matter intended to be given in evidence; but he cannot adopt both of these methods. The defendant in this case has set forth in his pleas every matter upon which he thinks he can rely, and those things which cannot fairly be pleaded he has put into the form of notices, <em>ad captandum.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-7\">But the whole of the subject matter of these notices is inadmissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-8\">The first notice is, that E. B. D. is not Cashier. This is objectionable, because when the defendant pleads special matter, he cannot give in evidence anything which amounts to the general issue; a special plea admits the cause of action and avoids it by special matter; besides the defendant after setting out the bond in his plea, reciting that E. B. D. was \u201c Cashier of the State Bank at Elizabeth,\u201d is now estopped from denying it. 4 <em>Com. Dig. Tit.

Notice\u2014-\u201cThat the cashier did not take the oath required by the statute.\u201d This notice contains no substantial matter of defence to the action, and although a notice need not contain all the <em>formal </em>matters of plea, it ought contain every matter of substance which would be required in a plea. If the statute in this case required the cashier to take an oath faithfully to discharge his trust, it was a duty which he was bound to perform, but it was no part of his appointment; and if he has failed in the performance of one part of his duty,\u2019 it is no reason why he should be excused for the violation of another part. Again, if E. B. D. was not sworn, he was not cashier. But the defendant has admitted him to be cashier by his plea, and, therefore, cannot now be permitted to gainsay that fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-5\">3. The third notice is, \u201c that the bond was not required by the plaintiffs, pursuant to the statute.\u201d This is not true in point of fact, for that the bond was required is manifest from the plaintiff\u2019s having the bond in their possession, and bringing this action upon it. But the bond may be good although hot <em>required, </em>and if so, the fact that it was not required forms no defence; a voluntary bond would be good, if it were competent for the cashier to give, and for the Bank to receive it. It constitutes no defence to say that the Bank did not require it. If it is said that the bond does not conform to the statute, the difference should have been pointed out in the notice, and without it the notice is insufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-6\">4th Notice\u2014\u201c That the bond was not delivered.\u201d If it was not delivered it is no bond, and it may be taken advantage of under the general issue without any notice. Nothing can be the subject of a notice except what might or ought to be specially pleaded, and nothing can be specially pleaded which amounts to the general issue. <em>Stephens on Plead., </em>412, <em>Rev. Laws </em>404.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-7\">5th [Notice\u2014\u201cThat the bond was delivered to E. B.

This bond being given to E. B. D., one of the co-obligors, could not have been delivered as an escrow. 1 <em>Esp. Dig. part 2d, 58; Shep. Touch. </em>58; <em>Cro. Eliz. 520; Com.

D., was Cashier.\u201d This notice proceeds upon the idea that it should appear by the records of the corporation, that this bond was received, accepted and approved. If this is necessary, then it must be shewn by the plaintiffs on the trial, and surely a defendant can never plead specially matter which it is incumbent on a plaintiff to prove in order to make out his case. But the very fact of the plaintiffs suing upon the bond is sufficient to show that they approved of it. A parol acceptance of a bond by a corporation is good; the ancient doctrine that a corporation could only act by a common seal has been exploded, and now, they may act without seal, and may even be bound by an implied contract. 7 <em>Oranch. </em>306.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-6\">7th Notice\u2014\u201cThat the plaintiffs were the occasion of the injury.

This notice is liable to the same objections as the two preceding. 2. It is perfectly immaterial how he has violated the bond, whether from nonfeasance or misfeasance, the defendant is equally liable. 3. The provisions of the bond shew that the parties contemplated a nonfeasance as well as a misfeasance, (see the condition of bond.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-10\">10th Notice\u2014\u201c That the plaintiffs have not been damnified.\u201d This is too vague and uncertain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-11\">11th Notice\u2014\u201c That the Cashier resigned his office and delivered to the committee the documents, &amp;c., &amp;o., in full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>satisfaction of the damages they had sustained.\u201d This is the same in substance as the matter set up in the fourth special plea. The plea states the documents to have been delivered to the plaintiffs themselves, and the notice states the delivery to the committee of the plaintiffs; and having been pleaded, it cannot be again set up in a notice. This was decided in the case of <em>CJiew </em>and <em>Egbert.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-5\">But the defence is had, even if it had not been contained in the special plea. The performance of part of a person\u2019s duty, cannot be pleaded as a satisfaction or in discharge of an action for not doing other duties -or the whole of the duties of the person pleading it. 1 <em>Esp.

The Bank is not bound by the acts of the President; the act of the majority of the directors can alone bind the Bank.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-11\">Again, A. 0., the President, was liable to the Bank for the money obtained upon the checks or drafts, the Bank was therefore authorized to enter into an agreement with him to take a collateral security. His liability was separate and distinct from that of the cashier, and nothing short of an actual satisfaction of the demand, by one will discharge the other. There was no relation of surety and principal between the cashier and the President, A. 0. 3 <em>Wheat.

This notice is in substance pretty much the same as the preceding. If the plaintiffs did accept a bond from the said A. 0. for the amount of the checks or drafts, they did not thereby discharge the bond which the Cashier had given. Although it might be true that A. 0. could not afterwards be sued in assumpsit on the checks, yet the distinct liability of the Cashier was not diminished. 1st <em>Esp. Di., Part 2d, page </em>67.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-5\">17. The amount of this notice is, that there was a committee appointed to examine the accounts of bank, and that they reported that they were all right. And the argument intended to bo drawn from this, is, that because the Cashier was so adroit, and concealed the matter so nicely, that the committee reported in his favor, that therefore he is to be discharged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-6\">18. That E. B. D. had the checks of A. 0. in his hands, and the plaintiffs by receiving them from him ratified his acts. But how did E. B. I), receive these checks? He received them as Cashier; wrongfully it is true, but the bank was entitled to them, and their receiving them of him, could not discharge him. The checks did not belong to E. B. D., and delivering them up was no more than an act of duty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-7\">19. The same answer may bo given to this notice as to the preceding; and besides, any delay which the bank extended to A. 0. could not affect the liability of the Cashier, because the relation of principal and surety did not exist between them. <em>3d Wheat Be. </em>520.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-8\">20. Notice. (Read the notice.) 1st. This is bad because the bank were not bound to remove the Cashier, and if they did not it is not in their power to set up such a defence. 2d. As to the Cashier drawing money out of the bank, which he had deposited there, this does not discharge him or his surety. 3d. As to the not prosecuting the Cashier, I admit that if any benefit is to bo derived from it the defendant is entitled to it. ' But a mere delay in not prosecuting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>principal will not discharge a surety; unless there is a delay by contract, or a fraudulent concealment, the surety is not discharged. <em>10th East. </em>34, <em>ib. </em>369; <em>2d John.

Notice is, 1st, \u201c That the bank neglected to appoint committees to examine the accounts of the Cashier as often as they might, and 2d, That the committees reported favorably.\u201d But there is no charge of fraud in the committee, and unless there is fraud the surety is not discharged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-6\">22.

The bringing the suit is a sufficient notice and all that the law requires.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-7\">23.

These notices present many very important questions. As preliminary to the discussion of each notice separately, it may be proper to observe, that many of the doctrines relative to the matters contained in these notices, notices have been adopted from the courts of equity, and courts of law have been liberal in allowing and construing them. The statute to facilitate pleading does not say that you cannot plead specially and give notice also; it only introduces a new and cumulative remedy. As to the form of these notices, they need not be as precise and particular as a special plea; it is sufficient if they contain such a statement of the special matter to be given in evidence at the trial, as may prevent the plaintiff from being taken by surprise. <em>Chamberlain </em>vs. <em>Gorham, 20 John. </em>746.

We contend that when the committee of the Bank discovered the situation in which the affairs of the Bank stood, that they should have looked immediately either to A. 0. or to the cashier; that having entered into arrangements with A. 0., they made their election to proceed against him and cannot now resort to the surety of the cashier or the cashier himself. 4 <em>John.

They might have refused to take them of the cashier as money and called upon him to pay them. But when they received them of the cashier as cash, they ratify his act. 1 <em>Cain.

Here the directors received these checks from the cashier as evidences of debt accounted with him for them. They did not, at that time, look to the cashier or his sureties for the payment of them; but they looked to A. 0., and demanded the amount of him. It is precisely like the case of a note\u2014 Suppose the cashier had let an individual have money out of the bank'upon his promissory note without the consent of the directors; this he had no right to do\u2014but suppose that afterwards the directors accept this note and approve of it; can they afterwards, if the drawer of the note should fail, resort to the cashier for a breach of duty ? Certainly not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-4\">19th Notice\u2014As to this, it was said that the cashier and A. 0. were not to be considered in the light of principal and surety; but the distinction taken by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was more subtle than solid; if the cashier is liable, A. 0. is also\u2014it is all one transaction. The case cited by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel from 10 <em>East. </em>34. <em>The Trent Navigation Company </em>v. <em>Harley, </em>is a solitary one, and one which carries the indulgence to the principal farther than it was ever carried before, and farther than the law will warrant.

It has been decided that the same matter cannot be presented in the double form of a special plea, and also of notice; but in this case the matters appear to be so different that no two of them are alike, and there is an option in respect to each matter, to plead it at the common law, or give notice of it under the general issue; either way being lawful cannot be prohibited by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">The plaintiffs\u2019 next motion is to strike out all the notices, because of an insufficiency alleged to be apparent in each one, which renders a detailed consideration of them unavoidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">1. The defendant is certainly estopped from denying that <em>Dayton </em>was Cashier, after having recited in the bond under hand and seal that he was \u201c Cashier of the State Bank at Elizabeth.\u201d There is no way to destroy this admission, but by denying the deed itself; he cannot admit the deed and at the same time traverse the truth of its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-11\">2. A party may be bound to the performance of duties by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>the double securities of an oath and a bond; but can it be pretended that the bond is void because the party <em>might </em>have sworn to perform it and did not ? Can his not being sworn justify him in breaking the bond? If it was a duty incumbent on him to be sworn before he entered on the duties of his office, it was a breach of the condition not to be sworn; for the condition was to perform, all the duties of Cashier; now to break the condition of a bond is what gives an action on it, but was never holden to bar one.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">3. and 4. <em>Notice\u2014\u25a0\u201c </em>That the bond was never delivered,\u201d amounts to the general issue, and could not be specially pleaded. If, without the previous formality of a requirement to give the bond, it was given according to the statute, the requirement must be so <em>implied in the giving </em>as to be no more traversable than an arrest after giving a bail bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">5. A party <em>to </em>an instrument can never hold it as an escrow; and therefore a plea that the bond was delivered to one of the co-obligors to hold as an escrow is ill. But if it was never delivered to the plaintiffs, <em>that </em>may be shewn under the general issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">6. There is a difference between the delivery of an instrument and the tender of one; in case of tender there may be no acceptance; but delivery necessarily implies the notion of acceptance. The case cited from the newspaper must have been governed by the provisions of some statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">'7. and 8. Set out no special matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">9. That if the cashier erred, he did so by mistake and not for want of fidelity. In support of this defence a case is cited, from 10 <em>John. </em>271, where the condition of the bond was for <em>fidelity only; </em>but it cannot be applicable to a bond like the present which is for the performance of many specific acts at his peril, and duties appertaining to the office of cashier.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">10. <em>Non damnificatus </em>cannot be specially pleaded to a condition that is multifarious, because the issue would be unintelligible alike to the parties, the court and the jury. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>am of opinion, therefore, that the first ten notices are insufficient and ought to be stricken out.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The 11th Notice is, that the cashier resigned his office to the plaintiffs, and delivered to an authorized committee of directors, all the property in his hands as cashier belonging to the plaintiffs, <em>in satisfaction of all damages </em>by reason of anything in the condition of the bond, and that the plaintiffs <em>accepted thereof in satisfaction. </em>An objection to this notice, that the matter in it is pleaded in the fourth special plea does not appear to be founded in fact; in the plea, the delivery is to the company, and in the notice, it is to an authorized committee; so that instead of being identical, they are diverse enough for two special pleas. The other objection is, that performance of some of the things he was bound to do, cannot be pleaded in satisfaction of the whole; as in <em>JPinnel\u2019s ease, </em>5 <em>Co. </em>117, where payment and acceptance of <em>\u00a35 </em>was holden to be no good satisfaction for \u00a38; the reason assigned, being, that five can by no possibility be satisfaction for eight; yet in 2 <em>Term Rep. </em>24, <em>Ashurst </em>and <em>Buller, </em>Justices say, that an agreement to take part in nudum pactum <em>unless afterwards accepted; </em>clearly implying that if it be no longer executory but executed, accptance of part in satisfaction of the whole is a good accord. But be this as it may, the case before us is different; the cashier pleads that what he did was not a part of what he was bound by the bond to do, but they were <em>other things; </em>he resigned his office in satisfaction, and that he was not bound to do; he made delivery to a <em>committee, </em>when the bond bound him to deliver only to his <em>successor. </em>Now, though according to <em>Binnel\u2019s </em>case, a <em>less sum </em>(of money) could not be in satisfaction of a <em>greater ; </em>yet it was determined in that case, that any <em>other thing, </em>such as a horse, or a hawk, delivered and accepted in satisfaction, would be good. Injured parties, have a right to accept anything that they please to take in satisfaction ; they might accept of resignation alone if they pleased; the law would not prevent them; and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>question of their having done so or not, must be left to the jury. I do not think it necessary to go into the next three notices, because they depend on the same principle as the present, and therefore the lltli, 12th, 13th and 14th notices, ought to stand for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The 15th Notice, supposes that the cashier applied the money of the Bank, to pay checks that were drawn on him by Aaron Ogden, for doing which, he had no other authority than that of the President; and as that was not plenary authority for making it an act of the Bank, he did not enter . it on their books, but held it out of them as a transaction for which he himself was answerable to the Bank, and Aaron Ogden answerable only to him, unless the Bank, by some further order of their own, should see fit to take A. Ogden, (the drawer of the checks) for the money, as they had a right to do by accepting the checks and charging the money to him on the books of the Bank. That the Bank might fairly exercise their election, the cashier laid the whole matter before them; and it resulted in their agreement to make A. Ogden, answerable to the Bank; accordingly they accepted those checks from the hands of the cashier, and not only legalized his original appropriation of the money by directing it to be charged on their books to A. Ogden but actually bound A. Ogden, to themselves for the whole sum, by taking from him a bond and mortgage for the amount. Now, when A. Ogden, under this agreement, became liable for the money to the Bank, his prior liability to the Cashier necessarily terminated, otherwise his remaining liable to <em>both parties </em>would have amounted to a double charge for the same debt; and beside, the Cashier could not have maintained an action to recover this money in his own name, after a bond and mortgage had been given for it to the Bank, with the assent of all parties. In consequence of this settlement, the Cashier (with the knowledge of the Bank) proceeded to give up moneys that were <em>in his hands </em>belonging to A. Ogden, out of which he might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>redressed liimself as Cashier for those advances, if the remedy he first had against A. Ogden, as receiver, had not been taken out of his hands. With these matters spread on the plea, as facts, it is not possible for the Court to overrule them, and say that they amount to no defence. They must therefore stand for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The 16th Notice is, that the chocks were merged in the bond given for the amount of them, by Col. Ogden, to tho Bank. Now, that they are extinguished as to him, may be true without varying the case of the Cashier, whose liability arises on the bond and not on tho checks, which are collateral matter. The facts, <em>as set out </em>in this notice, cannot bar the action of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The 17th Notice is insufficient, because it does not allege that the directors <em>knew </em>of the Cashier\u2019s improper appropriations at the time they approved of his accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The 18th Notice contains a direct averment that the plaintiffs ratified and confirmed the accounts of the Cashier, containing the checks that he had received of Col. Ogden for them, after they knew the manner in which they had \u2022been received. It is beyond all manner of doubt that the plaintiffs were competent in law to ratify and confirm the doing of tlieir Cashier if they were so disposed; it must therefore go to the jury to determine whether the plaintiffs ratified the transaction or not. It will be open for thorn to contest tho fact, or to shew that they had power, right or reason to retract the ratification, if' ever it was made; if they shew none of these things, and tho ratification is matter of fact, they surely cannot recover damages for an act that has received their approbation under a full knowledge of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The 19 th allegation is, that the plaintiffs accepted these checks of the Cashier <em>as cash, </em>knowing the circumstances under which they had been received of the President, for the Bank. Now, when the}'' accepted checks from their Cashier, and gave him credit for them <em>as </em>cash, if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>intended that the credit should not be absolute, but conditional, either they ought to have seen that the entry on their books was a qualified one, or else they ought to have notified the Cashier that they did not accept in the ordinary way as cash, but on condition that they could get the amount from Col. Ogden, or the security he had pledged for it; otherwise an unconditional acceptance of them as cash in the ordinary way and with a knowledge of all the circumstances, would be such a close of the affair between the Bank and their accounting officer, that they could not retract their settlement and resort to him afterwards in case the security failed. It is the province of a jury to determine upon the alleged acceptance of the checks as cash, and if they find it was so done at the time, and with a full knowledge of all the circumstances, it will be a good bar to their recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The 20th Notice must be stricken out, because their continuing the Cashier ten months afterward in office did not, in law or reason, heal breaches of an anterior date. So, also, as to the 21st and 22d, for there is nothing in the condition of the bond that he was to be watched, nor any neces- \u2022 sity for the plaintiffs to give notice when damages accrued, if the case be taken abstractly from attending circumstances.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
