That as to all matters which rested in the knowledge of the defendant, and where his affidavit would be received, as on a motion to compel the plaintiff to give security for costs, it was not necessary to give notice of the taking of affidavits.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b205-6\">Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Aae\">Where the plaintiff or defendant is to \u25a0state facts in his affidavit which cannot be rebutted, a notice of taking it is not necessary; but where the motion is a special one, and is to be examined upon special facts which may be inquired into, there a notice is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">If there be no settled practice, it appears to me to be much the safest way to require notice of taking the affidavit, as this application is not for a matter of course.</p>\n<author id=\"b205-8\">Rossell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANt\">1 should not be willing to allow the exception to this affidavit to prevail, as the practice in regard to .taking them has been both ways.</p>\n<author id=\"b205-9\">Ford, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsP\">I should be inclined to allow the present motion as the practice has been both ways; but in future I think that notice of taking the affidavits in these cases ought to be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">After some consultation on the bench the Chief Justice said, the allowance of this application is not a mere matter of course, and the affidavit to support it must be taken upon notice. This affidavit not having been thus taken cannot be read.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">Rule refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
