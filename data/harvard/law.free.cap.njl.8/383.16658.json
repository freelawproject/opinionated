The appellee thereupon offered and was admitted by the court, notwithstanding an objection from the appellant, to examine another witness as to the value, who stated the value of the chattels at a sum not exceeding $100, and the court refused the non-suit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-10\"><em>Scudder, </em>for the appellant</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQq\">now plaintiff in certiorari, moved to reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-11\">1. The value of the chattels was shewn to have been $102.58. Hence neither the justice nor Common Pleas had jurisdiction, which is given only where the debt, balance or <em>matter in dispute, </em>does not exceed the sum <em>or value </em>of $100. <em>Rev.

The examination of the second witness was illegal, for to disprove the facts stated by a witness is to discredit him, and a party is not permitted to impeach his own witness. 1 <em>Phil.

Hence the second witness was rightfully examined; and the two witnesses differing as to the value, presented a question to the court to decide which should be preferred. They adopted the valuation of the second witness, and of the propriety of their determination, being matter of fact, we have-no authority to inquire.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Let the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
