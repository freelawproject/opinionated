He appeals the sentence imposed for this offense, arguing that a three-level enhancement to his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The district court imposed this enhancement based on its finding that Alonso was a manager or supervisor in a criminal activity that involved at least five participants. This finding is reviewed for clear error. <em>See United, States v. Rose, </em>449 F.3d 627, 633 (5th Cir.2006). Based on the record as a whole, such a finding was plausible and therefore not clearly erroneous. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
