Njweng contends she should have been given the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status. She further contends the evidence was insufficient and she was denied due process insofar as the Board found she was inadmissible for having falsely claimed to be a United States citizen. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. A decision that an alien is not admissible is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law. <em>8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">The Board found Njweng was inadmissible for two independent reasons. Whether or not Njweng should have been permitted under amended regulations to apply for adjustment of status is irrelevant so long as she was inadmissible for having falsely claimed to be a United States citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">With respect to her due process challenge, we find she was provided with all the process she was due and, in any event, she failed to establish prejudice. <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 320-22 (4th Cir.2002). We further find the record does not compel a different result and the Board\u2019s decision is not manifestly contrary to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
