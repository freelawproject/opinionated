We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">The pertinent facts underlying Coppola\u2019s convictions are detailed, at length in our prior opinion in his case, <em>United States v. Church, </em>955 F.2d 688 (11th Cir.1992). For purposes of this appeal, in 1987 a jury convicted Coppola on a number of counts arising out of a thirteen-year criminal enterprise involving the importation, purchase, and distribution of marijuana and cocaine. Among the counts for which Coppola was convicted was one count of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise (\u201cCCE\u201d), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848 (Count 3), and two counts of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (Counts 5 and 7, respectively). The district court sentenced Coppola to serve 40 years in connection with the CCE offense. Because \u201cit is the law of this circuit that conspiracy offenses merge with a[CCE] offense,\u201d <em>United States v. Rosenthal, </em>793 F.2d 1214, 1246 (11th Cir.1986), however, the district court merged the two conspiracy offenses with the CCE offense. Thus, the court\u2019s 40-year sentence was based only on the CCE conviction. <em>See </em>R1-77 at 4; <em>Church, </em>955 F.2d at 690 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-19\">Coppola appealed his convictions on a number of grounds. <em>See Church, </em>955 F.2d at 690. Upon review, we affirmed Coppola\u2019s CCE conviction, but we vacated the two separate conspiracy convictions, agreeing that, as lesser included offenses, they merged with the CCE conviction. <em>See id. </em>at 690, 703. However, because there was no sentence imposed in connection with the two conspiracy convictions, <em>id. </em>n. 2, and because Coppola\u2019s 40-year sentence had been based solely on the CCE conviction, Rl-77 at 4, our vacatur of the two conspiracy convictions had no effect on the 40-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-20\">Coppola subsequently filed a motion with the district court to correct his sentence, pursuant to the former Rule 35(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>In his motion, Coppola argued that because his conspiracy convictions had been vacated in <em>Church, </em>he was now entitled to a resentencing on his CCE conviction. The district court rejected that argument. The court observed that Coppola\u2019s 40-year sentence had been based solely on the CCE count, and that no sentence had been imposed for the two conspiracy convictions due to the fact that those convictions merged with the CCE conviction. Consequently, the court found that the vacatur of Coppola\u2019s two conspiracy convictions in <em>Church </em>should have no effect on the 40-year sentence imposed pursuant to the CCE charge. Although the court concluded that \u201cthere was no [conspiracy-based] sentence to vacate,\u201d it used its ministerial power to eliminate all references to the two conspiracy counts from Coppola\u2019s judgment. Rl-77 at 5. After doing so, the court denied Coppola\u2019s Rule 35(a) motion to correct his sentence. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">On appeal, Coppola argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to correct his sentence. The question of whether a district court has authority to resentence a defendant under former Rule 35(a) is a legal question subject to plenary review. <em>United States v. Sjeklocha, </em>114 F.3d 1085, 1087 (11th Cir.1997). The district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error, and its application of the facts to the law is reviewed de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Coppola\u2019s appeal contends that the 40-year prison sentence imposed in connection with Count 3, the CCE count, is \u201cillegal\u201d according to the language of Rule 35(a), and that therefore the district court should have acted to correct it. He argues that the two conspiracy convictions which were later vacated \u201cmay well have played a role\u201d in the district court\u2019s decision to impose the 40-year sentence. Reply Br. of Appellant at 5. Although he agrees that the sentencing court merged the two conspiracy charges into the CCE conviction\u2014and although he further concedes that no separate sentence was ever imposed in connection with the two conspiracy charges, <em>see </em>Br. of Appellant at 7\u2014he nevertheless argues that the conspiracy charges may have been unduly relied upon by the district court in formulating his 40-year CCE sentence. Accordingly, he argues that a resentencing is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">We disagree with this contention. In its original sentencing decision, the district court made clear that the two conspiracy counts, Counts 5 and 7, merged with the CCE count. Rl-77 at 4. Consequently, the court stated that it was imposing a 40-year sentence pursuant to the CCE conviction; no sentence was ever imposed for Counts 5 or 7. <em>Id. </em>We observed this fact when we later vacated Coppola\u2019s conspiracy convictions in <em>Church. </em>After stating that we were vacating his convictions on Counts 5 and 7, we noted that \u201cthe district court <em>did not sentence Coppola for his convictions on these two counts.\u201d </em>955 F.2d at 690 n. 2 (emphasis added). We did not vacate Coppola\u2019s sentence in <em>Church </em>when we vacated his conspiracy convictions, because, as the district court properly noted, there was no corresponding sentence to vacate. <em>Cf. Rutledge v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 292, 295, 307, 116 S.Ct. 1241, 1244, 1250-51, 134 L.Ed.2d 419 (1996) (vacating defendant\u2019s convictions and his sentence, where he received two separate sentences, one for conspiracy and one for CCE); <em>Rosenthal, </em>793 F.2d at 1246 (same). Because the district court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>impose any sentence in connection with the now-vacated conspiracy charges, we are not presented with a conspiracy-based sentence warranting a vacatur.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Nor can we accept Coppola\u2019s speculative contention that the two conspiracy counts \u201cmay well have played a role\u201d in his 40-year CCE sentence. Reply Br. of Appellant at 5. In fact, the sentencing court expressly stated that the 40-year sentence was imposed based upon Coppola\u2019s CCE conviction alone; it made no mention of the conspiracy charges in formulating that sentence. (Indeed, the court\u2019s only mention of the conspiracy charges was to observe, quite properly, that those charges merged into the CCE charge.) We find no evidence that the two conspiracy convictions were unreasonably relied upon by the district court in sentencing Coppola for his CCE offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">We have observed that when a defendant raises a collateral attack on a particular sentence under former Rule 35, only that specific sentence on that specific count is before the court. <em>See United States v. Rosen, </em>764 F.2d 763, 766 (11th Cir.1985) <em>(per curiam). </em>In such cases, \u201c[t]he court has power only over what is brought before it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, because no sentence was ever imposed for Coppola\u2019s conspiracy counts, perforce his Rule 35(a) challenge must be based on the 40-year sentence that was imposed for his CCE conviction; only that specific sentence and that specific conviction has been brought before us. And yet there is nothing in the record to suggest that the 40-year sentence for the CCE conviction was in any way \u201cillegal\u201d as that term has been construed under former Rule 35.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum, nor is there any evidence that it implicated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution. Accordingly, we discern no basis upon which Coppola\u2019s CCE sentence would warrant a correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">In summary, we conclude that the district court acted properly in denying Coppola\u2019s motion to correct an allegedly illegal sentence under former Rule 35. The vacatur of Coppola\u2019s conspiracy convictions did not require a concomitant resentencing, as there was never any sentence imposed in connection with the conspiracy charges. Moreover, the 40-year sentence that the district court did impose on Coppola\u2014 which was based solely on his separate CCE conviction\u2014was within the statutory maximum and did not implicate Coppola\u2019s constitutional rights. Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Coppola\u2019s motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b913-16\">.
