Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment because it was enhanced based upon facts found by a judge. The decision in <em>Booker </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review, and a <em>Booker </em>claim does not satisfy the test for filing a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 427 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">For the first time on appeal, Scott raises a factual challenge to the district court\u2019s application of a four-level enhancement for his being a leader or organizer of the criminal activity. This newly raised factual claim is not reviewable for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
