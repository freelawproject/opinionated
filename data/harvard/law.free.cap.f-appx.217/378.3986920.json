Carter had one prior Texas conviction of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance, two prior convictions of burglary of a building, and one prior conviction of robbery. The district court considered those convictions in sentencing Carter under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Carter contends that the district court erred by regarding his prior burglary convictions as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. As Carter concedes, this issue is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Fuller, </em>453 F.3d 274, 278 (5th Cir.2006). Because Carter\u2019s two burglary convictions, together with the robbery conviction, are sufficient for sentencing under the ACCA, <em>see </em>\u00a7 924(e)(1), any error in regarding Carter\u2019s prior conviction of delivery of a controlled substance as a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) was harmless. <em>See United States v. Munoz, </em>150 F.3d 401, 419 &amp; n. 17 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Carter contends that it was unconstitutional to enhance his sentence under the ACCA because the indictment did not allege the predicate convictions, a jury did not find the existence of the predicate convictions beyond a reasonable doubt, and he did not admit to them in pleading guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). As Carter properly concedes, this issue is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-16\">Carter contends that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional on its face because it does not require that the offense had a \u201csubstantial\u201d effect on interstate commerce, or, alternatively, that there was an insufficient factual basis for conviction under the statute because the mere movement of a firearm from one state to another, at an undetermined time in the past, did not constitute a substantial effect on interstate commerce. As Carter concedes, \u201cthe constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) is not open to question.\u201d <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir. 2001) (quotation marks omitted). Further, the factual basis was sufficient as Carter admitted that he unlawfully possessed two shotguns that had been manufactured outside Texas and that had traveled in commerce to the Southern District of Texas. <em>See United States v. Guidry, </em>406 F.3d 314, 318 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 190, 163 L.Ed.2d 198 (2005). No error has been shown, plain or otherwise. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
