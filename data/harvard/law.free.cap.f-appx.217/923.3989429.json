Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001). We \u201cmust affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). In order to reverse the IJ\u2019s decision, we \u201cmust find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-28\">An alien may be granted asylum if he proves that he is a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>\u00a7 208(a)(1), (b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1), (b)(1). A refugee is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOP\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To prove refugee status, the alien must establish (1) his past persecution on account of a protected ground, or (2) his \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>see Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">If the alien provides credible evidence of past persecution, the IJ must specify whether the evidence presented constitutes past persecution. <em>Antipova v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 1259, 1265 (11th Cir. 2004) (considering withholding of removal claim). If the IJ finds that the alien established past persecution, a presumption of persecution arises, which the government can rebut by showing that the country\u2019s conditions have changed or that internal relocation is reasonably possible. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). If the IJ finds that the alien has not established past persecution, the alien must show a well-founded, or \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable,\u201d fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">The alien may also seek withholding of removal and CAT relief if he can prove that future persecution or torture would occur \u201cmore likely than not.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 241, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c); <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287; <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303. However, ineligibility for asylum generally precludes eligibility for withholding of removal or CAT relief, as the standard for the former is easier to meet than the standard for the latter. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93, 1303-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">The IJ rejected Astaiza Lopez\u2019s scant claim that it was his job with the ministry of environment that caused FARC\u2019s threats, finding instead that it was Astaiza Lopez\u2019s father\u2019s position that caused the threats.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because a job is not one of the protected grounds for asylum, the IJ did not err when it determined that Astaiza Lopez failed to show past persecution. Substantial evidence also supports the conclusion that Astaiza Lopez failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution. As we have discussed, the past acts of the FARC against him did not constitute persecution. In addition, Astaiza Lopez\u2019s family members who remain in Colombia\u2014including his father, mother, and siblings\u2014have not been harmed by the FARC. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1259 (11th Cir.2006) (noting that an alien did not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution when his family continued to live unharmed in his country of removal). Therefore, the evidence does not compel the conclusion that Astaiza Lopez is eligible for asylum. Because he has failed to demonstrate that he is eligible for asylum, he also has failed to meet the higher burden of proof re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>quired for withholding of removal. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-9\">. On appeal, Astaiza Lopez argues that it was his imputed political opinion by the FARC that caused the threats because of his involvement with the People\u2019s Movement and claim that his friend Phillipe was kidnaped and killed. Because we cannot consider evidence that is outside of the administrative record, we do not consider Astaiza Lopez\u2019s new argument. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A) (explaining that we may decide petition \"only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
