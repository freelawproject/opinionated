Veal was represented by counsel in the district court, but he is proceeding pro se on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-16\">Our exhaustive examination of the 5-volume record on appeal, the briefs of the parties, and, especially, the comprehensive and detailed Memorandum and Order signed by the district court on January 31, 2006, satisfies us that summary judgment of dismissal was properly granted in this case. As we agree with the reasoning and rulings of the district court, no useful purpose would be served by our writing further. For essentially the reasons set forth by the district court in its Memorandum and Order, that court\u2019s judgment is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b432-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
