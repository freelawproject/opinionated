The district court sentenced Hodges to concurrent terms of 220 months\u2019 imprisonment. Hodges timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Hodges\u2019 counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but contending that the district court abused its discretion by failing to order the government to divulge the identity of the confidential informant whose information formed the basis for the search warrant of Hodges\u2019 home. Hodges was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but he has not filed one.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">A defendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to know the identity of a confidential informant. <em>Rugendorf v. United States, </em>376 U.S. 528, 534-35, 84 S.Ct. 825, 11 L.Ed.2d 887 (1964). Disclosure of the identity of an informant is required when the informant\u2019s testimony is highly relevant \u201cto the defense of an accused, or essential to a fair determination of a cause.\u201d <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 60-61, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>780 F.2d 1102, 1108 (4th Cir.1985). Where the informant is used only for the purpose of obtaining a search warrant, and not in connection with the offense charged, the informant\u2019s identity need not be disclosed. <em>United States v. Gray, </em>47 F.3d 1359, 1365 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>440 F.2d 654, 656 (4th Cir.1971). The district court\u2019s decision concerning whether to require the revelation of a confidential informant\u2019s identity is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hollis, </em>245 F.3d 671, 673 (8th Cir.2001); <em>Smith, </em>780 F.2d at 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">In this case, the informant was used only to obtain a search warrant for Hodges\u2019 residence to search for indicia of heroin trafficking. The charges against Hodges were not based on heroin trafficking but on firearms and ammunition found in Hodges\u2019 home when it was searched pursuant to the warrant. We therefore find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to compel the government to divulge the informant\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Consistent with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Hodges\u2019 convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Hodges, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Hodges requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Hodges. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
