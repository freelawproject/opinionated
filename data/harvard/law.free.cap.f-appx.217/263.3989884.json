Williams was sentenced as an armed career criminal pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), and <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.4 (2005). He contends on appeal that his enhanced sentence violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendments under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because it was based on facts that were not charged or proved beyond a reasonable doubt, or admitted by him. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Williams did not dispute the fact or nature of the predicate convictions in the district court. We have previously held that the fact that a defendant has prior convictions that may be used as the basis for an armed career criminal sentence need not be charged or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-54 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005). We decline Williams\u2019 invitation to reconsider the continued validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which we previously held to be still viable after <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 281-83 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1463, 164 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
