Duong argues that he was actually innocent of the second firearm conviction because he was not convicted of a second drug trafficking offense. He asserts that his second firearm conviction was improper because the jury instructions on that charge were incorrect. He further maintains that the second firearm conviction violated the prohibition against double jeopardy. In support of his claims, Duong relies upon the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993), <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), and <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995), as well as several lower court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-18\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>See Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir. 2003). All of the Supreme Court decisions relied upon by Duong were already decided by the time Duong filed his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion in 1996. As Duong has not shown that his claims are based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>cisi\u00f3n that decriminalized the conduct for which he was convicted and were foreclosed at the time he filed his \u00a7 2255 motion, Duong has not made the required showing to challenge his convictions in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See id. </em>at 382. Although Duong relied upon the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), in the district court, he does not raise that argument in this court and the argument is, therefore, waived. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
