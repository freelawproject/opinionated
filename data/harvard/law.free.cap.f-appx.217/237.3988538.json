Ubl seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6) motion. We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the joint appendix and find no reversible error. Because we find Ubl\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion, brought nearly eight years after the order he seeks to be reopened was issued, was untimely, we affirm the district court\u2019s order on those grounds. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s order on modified grounds, we decline to address whether the audit conducted by the Government constitutes an \u201calternate remedy\u201d for purposes of the Civil False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(c)(5) (2000). <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>395 F.3d 516, 518-19 (4th Cir.2005) (\u2018We are not limited to evaluation of the grounds offered by the district court to support its decision, but may affirm on any grounds apparent from the record.\u201d). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
