As his sole argument on appeal, Trevino argues that the district court improperly considered his criminal history in determining the amount of his downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">The Government moves to dismiss Trevino\u2019s appeal on the basis of the plea agreement, which contained a waiver-of-appeal provision providing that Trevino waived his right to appeal except an \u201cupward departure from the USSG sentencing issues only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">The record reflects that Trevino\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim. R. 11(b)(1)(N); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 518 (5th Cir.1999). Giving the language in the waiver its ordinary and natural meaning, <em>see United States v. Cortez, </em>413 F.3d 502, 503 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 502, 163 L.Ed.2d 365 (2005), Trevino reserved only the right to appeal a sentence that represented an upward departure from the recommended Sentencing Guidelines range. Trevino cites to no authority supporting his assertion that the term \u201cupward departure\u201d could also be a reference to a sentence greater than that which he subjectively expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-18\">Because Trevino\u2019s issue on appeal does not fall within the preserved exclusion to the valid waiver of appeal, it is barred. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is denied as moot because a valid appeal waiver does not implicate our jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 230-31 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-19\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
