Nelson argues that the district court erred by denying him a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13 based on diminished mental capacity. He also contends that he may have received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-23\">Although the Government seeks to enforce the waiver-of-appeal provision in Nelson\u2019s plea agreement, given the inadequacies in the transcription of portions of the rearraignment hearing, we do not enforce the waiver. Because the district court did not misapprehend its authority to depart from the Guidelines under \u00a7 5K2.13, we lack jurisdiction to review the court\u2019s denial of a downward departure. <em>See United States v. Sam, </em>467 F.3d 857, 861 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-24\">To the extent that Nelson raises the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel, the record has not been adequately developed to address this issue on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Sanchez-Pena, </em>336 F.3d 431, 445-46 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-25\">AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
