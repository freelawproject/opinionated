To obtain reversal of an adverse eligibility determination, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that it does not compel a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant Nkemasong the relief he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-21\">Similarly, as Nkemasong does not qualify for asylum, he is ineligible for withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum\u2014even though the facts that must be proved are the same\u2014an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-22\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b296-18\"> Nkemasong did not challenge the denial of his application for protection under the Convention Against Torture to the Board. Therefore, he has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
