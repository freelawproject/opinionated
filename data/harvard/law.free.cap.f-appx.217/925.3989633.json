(\u201cSanders Lead\u201d), alleging race discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a) and (m), and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. The district court granted summary judgment to Sanders Lead, based on its conclusion that Wright had failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. Because Wright did not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination on the basis of race, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-27\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b951-28\">Sanders Lead recycles lead acid storage batteries. Wright was a second shift su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>pervisor in Sanders Lead\u2019s casting and alloy department, and he oversaw a number of employees. Wright\u2019s department was responsible for extracting, cleaning, and storing the lead. He had been employed in that position since approximately 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">On 4 February 2004, Austin Turner, a security guard at Sanders Lead, observed two other employees of the company, Travoris Green and Buddy Whitman, riding in a shipping truck behind the company\u2019s main office. At the time, Green was employed in the casting and alloy department, and he worked under Wright\u2019s supervision. Because Turner thought it unusual for Green to be riding in a shipping department truck, he followed the two men behind the office. Once Turner approached the truck he saw that Green and Whitman were smoking cigarettes. Sanders Lead\u2019s internal rules and regulations, which are included in the company\u2019s employee handbook, expressly prohibit the use of tobacco anywhere on company property. Turner first reprimanded Green for being outside of his work area. He then ordered the employees to empty their pockets, and they complied. He confiscated two packages of cigarettes, one from each employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Turner subsequently called Wright to inform him that one of his subordinates had been caught smoking on company property, which is a terminable offense. Wright was at the work site at the time, however, and was unavailable; therefore, Turner instructed Johnny McClendon, another supervisor, to immediately notify Wright of the incident. Shortly after receiving word of Green\u2019s actions, Wright spoke by telephone with Turner. According to Wright, while discussing Green\u2019s misconduct, Wright said to Turner, \u201cwork with me on this.\u201d Rl-14, Exh. 1 at 115.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Wright maintains that he intended this statement to mean that he was busy and needed some time to properly deal with disciplining Green, Turner interpreted Wright\u2019s statement as a request that Turner \u201clet [Green] get by,\u201d or that Turner \u201cnot [ ] say anything else about it.\u201d Rl-16, Exh. D at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">Subsequent to these developments, Turner and Wright ascertained that one of the confiscated cigarette boxes contained a brown cigar consisting of a substance that appeared to be marijuana. According to Wright, after this discovery, Wright returned to his office and completed the process for terminating Green\u2019s employment. Wright also called his direct supervisor, Edgar Fannin, and notified him of the incident. Fannin instructed Wright to prepare the necessary paperwork to effectuate Green\u2019s termination; Wright replied that he had already done so. Green was terminated the following day, February 5. Whitman was also terminated because of the smoking incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">Later that same day, however, Turner informed Wright\u2019s supervisor, Fannin, that Wright had \u201cattempt[ed] to sweep something under the rug\u201d-specifically, that Wright had sought to hide Green\u2019s wrongdoing from upper management during their phone conversation. Rl-16, Exh. A at 4. Then, on February 6, Turner met with Bart Sanders, the plant manager, who oversees all of the company\u2019s operations. In that meeting, Turner reiterated to Sanders his allegation that Wright had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>asked Turner to turn a blind eye to Green\u2019s misconduct. Upon learning of these allegations, Sanders made the decision, effective that day, to suspend Wright, pending a further investigation by the company. When Wright arrived at work on February 6, he was denied entrance to the plant. That afternoon, in a phone call with Fannin, Wright was first informed of Turner\u2019s allegations against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">A number of internal meetings were subsequently held among the members of the company\u2019s upper management, including Sanders, Fannin, and Turner. After a series of discussions, the company decided to terminate Wright\u2019s employment. Wright was not informed of this decision until February 12; Fannin notified him of the decision by phone. Wright was not permitted to meet with Sanders after the decision was made, nor was he brought before the company and given an opportunity to dispute Turner\u2019s account of the events. When Sanders was later asked why Wright was terminated, he testified that, as plant manager, he had made the ultimate decision, although he had received the input of the other managers. Sanders also testified that he had terminated Wright because he believed that Wright had tried to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-6\">to cover up misconduct by [ ] one of his workers ... that he was the direct supervisor over, for multiple intolerable rules violations, and [tried] to sweep it under the rug and not bring it to light, keep it out of upper management\u2019s knowledge. And concealed] the fact that these ... rules violations took place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">Rl-16, Exh. E at 28. Sanders further testified that he and the other managers had concluded that they could no longer \u201ctrust in (Wright] to represent the company\u2019s interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41. Sanders testified that race did not play a role in his decision to terminate Wright.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">Approximately six weeks after Wright\u2019s termination, Whitman, who is white, and who had worked as a laborer in Sanders Lead\u2019s shipping department before being terminated (along with Green) for the smoking incident, reapplied for employment with Sanders Lead. Whitman was rehired to work in the company\u2019s furnace department, for an hourly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">In October 2004 Wright filed suit in the Middle District of Alabama, alleging claims for wrongful discharge and discriminatory treatment in employment in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. He alleged that Sanders Lead discriminated against him because of his race and that other similarly situated white employees had received more favorable treatment than he did. Wright also alleged a separate state law claim for misrepresentation. Sanders Lead moved for summary judgment on all counts. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Sanders Lead on Wright\u2019s Title VII and \u00a7 1981 claims, due to its conclusion that Wright had failed to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. Having granted summary judgment in favor of Sanders Lead on Wright\u2019s federal claims, the court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367, declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The state claim was dismissed, without prejudice. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Burke-Fowler v. Orange County, Fla., </em>447 F.3d 1319, 1322 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (citation omitted). In doing so, we apply the same legal standards as those that controlled the district court. <em>Real Estate Fin. v. Resolution Trust Corp., </em>950 F.2d 1540, 1543 (11th Cir.1992) (per curiam) (citation omitted). According to those standards, set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In making this assessment, we review all facts and inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Farley v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>197 F.3d 1322, 1336 (11th Cir.1999) (citation omitted). \u201cA genuine issue of material fact \u2018exists only if sufficient evidence is presented favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">Title VII prohibits an employer from \u201cdischarging] any individual, or otherwise discriminating] against any individual ... because of such individual\u2019s race.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). When a plaintiffs Title VII claim of racial discrimination is based on circumstantial evidence, it is evaluated under the so-called <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-804, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824-25, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under that three-step analysis, the plaintiff has the initial burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. <em>Combs v. Plantation Patterns, </em>106 F.3d 1519, 1527-28 (11th Cir. 1997). Once the plaintiff has presented a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the employer \u201cto articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u201d for its employment action. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. at 1824. After the employer has done so, the plaintiff then must be given an opportunity to show that the reason provided is pretextual, or to \u201ccast sufficient doubt on the employer\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reason[] to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the employer\u2019s proffered \u2018legitimate reason! ][was] not what actually motivated its conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Combs, </em>106 F.3d at 1538 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">We begin our analysis with Wright\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case. In order to present a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination, an employee must \u201cshow that: (l)[he] is a member of a protected class; (2)[he] was subjected to an adverse employment action; (3)[his] employer treated similarly situated employees outside of [his] protected class more favorably than [he] was treated; and (4)[he] was qualified to do the job.\u201d <em>Burke-Fowler, </em>447 F.3d at 1323. A <em>prima facie </em>case must be established with \u201cfacts adequate to permit an inference of discrimination.\u201d <em>Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">Here, there is no dispute that Wright, who is African-American, was a member of a protected class, and that he suffered an adverse employment action when Sanders Lead terminated him in February 2004. The pivotal issue on appeal is whether Wright established that Sanders Lead treated a similarly situated, non-mi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>nority employee more favorably than it treated him. \u201cIf a plaintiff fails to show the existence of a similarly situated [non-minority] employee, summary judgment is appropriate where no other evidence of discrimination is present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">In discussing the \u201csimilarly situated\u201d aspect of a <em>prima facie </em>discrimination case, we have stated that a plaintiff must show that he and the non-minority employee with whom he seeks comparison are \u201csimilarly situated <em>in all relevant respects.\u201d Jones v. Bessemer Carraway Med. Ctr., </em>137 F.3d 1306, 1311 (11th Cir.) (citing <em>Holifield, </em>115 F.3d at 1562) (emphasis added), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>151 F.3d 1321 (11th Cir.1998). In addition, in cases\u2014 such as Wright\u2019s\u2014involving an employer who takes disciplinary action against two workers and allegedly treats a non-minority employee more favorably than the minority employee, we have held that \u201cit is necessary to consider whether the employees are involved in or accused of the same or similar conduct and are disciplined in different ways.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Holifield, </em>115 F.3d at 1562).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">In this case, Wright argues that he is similarly situated with Whitman, the white shipping department employee who was caught smoking on company premises. Wright contends that while he was immediately fired for his misconduct without any chance to rebut the allegations against him, Whitman was permitted to explain his version of the events to Sanders, the plant manager. Moreover, Wright asserts that Whitman was eventually re-hired by Sanders Lead and was given a new position, whereas Wright was never given such an opportunity. As he explains, \u201cSanders gave Whitman, <em>a white man, </em>a second chance by rehiring him ... but he never informed Wright, <em>a black man, </em>that he could come back to work.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8 (emphasis in original). Based on these facts, Wright contends that he is similarly situated to Whitman, a non-minority, and that Sanders Lead treated Whitman more favorably than it treated him.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">The flaw in this argument, as the district court properly surmised, is that Wright failed to establish that he and Whitman were \u201csimilarly situated in all relevant respects.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>137 F.3d at 1311. First, the two employees did not engage in similar acts of misconduct. The evidence suggests that Whitman was fired for smoking on company premises, whereas Wright was fired because he asked a guard not to report his employee for a rule violation. Whitman, a laborer, committed a breach of safety, but Wright, a supervisor, committed a breach of trust. The acts of misconduct for which the two men were disciplined were substantially different. We have stated that the comparator\u2019s misconduct must \u201cbe nearly identical [to the plaintiff\u2019s] to prevent courts from second-guessing employer\u2019s reasonable decisions and confusing apples with oranges.\u201d <em>Burke-Fowler, </em>447 F.3d at 1323 (citation omitted); <em>Silvera v. Orange County Sch. Bd., </em>244 F.3d 1253, 1259 (11th Cir.2001) (same). Similarly, here, comparing Wright\u2019s transgression (covering up wrongdoing) with Whitman\u2019s (smoking) is akin to comparing apples with oranges.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">Furthermore, while it is true that Whitman was later re-hired and Wright was not, Whitman\u2019s position involved an hourly wage and a general lack of supervisory responsibilities, whereas Wright\u2019s position was a salaried job and involved significant supervisory duties. These circumstances provide context as to why Wright\u2014who was accused of an act of dishonesty\u2014 would be immediately divested of his supervisory position and would not be rehired, while Whitman\u2014whose act of smoking did not involve dishonesty\u2014would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>permitted to return as an hourly employee in a different department, nearly two months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">We conclude that Wright failed to establish that he was similarly situated with Whitman. \u201cIf two employees are not similarly situated, then the different application of workplace rules to them does not constitute illegal discrimination,\u201d and the plaintiffs <em>prima facie </em>case fails as a matter of law. <em>Lathem v. Dept. of Children &amp; Youth Servs., </em>172 F.3d 786, 793 (11th Cir. 1999) (citation and internal quotation omitted). Nor does Wright offer any additional circumstantial evidence of racial discrimination, other than the simple fact that he lost his job, and that a white person who had been terminated (for different conduct) was subsequently rehired (albeit in a different capacity). In light of the evidence presented, we conclude that Wright \u201cfailed to establish valid comparators and presented no other circumstantial evidence suggesting racial discrimination,\u201d and that therefore he did not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Burke-Fowler, </em>447 F.3d at 1325. Because Wright failed on the first step of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework applicable to a discrimination claim, summary judgment was properly entered for Sanders Lead on Wright\u2019s Title VII and \u00a7 1981 claims. Accordingly, the district court properly issued summary judgment in favor of Sanders Lead on Wright\u2019s racial discrimination claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">Having reviewed the record and the arguments of the parties, we conclude that Wright failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination on the basis of race, and that therefore summary judgment was properly entered for Sanders Lead. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>eordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b952-6\">. Turner maintains that Wright also asked that he \u201clet [Green] slide this time.\u201d Rl-16, Exh. D at 30. Wright, however, disputes that version of events, contending that he only said \"work with me.\u201d Rl-14, Exh. 1 at 115-16. Regardless of what Wright actually said, it is undisputed that Turner interpreted Wright\u2019s statement as a request that he turn a blind eye to Green\u2019s wrongdoing. And it is clear that Wright's superiors believed that Wright, with his passing comment to Turner, was attempting to hide Green's misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b953-8\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c) provides that \"the district court [] may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim ... if ... the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.\u201d On appeal, Wright does not challenge the dismissal of the state law claim. Thus we address solely the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment on the Title VII claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b954-6\">. The same three-step <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis applies to claims brought pursuant to \u00a7 1981 alleging discriminatory treatment in employment. <em>Turnes v. AmSouth Bank, NA, </em>36 F.3d 1057, 1060 (11th Cir.1994) (citation omitted). As a result, if a plaintiff\u2019s Title VII claim fails under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, so too does the plaintiff's \u00a7 1981 claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b956-5\">. Because we conclude that Wright failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, we need not consider whether Sanders Lead met its burden of showing a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision, or whether that reason was a pretext for discrimination. <em>See Morris v. Emory Clinic, Inc., </em>402 F.3d 1076, 1082 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b956-6\">. In his appeal, Wright makes occasional, cursory references to Section 2000e-2(m) of Title VII, the provision that permits an employee to allege an unlawful employment practice by demonstrating that the employee\u2019s race was \u201ca motivating factor for an employment practice.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(m). The Supreme Court has described this provision of Title VII as providing \"an alternative for proving that an 'unlawful employment practice\u2019 has occurred.\u201d <em>Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, </em>539 U.S. 90, 94, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 2151, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(m)). Although Wright\u2019s complaint was more general in nature (indicating only that he was suing under Title VII), his appellate brief occasionally mentions \u00a7 2000e-2(m) as a possible separate grounds for relief, that is, in addition to relief for race discrimination under \u00a7 2000e-2(a). <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Br. at 10-11, 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">Even assuming that this claim was properly alleged as a separate basis for relief, we would nevertheless conclude that summary judgment for Sanders Lead was appropriate. The Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff suing under \u00a7 2000e-2(m) must \"present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u2018race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Desert Palace, </em>539 U.S. at 101, 123 S.Ct. at 2155 (citing U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(m)). As noted above, Wright presents no evidence that race was a motivating factor in his termination; in fact, the record makes clear that Sanders Lead terminated Wright based on the belief that he had acted dishonestly in attempting to cover up an employee\u2019s wrongdoing. Because nothing in the record suggests that race played \"a motivating factor\u201d in the decision to terminate Wright, summary judgment would be proper for Sanders Lead on a claim based on \u00a7 2000e-2(m).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
