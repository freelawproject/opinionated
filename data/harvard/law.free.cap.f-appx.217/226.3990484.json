Love\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue but stating that, in her view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Love has been informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not filed a brief. We affirm.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">After his arrest, Love admitted that he had been making methamphetamine for several months, pled guilty to the above offense, and stipulated that fifty to 150 grams of methamphetamine (actual) was reasonably foreseeable to him. Love made no objections to the guideline range calculated in the presentence report, although he disagreed with certain other information contained in the report. After considering Love\u2019s clarifications, the advisory guideline range, and the factors set out in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006), the court imposed the minimum guideline sentence of ninety-seven months, and ordered Love to pay $1,549.41 in restitution to reimburse the Drug Enforcement Administration for clean-up costs at Love\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">On appeal, counsel suggests that the district court erred in failing to depart for substantial assistance. Love allegedly cooperated with the government while he was on pretrial release, but the government did not request a departure pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1, p.s. (2005), and the plea agreement provided that the government had sole discretion to determine whether any assistance Love might provide was substantial. A government motion is necessary before the sentencing court may depart for substantial assistance. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006); USSG \u00a7 5K1.1. Thus, the court did not err in failing to depart sua sponte on this ground. Moreover, Love does not allege that the government\u2019s motive for withholding a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion was unconstitutional. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (holding that defendant must make substantial threshold showing of improper motive to obtain review of government\u2019s decision not to move for substantial assistance departure). Love\u2019s ninety-seven-month sentence was within the correctly calculated guideline range of 97-121 months, and was thus reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-16\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that such a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b253-11\"> Although in his plea agreement Love waived his appeal rights, we have declined to consider a defendant\u2019s appeal waiver where the government fails to assert the waiver. <em>See United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005). In this case, the government has not moved to dismiss Love\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
