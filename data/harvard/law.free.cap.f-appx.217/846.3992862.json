Burley Marine owns the M/V Three D of Guernsey, which was insured by Lloyd\u2019s when it ran aground in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, in April 2003. The Three D was taken for repairs to Cable Marine, where Timothy Fenby was injured while working on the yacht. Burley Marine sought a declaratory judgment that the insurance policy on the Three D required Lloyd\u2019s to pay for the repairs to the yacht and defend a lawsuit brought by Timothy Fenby and his wife. After a bench trial, the district court entered judgment in favor of Lloyd\u2019s. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-13\">The relevant facts are taken from the findings of the district court. On May 23, 2002, Lloyd\u2019s issued an insurance policy on the Three D that provided coverage for one year, and that policy contained two clauses relevant to this appeal. First, the policy limited coverage to certain navigational limits, subject to a \u201cheld covered\u201d clause: \u201cMediterranean Waters ... or held covered at rate and terms to be agreed subject to notice being given as soon as practicable.\u201d A \u201cheld covered\u201d clause provides coverage in certain circumstances when a breach of warranty occurs. <em>Hilton Oil Transp. v. Jonas, </em>75 F.3d 627, 629-30 (11th Cir.1996). Second, the policy included the following \u201cagreed paid for loss\u201d clause: \u201cAgreed pay for loss or damage to the vessel when caused by the breach of any warranty contained in this policy by a paid captain and/or crew members or a charterer provided ... such breach is not committed with the consent, approval or knowledge of the assured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-14\">The parties later negotiated changes to the navigational limits for a limited term of coverage. In the fall of 2002, George Downing, the beneficial owner of Burley Marine, decided to transport the Three D to Martinique, an island in the West Indies, for the winter season. Downing had his insurance broker obtain from Lloyd\u2019s an endorsement to the insurance policy, which provided that, \u201c[u]pon safe arrival in Martinique, cruising is restricted to Caribbean Waters until April 2003.\u201d On March 31, 2003, Lloyd\u2019s issued a second endorsement, which provided that \u201cthe cruising range is extended to include Caribbean waters up to and including April 16, 2003.\u201d On April 10, 2003, Lloyd\u2019s issued a third endorsement, which provided that \u201cthe cruising range is extended to include Caribbean waters up to an including 28th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>April 2003.\u201d Neither the policy nor the endorsements defined the term \u201cCaribbean Waters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">On April 14, 2003, the Three D ran aground on a beach in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. It was piloted by Kaj Collins, a captain hired by Trevor Woodman, the captain hired by Downing to pilot the yacht. The Three D was taken to Cable Marine, where Fenby was injured. Fenby and his wife brought a lawsuit against various entities, including Burley Marine. On April 22, 2003, Lloyd\u2019s issued a final endorsement, which provided \u201ccoverage is extended to include cruising in Florida waters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Burley Marine filed a third-party complaint for a declaratory judgment against Lloyd\u2019s regarding coverage for damage to the vessel and injuries to Fenby. Burley Marine presented three arguments. First, it contended that the navigational limits had not been breached, because the phrase \u201cCaribbean Waters\u201d is ambiguous and should be construed against Lloyd\u2019s. Second, it argued, in the alternative, that the \u201cheld covered\u201d provision of the insurance policy provides coverage. Finally, it asserted that the \u201cagreed pay for loss\u201d clause provides coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">The district court entered a declaratory judgment in favor of Lloyd\u2019s. The district court applied Florida law in interpreting the contracts of marine insurance, <em>see Wilburn Boat Co. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>348 U.S. 310, 321, 75 S.Ct. 368, 374, 99 L.Ed. 337 (1955), and rejected all three arguments of Burley Marine.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">Our standard of review is settled: We review the legal conclusions of the district court <em>de novo </em>and the findings of fact for clear error. <em>Mitchell v. Hillsborough County, </em>468 F.3d 1276, 1282 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">Burley Marine first contends that the Three D did not sail beyond the navigational limits covered by the insurance policy when it ran aground on a beach in Ft. Lauderdale. Burley Marine asserts that the phrase \u201cCaribbean Waters\u201d is ambiguous and should be construed against Lloyd\u2019s. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">Contrary to the assertion of Burley Marine, \u201c \u2018[t]he mere failure to provide a definition for a term involving coverage does not necessarily render the term ambiguous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Health Options, Inc. v. Kabeller, </em>932 So.2d 416, 420 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 2006) (quoting <em>Jefferson Ins. Co. of N.Y. v. Sea World of Fla., Inc., </em>586 So.2d 95, 97 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1991)). \u201cAmbiguity is not invariably present when analysis is required to interpret the policy.\u201d <em>Gulf Tampa Drydock Co. v. Great Atl. Ins. Co., 757 </em>F.2d 1172, 1175 (11th Cir.1985) (citing <em>Blue Shield of Fla., Inc. v. Woodlief </em>359 So.2d 883, 884 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1978)). \u201cUnder Florida law, the words utilized in an insurance policy are to be given their plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Rigby v. Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, </em>907 So.2d 1187, 1188 n. 1 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">The phrase \u201cCaribbean Waters\u201d is not ambiguous in this circumstance. Under the plain and ordinary meaning of the words, \u201cCaribbean Waters\u201d do not include waters immediately off the coast of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. \u201cCaribbean Waters\u201d are waters of or relating to the \u201cCaribbean,\u201d and The Oxford English Dictionary defines the word \u201cCaribbean\u201d as an adjective or noun \u201capplied to certain of the West Indian isles, and to the sea between them and the [South and Central American] mainland.\u201d The Oxford English Dictionary 899 (2d ed.1989) (entry for \u201cCarib\u201d). Ft. Lauderdale is not a West Indian isle, and between Ft. Lauderdale and the Caribbean Sea are more than 200 miles of the Atlantic Ocean and the island of Cuba. <em>See </em>14 The New Encyclopedia Britannica 304 (15th ed.2003) (entry for \u201cCaribbean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>Sea\u201d) (describing the Caribbean Sea as bounded to the north by the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Second, Burley Marine argues that, even if the Three D sailed beyond the navigational limits covered by the insurance policy and the endorsements, the \u201cheld covered\u201d provision of the policy provides coverage. We disagree. A \u201cheld covered\u201d clause provides coverage when a breach of warranty occurs, but only if the breach was not willful. <em>Hilton Oil Transp., </em>75 F.3d at 630. The district court found that Downing knowingly and intentionally sent the Three D out of \u201cCaribbean Waters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Burley Marine argues that, contrary to the finding of the district court, Downing did not know that the waters immediately off the coast of Ft. Lauderdale were outside \u201cCaribbean Waters,\u201d but Burley Marine fails to provide any evidence to support this assertion. \u201cIf the appellant intends to urge on appeal that a finding [of the district court] ... is unsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, the appellant must include in the record a transcript of all evidence relevant to that finding____\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 10(b)(2). Because Burley Marine failed to comply with this rule, we cannot review the alleged evidentiary error and must affirm the finding of the district court. <em>Loren v. Sasser, </em>309 F.3d 1296, 1304 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">Finally, Burley Marine contends that the \u201cagreed pay for loss\u201d clause of the insurance policy provides coverage. Lloyd\u2019s \u201c[a]greed [to] pay for loss or damage to the vessel when caused by the breach of any warranty contained in this policy by a paid captain and/or crew members or a charterer provided ... such breach is not committed with the consent, approval or knowledge of the assured.\u201d Burley Marine argues that, even if navigational limits were breached, the breach was not committed with the consent, approval, or knowledge of Downing.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">We disagree. The district court found that Downing approved and ordered that the Three D be sailed beyond the navigational limits covered by the insurance policy and endorsements. Although Burley Marine contests this finding, it again offers no evidence to support its assertion. Without a transcript of the trial to review, we must affirm the finding of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">The declaratory judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
