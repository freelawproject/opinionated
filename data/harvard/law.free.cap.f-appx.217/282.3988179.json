Greer seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. This court granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether Greer received ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel did not file a notice of appeal. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Peak, </em>992 F.2d 39, 42 (4th Cir.1993). The Government filed a brief conceding that the district court erred by denying this claim despite the fact Greer alleged under penalty of perjury that he requested his counsel to file a notice of appeal. We dismiss in part and vacate in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-17\">Because the record did not conclusively show that Greer\u2019s counsel was not ineffective for not filing a notice of appeal, we vacate in part the district court\u2019s order and remand to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-18\">Greer also sought to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his other claims. This court granted a certificate of appealability only on the issue regarding whether counsel was ineffective for not filing a notice of appeal. That part of the order denying relief on the remaining claims is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude Greer has not made the requisite showing as to his remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Accordingly, we grant Greer\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis and we vacate that part of the district court\u2019s order denying Greer\u2019s claim he received ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to file a notice of appeal and remand for an evidentiary hearing on this issue. As to the remaining claims, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss in part the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
