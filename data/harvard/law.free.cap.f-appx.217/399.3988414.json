The district court dismissed the petition as untimely, but Green failed to receive timely notice of the dismissal. Green subsequently moved for an out-of-time appeal based on his failure to receive notice, but the district court denied the motion as untimely. Green eventually filed the instant Rule 60(b) motion for relief from the order denying his motion for an out-of-time appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">As Green is not attempting to use the Rule 60(b) motion to alter the judgment in his underlying habeas petition, but instead is seeking relief from the denial of his motion for an out-of-time appeal, a COA is not necessary. <em>See Dunn v. Cockrell, </em>302 F.3d 491, 492 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.2002); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1). Accordingly, the motion for a COA is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Nevertheless, Green\u2019s appeal is unavailing. He contends that the district court failed to explain adequately its reasons for denying Rule 60(b) relief. Giving Green the benefit of liberal construction, we perceive that he also contends that the district court abused its discretion by failing to investigate why the notice of dismissal was returned to the court and by failing to apply equitable tolling to permit Green to appeal the dismissal. Green essentially attempts to re-argue claims he made in his motion for an out-of-time appeal. That motion was previously presented to this court, and we held that the district court was without authority to extend the appeal period. <em>See Green v. Dretke, </em>No. 04-41263 (5th Cir. Nov. 3, 2004); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). Green has failed to show that the district court\u2019s denial of Rule 60(b) relief was so unwarranted as to constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>See Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Rule 60(b) relief is affirmed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">MOTION FOR COA DENIED AS UNNECESSARY; AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
