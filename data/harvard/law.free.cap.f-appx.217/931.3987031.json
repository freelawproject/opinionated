The term was to run concurrently with a 240 months prison sentence the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida had imposed on Petitioner for possessing crack cocaine with intent to distribute. We affirmed Petitioner\u2019s conviction and sentence in the NDF1 Case on March 30, 1998, and on March 8, 1999, Petitioner moved the district court to vacate his conviction and sentence in that case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court denied his motion. Petitioner\u2019s subsequent attempts to obtain \u00a7 2255 relief were rejected, principally on the ground that they constituted successive motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-25\">In July 2006, Petitioner once again challenged his NDF1 conviction and sentence, this time with a petition for writ of habeas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The district court denied his petition as barred under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. He now appeals that ruling, contending that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause permits him to file his \u00a7 2241 petition because \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir. 2003). Section 2255 contains a \u201csavings clause,\u201d which permits a prisoner to mount a collateral attack after having been denied \u00a7 2255 relief if relief under that section is \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d The savings clause provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-5\">[a]n application for writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Accordingly, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. The burden of coming forward with evidence affirmatively showing the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy rests with the movant. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">When a prisoner has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from the court of appeals before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255. Such restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999). Consequently, a petitioner who has filed a previous \u00a7 2255 motion, and been denied, may not circumvent the successive-motion rule simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>Id. </em>The savings clause only applies when (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision established that the petitioner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense;\u201d and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244. For a prisoner to avail himself of the \u00a7 2241 remedy under <em>Wofford, </em>all three criteria must be satisfied. As we have made clear, all three criteria will be met only in the narrowest of circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">The district court committed no error in dismissing the instant \u00a7 2241 petition. Petitioner is precluded from seeking relief under \u00a7 2241 because \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause does not apply. First, it appears that he has filed the present \u00a7 2241 petition in an effort to circumvent the rules limiting the scope of successive \u00a7 2255 motions. Second, he cannot meet the initial prong of the test in <em>Wofford </em>because he has not demonstrated that his claims are based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. Given this fact, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>need not address <em>Wofford\u2019s </em>remaining prongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-7\">. Petition also contends\u2014for the first time in this appeal\u2014that the district judge should have recused. We decline to consider the recusal issue because it was not presented to the district court in the first instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
