He asserts that his petition satisfies the criteria of the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 savings clause because his prior burglary offenses did not meet the generic definition of \u201cburglary\u201d and thus did not constitute crimes of violence, pursuant to <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-23\">Blake is required to show that his claim is based on a retroactively applicable Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>preme Court decision which establishes that the offense of conviction no longer qualifies as a violation of law. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Blake also must show that his claim was barred by circuit precedent at the time of his direct appeal or original \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>See id. </em>He has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Blake\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
