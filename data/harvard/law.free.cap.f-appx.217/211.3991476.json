The Agreement governs the terms of sale of a document shredding business previously owned and operated by Appellees Theda L. Vaughan (\u201cTheda\u201d) and James Ricky Vaughan and purchased by Appellants Recall Total Information Management, Inc. (\u201cRecall\u201d), and Brambles USA, Inc (\u201cBrambles\u201d). The Agreement provides that the purchase price is to be paid as follows: 1) a lump sum payment upon closing; and 2) a percentage of the business\u2019s \u201cSales Revenues\u201d for the following year (\u201cEarnout\u201d payment). The parties disagree on what constitutes \u201cSales Revenues\u201d under the terms of the contract as well as the proper method of calculation of the Vaughans\u2019 Earnout. Recall also asserts a Counterclaim that seeks to recover a portion of the Earnout monies already paid to the Vaughans or a set-off against any award the Vaughans receive. Appellant Recall challenges the trial court\u2019s interpretation of certain portions of the Agreement and the dismissal of its Counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">The Vaughans are former shareholders of Secured Data of America, Inc. (\u201cSDA\u201d), a Tennessee corporation. SDA was a document destruction company that specialized in the destruction of confidential documents and data. SDA was headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina, and maintained operating facilities located primarily on the East Coast. SDA also had a facility in Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">Recall is an information management company incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Atlanta, Georgia. Recall provides services such as physical and electronic document storage and retrieval, protection of computer backup data, and destruction of sensitive documents. Brambles is the parent company of Recall, which likewise has its principal place of business in Atlanta, Georgia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">In November 1999, the Vaughans had an offering memorandum prepared for the purpose of determining the estimated market value of SDA. Among other things, the offering memorandum boasted SDA\u2019s existing client base, operating capacity figures demonstrating an ability to expand, and the potential for significant growth in sales. The offering memorandum generated interest in SDA by other companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-16\">On August 2, 2000, the Vaughans contracted to sell SDA to Recall pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement. (J.A. at 530-83; Pl.\u2019s Exh. 1) Theda Vaughan was the general manager of SDA and James Ricky Vaughan was Chief Executive Officer. The Agreement provided that Theda would remain employed at SDA as Executive Vice President and be responsible for eom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>pany sales. In addition to retaining Theda, Recall entered into employment agreements with two other SDA employees, one of whom was Christopher Lupo (\u201cLupo\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Recall agreed that if it materially changed the job positions of these employees, it would provide Theda with comparable or better support. Mr. Vaughan was to stay on as a consultant for up to six months after closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">At closing, the Vaughans were paid $15,522,960. The Vaughans also had the potential to receive up to an additional $11,750,000 based on an Earnout formula contained in the Agreement. The parties agreed to the Earnout as a means for providing additional compensation to the Vaughans as the projected sales numbers approached their targets.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Earnout was payable in two installments: 1) the Vaughans were entitled to a partial Earn-out after six months if sales revenues exceeded $6,150,000; and 2) the Vaughans were entitled to a final Earnout after 12 months if sales revenues exceeded $12,300,000. To maximize that final Earn-out payment, SDA needed to achieve sales revenues in the amount of $17,950,000 for the year following execution of the SDA\u2014 the period August 2, 2000 through August 1. 2001 (\u201cEarnout period\u201d). If accomplished, this gain in sales would represent a growth of nearly 50%.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">During the Earnout period, Recall acquired several other document shredding businesses, including InstaShred, DocuShred(PA), DocuShred (TN), SecureShred (Greenville) and MobilShred. With the exception of MobilShred, Recall was entirely responsible for these acquisitions. Although Recall financed the purchase of MobilShred, Theda and Chris Lupo are credited with helping to facilitate the MobilShred acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">In May 2001, after Recall acquired InstaShred, Recall reorganized its document destruction operations into two separate companies\u2014\u201cSDS West\u201d and \u201cSDS East\u201d (or SDA). InstaShred was primarily serving the West Coast or western United States and SDA was primarily serving the East Coast plus Texas. Recall elected to divide the businesses geographically, placing SDA\u2019s Texas operations under SDS West and all operations east of Texas under SDS East.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">After acquisition, DocuShred (PA and TN) and SecureShred ceased to operate. The accounts previously serviced by these businesses were absorbed and serviced by SDS East (SDA).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> SDA\u2019s servicing of these accounts means SDA picked up, shredded, and baled the trash in addition to selling the paper and billing the client. SDA also took over former InstaShred operations in Virginia and Florida. The rest of InstaShred\u2019s business made up Recall\u2019s SDS West operations. MobilShred\u2019s operations were placed under SDS West <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>since its operations were centered in Vancouver and Calgary.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">SDA did not meet its sales goals for the Earnout period. Instead, based upon estimated sales revenues of $15,706,000, the Appellees were paid $1,236,000 after the first six months and an additional $5,847,000 at the end of the Earnout period, for a total Earnout payment of $7,083,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the total payout for the sale of SDA was $22,305,960.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In February 2002, the Vaughans commenced the underlying civil action alleging breach of contract. Specifically, the Vaughans complained that 1) Recall wrongfully excluded $522,649 of sales revenues generated by SDA during the Earn-out period; and 2) Recall, in violation of the \u201cgood faith\u201d (express and implied) provisions of the SPA, prevented Theda from maximizing her Earnout.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">In May 2003, Recall amended its Answer to include a counterclaim, the gist of which was that Recall had <em>overpaid </em>rather than underpaid Theda. According to Recall, the Earnout was not calculated properly because SDA had been over billing one of its clients\u2014Bank of America. Following the Earnout period, Recall reached an agreement with Bank of America whereby Recall repaid a portion of the overcharge and negotiated a new contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The district court presided over a three-day bench trial. At the conclusion of the trial, the district court rejected the Vaughans\u2019 allegation that Recall, in bad faith, prevented SDA from reaching its projected sales goal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (J.A. at 1111-20, \u00b6\u00b6 21-84, and 1128, \u00b6 1) However, the district court ruled in favor of the Vaughans on the acquisition revenue issue, finding that SDA performed the actual services and \u201cgenerated\u201d the revenue previously attributable to the acquired entities. (J.A. at 1121-23, \u00b6\u00b6 86-92) In essence, the district court found that SDA helped Recall absorb the newly acquired businesses by assuming responsibility for some, if not all, of the work. The district court expressly noted that the Vaughans\u2019 evidence was more credible on this claim. (J.A. at 1127, \u00b6 116) Alternatively, the district court found that Recall was estopped from contesting this claim in that Recall had waived its right to challenge the calculation of Theda\u2019s Earnout payment. (J.A. at 1121, \u00b6 86) With respect to the MobilShred acquisition, the trial judge found that the good faith provision within the Agreement required Recall to credit MobilShred revenues to SDA because Theda and Chris Lupo were largely responsible for the acquisition. (J.A. at 1123, \u00b6\u00b6 93-5) The district court treated Recall\u2019s counterclaim as an indemnification or breach of warranty action and deemed it untimely pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. (J.A. at 1124-1128, \u00b6\u00b6 106-11)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">The district court\u2019s rulings were based on its interpretation of the Stock Purchase Agreement as a matter of law. Finding the Agreement unambiguous, the district court did not consider extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">On appeal, the trial court\u2019s judgment following a bench trial is subject to a \u201cmixed standard of review\u2014factual findings may be reversed only if clearly erroneous, while conclusions of law, including contract construction, are examined <em>de novo. \u201d Roanoke Cement Co., LLC v. Falk Corp., </em>413 F.3d 431, 433 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Recall raises the following issues on appeal: 1) Whether the trial court erred as a matter of law by construing the SPA\u2019s \u201cSales Revenue\u201d definition to include acquisition revenues of document shredding operations serviced by SDA during the Earnout period; 2) Whether the trial court\u2019s factual findings with respect to estoppel or waiver of Recall\u2019s right to challenge calculation of the Earnout payment are clearly erroneous; 3) Whether the trial court erred as a matter of law by construing the SPA\u2019s good faith and sales revenue provisions as requiring Recall to credit SDA for the MobilShred acquisition revenues; and 4) Whether the trial court erred as a matter of law by dismissing Recall\u2019s counterclaim as untimely pursuant to the 18-month limitations period within the SPA. Each of these issues is addressed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">For the reasons set forth, we AFFIRM in part, REVERSE in part, and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">A. Acquisition Revenues/\u201cSales Revenues\u201d Under The SPA</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Recall contends that the district court erred as a matter of law in construing the SPA. Recall claims that the SPA\u2019s definition of \u201cSales Revenues\u201d should not have been interpreted to include SDA\u2019s sales from contracts acquired by SDA as a result of Recall\u2019s business acquisitions during the Earnout Period.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the alternative, Recall argues that the Agreement is ambiguous, requiring the consideration of extrinsic evidence. We disagree with both propositions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">i. Applicable Rules Of Contract Construction Under South Carolina Law<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">In construing the SPA, it is our function \u201cto ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties, looking first to the written instrument itself.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Bi-Lo, Inc., </em>301 S.C. 448, 392 S.E.2d 477, 479 (Ct.App.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">The Court must first determine, as a matter of law, whether or not the Agreement is ambiguous. <em>South Carolina Dep\u2019t of Natural Ress. v. Town of McClellanville, </em>345 S.C. 617, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302-303 (2001). \u201c[A] contract is ambiguous only when it may fairly and <em>reasonably </em>be understood in more ways than one.\u201d <em>Goldston v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

In other words, \u201cwhere one construction makes the provisions unusual or extraordinary and another construction which is equally consistent with the language employed, would make it reasonable, fair and just, the latter construction must prevail.\u201d <em>Id.

Phoenix Mut. Life Ins.

The SPA, Taken As A Whole, Can Reasonably Be Construed Only As Encompassing Acquisition Revenues Earned and Billed (Or Generated) By SDA</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">According to Recall, acquisition revenues do not fall 'within the scope of SDA\u2019s \u201cSales Revenues\u201d as defined by the SPA. Specifically, Recall contends that subsection (2)\u2014\u201cAll gross revenue generated by the Company from <em>new contracts or agreements from any </em>source\u201d\u2014does not include new contracts or agreements obtained via a subsequent acquisition. As explained below, Recall\u2019s argument is contrary to the plain language of SPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Recall\u2019s first two arguments hinge upon interpretation of the SPA provisions addressing sales revenues, good faith, and the restrictions on competition during the Earnout period. We turn now to the relevant language in the SPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Section 1.4 of the SPA, entitled \u201cEarn-out Payments,\u201d sets forth how the Vaughans\u2019 Earnout is to be calculated, beginning with the \u201cgood faith\u201d provision in Section 1.4(a). Section 1.4(a) provides insight as to the significance of the Earnout Payments as well as the parties\u2019 intent. <em>See Goldston, </em>594 S.E.2d at 518 (\u201cThe primary purpose of all rules of contract construction is to determine the intent of the parties.\u201d) Section 1.4(a) reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">It is the parties\u2019 intention that a significant part of the Purchase Price will be paid pursuant to this Section 1.4, and <em>Purchaser agrees to act reasonably in good faith </em>to allow Theda to have a fan-opportunity to qualify for the maximum payments provided for by this Section 1.4. The previous sentence shall also apply to Purchasers\u2019 Affiliates,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> except as provided below. Neither the foregoing nor anything in this agreement shall affect or apply to the current or <em>subsequent operations of </em>... <em>any business subsequently acquired by [Recall] ... engaged in document shredding services, </em>including, without limitation, any current business ... <em>or any business subsequently acquired by Purchaser or its Affiliates and engaged in document shredding services </em>(all such current and subsequent businesses being collectively referred to as \u201cPurchaser/Affiliate Shredding Businesses\u201d). The <em>sole obligation of </em>Purchaser/Affiliate Shredding Businesses shall be as set forth in this Section 1.4(f)(7) ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">(J.A. at 545-46; \u00a7 <em>lA(a))(emphasis added </em>). Thus, Section 1.4(a) imposes a good faith obligation on Recall and its Purchasers\u2019 Affiliates \u201cto act reasonably in good faith\u201d such that Theda would have a \u201cfair opportunity\u201d to maximize her Earnout Payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">\u201cSales Revenue\u201d is defined broadly in the Stock Purchase Agreement as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-15\">\u201c[T]he aggregate of all the Company\u2019s <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>gross revenue earned and billed </em>for the Earnout Period ... and consisting of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-16\">(2) All gross revenue <em>generated </em>by the Company from <em>new </em>contracts<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number><em>agreements from any source </em>for document shredding services ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">(J.A. at 546; \u00a7 <em>lA(e))(emphasis added). </em>The terms \u201cearned,\u201d and \u201cgenerated\u201d are not expressly defined within the SPA. Likewise, the SPA does not clarify what is meant by \u201cnew contracts or agreements.\u201d The SPA also includes a non-competition clause stating Recall\u2019s policy of preventing a \u201cPurchased Business\u201d from competing with SDA under certain circumstances. (J.A. at 549-50, \u00b6\u00b6 1.4(f)(7)(A) and (B)) The non-competition clause within Section 1.4(f)(7) speaks most directly to the intended relationship between SDA and subsequent acquisitions during the Earnout period:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">If Purchaser or Parent (or any of their Affiliates) purchase any business in North America during the Earnout Period ... (each such business being a \u201cPurchased Business\u201d), then with respect to each Purchased Business:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">(A) Purchaser and Parent will not institute a corporate policy preventing the Company from competing against the Purchased Business for new business (being business not previously serviced by the Purchased Business); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">(B) Purchaser and Parent will not permit the Purchased Business to compete against the Company for the services and locations (1) covered by the written customer contracts listed on item 5 to Schedule 2.16 and the contract resulting from rfp number 64960-001-001 dated April, 2000, and any subsequent variation thereof and (2) previously provided to Current Customers and serviced by the Company within the two year period prior to Closing; provided that the foregoing shall not restrict any service to any location of a Current Customer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">Purchaser/Affiliate Shredding Businesses in North America shall be subject to the requirements of (A) and (B) above during the Earnout Period. The <em>sole obligation </em>of Purchaser/Affiliate Shredding Businesses shall be as set forth in this Section 1.4(f)(7) ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">(J.A. at 549-50.) <em>(emphasis added) </em>Section 1.4(f)(7) may be said to provide for a level playing field for SDA and Recall and its Purchaser/Affiliate Shredding Businesses during the Earnout period. SDA is free to compete with any Purchaser Affiliates for \u201cnew business,\u201d while its existing contracts and locations are protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">Viewed as a whole, the SPA is not ambiguous. Pursuant to the Agreement, for revenues to fall within SDA\u2019s \u201cSales Revenue\u201d provision, SDA had to (1) generate or earn and bill the revenue, (2) as a result of new contracts or agreements from any source (3) for document shredding services.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The district court found that SDA \u201cearned and billed,\u201d or \u201cgenerated\u201d the acquisition revenue at issue. In construing the introductory language of \u00a7 1.4(e), the district court applied an ordinary, every day meaning of the word \u201cearned\u201d\u2014 \u201cto acquire by labor, service, or performance.\u201d (J.A. at 1121, \u00b6 87) Based upon undisputed facts, the district court then found that SDA performed under the contracts at issue by providing the actual document shredding services and that SDA billed said accounts. The district court found that SDA, in fact, \u201cgenerated\u201d the revenue. (J.A. at 1121-22, \u00b6 88)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">The district court also found that the acquisition revenues resulted from \u201cnew contracts or agreements\u201d because SDA had never serviced these customers before.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While the word \u201cnew\u201d hardly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>needs defining, its ordinary meaning is \u201chaving been made or come into being only a short time ago; recent\u201d or \u201crecently arrived or established in a place, position, or relationship.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth (2000). In addition to its ordinary meaning, the Court looks to Section 1.4(f)(7)(A), which defines \u201cnew business\u201d as \u201cbusiness not previously serviced by the Purchased Business.\u201d (J.A. at 549.) Applying the same definition to SDA, we find that any contract not previously serviced by SDA, whether obtained -via acquisition or otherwise, fits squarely within the language of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Furthermore, because SDA\u2019s sales revenues can be \u201cfrom any source,\u201d the fact that the contracts resulted from Recall acquiring and dissolving another document shredding business makes no difference. In short, the language <em>\u201cfrom </em>any source\u201d can <em>reasonably </em>be interpreted only as inclusive of acquisition revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">According to Recall, the language within Section 1.4(a) referring to the non-competition clause as the Purchaser/Affiliates\u2019 \u201csole obligation\u201d means that Recall owes Theda and SDA nothing for the services SDA performed in connection with acquisitions during the Earnout period. Read together, Sections 1.4(a) and (f)(7), undermine Recall\u2019s argument. Section 1.4(a) speaks in terms of continuing document shredding \u201coperations\u201d of a business subsequently acquired by Recall and contemplates that \u201cany business subsequently acquired ... and engaged in document shredding services\u201d is subject to the anti-competition clause. (J.A. at 549-50.) As already noted, several of the acquired entities ceased operations entirely or at least at certain facilities. The anti-competition clause within \u00a7 1.4(f)(7) only makes sense if the integrity of the acquired entity is maintained and the entity continues to be viable. A dissolved entity simply poses no competitive threat to SDA. For this reason, it makes little sense to construe the language as Recall suggests. Given the plain language of the Agreement, a more reasonable construction would provide that Recall could acquire and operate other document destruction businesses without the need to credit SDA with the revenue as long as, once acquired, the companies were operated independently of SDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">It is also clear from Section 1.4(f)(7) that the parties contemplated future acquisitions of document shredding businesses by Recall when the SPA was drafted. The Agreement expressly addressed the treatment of acquisition revenues from South-land Information Destruction (\u201cSouth-land\u201d). The parties made their intent clear regarding the revenues generated by SDA as a result of the Southland acquisition. The Agreement provided that \u201c[a]ll gross revenues from customers acquired in the Southland Acquisition\u201d would be included within SDA\u2019s sales revenues. (J.A. at 547.) At the inception of the SPA, Southland was the only acquisition the parties knew was a certainty.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Southland was also the only acquisition financed entirely by SDA rather than Recall. However, the fact that Southland's subsequently acquired revenues are expressly addressed within the SPA is instructive on at least three points. First, this provision tells us that the parties knew how to include (or exclude) acquisition revenues from sales revenues. Secondly, it distinguishes between \u201ccustomers acquired\u201d from South-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>land and Southland itself\u2014a distinction not made in the SPA with respect to Recall\u2019s Purchasers\u2019 Affiliates or Purchased Businesses. Finally, it demonstrates the parties\u2019 recognition that issues surrounding calculation of Theda\u2019s Earnout might arise post-merger with respect to subsequent acquisitions. While it is conceivable that the parties\u2019 failure to be more explicit concerning Recall\u2019s subsequent acquisition revenue was due to poor drafting rather than the actual intent of the parties, it is not the role of the court to speculate or rewrite the terms of the Agreement where the language actually used leaves no plausible room for Recall\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Considering the Stock Purchase Agreement as a whole, the Court finds there is only one <em>reasonable </em>interpretation of the Sales Revenue provision. <em>See C.A.N. Enters., </em>373 S.E.2d at 586 (noting that an unambiguous contract \u201cmust be construed according to the terms the parties have used, to be taken and understood in their plain, ordinary and popular sense\u201d). For these reasons, we find the SPA and its definition of \u201cSales Revenues\u201d unambiguous. Accordingly, the district court properly relied on the plain language of the SPA in construing the Agreement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">B. The District Court\u2019s Factual Findings Related To Waiver &amp; Estoppel By Recall Are Not Clearly Erroneous</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Recall also challenges the district court\u2019s alternative finding of waiver and estoppel. Section 1.4(g) of the SPA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7O\">\u201cWithin twenty (20) days after the end of each calendar month, <em>Purchaser shall </em>furnish to Theda a report describing the amount of Sales Revenues for such month, the sources thereof for such month, and any revenues of the Company for such month <em>which Purchaser believes </em>do not qualify as Sales Revenues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">(J.A. at <em>550.)(emphasis </em>added) The district court found that Recall never submitted any such monthly report as contemplated by the SPA. (J.A. at 1123, \u00b6 91) While the Agreement does not expressly identify the purpose of this provision, the parties\u2019 manifest intent was to provide an avenue for contemporaneous identification and resolution of any dispute about sources and calculation of sales revenues. Significantly, the onus in this regard was on Recall\u2014not SDA or Theda.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Nevertheless, Recall blames Theda for its own failure to act. Recall points to two monthly reports reflecting revenue trends submitted by Theda during the Earnout period. In both, the acquisition revenues are identified as such and placed under a heading separate from other SDA accounts. (J.A. at 854-55.) Recall contends there is nothing expressly stating that Theda considered these acquisition revenues as SDA\u2019s \u201cSales Revenues\u201d for purposes of calculating her Earnout payment. Thus, according to Recall, there was nothing for Recall to object to. Recall\u2019s' argument is specious. The inclusion of these revenues in the report purporting to represent SDA\u2019s monthly \u201crevenue trends,\u201d and the fact that the acquisition revenue figures are included in SDA\u2019s monthly revenue totals, at least put Recall on inquiry notice. Recall took no action. Furthermore, the language of \u00a7 1.4(g) makes clear that the mandatory report from Recall is not contingent upon receipt of any monthly report from Theda or SDA. Rather, the 20-day notice and report requirement incumbent upon Recall is triggered by \u201cthe end of each calendar month.\u201d In light of Recall\u2019s failure to inquire or contest SDA\u2019s monthly revenue totals in any way, its protest in this regard is unavailing. The district court\u2019s reliance on estoppel and waiver principles was appropriate and supports its ruling on this issue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>C. The District Court Erred In Construing The SPA To Credit MobilShred Sales Revenues To SDA</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Recall also contends that the district court erred in concluding SDA was entitled to credit for MobilShred\u2019s revenues earned and billed (or generated) during the Earnout period. We agree. The district court found that revenues resulting from Recall\u2019s acquisition of MobilShred, whose accounts were ultimately assigned to SDS West for service, should have been included in SDA\u2019s aggregate sales revenues figure and the Earnout calculation. The district court relied heavily on the good faith language within \u00a7 1.4(a) in support of this interpretation of the Agreement. The trial judge found that Theda and Lupo were \u201cprincipally responsible\u201d for the acquisition of Mobil Shred. (J.A. at 1123, \u00b6 93) Despite its own findings regarding the absence of bad faith on the part of Recall, the trial judge was troubled by the fact that Recall utilized Theda and Lupo to make the acquisition, which purportedly eliminated potential SDA customers, and then assigned the contracts to SDS West. (J.A. at 1123, \u00b6 94) Although SDA did not actually perform the document shredding services\u2014said performance having been previously equated by the lower court with the generation of revenue\u2014the district court found that good faith required Recall to credit SDA with these revenues. (J.A. at 1123, \u00b6 95)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">This aspect of the district court\u2019s ruling cannot be reconciled with the rationale correctly employed to construe Section 1.4(e). Even if we found that Theda and Lupo \u201cearned\u201d the revenues as a result of their pre-acquisition contributions, SDA did not \u201cbill\u201d any of the MobilShred revenues. The definition applied earlier requires both\u2014to earn <em>and </em>bill. Therefore, we cannot find that SDA generated the MobilShred revenues. Further, the good faith language within \u00a7 1.4(a) should not be read effectively to impair the SPA\u2019s explicit definition of \u201cSales Revenues.\u201d <em>Hardee v. Hardee, </em>348 S.C. 84, 558 S.E.2d 264, 267 (Ct.App.2001) (court should employ a construction that gives effect \u201cto the whole instrument and each of its various parts and provisions\u201d). Finally, we are unable to find any other language within the SPA to support the lower court\u2019s finding on this issue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">D. Recall\u2019s Counterclaim Is Not Subject To The 18-Month Limitations Period Within \u00a7 8.1 Of The SPA Applicable To Representations Or Warranties Prior To Closing</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjF\">Recall also challenges the district court\u2019s legal conclusion that its counterclaim was barred by Section 8.1 of the SPA. We agree with Recall on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">As already noted, Bank of America was one of SDA\u2019s largest customers when Recall purchased SDA. After the Earnout period, Recall discovered that SDA had been over-billing Bank of America. Without any contractual authority, SDA began to use an average weight (versus actual weight) of bins from the bank\u2019s high rise offices to determine the billing amount. The parties refer to this as the \u201c274 pound convention\u201d or a \u201cfixed weight billing practice.\u201d In September 2002, Bank of America learned of the mistake and demanded repayment. Recall eventually paid Bank of America a sum of approximately $1.5 million and negotiated a new contract.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (J.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>at 819-24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Recall\u2019s Amended Answer &amp; Counterclaim originally alleged two claims for relief complaining of SDA\u2019s over-billing of Bank of America\u2014Fraudulent Inducement (Count I) and Breach of Stock Purchase Agreement (Count II).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, Recall ultimately abandoned its fraudulent inducement claim. Count II, labeled by Recall as \u201cThe Breach of Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d alleges that Bank of America \u201crejected the invoices for the amounts that it was overbilled\u201d and \u201cdemanded repayment of those overbillings.\u201d It further alleges that Recall, as Counter-plaintiff, is \u201centitled under the SPA to a refund of the earn-out amounts paid to Counter-Defendants which were attributable to the over-billings to BoA.\u201d (J.A. at 32-3, \u00b6\u00b626-8)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The Vaughans do not dispute the fact that Recall incurred a liability to Bank of America as a result of SDA\u2019s prior practice. It is also undisputed that Theda\u2019s Earnout included Bank of America sales revenues given the overlap between the contract terms and the Earnout period.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The district court rejected Recall\u2019s contract theory, finding that Section 1.4 of the Agreement created no contractual duty on the part of the Vaughans. Instead, the district court characterized Recall\u2019s counterclaim as one for indemnification based upon an alleged misrepresentation or breach of warranty prior to closing and found that Recall did not provide timely notice of its claim under Section 8.2 of the Agreement. (J.A. at 1127, \u00b6 112) The district court also found that any breach of warranty claim Recall could have brought against the Vaughans was now time-barred as a result of the 18-month limitations period within Section 8.1 of the SPA. (J.A. at 1125-27, \u00b6\u00b6 106-11) On appeal, Recall asserts, for the first time, that its counterclaim alleging breach of contract should be characterized as an action for \u201cset-off,\u201d or merely a defense to any damages the Vaughans may be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Before addressing the merits of Recall\u2019s claim, we first determine whether it is properly before the Court. We have often held that an issue raised for the first time on appeal ordinarily will not be considered. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.l993)(citing <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed. v. Hanson, </em>859 F.2d 313, 318 (4th Cir.1988); <em>Stewart v. Hall, </em>770 F.2d 1267, 1271 (4th Cir.1985); <em>Maynard v. General Elec. Co., </em>486 F.2d 538, 539 (4th Cir.1973)). Nonetheless, we have made exceptions to this rule and recognized new arguments on appeal where the error is \u201cplain\u201d or failure to do so otherwise would result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>Id. (citing Nat\u2019l Wildlife, </em>859 F.2d at 318 (remanding to district court for recalculation of attorneys\u2019 fees under historic rather than current rate)). Such is the case here. Because this action seeks to ensure that the Earnout payment was calculated prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>erly under the terms of the Agreement, failure to consider Recall\u2019s counterclaim would constitute a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Although Recall pled a breach of contract claim, we find Recall\u2019s pleading more akin to an action for equitable recoupment. \u201cRecoupment is the right of the defendant to have the plaintiff\u2019s monetary claim reduced by reason of some claim the defendant has against the plaintiff arising out of the very contract giving rise to the plaintiffs claim.\u201d <em>See FDIC v. Marine Midland, Realty, Credit Corp., </em>17 F.3d 715, 722 (4th Cir.l994)(the \u201cdoctrines of setoff and recoupment are often confused\u201d) (citing <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank of Louisville v. Master Auto Serv. Corp., </em>693 F.2d 308, 310 n. 1 (4th Cir.1982)); <em>Tuloka Affiliates, Inc. v. Moore, </em>275 S.C. 199, 268 S.E.2d 293, 295 (1980)(noting that recoupment only reduces the plaintiffs claim and construing what appellant described as his \u201csecond defense and counterclaim\u201d as a recoupment defense)(ciimp <em>Mullins Hosp. v. Squires, </em>233 S.C. 186, 104 S.E.2d 161 (1958); <em>See generally, Para-Chem Southern, Inc. v. M. Lowenstein Corp., </em>715 F.2d 128, 131 (4th Cir.1983)). In its counterclaim, Recall asks for \u201ca reduction in the amount of the Sales Revenues subject to the earn-out and a corresponding reduction in the amount of the earn-out due to Counter-defendants.\u201d (J.A. at 33, \u00b6 27)</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Recall\u2019s recoupment claim may also be considered a compulsory counterclaim.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Fraser v. Astra Steamship Corp., </em>18 F.R.D. 240, 241-42 (S.D.N.Y.1955) (Under Rule 13 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \u201ca counterclaim now encompasses both set-off and recoupment.\u201d) A compulsory counterclaim \u201carises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject of the opposing party\u2019s claim.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a); <em>Painter v. Harvey, </em>863 F.2d 329, 332 (4th Cir.1988). The following four inquiries may be relevant in determining whether a counterclaim is compulsory: 1) whether the issues of fact and law raised in the claim and countei\u2019daim are largely the same; 2) whether res judicata would bar a subsequent suit on the party\u2019s counterclaim; 3) whether substantially the same evidence supports or refutes the claim as well as the counterclaim; and 4) whether there is any logical relationship between the claim and counterclaim. <em>Painter, </em>863 F.2d at 331 (indicating it is not necessary for all of the four inquiries to be answered in the affirmative) <em>(citing Sue &amp; Sam Mfg. Co. v. B-L-S Constr. Co., </em>538 F.2d 1048 (4th Cir.1976)). Here, accurate calculation of the Earnout under the SPA is at the heart of the Vaughans\u2019 action as well as Recall\u2019s counterclaim. Therefore, the issues of fact and law are similar, the evidence will overlap, and there is a logical relationship between the two actions. Applying these criteria, we treat Recall\u2019s counterclaim as compulsory. Notwithstanding Recall\u2019s inartful pleading, the objectives of Rule 13 are also best served by our entertaining Recall\u2019s recoupment defense. <em>Painter, </em>863 F.2d at 332 (noting the purposes of Rule 13(a), including \u201cto prevent the relitigation of the same set of facts\u201d and to dispose of all the disputes between the parties in one action). We now turn to the merits of Recall\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">As an initial matter, the district court mischaracterized Recall\u2019s counterclaim as an action arising out of an alleged misrepresentation or breach of warranty prior to closing. Indeed, Appellees\u2019 coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>sel conceded as much during oral argument. Section 8.1 of the Stock Purchase Agreement is entitled \u201cSurvival/Indemnification,\u201d and provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\">\u201c[N]o party will have any liability (for indemnification or otherwise) <em>with respect to any representation or warranty, or covenant or obligation to be performed and complied with on or prior to the Closing, </em>unless on or before eighteen (18) months after the Closing the complaining party notifies the other party in writing of a claim specifying the factual basis of that claim in reasonable detail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) <em>the representations and warranties </em>set forth at Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.19, 3.1 and 3.2 [Representations And Warranties Of Sellers] shall survive indefinitely and (y) the <em>representations and warranties </em>at Section 2.17 [Employee Benefit Plans] and Section 2.21 [Taxes] shall survive ... until the 90th day after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the limitations set forth in this Section 8.1 shall apply to any claims brought by Purchaser ... based on any fact or circumstance <em>which is alleged to be a breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty or a failure to perform a covenant or obligation to be performed and complied with on or pri- or to the Closing </em>regardless of whether the claim is brought pursuant to this agreement or otherwise and regardless of the theory upon which the claim may be based, whether contract, tort, warranty, strict liability, Federal and State Securities Laws or any other theory of liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">(J.A. at 571-72; PL\u2019s Exh. 1, \u00a7 8.1) <em>{emphasis </em>added). Section 8.1, which focuses entirely on 1) representations and warranties prior to Closing, or 2) covenants or obligations to be performed and complied with on or prior to Closing, does not control. Even if Recall\u2019s counterclaim were based upon a representation or warranty, the conduct Recall complains of did not occur prior to Closing. In fact, neither Recall nor Bank of America learned of SDA\u2019s 274 pound convention until well <em>after </em>the Closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">The district court also erred in finding that Recall failed to comply with the 20-day notice provision described in Section 1.4(g) and the prescribed procedures for seeking indemnification contained within Sections 8.2 and 8.4.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The \u00a7 1.4(g) notice could not bar Recall\u2019s counterclaim given that Recall couldn\u2019t have possibly challenged SDA\u2019s sales figures for the Bank of America accounts until <em>after </em>it discovered the over-billing.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Similarly, because Recall\u2019s counterclaim is not properly construed as an indemnification action within the purview of Section 8.1, Sections 8.2 and 8.4 do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">Although the SPA does not expressly provide a defined remedy,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>implicit mutual obligation to calculate the Earnout payments accurately encompasses Recall\u2019s right to contest the amount of damages Theda is entitled to collect based upon inaccurate calculations or \u201cunearned\u201d sales revenues arising from Bank of America contracts. Recall contends that the over-billing resulted in payment of Earn-out monies not actually \u201cearned.\u201d In addition to Section 1.4(e)\u2019s requirement that Sales Revenues be \u201cearned and billed\u201d by SDA, Recall points to language within \u00a7 1.4(e)(5), which sets forth specifically how Bank of America accounts are to be treated for purposes of determining Sales Revenues. Section 1.4(e)(5) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjQ\">\u201cNo bill or invoice rejected by the customer shall be considered \u201cearned\u201d or included in Sales Revenues for purposes of this Section 1.4, except to the extent subsequently paid by the customer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">(J.A. at 548.) Here, the invoices were paid by Bank of America prior to the discovery of the 274 pound convention. Recall posits that had Bank of America known of the overcharge prior to the end of the Earnout period, the bank would have rejected the charges and not submitted payment. In any event, we find that SDA did not actually earn the portion of Sales Revenues attributable to the over-billing of Bank of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Recall\u2019s counterclaim, an equitable recoupment action, will be remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In its ruling below, the district court noted that it did not need to consider the defenses to Recall\u2019s counterclaim asserted by the Vaughans, namely, volunteer and ratification. (J.A. at 1127, \u00b6 113) For this reason, remand is required to determine if these defenses preclude Recall\u2019s recovery and, if not, the extent to which Recall may be entitled to recoupment.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">The district court noted that Recall conceded at trial it may have inadvertently omitted from its Earnout calculation Sales Revenues generated by SDA\u2019s Texas facility in July 2001. (J.A. at 1124, \u00b6 99) The district court stated that the July 2001 Sales Revenues for SDA Texas were estimated at $25,000, and found that, if included, the July 2001 Sales Revenues would increase the amount due under the Earn-out to approximately $7,070,191. <em>Id. </em>However, the district court did not expressly address this adjustment to the Earnout within its Conclusions Of Law. In addition, the Judgment does not reflect the judge\u2019s factual finding on this issue. (J.A. at 1107.)
