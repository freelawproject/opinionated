The district court did not err by dismissing Gandy\u2019s complaint; Gandy may not proceed under \u00a7 1983 against an entity that is not acting under color of state law. <em>See West v. Atkins, </em>487 U.S. 42, 48, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">The dismissal of this appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Gandy\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim count as strikes under the Prison Litigation Reform Act. <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Gandy already has two countable strikes in the district court. <em>See Gandy v. Paper Wings, </em>No. 4:05-CV-00101-TSL-AGN, 2005 WL 1657048 (S.D.Miss. July 8, 2005); <em>Gandy v. Pierce, </em>No. 2:05-CV-00111-KS-JMR, 2005 WL 1279233 (S.D.Miss. May 31, 2005). Because Gandy has accumulated at least three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. \u00a7 1915(g). Gandy is warned that additional sanctions may be imposed if he does not withdraw any pending appeals that are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 BAR IMPOSED; SANCTIONS WARNING IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
