He argues that the district court erred by refusing to reduce his advisory guidelines offense level for a minor or minimal role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Although Cortez may have had the status of a \u201chired hand,\u201d he was apprehended while loading 363 kilograms of marijuana, and he accompanied a shipment to its destination. Cortez knew the leader of the drug conspiracy, knew that person to be a marijuana distributor, and resumed his association with that person as soon as he was released from prison. The record shows that Cortez was involved with more than 700 kilograms of marijuana; he assisted with the transportation of at least two loads; and he did whatever the leader told him to do. The district court did not commit clear error by refusing to reduce Cortez\u2019s offense level for his role in the offense. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Zuniga, </em>18 F.3d 1254, 1261 (5th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
