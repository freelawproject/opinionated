The district court held that while styled as a \u00a7 2241 petition, his pleading was subject to dismissal without prejudice as an unauthorized successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. Caderno has inadequately briefed the issue whether the district court erred by construing his pleading as such and instead merely recites the law pertaining to the filing of \u00a7 2241 petitions without applying it to the facts of his case. He does not address the issues whether the \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective or, alternatively, whether he meets the criteria for filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. He has therefore waived review of these issues. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
