He argues pursuant to Amendment 668 to the Sentencing Guidelines that he is entitled to a role adjustment in his offense level. Araujo, however, has failed to brief the issue whether the district court erred in holding that his motion was merit-less because Amendment 668 has not been designated retroactively applicable under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(e) (2006). He has therefore waived its review. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
