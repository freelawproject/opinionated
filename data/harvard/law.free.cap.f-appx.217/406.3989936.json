Schattman, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth, TX, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-17\">Mois\u00e9s Lopez, Seagoville, TX, pro se.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b433-19\">Before JONES, Chief Judge, and JOLLY and OWEN, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b433-20\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b433-21\">Mois\u00e9s Lopez appeals the sentence imposed following his guilty plea conviction of possession with intent to distribute pure methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-22\">Lopez argues that the district court erred by increasing his sentence based on facts not alleged in the indictment or found by the jury, in contravention of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights. This argument lacks merit. By rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory only, <em>Booker </em>eliminated the Sixth Amendment concerns that prohibited a sentencing judge from finding all facts relevant to sentencing. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 552-54 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-25\">Lopez argues that the district court erred when it denied him an acceptance of responsibility adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. The record shows that the district court\u2019s ruling, based on Lopez\u2019s denial of relevant conduct and his attempt to minimize his involvement in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>offense, is not without foundation. <em>See United States v. Brace, </em>145 F.3d 247, 264 (5th Cir.1998) (en banc). The district court therefore did not reversibly err when it denied Lopez an acceptance of responsibility adjustment. <em>See United States v. Flucas, </em>99 F.3d 177, 180 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Lopez argues that the district court erred in denying him a \u201csafety valve\u201d reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. The district court, relying on information contained in the presentence investigation report (PSR), found that Lopez had a leadership role in the offense. Lopez has not rebutted the presumed reliability of the information contained in the PSR. As a leader of the offense, Lopez was ineligible for the safety valve reduction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(f)(4); \u00a7 501.2(a)(4). Lopez has not shown that the district court clearly erred in denying the safety valve reduction. <em>See United States v. Treft, </em>447 F.3d 421, 426 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 555, 166 L.Ed.2d 413 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Finally, Lopez argues that his sentence at the bottom of the applicable advisory sentencing guideline range is unreasonable under \u00a7 3553(a) because it was greater than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing. The record shows that the district court considered the sentencing factors set forth at \u00a7 3553(a). Lopez\u2019s disagreement with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s assessment of the seriousness of his offense does not establish that his sentence was unreasonable. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
