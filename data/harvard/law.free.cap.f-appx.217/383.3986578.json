He raises numerous allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel relating to his guilty-plea conviction for sexual battery of a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-26\">Field does not address the basis of the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b) motion. Because he has not identified any error in the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b) motion, Field has abandoned the only issue before the court on appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987). Field\u2019s appeal is without merit and therefore is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Field\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and this court\u2019s dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Field is warned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
