Smocks, a federal prisoner, moves this court for authorization to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in his appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for habeas relief, filed under 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Smocks argues that he was denied the right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Smocks has failed to establish a nonfrivolous ground for appeal because he waived his claim that he was denied a speedy trial. <em>See United States v. Bradfield, </em>113 F.3d 515, 526 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Bell, </em>966 F.2d 914, 915 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir. 1982); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3). The motion to proceed IFP is denied. As the appeal contains no nonfrivolous issues, it is dismissed. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Smocks\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is likewise denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-37\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
