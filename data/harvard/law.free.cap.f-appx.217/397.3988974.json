Colvin concedes that he has \u201cwaived most of his appellate rights\u201d but goes on to argue that, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), his Sixth Amendment rights were violated and that he \u201cmight have\u201d received ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-14\">By failing to argue that his guilty plea was unknowing and involuntary, Colvin has waived such an argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). Insofar as Colvin is bound by the terms of his plea agreement, he has waived his right to bring the instant appeal, and this court will not review his ineffective assistance and <em>Booker </em>arguments. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-15\">Colvin\u2019s argument that the Government \u201cmay have\u201d breached the plea agreement does not amount to plain error given that the Government never agreed to seek a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. <em>See United States v. Reeves, </em>255 F.3d 208, 210 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Garcia-Bonilla, </em>11 F.3d 45, 46 (5th Cir. 1993). Moreover, Colvin received a three-level reduction under the terms of the agreement, and the Government dismissed the remaining counts against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
