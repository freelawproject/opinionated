The district court concluded Simmons\u2019 claims should be dismissed because they were barred by the doctrine of judicial estoppel. Specifically, the district court found Simmons did not disclose her potential claims against State Farm in her pending bankruptcy case, despite numerous opportunities to do so, and that the failure to disclose was calculated to make a mockery of the judicial system.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">Under the doctrine of judicial estoppel, \u201ca party is precluded from \u2018asserting a claim in a legal proceeding that is inconsistent with a claim taken by that party in a previous proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burnes v. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc., </em>291 F.3d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir.2002) (citation omitted). We consider two factors in the application of judicial estoppel. <em>Id. </em>First, the allegedly inconsistent positions must have been made under oath in a prior proceeding. Second, the inconsistencies must have been calculated to make a mockery of the judicial system. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">After review, we conclude the district court did not err in dismissing Simmons\u2019 claims based on judicial estoppel. We affirm for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion of August 2, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
