Verdi\u2019s brief fails to address the basis for the district court\u2019s dismissal of her suit, which was want of prosecution based on her failure to pay the filing fee as ordered. Her brief addresses only the merits of her various claims and seeks various forms of relief from this court. Accordingly, she has abandoned the only ground for appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although pro se briefs are afforded a liberal construction, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 225. Given her failure to brief the basis of the district court\u2019s ruling, we dismiss the appeal as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-16\">Verdi\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, motion for immediate court order seeking return of certain records, and motion for emergency court order, are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-17\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b413-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
