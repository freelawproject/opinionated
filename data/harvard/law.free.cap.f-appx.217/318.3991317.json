De La Rosa challenges the district court\u2019s upward departure in his sentence on the basis that his criminal history category of V substantially under-represented the seriousness of his prior criminal conduct and the likelihood of recidivism. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a). He argues that the district court erred when it assigned a criminal history category of VI and increased his offense level by three levels. He also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of \u00a7 1326(a) and (b) are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-23\">De La Rosa\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although De La Rosa contends that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-26\">We review the decision of the sentencing court to depart, and the extent of the departure, for abuse of discretion, ultimately determining whether the sentence is unreasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Desselle, </em>450 F.3d 179, 182 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1148, - L.Ed.2d - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>(2007); <em>United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 415-16 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1911, 164 L.Ed.2d 663 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">As determined by the district court, the record indicates that De La Rosa has a general disrespect of the law and that prior punishment for criminal acts has not acted as a deterrent. The district court thus did not abuse its discretion when it used recidivism as a basis for the departure. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l). Additionally, the extent of the departure was not \u201cunreasonable,\u201d given that De La Rosa had illegally entered this country undetected on three prior occasions and had committed at least one crime in this country on each occasion, and that he was unresponsive to the prison sentences he received for prior crimes. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006); \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
