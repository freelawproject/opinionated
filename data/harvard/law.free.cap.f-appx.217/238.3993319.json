Because the Board affirmed under its streamlined process, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2006), the immigration judge\u2019s decision is the final agency determination. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 366 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">The federal immigration statutes clearly state that \u201c[a] court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (West 2005). When Congress has statutorily mandated exhaustion, that requirement must be enforced. <em>Kurfees v. INS, </em>275 F.3d 332, 336 (4th Cir.2001). This court has held that it lacks jurisdiction to consider an argument not made before the Board. <em>Gandziami-Mickhou v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 351, 359 n. 2 (4th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004)). Our review of the briefs and administrative record demonstrates that Fajardo-Bania failed to exhaust all but one of her claims on appeal by failing to argue them to the Board. Accordingly, we are without jurisdiction to review all her claims with the following exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">Fajardo-Bania did argue to the Board that the immigration judge erred in finding her ineligible for an 1-212 waiver, which allows readmission to the United States after deportation. Therefore, we have jurisdiction to review this claim. However, we conclude the immigration judge was correct in its statement that a nunc pro tunc 1-212 waiver of an immigrant\u2019s failure to apply for admission can be granted only if such a waiver will cure the only ground for inadmissibility. <em>Matter of Garcia-Linares, </em>21 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 254, 257-58 (B.I.A.1996). Here, even if she received such a waiver, Fajardo-Bania would remain deportable under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), (ii). <em>See Matter of Balderas, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 389, 391 (B.I.A. 1991) (holding that 1-212 waiver does not eliminate or pardon convictions). Therefore, she is entitled to no relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">Accordingly, we deny Fajardo-Bania\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
