DavilaSolis contends the district court erred by applying an eight-level increase to his offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), because the conviction that resulted in his deportation, misdemeanor assault in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. 22.01(a)(1), is not a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 and does not constitute an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In <em>United States v. Villegas-Hernandez, </em>468 F.3d 874 (5th Cir.2006), this court determined that use of force is not an element of \u00a7 22.01(a)(1). The district court therefore erred in applying an enhancement based on this factor. The government concedes that based on <em>Villegas-Hemandez, </em>the court so erred, but the government asserts the error is harmless. Because, however, the government has failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the court would have imposed the same sentence absent the error, <em>see U.S. v. Kay, </em>83 F.3d 98, 101 (5th Cir.1996); <em>U.S. v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.2005), the sentence is vacated, and this matter remanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Davila-Solis also challenges the constitutionality of the treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Davila-Solis suggests that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), this court has repeatedly rejected such arguments and has declared <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). <em>See also Rangel-Reyes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2873, 165 L.Ed.2d 910 (2006). Davila-Solis concedes his argument is foreclosed but raises it preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b428-39\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
