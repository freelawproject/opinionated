Ahmed\u2019s motion to reopen was based on his marriage to a United States citizen and the filing of an alien relative petition on his behalf. Ahmed argues that the BIA abused its discretion by declining to find that the marriage was entered in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The BIA considered Ahmed\u2019s evidence of a good faith marriage. However, the BIA concluded that the evidence was not \u201cclear and convincing\u201d as was necessary to overcome the presumption of bad faith that adheres to a marriage entered into during removal proceedings. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(e); <em>In re: Velarde-Pacheco, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 253, 256 (BIA 2002). The BIA\u2019s decision was not an abuse of discretion because it was \u201cnot capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 304 (5th Cir.2005) (quotation marks and citation omitted). The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
