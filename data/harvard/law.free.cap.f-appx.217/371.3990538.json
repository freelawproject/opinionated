The district court concluded that Fulton\u2019s constitutional challenges to the state-court civil forfeiture proceeding in which Fulton\u2019s Chevrolet Blazer was forfeited to the State of Texas was barred by the <em>Rooker/Feldman </em><footnotemark>**</footnotemark> doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-25\">Fulton was the losing party in a state-court action, and he filed suit in federal court after the state proceedings ended. His federal action concerns an injury \u201ccaused by the state-court judgment and [effectively] seek[s] review and rejection of that judgment.\u201d <em>See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 291-92, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). As such, the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Fulton\u2019s complaint. <em>Richard v. Hoechst Celanese Chem. Group, Inc., </em>355 F.3d 345, 354 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-26\">The appeal is without arguable merit, is frivolous, and is therefore dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Fulton\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as strikes under the three-strikes provision, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Fulton is cautioned that if he accumulates a third strike under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-27\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
