Because the district court determined Gallegos was responsible for 2.5 kilograms of cocaine powder, Gallegos was sentenced to 100 months\u2019 imprisonment. We find no error and affirm Gallegos\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-21\">On appeal, counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). He first asserts that there is \u201ca genuine issue about whether the appeal waiver in the plea agreement is knowing and intelligent.\u201d Counsel next questions whether the magistrate judge fully complied with the requirements of Rule ll.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, counsel contends the district court violated <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because it sentenced Gallegos based on a drug weight that was not admitted, alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>in the indictment, nor found by jury beyond a reasonable doubt. However, counsel concluded this argument was \u201cforeclosed\u201d by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220,125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Gallegos joins his counsel\u2019s assertion that his appellate waiver was not knowingly and intelligently made. Additionally, Gallegos contends the district court erred by finding the drug weight by a preponderance of the evidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt. Gallegos further contends his sentence is proeedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to make specific findings on the record. The Government elected not to file a responsive brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Gallegos first challenges the voluntariness of the appellate waiver provision in his plea agreement. However, because the Government has not sought to enforce the waiver, we have not considered it. Accordingly, we need not address whether Gallegos\u2019s agreement to the appellate waiver was knowing, intelligent, or voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Next, Gallegos contends the magistrate judge did not fully comply with the requirements of Rule 11. Because Gallegos did not seek to withdraw his guilty plea in the district court, we review any alleged Rule 11 error for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 524-26 (4th Cir.2002). To establish plain error, Gallegos must show that an error occurred, that the error was plain, and that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 215 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005). We have reviewed the record and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">Gallegos next contends the district court erred by sentencing him based on facts that were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. However, after <em>Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the guideline range prescribed thereby as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). This court has previously noted that sentencing factors should continue to be evaluated based on the preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005). As Gallegos\u2019s sentence was imposed post-<em>Booker, </em>the district court\u2019s use of a preponderance of the evidence standard was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">Further, in imposing Gallegos\u2019s sentence, the district court stated that it had considered the advisory guideline range, the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and <em>Booker. </em>The court determined that a sentence at the low end of the guideline range was appropriate as it was \u201ca significant sentence.\u201d Though Gallegos asserts in his pro se supplemental brief that his sentence is proeedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to make specific findings, and the court concededly failed to explicitly discuss the various \u00a7 3553(a) factors on the record, we conclude it does not render Gallegos\u2019s sentence unreasonable. The district court satisfied its obligations by explicitly stating at the sentencing hearing that it had considered both the advisory guidelines as well as the relevant factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006) (\u201cRequiring district courts to address each factor on the record would ... be an exercise in unproductive repetition that would invite flyspecking on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly we affirm Gallegos\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-14\">.
