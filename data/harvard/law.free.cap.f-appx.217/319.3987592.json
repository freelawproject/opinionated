Because McFarland did not meet the requirements for proceeding under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the district court dismissed his petition for lack of jurisdiction. McFarland timely appealed and has moved for a certificate of appealability (COA) and the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-23\">A COA is not required for McFarland to proceed on appeal. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). McFarland concedes that the district court correctly dismissed his \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction. He argues, however, that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) is unconstitutional because it violates the Suspension Clause. This court has rejected the contention that the AEDPA violates the Suspension Clause. <em>See Turner v. Johnson, </em>177 F.3d 390, 392-93 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-24\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. McFarland\u2019s motion for a COA is DENIED AS UNNECESSARY. His motion for the APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b345-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
