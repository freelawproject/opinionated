Ward sued Midwestern State University (MSU), alleging race discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1981a, and 1983, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e (Title VII)- The district court granted MSU\u2019s motion to dismiss Ward\u2019s section 1981, 1981a, and 1983 claims and granted summary judgment for MSU on Ward\u2019s Title VII claims. Ward appeals the grant of summary judgment on his Title VII claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b352-14\">MSU offered and Ward, an African-American male, accepted, on a contract basis, the positions of Associate Professor of Public Administration and Coordinator of the Masters in Public Administration program in the College of Health and Human Services. The associate professor position was a tenure-track position that commenced in September 2001, and Ward was to be considered for tenure \u201cno earlier than 2003 and no later than 2007, provided that [he] meet all other requirements for this consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-15\">In December 2001, Dr. Susan Sportsman, Dean of the College of Health and Human Services, asked Ward to step down from the coordinator position without a concomitant reduction in salary. On October 14, 2002, Ward applied for tenure. In a letter dated October 15, 2002, Sportsman informed Ward that he would not receive a contract to teach at MSU for the 2003-2004 academic year. Ward alleges that MSU discriminated against him because of his race by removing him from the coordinator position, denying him tenure, and refusing to renew his teaching contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b352-17\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthe pleadings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An issue as to a material fact is \u201cgenuine\u201d if the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the non-moving party.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cWe may affirm summary judgment on any legal ground raised below, even if it was not the basis for the district court\u2019s decision.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\"><em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. </em>Green<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and its progeny establish the burden-shifting analysis to be applied to Title VII discrimination claims. In order to overcome a motion for summary judgment on his Title VII discrimination claims, the plaintiff must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, which entitles him to a presumption of discrimination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant may rebut this presumption by presenting a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under the traditional <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis, the plaintiff must then offer sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason for its action is pretextual.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In \u201cmixed-motive\u201d cases, this court applies the \u201cmodi<em>fied-McDonnell Douglas \u201d </em>framework.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under this mixed-motive framework, after the defendant has presented a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, the plaintiff must offer sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact that the defendant\u2019s reason, while true, is only one of the reasons for its conduct, and the plaintiffs race is another \u201cmotivating factor\u201d for the defendant\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">\u201cTo establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, a plaintiff need only make a very minimal showing.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, we assume without deciding that Ward established a <em>prima facie </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">Ward asserts that at the second step of the burden-shifting analysis, MSU failed to present legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. At this step of the analysis, the defendant has the burden of production, not persuasion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018[T]he employer\u2019s burden is satisfied if he simply explains what he has done or pro-due[es] evidence of legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This explanation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\u201cmust be clear and reasonably specific.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> MSU relied on Sportsman\u2019s affidavit. Ward first alleges that the district court erred in considering that affidavit because it was vague, speculative, and conclusory and because MSU failed to attach referenced documents. While Ward did make three hearsay objections to several parts of Sportsman\u2019s affidavit, which the district court sustained, Ward never objected to any part of the affidavit on the grounds that it was vague, speculative, or conclusory or that MSU failed to attach referenced materials. Therefore, Ward has waived these objections to the affidavit, and the district court properly considered the portions of the affidavit to which there was no objection.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Sportsman\u2019s affidavit states that Ward was removed from the coordinator position and his contract was not renewed based on several incidents. First, Sportsman \u201cobserved Dr. Ward standing and shouting at other MPA faculty during an MPA faculty meeting,\u201d and Sportsman \u201cintervened, stopped the meeting, and asked Dr. Ward and another professor to join [her] to discuss the situation.\u201d In another incident, \u201cDr. Ward, through an email disbursed to all MPA faculty [in November 2001], chastised a fellow MPA faculty member for the presentation of an MPA candidate.\u201d Finally, Sportsman stated that \u201cbeginning in the Fall, 2002 semester, Dr. Ward was absent from all College Faculty meetings and the mandatory MPA faculty meetings.\u201d Sportsman states that Ward was removed from his position and his contract was not renewed because these incidents demonstrated that Ward lacked the interpersonal skills necessary to serve as coordinator or associate professor. These proffered reasons are clear and reasonably specific, and MSU met its burden of production. MSU, therefore, rebutted the presumption of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Under the final step of the burden-shifting analysis, Ward must present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact that MSU\u2019s proffered reasons are pretextual. The district court determined, under the traditional <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis, that Ward failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that MSU\u2019s proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Ward contends that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether MSU\u2019s proffered reasons are pretextual. In order to raise a genuine issue of material fact, the non-movant must come forward with \u201cspecific facts.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cConclus[ory] allegations and denials, speculation, improbable inferences, unsubstantiated assertions, and legalistic argumentation do not adequately substitute for specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Ward alleges that the \u201cpurposefully vague and conclusory\u201d statements in Sportsman\u2019s affidavit raise an inference that MSU\u2019s proffered reasons were pretextual. As determined earlier, Sportsman\u2019s affidavit contains clear and reasonably specific reasons for MSU\u2019s actions; therefore, Ward makes an improbable inference that is insufficient to raise a genuine fact issue for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Next, Ward stresses that he was better qualified than a white colleague who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>was granted tenure. To support this allegation, Ward submits his own deposition testimony in which he claims to be better qualified and better published than his colleague, but this evidence is mere speculation. Ward fails to refer this court to any particularized evidence to support his subjective view that he was better qualified than his colleague.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Ward also alleges that the facts that there were only four African-American faculty out of approximately 500 MSU faculty members and that another African-American faculty member in the College of Health and Human Services was denied tenure raise a fact issue that MSU\u2019s proffered reasons were pretextual. Again, Ward relies on his own speculative deposition testimony to support these allegations, and he fails to present any particularized evidence to support these allegations. We conclude that Ward\u2019s evidence is insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether MSU\u2019s proffered reasons for its actions was pretext for unlawful discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Ward also argues that the district court improperly failed to apply the mixed-motive theory to his Title VII claims. This argument, however, falls outside the scope of our appellate review because Ward waived this allegation by failing to present any arguments related to the mixed-motive analysis in the district court.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
