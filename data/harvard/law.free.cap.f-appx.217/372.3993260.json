Brown alleged that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs by causing him to be exposed to and to contract tuberculosis from a fellow inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-22\">On appeal, Brown contends that (1) the district court erred in refusing to permit him to read into the record, during cross-examination of defense experts, medical pamphlets and treatises and (2) the defense experts committed fraud and misrepresentation by testifying falsely regarding the relationship between tuberculosis and Mycobacterium Avium Complex, an avian disease. Brown has not provided a transcript of the trial or any pretrial hearing. The absence of transcripts prevents us from reviewing Brown\u2019s arguments concerning matters or rulings that occurred at transcribed proceedings. <em>See Richardson v. Henry, </em>902 F.2d 414, 416 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-23\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
