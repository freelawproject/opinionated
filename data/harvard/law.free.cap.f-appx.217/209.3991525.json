The district court sentenced Edwards to fifteen months\u2019 imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Edwards appealed, and counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), finding no meritorious issues for appeal but raising the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing. Edwards was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief; however, he has not done so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Because Edwards did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, his challenge to the adequacy of the Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002) (holding that \u201cplain error analysis is the proper standard for review of forfeited error in the Rule 11 context\u201d). Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court fully complied with the mandate of Rule 11 in accepting Edwards\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We therefore affirm Edwards\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Edwards, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Edwards requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Edwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b236-10\"> To the extent Edwards asserted a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in his pro se notice of appeal, we decline to review this issue on direct appeal as counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness is not apparent from the record. <em>See United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1407, 164 L.Ed.2d 107 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
