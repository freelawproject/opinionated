Whitehead contends that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional on its face because it does not require a substantial effect on interstate or foreign commerce. Alternatively, he contends that the factual basis for his plea was insufficient because the mere movement of a firearm from one state or country to another at some undetermined time in the past does not constitute a substantial effect on interstate or foreign commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-22\">Whitehead raises these arguments solely to preserve them for possible Supreme Court review. As he acknowledges, they are foreclosed by existing Fifth Circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Guidry, </em>406 F.3d 314, 318-19 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 190, 163 L.Ed.2d 198 (2005); <em>United States v.
