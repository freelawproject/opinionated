(Moore), alleging sex discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e (Title VII). The district court granted summary judgment to Moore on all of Davis\u2019s Title VII claims, and Davis appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b340-15\">Davis worked as the only female press operator for Moore at its Nacogdoches, Texas facility. While working for Moore, Davis missed work on several occasions to take her daughter to Houston for medical treatment. Moore claims that it terminated Davis for violating its written attendance policy. Moore placed Davis on final written warning after she missed three consecutive days of work in June 2003. Moore was instructed that, according to the attendance policy, if she missed any more hours before February 26, 2004, she would be terminated. Moore claims that Davis was terminated in January 2004 because she accrued additional absent hours during the week of December 15, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-16\">Davis claims that she was in compliance with the attendance policy because she had permission to miss the three days in June 2003 and to make up the hours missed in December 2003. Davis also claims that at the end of December 2003, Operations Manager Tim Gillespie said to her, \u201cI never did like the idea of having a female press operator anyway and if it is the last thing I do you will be gone.\u201d Davis reported this remark to Assistant Human Resources Director Joe Cortes on Decem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>ber 31, 2003. Davis claims that Moore terminated her because of her sex and in retaliation for her complaint against Gillespie.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An issue as to a material fact is \u201cgenuine\u201d if the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the non-moving party.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in her favor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2018We may affirm summary judgment on any legal ground raised below, even if it was not the basis for the district court\u2019s decision.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">A plaintiff may prove a Title VII discrimination claim through direct or circumstantial evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Direct evidence of discrimination \u201cis evidence which, if believed, proves the fact without inference or presumption.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the plaintiff provides direct evidence, then the burden shifts to the employer to prove that the same adverse action would have occurred regardless of discriminatory animus.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-17\">Absent direct evidence of discrimination, <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. </em>Green<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and its progeny establish the burden-shifting analysis to be applied. In order to overcome a motion for summary judgment on her discrimination claim, the plaintiff must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, which entitles her to a presumption of discrimination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant may rebut this presumption by presenting a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under the traditional <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis, the plaintiff must then offer sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason for its action is pretextual.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-18\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of sex discrimination, \u201ca plaintiff need only make a very minimal showing.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, we assume without deciding that Davis established a <em>prima facie </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-19\">Under the second step of the burden-shifting analysis, Moore presented a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Davis: she violated Moore\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>attendance policy. Davis was given verbal and written warnings in accordance with Moore\u2019s written attendance policy on sixteen separate occasions between November 1998 and May 2003. In June 2003, Davis missed three consecutive days of work, and she was placed on final written warning and told that she would be terminated if she missed any additional hours before February 26, 2004. Davis then accrued additional absent hours during the week of December 15, 2003, which resulted in her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Under the final step of the burden-shifting analysis, Davis must present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact that Moore\u2019s proffered reason is pretextual. Davis contends that Moore\u2019s proffered reason was pretextual because she was in compliance with the attendance policy. Davis maintains that she received permission from her supervisor, Sheila Murdock, to take three days off in June 2003 in accordance with the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Moore allows employees to take up to twelve weeks of FMLA leave per year because of their own or a family member\u2019s serious medical condition. Once an employee misses twelve weeks of FMLA leave time, any additional missed hours are charged against the employee as unapproved absent hours under Moore\u2019s attendance policy. Moore presented undisputed evidence that Davis had already used twelve weeks of FMLA leave prior to missing three days in June 2003. Also, under Moore\u2019s policy, FMLA leave must be approved by an employee in the Human Resources Department, and there is no evidence that anyone in the Human Resources Department approved Davis\u2019s absences in June 2003. Davis\u2019s own conclusory remark that her June 2003 absences were \u201capproved\u201d is insufficient raise a fact issue.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Davis also claims that she had permission to work her assigned hours on a different schedule during the week of December 15, 2003. Even if Davis had permission to work a different schedule that week, the undisputed documentary evidence shows that Davis worked 65 hours when she was assigned to work 68 hours. The only evidence that Davis presents to show that she worked all of the hours she was assigned for the week of December 15, 2003 is her conclusory statement that she did so, which is insufficient to create a fact issue.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Davis also argues that Gillespie\u2019s comment is direct evidence of sex discrimination. \u201cFor comments in the workplace to provide sufficient evidence of discrimination, they must be (1) related to the protected class of persons of which the plaintiff is a member; (2) proximate in time to the terminations; (3) made by an individual with authority over the employment decision at issue; and (4) related to the employment decision at issue.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Gillespie was an Operations Manager at the plant, but there is no evidence that he had any authority over the termination decision or that he had any influence over the actual decision-makers. The evidence of Gillespie\u2019s comment, therefore, is insufficient to raise a fact issue of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Also, the fact that Gillespie told Davis, \u201cI never did like the idea of having a female press operator anyway and if it is the last thing I do you will be gone,\u201d is insignificant in comparison to the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>of Davis\u2019s violations of Moore\u2019s attendance policy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The undisputed evidence also shows that Moore fired two male employees for violations of the attendance policy during the same period that it fired Davis. Absent any evidence that Moore would have been more lenient of similar violations by a male employee or that Davis did not in fact commit the violations cited by Moore, we cannot conclude that Gillespie\u2019s statement, on its own, is sufficient to meet Davis\u2019s burden of creating a fact issue that Moore had a discriminatory motive for the termination.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The same burden-shifting analysis applicable to Davis\u2019s Title VII discrimination claim also applies to Davis\u2019s Title VII retaliation claim.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for unlawful retaliation, the plaintiff must establish \u201c(1) that she engaged in activity protected by Title VII, (2) that an adverse employment action occurred, and (3) that a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Davis has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact on the third element of her <em>prima facie </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">For Davis to establish that a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse employment action, \u201cthe evidence must show that the employer\u2019s decision to terminate was based in part on knowledge of the employee\u2019s protected activity.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This may be established by presenting \u201cevidence that the ultimate decision maker, with final authority to hire and fire subordinate employees merely \u2018rubber stamped\u2019 a recommendation to terminate made by an employee with knowledge of the complaint.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">Davis alleges that Tim Gillespie said to her, \u201cI never did like the idea of having a female press operator anyway and if it is the last thing I do you will be gone.\u201d In her deposition, Davis testified that she reported this remark to Assistant Human Resources Director Joe Cortes. It is undisputed that this is a protected activity under Title VII. Even in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Davis, however, there is no evidence to support a finding that the decision-makers at Moore had any knowledge of this protected activity at the time the decision to terminate Davis was made. The evidence shows that on December 18, 2003, Sheila Murdock, Davis\u2019s supervisor, informed Catheryn Williams, Senior Human Resources Manager, that Davis had accrued six absent hours from December 15 through 17, in violation of her Final Written Warning probation. That same day, Williams emailed Mike Sirchio, Vice President of Human Resources, recommending that Davis be terminated. According to a documented calendar entry and Williams\u2019s affidavit, Sirchio and Bill Burch, the plant manager for the facility, approved Davis\u2019s termination on December 22, 2003 but decided to postpone it until after the new year to avoid terminating Davis days before the Christmas holidays.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">Davis did not report Gillespie\u2019s remark to Cortes until December 31, 2003. Davis presented no evidence to suggest that Sirchio and Burch\u2019s decision to terminate Davis was not finalized on December 22. The decision-makers could not have had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>knowledge of the protected activity at the time they decided to terminate Davis because it had yet to occur. Davis has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b340-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
