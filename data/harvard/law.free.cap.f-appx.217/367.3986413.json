The district court denied Shelton\u2019s IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP, Shelton is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-22\">Shelton asserts that his due process rights were violated because the defendant performed an autopsy on his deceased wife without his permission and did not return the body to Shelton for burial although Shelton was the next of kin. He also asserts that he wrongly lost custody of his children. The district court concluded that Shelton\u2019s claims, which accrued at the latest in 1992, were untimely. <em>See Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>51 F.3d 512, 516 (5th Cir.1995); Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 16.003(a). Shelton has not presented a nonfrivolous appellate issue concerning the dismissal on limitations grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-23\">Shelton has not shown that the district court\u2019s conclusion that his appeal would be frivolous was incorrect. The instant ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>peal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Shelton\u2019s request for IFP status is denied, and his appeal is dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The dismissal of Shelton\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit by the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Shelton has two prior strikes. <em>Shelton v. Schorre, </em>48 Fed-Appx. 106 (5th Cir.2002). Because Shelton has accumulated at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b393-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
