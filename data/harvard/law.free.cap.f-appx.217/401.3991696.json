Feliz concedes that he has filed two motions to reopen, but he contends that because his first motion alleged that he was denied notice before the immigration judge issued an in absentia removal order, the first motion should not count against the numerical limitation placed on motions to reopen. Feliz cannot establish that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his most recent motion to reopen as exceeding the numerical limitation on such filings. <em>See Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 549-50 (5th Cir.2006); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), (3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-23\">Feliz also contends that the BIA abused its discretion by refusing to reopen the case sua sponte, in light of the exceptional circumstances he has shown. Because there is \u201cno legal standard against which to judge an [administrative agency\u2019s] decision not to invoke its sua sponte authority,\u201d we lack jurisdiction to consider this claim. <em>See Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 250 (5th Cir.2004). Feliz\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
