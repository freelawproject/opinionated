He appeals the sentence imposed for his assault offense. Crow asserts that a six-level enhancement to his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(b) was improper because the enhancement was based on the district court\u2019s clearly erroneous finding that Crow\u2019s assault was motivated by the victim\u2019s status as a government employee. Based on the record as a whole, such a finding was plausible and therefore not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 560, 584 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-21\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
