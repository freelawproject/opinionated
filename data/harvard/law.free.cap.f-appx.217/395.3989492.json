Moreno argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his prior Texas robbery conviction under Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 29.02 (Vernon 1999). He also argues that the enhancement provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-24\">Robbery is expressly listed as a crime of violence in the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. l(b)(iii). This court recently held in <em>United States v. Santiesteban-Hernandez, </em>469 F.3d 376, 378-82 (5th Cir.2006), that the Texas robbery statute, \u00a7 29.02, qualifies as the enumerated offense \u201crobbery\u201d for \u00a7 2L1.2 purposes. Moreno\u2019s arguments are almost identical to the arguments made in <em>Santiesteban-Hernandez, </em>469 F.3d at 378-82, and therefore do not provide a basis for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and subsequent Supreme Court precedent, Moreno challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. Moreno\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Moreno properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b421-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
