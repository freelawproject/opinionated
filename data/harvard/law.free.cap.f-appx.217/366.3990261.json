McGrew, Jr., Texas prisoner # 1317843, has filed a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. The district court denied McGrew\u2019s IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP, McGrew is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-18\">McGrew asserts that he was denied his due process rights by the Monahans Municipal Court because he was prosecuted for driving with a suspended license. He also contends that the City of Monahans should be held liable for the actions of its court. McGrew has not shown that the district court\u2019s determination that his appeal would be frivolous was incorrect. He has failed to brief a challenge to the basis for the district court\u2019s denial of IFP, and any such argument is not preserved. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, McGrew\u2019s request for IFP status is denied, and his appeal is dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-23\">The dismissal of McGrew\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit by the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). McGrew has one prior strike. <em>McGrew v. Orona, </em>No. 7:04-CV-156-RAJ (W.D.Tex. Dec. 9, 2004). Because McGrew has accumulated at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-24\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
