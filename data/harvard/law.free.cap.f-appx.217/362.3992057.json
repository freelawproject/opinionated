He argues that the district court clearly erred in denying him a minor-role adjustment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. Trevino-Salazar argues that he was a mere courier who was substantially less culpable than other participants in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and review factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005). Pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2, a district court may decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if the defendant was a minor participant. An adjustment for a minor role applies to a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 5. The district court did not clearly err in denying Trevino-Salazar a minor-role adjustment. <em>See United States v. Atanda, </em>60 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
