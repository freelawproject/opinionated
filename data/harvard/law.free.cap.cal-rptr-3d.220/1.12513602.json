As relevant to this writ proceeding, Proposition 57 eliminated the People's ability to directly file criminal charges against a juvenile defendant\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in a court of criminal jurisdiction (Adult Court). We must determine whether Proposition 57 applies to a pending case that the People directly filed in Adult Court against real party in interest, Jeremy Walker, several years\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to the effective date of the new law. We conclude that Proposition 57 does not apply to Walker's case and that the trial court's transfer of Walker's case from Adult Court to the juvenile court (Juvenile Court) pursuant to the new law was erroneous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we grant the People's writ petition and direct the trial court to vacate its order transferring Walker's case from Adult Court to Juvenile Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In February 2012, the People filed a complaint against Walker in Adult Court, alleging two counts of attempted premeditated murder ( Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664, 187, subd. (a) ) and one count of active participation in a gang ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 186.22, subd. (a) ). With respect to the attempted murder counts, the People alleged two firearm enhancements ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.53, subds. (d), (e) ) and a gang enhancement ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 186.22, subd. (b) ). The record indicates that Walker was 17 years old at the time of the events giving rise to the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The People filed the complaint pursuant to former section 707, subdivision (d) of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   That statute permitted the direct filing of criminal charges in Adult Court against a person who was under 18 years of age at the time the crime was allegedly committed, under certain specified circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A jury found Walker guilty as charged. The jury also found the firearm and gang\n   enhancements true. The trial court sentenced Walker to 80 years to life in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In May 2015, this court ruled that the trial court erred in admitting certain evidence at Walker's trial and reversed his convictions. In September 2015, the remittitur issued in Walker's appeal. Since the issuance of the remittitur, Walker has been awaiting retrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 8, 2016, the voters passed Proposition 57, which became effective the following day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In late November 2016, Walker filed a motion to transfer his case from Adult Court to Juvenile Court, in light of Proposition 57. In his motion, Walker argued that Proposition 57 \"applies retroactively to direct file cases which are not yet final.\" (Formatting omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The People filed an opposition to the motion in which they argued that Proposition 57 did not apply retroactively to cases filed in Adult Court prior to the effective date of the new law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court held a hearing on Walker's motion on December 12, 2016. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court granted the motion, ruling in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"One side is, it goes to [J]uvenile [C]ourt, because Prop 57 is to be broadly construed. It doesn't speak to retroactivity at all, which of course is the People's argument, if it doesn't speak to it, that means it's prospective.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"So these cases are going to have to be adjudicated again by eventually the Supreme Court, I'm sure, but my order right now is I'm going to grant the motion and order it-put it in [J]uvenile [C]ourt, because I think that's what the intent of the proposition is.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court stayed its order to permit the People to seek appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   That same day, the People filed a petition for writ of mandate/prohibition in the Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District, Division 2. In their petition, the People requested that the Court of Appeal order the trial court to vacate its order granting Walker's motion. Three days later, the Administrative Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District, transferred the matter to this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On December 22, this court issued an order to show cause, directed Walker to file a return, permitted the People to file a traverse, and stayed all further proceedings in the trial court. Thereafter, Walker filed a return, the People filed a traverse, and this court heard argument in the matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    The trial court's order granting Walker's motion to transfer the case from Adult Court to Juvenile Court is premised on an improper retroactive application of Proposition 57\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In their petition, the People argue that this court should order the trial court to\n   vacate its order granting Walker's motion. In support of this contention, the People argue that Proposition 57 does not apply retroactively to cases properly filed in Adult Court prior to the effective date of the proposition, and that the trial court's order transferring Walker's case to Juvenile Court is premised on an improper retroactive application of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Walker contends that Proposition 57 applies retroactively to cases filed in Adult Court prior to the effective date of the proposition. In the alternative, Walker contends that the trial court's order constitutes a prospective application of the new law. Walker also argues that the Adult Court lacks jurisdiction over his case pursuant to a section of the Welfare and Institutions Code (\u00a7 602 ) as amended by Proposition 57. Finally, Walker maintains that to fail to apply Proposition 57 to his case would constitute a denial of equal protection of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We first provide a summary of Proposition 57, before considering whether the proposition may be applied retroactively to cases properly filed in Adult Court before the effective date of the statute. After concluding that Proposition 57 may not be applied retroactively, we next consider whether the trial court's order is premised on a prospective application of the new law. We conclude that the trial court's application of Proposition 57 to Walker's case constitutes an improper retroactive application of the law. We further conclude that the Adult Court does not lack jurisdiction over Walker's case under section 602 and that failing to apply Proposition 57 to Walker's case would not deny him equal protection of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Proposition 57\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Summary of Proposition 57\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    People v.

We disagree. Both statements fall\n   <em>\n    far short\n   </em>\n   of the clear indication of retroactivity required under California law.

For the same reason, we are unpersuaded by Walker's contention that the electorate's intent to apply the law retroactively is demonstrated by the Legislative Analyst's reference to potential costs savings premised on youths spending less time in prison and on parole as a result of the proposition. (See Voter Guide,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at p. 57.) This analysis reflects the Legislative Analyst's prediction with respect to the cost savings related to the implementation of the law generally. Nothing in the analysis suggests that the savings predicted-which was estimated to be \"a few million dollars annually\" (Voter Guide,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at p. 57)-was in any way based on the proposition being applied retroactively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   We also are unpersuaded by Walker's contention that Proposition 57 may be applied retroactively because \"[n]othing in the language of the measure or the Legislative Analyst's treatment of the measure\n   suggested an intention to limit the applicability to those whose cases have been filed or who were at any specific stage of the proceedings.\" In light of the well-established presumption in\n   <em>\n    favor\n   </em>\n   of the\n   <em>\n    prospective\n   </em>\n   application of statutes (e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Tapia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 53 Cal.3d at p. 287,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=279%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20592\">\n    279 Cal.Rptr. 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=807%20P.2d%20434\">\n    807 P.2d 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), the\n   <em>\n    absence\n   </em>\n   of language in Proposition 57 reflecting an intent to apply the proposition prospectively does not demonstrate that the voters intended for the law to be applied\n   <em>\n    retroactively\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In sum, \"the voters did not make their intent clear regarding retroactive application in the text of Proposition 57 nor can we clearly discern their intent from the voter information guide.\" (\n   <em>\n    Mendoza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 10 Cal.App.5th at p. 345,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=216%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20361\">\n    216 Cal.Rptr.3d 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

Specifically, such application attaches a new legal consequence to the prior proper\n   <em>\n    filing\n   </em>\n   of charges in Adult Court, an event completed prior to the change in the law, by invalidating the filing and transferring the matter back to Juvenile Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Finally, neither the\n   <em>\n    Cervantes\n   </em>\n   court nor the\n   <em>\n    Lara\n   </em>\n   court identified any procedural mechanism in\n   <em>\n    Proposition 57\n   </em>\n   by which an\n   Adult Court may transfer to the Juvenile Court a case that was pending in Adult Court as of the effective date of the proposition. As discussed above, the\n   <em>\n    Lara\n   </em>\n   court merely asserted that the real party was now under the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court (\n   <em>\n    Lara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 9 Cal.App.5th at p. 775,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=215%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20456\">\n    215 Cal.Rptr.3d 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and the\n   <em>\n    Cervantes\n   </em>\n   court looked to two statutes, section 604 and Penal Code section 1170.17,\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   as \"analogue[s],\" that could \"provide a procedural framework for a transfer to juvenile court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Cervantes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 9 Cal.App.5th at pp. 613-614,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=215%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20174\">\n    215 Cal.Rptr.3d 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In our view, the absence of any mechanism\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   Proposition 57 to effectuate such transfers further demonstrates that the proposition was not intended to be applied to cases filed in Adult Court prior to the effective date of the proposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   In short, the procedure approved in\n   <em>\n    Cervantes\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lara\n   </em>\n   -the transfer of a minor's case from Adult Court to Juvenile Court to permit the People to bring a motion to transfer the case back to Adult Court under the new law-does not constitute a proper\n   <em>\n    prospective\n   </em>\n   application of\n   <em>\n    Proposition 57\n   </em>\n   . Rather such a procedure is premised on the combination of an impermissible\n   <em>\n    retroactive\n   </em>\n   application of Proposition 57 to invalidate a properly direct filed case under the former law and the borrowed \"procedural framework\" (\n   <em>\n    Cervantes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 9 Cal.App.5th at p. 613,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=215%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20174\">\n    215 Cal.Rptr.3d 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) of a law\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   of Proposition 57 to transfer the case from the Adult Court to the Juvenile Court.
