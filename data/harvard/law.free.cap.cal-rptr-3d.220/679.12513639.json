He contends his trial attorney provided ineffective assistance by failing to move to dismiss the identity theft charge under the so-called\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   rule. Defendant also contends that the court erred in imposing penalty assessments on fees imposed under the Health and Safety Code and in requiring him to pay $500 in attorney fees. We reject defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel but conclude that the matter must be remanded to recalculate the fees excluding the penalty assessments and to determine defendant's financial ability to pay attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant was charged by amended information with driving or taking a vehicle without consent after a prior conviction ( Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851 ; Pen. Code,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00a7 666.5 [count 1] ), identity theft (\u00a7 530.5, subd. (a) [count 2] ),\n   possession for sale of methamphetamine ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11378 [count 3] ), transportation of methamphetamine ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11379, subd. (a) [count 4] ), and misdemeanor receiving stolen property of a value not exceeding $950 (\u00a7 496, subd. (a) [count 5] ). The information also alleged that defendant had two prior convictions for which he served a prison term (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because defendant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence in support of his convictions, a detailed summary of the trial evidence is unnecessary. We set forth only a summary of basic facts to provide context for the discussion that follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A police officer testified that on August 31, 2015, at approximately 3:00 p.m., he received notification that a stolen vehicle was traveling in a nearby area. He drove to the area where he located the stolen car parked with defendant sitting in the driver's seat. The officer observed defendant exit the car and walk behind a set of parked cars. When the officer then detained defendant, he refused to identify himself but stated that he had an identification card in his pants pocket. The officer retrieved a California driver's license from defendant's pocket. Defendant \"didn't necessarily look like the same person\" as depicted on the license. The officer confronted defendant and asked for his real name and defendant responded that his name is David Donald Webb.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After arresting defendant, the officer walked the route that defendant had taken after exiting the stolen car and recovered from beside the parked cars a small box containing 2.129 grams of methamphetamine and a small electronic scale. Video from the citywide surveillance system showed defendant dropping the box out of his pocket as he walked behind the parked cars. During defendant's booking search following his arrest, the officer found in defendant's pocket six personal bank checks in the name of other individuals, intermingled with other personal items. The officer also recovered from defendant two cell phones, one of which contained text messages and emails relating to drug transactions. Finally, a search of defendant's home uncovered additional methamphetamine and indicia of drug sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The jury found defendant guilty as charged and the court found the enhancement allegation to be true. The court denied probation and imposed a five-year sentence consisting of two years in county jail and three years of mandatory supervision. The court imposed, among other fees, a $190 criminal laboratory analysis fee ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11372.5 ), a $570 drug program fee ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11372.7 ) and attorney fees of $500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant timely filed a notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   1. The\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   Rule\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Under the\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   rule, if a general statute includes the same conduct as a special statute, the court infers that the Legislature intended that conduct to be prosecuted exclusively under the special statute. In effect, the special statute is interpreted as creating an exception to the general statute for conduct that otherwise could be prosecuted under either statute. [Citation.] ... [\u00b6] Absent some indication of legislative intent to the contrary, the\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   rule applies when (1) 'each element of the general statute corresponds to an element on the face of the special statute' or (2) when 'it appears from the statutory context that a violation of the special statute will necessarily or commonly result in a violation of the general statute.' [Citation.] In its clearest application, the rule is triggered when a violation of a provision of the special statute would inevitably constitute a violation of the general statute.... [\u00b6] On the other hand, if the more general statute contains an element that is not contained in the special statute and that element would not commonly occur in the context of a violation of the special statute, we do not assume that the Legislature intended to preclude prosecution under the general statute. In such situations, because the general statute contemplates more culpable conduct, it is reasonable to infer that the Legislature intended to punish such conduct more severely.... [\u00b6] However, that the general statute contains an element not within the special statute does not necessarily mean that the\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   rule does not apply. 'It is not correct to assume that the [\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   ] rule is inapplicable whenever the general statute contains an element not found within the four corners of the \"special\" law. Rather, the courts must consider the\n   <em>\n    context\n   </em>\n   in which the statutes are placed. If it appears from the entire context that a violation of the \"special\" statute will necessarily or commonly result in a violation of the \"general\" statute, the\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   rule may apply even though the elements of the general statute are not mirrored on the face of the special statute.' \" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

The defendant willfully obtained someone else's personal identifying information; [\u00b6] 2. The defendant willfully used that information for an unlawful purpose; [\u00b6] AND [\u00b6] 3. The defendant used the information without the consent of the person whose identifying information he was using.\" The jury was further instructed that \"An unlawful purpose includes ... Falsely representing or identifying one's self as another person to a peace officer, upon a lawful detention, to evade the proper identification of himself. [\u00b6] or [\u00b6] Giving information to a peace officer, who is performing his duties under the vehicle code, when he knows the information is false.\" Defendant concedes that not every violation of section 148.9 or Vehicle Code section 31 results in a violation of section 530.5, subdivision (a) but argues that the rule applies in this instance because the manner in which he violated section 148.9 and Vehicle Code section 31 would commonly result in a violation of section 530.5. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Providing false personal identification information to a police officer would, as defendant argues, necessarily establish a violation of the two misdemeanor statutes. That act would not be sufficient, however, to support a conviction for identity theft. To establish a violation of section 530.5 the prosecution must also prove that defendant obtained and used the personal identification information without the consent of the person whose identifying information he was using. We see no basis to assume, as defendant suggests, that false identification provided to a police officer is commonly information willfully obtained from another person and used without consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As argued by the Attorney General, section 148.9, subdivision (a), and Vehicle Code section 31\"do not even contemplate the existence of individual victims. These statutes are merely designed to help law enforcement to locate a defendant if he or she does not appear in court, and to ensure proper enforcement of the Vehicle Code.\" Section 530.5, in contrast, \"is designed to protect the public from the uniquely disruptive and pernicious effect of identity theft in the era of ubiquitous electronic transactions.\" Accordingly, the additional requirement that personal identification information be obtained from another person and used without that person's consent is significant, strongly suggesting that the Legislature intended to punish one who uses false personal identification information taken from another without consent more severely than one who merely fibs to an officer about his or her name. Because a violation of section 148.9 would not necessarily or commonly\n   result in a violation of section 530.5, the\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   rule does not apply and trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance by failing to move to dismiss the identity theft charge on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Penalty Assessments on Health and Safety Code Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court imposed a criminal laboratory analysis fee under Health and Safety Code section 11372.5, subdivision (a) and a drug program fee under Health and Safety Code section 11372.7, subdivision (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also imposed\n   various penalty assessments on those fees, resulting in total criminal laboratory analysis fees of $190 and drug program fees of $570. Defendant contends the court erred by applying the additional penalty assessments to the Health and Safety Code fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Penalty assessment are monetary charges which, \"when applicable, inflate the total sum imposed on the defendant by increasing certain charges by percentage increments. All current penalty assessments are legislatively expressed as a certain dollar amount 'for every ten dollars ($10), or part of ($10),' for the particular fine, penalty, or forfeiture that is subject to the assessments. [Citation.] Thus, for example, if the base fine is $100 and the penalty assessment is $2 for every $10 imposed, the penalty assessment increases the defendant's base fine by $20, or 20 percent. If the same penalty assessment is imposed on a base fine of $105, the penalty assessment is $22, and the percentage increase is slightly more than 20 percent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Watts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 2 Cal.App.5th at p. 228,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20202\">\n    206 Cal.Rptr.3d 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Penalty assessments imposed under the Penal and Government Codes mandate additional assessments upon every \"fine, penalty, or forfeiture\" imposed in a criminal case. (See, e.g., Pen. Code, \u00a7 1464, subd. (a)(1) [\"[T]here shall be levied a state penalty in the amount of ten dollars ($10) for every ten dollars ($10), or part of ten dollars ($10), upon every fine, penalty, or forfeiture imposed and collected by the courts for all criminal offenses.\"]; Gov.

Penalty assessments are not applicable to monetary charges, usually referred to as fees, intended to cover a particular governmental program or administrative cost.

Importantly, unlike penalty assessments which also generate funds for court\n   services, the court security fee is a relative small flat fee and not a percentage of the total fine imposed on a defendant.

Health and Safety Code section 11372.5, subdivision (b) expressly provides in part that \"The county treasurer shall maintain a criminalistics laboratories fund\" into which the criminal laboratory analysis fee shall be deposited and that the \"county may retain an amount of this money equal to its administrative cost incurred pursuant to this section. Moneys in the criminalistics laboratories fund shall, except as otherwise provided in this section, be used exclusively to fund (1) costs incurred by criminalistics laboratories providing microscopic and chemical analyses for controlled substances, in connection with criminal investigations, ... (2) the purchase and maintenance of equipment for use by these laboratories in performing the analyses; and (3) for continuing education, training, and scientific development of forensic scientists regularly employed by these laboratories.\" Contrary to the decision in\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , we do not believe that the statute serves a \"dual purpose\" merely because it also provides for deposit of any residual funds in the state General Fund-as is typically required of excess moneys in other public funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We reach a similar conclusion with regard to the drug program fee. Health and Safety Code section 11372.7, subdivision (c) directs that funds collected in connection with the drug program fee be deposited into a drug program fund which \"shall be allocated by the administrator of the county's drug program to drug abuse programs in the schools and the community, subject to the approval of the board of supervisors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Funding community drug abuse prevention programs is a non-punitive, administrative purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   , neither of the fees is tethered to the seriousness of defendant's criminal conduct. The criminal laboratory analysis fee is a fixed $50. The drug program fee may not exceed $150 and the sliding scale is based not on severity of the offense but on the defendant's ability to pay. Neither fee is sufficiently great to serve as a deterrent.

In response to defendant's request that the fees be waived based on his indigent status, the court explained that attorney fees are \"not one of the discretionary fines and fees, so the court would not be willing to waive.\" Although phrased as a request to \"waive\" the fees, trial counsel's objection must be understood as asserting an objection based on defendant's inability to pay attorney fees. On appeal, defendant clearly asserts that he is indigent and contends that the trial court \"was wrong that it did not have discretion not to impose the attorney's fees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Attorney General argues that a trial court \"has no authority to simply waive attorney's fees for a defendant with the ability to pay.\" While that may be correct, the court did not find that defendant has the ability to pay the attorney fees. Rather, the court concluded that it was compelled to impose the fees on defendant, apparently without regard to his ability to pay them. The probation report contains little information about defendant's ability to pay attorney fees, indicating that he is a 33 year old man without a high school diploma who has spent the last 15 years of his life either detained or on parole or probation.
