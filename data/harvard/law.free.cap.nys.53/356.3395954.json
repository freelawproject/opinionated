This seems untenable. It is alleged that the defendant, on March 26, 1898, \u201cbrutally beat this plaintiff about the head and face.\u201d It is further alleged that defendant has absented himself from his home since May 16, 1898; that he has failed to furnish plaintiff with the necessaries of life; and that his entire course of conduct towards her prior to the abandonment was so brutal as to undermine her health. Whatever the proof, these allegations are sufficient. It may be that a single instance of cruelty is not of itself enough to justify a suit for a separation (Solomon v. Solomon, 28 How. Prac. 218); but, taken in connection with the other averments here, the beating alleged is sufficient. The general ill treatment is alleged to have been sufficient to impair the plaintiff\u2019s health, and so comes up to the legal requirements. Perry v. Perry, 2 Paige, 601. The allegations of the complaint are supported by the verified averments of the petition, which are corroborated by the affidavit of the petitioner\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">The plaintiff\u2019s allegations are denied by the defendant\u2019s affidavits; but a fair question seems to have been presented for the exercise of the discretion of the special term, which should not be disturbed. The order should consequently be affirmed, with \u00a710 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
