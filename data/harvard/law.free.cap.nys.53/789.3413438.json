It is claimed that such jurisdiction is conferred upon us under the provisions of chapter 748 of the Laws of 1896. That statute, however, seems to authorize an appeal only from two classes of orders, viz.: First, from orders opening default and setting aside, vacating, or modifying judgments entered upon such defaults; second, from \u25a0orders granting motions for a new trial, made for the causes specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>in section 999 of the Code of- Civil Procedure, The order in question does not come under either class. There was no default, and it has-been held that a motion for a new trial, under section 999 of the Code, cannot be entertained on the ground of surprise (Argali v. Jacobs, 56 How. Prac. 167, affirmed <em>21 </em>Hun, 114), nor can such a motion be made under that section on the ground of newly-discovered evidence. 'In this view of the law, we therefore feel constrained to dismiss the-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Appeal dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
