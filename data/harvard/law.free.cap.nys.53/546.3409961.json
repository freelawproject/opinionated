The answer is a general denial. The evidence showed that the defendants conducted an express business under the name and style of .the New York Despatch &amp; Delivery Company. The plaintiff testified that he delivered to an expressman in charge of an express-wagon bearing the name of the New York Despatch &amp; Delivery Company three packages of goods, to be delivered, respectively, toR. Goldsmith, S. Levine, and Bernstein; that the package consigned to Bernstein - was delivered; that the package containing clothing-valued at the sum of $136, and consigned to Levine, and the package-containing clothing valued at $136, and consigned to Goldsmith, were not delivered; that the express wagon was the one which-called at plaintiff\u2019s place every night for the goods to be delivered; that he always used defendants\u2019 company to ship goods to Brooklyn; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>that, at the time of the delivery of the goods to the expressman, the expressman signed a receipt on a form used by the Hew York Despatch &amp; Delivery Company; that, immediately after discovering the loss of. the package consigned to Goldsmith, plaintiff notified the defendants, and left with them the receipt he received at the time he made a delivery of the goods to the expressman; and that, 30 days afterwards, he again.notified the defendants\u2019 company that he had then discovered the loss of the package consigned to Levine. The defendants testified that only two of their employ\u00e9s, namely, Rush and Bennett (both of whom testified that they had not received the lost goods), had charge of the route in which the plaintiff- resided; but it appeared on cross-examination of the witness Bennett that another man was also in the employ of the defendants\u2019 company, who had also signed receipts fqr shipment of goods he received from plaintiff for delivery by the defendants\u2019 company. The defendant Van Horn testified that he received all the goods that came in the office, and kept all the records of such goods, and that he had never received nor recorded the goods in question; and other testimony was given with the view of showing that the goods were never delivered to nor received by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, a motion to dismiss the complaint was made. It was properly denied, because, taking the evidence in its most favorable aspect for the plaintiff, and conceding him all the inferences of its legal import, it was impossible to say that the jury would not have been justified in finding for the plaintiff. Besides, the motion to dismiss the complaint was not renewed at the close of the entire case. There was no motion made for a direction, nor were there any exceptions taken to the charge of the trial justice, nor were any requests to charge submitted to him by the counsel for the. defendants. There was therefore an unequivocal concession on his part that there was a question of fact in the case, which should be passed upon by the jury, and that there was some evidence tending to support the respondent\u2019s cause of action.
