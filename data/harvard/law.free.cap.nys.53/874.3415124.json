An assignee is liable only for rent which falls due under the lease after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>the assignment. There can be no recovery against him for rent which became payable before the assignment, even though it was payable in advance for a period within which the assignment was made. McAdam, Eandl. &amp; Ten. p. 283. It appears from the record that, if there was any assignment at all, it was made after the due date of the rent in question. Consequently, the defendant was not liable for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
