On that day the plaintiff attended at the court, prepared to try the case, when defendant\u2019s attorney asked for another adjournment. The court refused the request, and an inquest was taken. Subsequently defendant moved to open the default, which motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>was granted, upon reasonable terms, with which defendant never complied, nor did it appeal from the order opening the default. It did appeal, however, from the original order denying the motion for an adjournment and also from the judgment rendered on the default. It is our opinion that, under the circumstances disclosed, the trial court was fully warranted in denying the application, and in rendering judgment on defendant\u2019s default.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
