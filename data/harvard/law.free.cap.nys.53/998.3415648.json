Had. judgment been recovered against the property, the sureties might have been concluded, for such is the condition of their covenant. Ringle v. O\u2019Matthiessen (Sup.) 39 N. Y. Supp. 92, 94; Thomas v. Hubbell, 15 N. Y. 405. But the effort is to defeat such judgment, and sureties may avail of any defense that was open to their principal. 1 Wait, Act. &amp; Def. 700. They are not to be affected by the. admission of the principal. 2 Whart. Ev. -\u00a7 1212. Upon a careful review of the evidence, I am still of the opinion, intimated at the trial, that the plaintiffs have failed to establish thq, alleged oral agreement of October 1, 1891. I conclude further that the contractors Rid not delay the work, and so are not responsible for plaintiffs\u2019 increased expense in the hire of laborers. It results, therefore, that the amount of plaintiffs\u2019 claim in the notice of lien is enormously exaggerated, and that this was done intentionally, by pretense of a fictitious contract, for the purpose of enforcing a false and fabricated demand. Hence the case is controlled by Goodrich v. Gillies, 66 Hun, 422, 21 N. Y. Su'pp.'400, with which nothing in Ringle v. Iron Works, 149 N. Y. 439, 44 N. E. 175, is observed to conflict.
