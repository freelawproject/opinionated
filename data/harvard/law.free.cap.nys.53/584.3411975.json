The assignment was absolute and unconditional in form, and contained a covenant on Miller\u2019s part by which he assumed the payment of the debts of the co-partnership in exoneration of Mrs. Wise. The claim now advanced, that there was a collateral oral agreement that the property thus conveyed was to be held by Miller as a sort of trust fund with which to discharge such debts, is fully met by the opposing affidavits, which I prefer to credit, among other reasons, because, on a consideration of the surrounding facts and circumstances, and the general arrangement of which the transfer was a part, it is improbable that any such agreement would have been made. I have no doubt whatever that the money which Miller used in paying the creditors of Wise &amp; Miller, pursuant to the composition made with them, was lent to him by his uncle, the defendant Darling, in entire good faith. He had a right to secure his uncle as he did. In so doing he was not using the property of Wise &amp; Miller to discharge his individual debt. The property was his own, conveyed to him with the knowledge and assent of the plaintiff, who then stood in no better position towards it than any other creditor Miller might have. I fa-il to discover any adequate proof of fraud in the transfer made to Darling, or any equity in favor of the plaintiff at all superior to his. The allegation that the defendant Darling is insolvent or pecuniarily irresponsible is fully met by the answering affidavits. I am of the opinion, after a careful examination of all the papers, that the injunction should not be continued. Some of the defendants\u2019 affidavits are seriously defective in form, but, as these formal defects have been waived in writing by plaintiff\u2019s attorney, I have concluded to receive them. Motion denied, with ten dollars costs to abide the event, and temporary injunction vacated.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b612-13\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.
