The executors were next directed to convert testator\u2019s property, \u201cexcepting that part hereinbefore appropriated,\u201d into money, and divide the same between named legatees. The next clause provided that, in the event of remarriage of the widow, the principal of the sums-set apart to raise her annuity and the charges on the house should be divided like as before directed between the said named legatees. <em>Held, </em>that the words \u201cexcepting that part hereinbefore appropriated\u201d referred' to the bequests to the servant and to testator\u2019s wife, and not to the funds out of which such bequests were raised; and therefore the will effected a disposition of testator\u2019s entire estate, notwithstanding such construction rendered surplusage the clause providing for disposition in the event of the widow\u2019s remarriage.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b1056-10\">Appeal from special term, Suffolk county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1056-11\">Action by one Meeks against Catherine L.

I hereby nominate, constitute, and appoint my son Albert Victor Meeks and my son Edwin Bartlett Meeks executors of this my last will and testament, and trustees of the several trust estates hereinbefore created; and I hereby expressly authorize and empower them, until the sale and distribution of my estate as herein provided, to collect and receive the rents and profits of my real estate, except the portion thereof reserved and devised to my said wife during her natural life, or until her interest therein terminates, pursuant to the conditions thereto annexed. It is my wish that my son Albert V. Meeks should have the principal management of my estate, and that my other executor should not interfere with him so long as he shall be able to attend to the said management. When he ceases to act, then the other party named shall take the management. And, should either of my said trustees die, the said trust estates, trusts, and powers shall vest in the survivor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1058-8\">In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and affixed my seal, this sixteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven. . Joseph W. Meeks. [L. S.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1058-9\">The following is the opinion of the court below (BROWN\", J.):</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1058-10\">The proper construction of the will of Joseph W. Meeks, deceased, depends upon the meaning of the words in the fifth clause, \u201cexcepting that part hereinbefore appropriated.\u201d If by that expression the testator intended to refer to the corpus of the funds that were directed to be set apart by the second and fourth clauses of the will, then there is no disposal of those funds by the fifth clause, and their disposition is to be governed by the statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>distribution. The expression referred to should be given such meaning as will effectuate the general intention of the testator in the disposal of his estate, if such intent can be ascertained from a reading of the whole will. That the testator intended to dispose of his whole estate, and not to leave any of it to be distributed under the statute to the next of kin, I think is clear. The objects of his bounty were to be his wife, children, and grandchildren. The whole estate was to be given to them. If the widow remarried, the fund directed to be set apart in the fourth clause was to be divided and distributed in the same manner and to the same persons as he had directed as to his other property in the fifth clause. It is exceedingly improbable that the testator intended to provide for the disposition on the contingency of his widow\u2019s remarriage, an event unlikely to occur, and intended that, in the probable contingency of her dying as his widow, the fund should be distributed under the statute. It would require very plain language to lead the court to that conclusion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1059-5\">Again, the sixth clause does not dispose of the corpus of the fund to be set apart to provide the annuity for Thomas Donnelly. Yet it clearly was the intention of the testator to provide for the disposition of that fund. It is expressly stated that it was to form a part of the residuary estate, and to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the residuary clause of the will. Likewise, he provides that the Mount Vernon house is to form a part of the residuary estate, and be disposed of \u201cas hereinafter directed and provided.\u201d In the fifth clause he provides that, until the conversion of his estate into money and the division made as provided, it is his will that his children receive the income of the whole estate, share and share alike, subject to the special bequests. His widow might have died shortly following his own death, in which case the income bequeathed to her would have gone to the children under the will, and not under the statute. Donnelly might have died before the fund was set apart to produce his annuity, in which case the income thereon would have gone to the children under the will. All these provisions indicate an intention on the testator\u2019s part to dispose of his whole estate for the benefit of his wife and children and his old servant Donnelly. He speaks of a residuary clause of his will, and he referred by that term to the fifth clause. If the expression \u201cexcepting that part herein-before appropriated\" be held to have relation to the bequests to Donnelly, to his widow, and to his executors, and not to the corpus of the fund set aside for them, the instrument is made consistent and harmonious with his intention. All his property is then to be divided. There is nothing in the instrument making necessary a division of the whole estate at once. That portion which would be set apart to provide the Donnelly annuity and the widow\u2019s annuity and the executors\u2019 compensation vested immediately in persons named in the fifth, clause, subject to the interests of Donnelly and the widow and the executors; and the actual division would be made by the executors on the deaths of the life tenants. This construction of the will may make surplusage of the sixth clause, but that is not an obstacle to the conclusion I have reached.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1059-6\">The cardinal rule of construction of all instruments of this character is that the intent of a testator must be sought for in the provisions of the wjll, and, when it is ascertained, effectuated, if the language used permits. The court may transpose words and phrases, and read the provisions of the instrument in a different order from that in which they appear, and insert and leave out provisions if necessary. And, when susceptible of it, that construction will' be given which renders the instrument operative, rather than invalid; and an interpretation that will produce intestacy as to any part of the estate is to be avoided if possible. Hoppock v. Tucker, 59 N. Y. 203; Phillips v. Davies, 92 N. Y. 199; Du Bois v, Bay, 35 N. Y. 162. It may not have seemed to the testator that it was \u2018unnecessary to insert the sixth clause, and it does no violence to the instrument to hold that that was a useless provision. On the contrary, its presence in the will has no necessary tendency to show that the testator intended in the case of his wife\u2019s death to leave the fund undisposed of, while its rejection renders the will complete and harmonious.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1060-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>My conclusion is that the testator, by his will, disposed of his whole estate, and that the funds set apart by the second and fourth clauses of the will are a part of the residuary estate, and are disposed of by the fifth clause. Findings and decree may be prepared and submitted to the court on notice to all parties.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1060-5\">Argued before GOODRICH, P.
