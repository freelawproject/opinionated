Wilmerding v. Jarmulowsky, 85 Hun, 285, 32 N. T. Supp. 983. The burden of proof in this \u00a1regard rests upon the plaintiffs. The defendant denies any such notice, and also knowledge of the circumstances on which the plaintiffs rely to establish guilty participation in the fraud. The plaintiffs chiefly depend upon the \u2022evidence of the fraudulent debtor and grantor; but, without going into detail, it is enough to say that, after a careful consideration of his testimony, I -entertain such doubt with respect to his credibility as a witness that I am unwilling to give his evidence as great weight as that of the defendant, whose statements are not inconsistent with any conceded fact proven in the \u25a0case. Indeed, the dealings of the defendant with the property after the conveyance, especially the expenditure by him of some $13,000 upon it, to which \u25a0attention is called in the opinion of the general term, tends to support his claim of good faith in the matter. While there may be suspicion of the bona -tides of the transactions, that is not enough on which to rest a judgment. The plaintiffs are bound to make out their case by a clear preponderance of credible proof,\u2014a burden which, I think, they have failed to sustain. The \u25a0complaint must therefore be dismissed, with costs.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b611-11\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.
