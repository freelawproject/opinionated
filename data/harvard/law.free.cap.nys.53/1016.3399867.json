There is no dispute about the facts. The charge was simply that the relator, in good faith and upon a legal claim, exercised his statutory right to file a mechanic\u2019s lien upon the property of an associate member. Conceding the merits of the relator\u2019s claim, and refusing to inquire into the merits, the committee of this association presumed to declare the relator a subject for suspension because he had not first sought to arbitrate. The sufficient answer to this is that the rules do not compel him to arbitrate. This act of the relator did not tend to injure the standing or credit of the organization. Before an association can assume to discipline a member for exercising a legal right, it must make it plain by its by-laws that such exercise will subject the member to the penalty sought to be imposed. This was an unauthorized and arbitrary proceeding. Let the peremptory writ of mandamus prayed for issue, and the relator is awarded 850 costs, together with his disbursements, to be taxed.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1045-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>Argued before BARRETT, RUMSEY, O\u2019BRIEN, and McLAUGHLTN, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1045-5\">R.
