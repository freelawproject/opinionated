For the defendant it was claimed that the indorsement was procured for the purpose of enabling the plaintiff to have the note discounted, and upon an agreement that the plaintiff wnuld not hold the defendant, or enforce any liability, by reason of such indorsement. The conflict in the evidence was submitted to the jury, fairly and impartially, by the learned trial justice, and the jury found for the plaintiff, and that verdict is sustained by a fair preponderance of evidence. No claim was made that the defendant Alice Theiss had received any consideration for her indorsement; that indorsement having been procured.for the purpose of enabling George Theiss to obtain a credit with the plaintiff. It follows that the objection to the question whether this defendant received any consideration for the indorsement was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">We think that the case was properly disposed of below, and that the judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-14\">SCHUCHMAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
