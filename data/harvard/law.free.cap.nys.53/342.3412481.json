Since that time, the plaintiffs have continued to manufacture and sell the- game, put up in a box upon which the colored label is affixed; and, as the result of advertising, it has \u201cobtained quite a reputation as one of plaintiffs\u2019 best games.\u201d The defendant Jasper H. Singer began to make an article, and put it up with a label on boxes containing it, some time just prior to 1897, when, having made an assignment for the benefit of creditors, the business was subsequently bought in and conducted by his wife, the other defendant, Jane C. Singer, under the superintendence of her husband. The similarity in the two labels is apparent on the barest inspection; and we do not understand that the fact that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>are similar is at all in dispute. The position taken by the defendants is stated in the affidavit of one of them in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">\u201cI am advised and believe that plaintiffs might possibly have obtained a copyright upon the design contained upon the box cover, provided the same involved any originality; but the very fact that they did not obtain a copyright for such design is an abandonment and dedication to the publ.c of such design; and therefore I have a perfect right to copy it literally, if X see fit so to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">This position is emphasized by the counsel for the respondents, who insists that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">\u201cAfter the publication of this new game and new design, everybody had the right to publish the same game and the same picture, unless by so doing he infringed upon plaintiffs\u2019 trade-marks, provided they had any, or the sale by such other person was an unfair competition in trade.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The latter statement, of course, is a modification of the broad proposition that the defendants had a right to appropriate, not alone the game, but also the label by which it had been advertised and become known to the public. The concession, however, that unfair competition in trade may be enjoined, we think, is sufficient, with the other facts appearing, to justify the court in awarding an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">We have the statement presented by one Kallenbach, who has been familiar with such nlatters for 30 years, that the game prepared and sold by the defendants under the name of \u201cMessenger Boy\u201d is inferior to the plaintiffs\u2019, and that the sale of such imitation game will greatly injure the reputation of the plaintiffs\u2019 Messenger Boy game, and result in decrease of the sale of the plaintiffs\u2019 game. Without discussing the moral standard which the defendants set up, of their right to take advantage of the plaintiffs\u2019 ideas in originating the game and advertising so as to create a demand, or their right to get some advantage from the trade and demand thus created, and to reap a profit from selling an inferior imitated article, we shall confin\u00e9 ourselves, assuming the defendants have such right, to the real point in this case, as to whether, upon such sale, they can also make use of a similar label to the one employed by the plaintiffs. Not only do the affidavits show, but there is no denial, that the defendants\u2019 label is an intentional imitation of the plaintiffs, and on its face has a tendency to mislead persons to mistake it for the original label on the plaintiffs\u2019 goods. This imitation or similarity of the two labels is apparent throughout. Thus, from the top to the bottom, whether we take the coloring, rainbow shape, proportion of circle at the top, or the picture of buildings in the background and a messenger boy in front, or the figure and position of the boy, and the arrangement of the border at the base, the two labels are substantially the same; and that they were not exactly the same could only be determined by close inspection. In the right-hand corner the cards have different printed matter upon them; but the branch of leaves and flowers is copied down to the very number of flowers, there being the same number on each.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>It is suggested that the failure to show that persons were actually deceived is fatal to the plaintiffs\u2019 right to relief by injunction. This contention, however, is disposed of by the case of Taendsticksfabriks Aktiebolagat Vulcan v. Myers, 139 N. Y. 367, 34 N. E. 904, wherein it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">\u201cNo evidence is given or offered to show that any person had actually been deceived by the imitation of the plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark, and we think that none was necessary for' the maintenance of the action. It is the liability to deception which the remedy may be invoked to prevent. It is sufficient if injury to the plaintiff\u2019s business is threatened or imminent to authorize the court to intervene to prevent its occurrence. The owner is not required to wait until the wrongful use of his trade-mark has been continued for such a length of time as to cause some substantial pecuniary loss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u2022 The motion was denied in the court below, for the reason tnat it was thought that the label was merely descriptive of the article sold. We think that in this the learned court fell into error. It may be that the name \u201cDistrict Messenger Boy,\u201d separated from the label, might give some idea of what the game was about, it appearing when examined that it deals with the career of a messenger boy; but, even if.this could be held to be descriptive of the game,\u2014and we do not think it can,\u2014what connection has it with the conceded simulation of the coloring, the rainbow half-circle at the top, the branch of flowers at the bottom, or the style and shading of the figures and letters, as relating to the description of the article? Certainly, the figure of the boy .running is not descriptive, there being no contention that there is a running boy in the box, or any rainbow or bunch of flowers therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Equally without force is the contention that the plaintiffs are entitled to no relief because they have not shown that the label used was their trade-mark. One has the right to adopt a label in the sale of goods, and even though it does not amount, strictly speaking, to a trade-mark, this does not permit another to enter into an unfair competition with him in his business by getting up a. similar article (here unquestionably inferior), and placing it in packages, so alike that the public are liable to be deceived, and thus palming it off on the unwary, to the detriment of the originator. We do not think, however, that this subject requires further elaboration, it being fully covered by the decision of this court in Day v. Webster, 23 App. Div. 602, 49 N. Y. Supp. 314, in which the very question here presented as to the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, and as to the effect of failure to show that others had been deceived, was considered, and the further question also discussed as to the cases where it is necessary to produce evidence, of similarity. It was therein said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\u201cWhat they claim, therefore, is, in substance, unfair competition; that is, that the defendants are fraudulently attempting to pass off their goods as the goods of the plaintiffs. The question thus is, have the plaintiffs proved this charge of fraud? In the case of a technical trade-mark to which the plaintiff shows a property right, fraud is not the essence of the claim. That property right may be infringed unintentionally as well as fraudulently, and the innocent infringement will be restrained irrespective of the question of intention. Not so, however, where the question is solely one of unfair competition. There, fraud is the essence of the claim. It is true that the similarity of the wrongdoer\u2019s label may be so great that fraud will be inferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>from a mere inspection of the respective labels. Where, however, the similarity is not so great as, upon a mere inspection, to warrant the conclusion of fraud, resort may be, and usually is, had to evidence aliunde.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In the case at bar, the similarity between the two labels, as stated, appears upon the barest inspection, and is not seriously disputed; the position of the defendants being, as shown, that having a right to manufacture the game, because it was dedicated to the public by the plaintiffs when they made it and put it upon the market without having it protected by a trade-mark, the defendants have the further right to appropriate the label adopted by the plaintiffs, and placed upon the box containing the game when ready for sale. The practice is not to grant preliminary injunctions except in very clear cases; but the present, we think, clearly falls within the exception, for little could be added upon the trial to the showing made by the plaintiffs as to the palpable imitation of their label, or to the facts showing unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">We think, therefore, that the order below was wrong, and should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs to abide the event. All concur, except McLAUGHLIN, J., dissenting.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b373-7\">BAEEETT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ate\">I agree with Mr. Justice McLAUGHLIN that ordinarily it must be shown in this class of cases\u2014that is, in cases of unfair competition\u2014that the resemblance of the labels is not only calculated to, but does in fact, deceive. The defendants\u2019 label here, however, is not merely calculated to\u2014it cannot fail\u2014 to deceive. The resemblance to the plaintiffs\u2019 label is too striking to call for proof of actual deception. The defendants\u2019 label is, in fact, ostentatiously similar to the plaintiffs\u2019, and flagrantly fraudulent. Indeed, there is no attempt to defend it except upon the ground that the defendants have a legal right to sell this particular game, and to use this particular device, whether such sale and use effect deception or not. Thus, the bare inspection of these labels proves the plaintiffs\u2019 case, and entitles them to a decree. I therefore concur with Mr. Justice O\u2019BEIEN.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b373-8\">McLAUGHLIN, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"ANR\">The plaintiffs\u2019 right to maintain this action is based on the theory that the use of the label by defendants is an unfair and dishonest competition in trade on their part. In other words, the plaintiffs in effect claim that the defendants, by the use of the label, are fraudulently attempting to sell their goods as the goods of the plaintiffs. To entitle the plaintiffs to recover, they must not only allege in their complaint, but they must prove upon the trial, that the resemblance of the labels is not only calculated to, but that the same does in fact, deceive the ordinary buyer. This is precisely what the court of appeals declared, in Fischer v. Blank, 138 N. Y. 252, 33 N. E. 1040, was necessary to be established to entitle a plaintiff to recover in an action of this character. Judge Maynard, in delivering the opinion of the court in that case, in which all of the judges concurred, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\u201cThe true test, we think, is whether the resemblance is such that it is calculated to deceive, and does in fact deceive, the ordinary buyer making his-purchase under the ordinary conditions which prevail in the conduct of the particular traffic to which the controversy relates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">In the case now before us no proof whatever was presented to the special term that any one had in fact been deceived by the defendants\u2019 use of the label, and we have no right, in the absence of proof, to infer that they will be.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">For this reason, the learned justice at special term was right in denying the motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
