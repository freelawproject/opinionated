Anderson, and on his motion the defendant was interpleaded. From the complaint it appears that one Frederick Hafner (plaintiff\u2019s assignor) had a contract with one William S. Anderson to roof for said Anderson six houses on 106th street, for the sum of $1,800, all of which had been paid except the balance of $350; that, before the commencement of the action, said F. Hafner assigned all his right, title, and interest in said contract to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">The facts according to the findings are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">Frederick Hafner had a contract with William S. Anderson to. do the roofing of six houses on 106th street, New York City; that towards that work the Phillips' Tin-Plate Company furnished material. The contract was $1,800, upon which there was due at the time of the commencement of the action $350. Frederick Hafner owed the Phillips Tin-Plate Company more than $500 on August 18, 1896. The defendant was the agent in the employ of the Phillips Tin-Plate Company, which Frederick Hafner knew. Said Fred- \u25a0 erick Hafner being thus indebted to the Phillips Tin-Plate Company, the defendant, as agent for the said company, called upon said Frederick Hafner on August 1, 1896, and, as such agent, demanded payment from said Frederick Hafner of the amount due said Phillips Tin-Plate Company; and thereupon the said Hafner made, executed, and delivered to defendant, for and on behalf of said Phillips Tin-Plate Company, the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">\u201cNew York, August 1, 1896.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-13\">\u201cMr. William S. Anderson\u2014Dear Sir: Please pay to Mr. Kirby, my tin man,. 8350 out of my payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-14\">\u201cYours, &amp;e., F. Hafner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-15\">\u201cAccepted. W. S. Anderson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-16\">The defendant received said oMer from Frederick Hafner, and. took it to Anderson, upon whom it was drawn; and said Anderson accepted said order, writing thereon, in the presence of the defendant, the words, \u201cAccepted. W. S. Anderson,\u201d and. left the order with said Anderson. The order was given to, and accepted by,. the defendant, on behalf of the Phillips Tin-Plate Company, and in part payment of their bill. The assignment of Frederick Hafner to his wife, the plaintiff, was made on December 14, 1896, four months and fourteen days subsequent to the said order.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-17\">The said order amounted, in law, to an assignment, pro tanto, of the fund due by Anderson to Frederick Hafner under the contract. Lauer v. Dunn, 115 N. Y. 405, 22 N. E. 270; Stevens v. Ogden, 130 N. Y. 182, 29 N. E. 229. The assignment to the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>being subsequent to said order, and assigning all the right, title, and interest of Frederick Hafner, cannot defeat the rights of the defendant acquired as aforesaid by said order. Fairbanks v. Sargent, 104 N. Y. 108, 9 N. E. 870; Fortunato v. Patten, 147 N. Y. 277-283, 41 N. E. 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">OLGOTT, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
