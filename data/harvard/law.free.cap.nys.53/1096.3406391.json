The petition further sets forth that the water commissioners caused a map to be filed in the Clinton county clerk\u2019s office. There is no allegation anywhere that any map or plans were filed in the village clerk\u2019s office, and the proof upon the hearing failed to disclose the making or filing of plans in any office, but did disclose that a map and order were filed in the county clerk\u2019s office on the 2d day of July, and a duplicate of the map in the village clerk\u2019s office on the 7th day of July. We think that, for this omission to comply with the provisions of the statute, the proceedings are irregular, and the petition insufficient to give the court jurisdiction, and for these reasons the proceedings should be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-18\">Order reversed, and proceedings dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-19\">Substantially the same questions are involved in the appeal from the order made in the case of the village of Champlain against Matilda McCrea and Emmett N. Fitch, and the order in that case should therefore also be reversed, and the proceedings dismissed. All concur, except LANDON, J., dissenting.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1124-20\">LANDON, J.. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Ammd\">At the time of the act taking effect July 1,1897, the plaintiff, had the right to file its map and order which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>it had previously made, and thereby complete the steps preliminary to initiating this proceeding in court. Section 31 of the statutory construction act saved to the plaintiff all its existing rights, and therefore the right to file the map and order under the act of 1875. I therefore dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
