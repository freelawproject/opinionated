The property sold was subject to a very onerous incumbrance, of which no notice was given at the sale, as it should have been. Code, \u00a7 1678. The beams, of the building sold rested in the wall of the premises to the west, by virtue of an agreement which, after granting that easement, provided that no building should be erected upon the lot in question here to a greater depth than 45 feet, and that any extension built thereon should be at least eight feet distant from said wall, in which, according to the agreement, the adjoining owner might maintain three rows of windows. The agreement in question was referred to on the sale and in the notice of sale, but its contents were not given nor described. On the contrary, it was described as giving \u201crights, privileges, and easement * * * in the westerly wall of the building adjoining said premises,\u201d whereas the wall to which the agreement referred was the easterly wall of the building adjoining the premises on the west. The westerly wall of the building adjoining the premises to be sold was, of course, the wall of the building east of said premises, and, as that was described in the advertisement of sale as a party wall, intending purchasers might readily infer that the \u201crights, privileges, and easement\u201d in the wall mentioned were such as pertained to a party wall. Under the circumstances, as the plaintiff made an error in the description which was calculated to mislead intending purchasers, the latter ought not to be held to the obligation to examine the agreement thus misdescribed in order to detect possible errors, but must be deemed to be justified in relying upon the accuracy of the description. They were also justified in assuming that, if the agreement in queslion created a charge upon the land, it would be \u201cdeclared at the time of the sale,\u201d as prescribed in the section of the Code above referred to. This is a case, I think, in which the discretion of the court may be invoked to relieve the purchaser. Riggs v. Pursell, 66 N. Y. 199.
