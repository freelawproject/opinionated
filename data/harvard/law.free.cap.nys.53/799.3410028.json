The default of the plaintiffs was taken upon the return of the summons, and the dismissal of the complaint ' could therefore be had without her. pleading thereto. Under these circumstances, it will be assumed that no answer was filed, and that the recitals contained in the last paragraph of the order in question are erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-15\">The trial justice erred in the directions given with respect to the service of an answer by the defendant, and thus assuming to control and limit the defendant in the exercise of the rights which the law conferred upon her on the return day of the summons. She was not in fault, and no conditions should have been imposed upon her. The order appealed from was made on the motion of the plaintiff excusing his default, and should not have gone beyond placing him in the same position he would have occupied had he been present when the case was called, leaving the defendant free to plead by answer or demurrer, or to take such other action, permissible at that time, as she might be advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-16\">For these reasons, the order appealed from should be modified by striking out all directions for the filing of an answer, and the service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>of a copy of the same, and that in lieu thereof there be inserted a provision to the effect that the defendant may plead to the complaint, or take such other action, permissible at that time, as she may be advised, at a time and place to be specified in the order, which is to be settled on notice; and, as thus modified, the order in question should be affirmed, with costs to appellant to abide the event of the action.
