Warren Travers is the nominee of the Conservative Party for such office. We conclude that the petitioner on the present record has not met the burden of Showing the probability that a new election would produce a different result <em>(Matter of IppoKto </em>v. <em>Power, </em>22 N Y 2d 594, 597-598). Judgment affirmed, without costs. Herlihy, P. J., Sweeney,. Main and Reynolds, JJ., concur; Kane, J., dissents and votes to reverse in the following memorandum. Kane, J. (dissenting). I would reverse and direct a new election. Evidence as to how an eligible voter easts his ballot in a primary election in inadmissible in a proceeding under subdivision 2 of section 330 of the Election Law. Therefore, since the irregular votes cannot be counted, it is impossible to determine the result of this election. Furthermore, since the probability has been established that a new election could produce a different result, a new election is required. <em>(Matter of De Martini </em>v. <em>Power, </em>27 N Y 2d 149; <em>Matter of Creedon, </em>264 N. Y. 40; <em>Matter of Dayton </em>v. <em>Board of Elections of Albany County, </em>40 AD 2d 616.)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
