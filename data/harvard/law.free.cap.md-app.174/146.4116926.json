Bereano appeals the judgment of the Circuit Court for Howard County, affirming the finding of the State Ethics Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) that Bereano knowingly and willingly violated Maryland Code (1984, 2004 RepLVol.), \u00a7 15-713(1) of the State Government Article (\u201cS.G.\u201d) by being engaged for lobbying purposes for compensation that was contingent upon executive or legislative action. Premised upon its finding that Bereano knowingly and willfully violated S.G. \u00a7 15-713(1), the Commission, acting pursuant to its newly conferred authority under S.G. \u00a7 15-405(e), reprimanded Bereano, suspended his lobbying registrations for a period of ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>months, prohibited him from engaging in lobbying activity for ten months, imposed a $5,000 f\u00edne, and required him to submit to the Commission for a period of three years copies of all fee agreements for lobbying activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Bereano presents four questions for our review, which we have slightly reworded as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">I. Was the Commission\u2019s decision that Bereano knowingly and willfully violated S.G. \u00a7 15-713 supported by substantial evidence on the record?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">II. In sanctioning Bereano for his violations of S.G. \u00a7 15-713(1), did the Commission apply S.G. \u00a7 15-405 retroactively?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">III. Did the Commission err in applying the \u201cmissing witness rule\u201d and in concluding that a witness Bereano did not call to testify before the Commission would not have supported Bereano\u2019s testimony?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">IV. Does S.G. \u00a7 15-713(1), which prohibits registered lobbyists from engaging in lobbying activity for compensation that is contingent upon legislative and executive action, constitute an unconstitutional restraint on free speech or the right to petition the government for redress of grievances in violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Chapter 15, Subtitle 7 of the State Government Article regulates lobbying activity. Section 15-713 of that Article, which was enacted by the 631st Act of the 2001 Session and became effective on November 1, 2001,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> prohibits activities of regulated lobbyists. It provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">A regulated lobbyist may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">(1) be engaged for lobbying purposes for compensation that is dependent in any manner on:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">(i) the enactment or defeat of legislation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">(ii) the outcome of any executive action relating to the solicitation or securing of a procurement contract; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">(iii) any other contingency related to executive action or legislative action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">Bereano, formerly an administrative assistant and legal counsel to the Office of the Senate President, has been a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>lobbyist registered with the Commission since its creation in 1979. In September 2001, he contracted with Michael Tra\u00edna, founder of the Mercer Group, Inc., parent company of Social Work Associates, Inc. (collectively \u201cMercer\u201d), to provide lobbying, political consulting, and contract development services.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">In a letter dated September 1, 2001, Bereano proposed a fee agreement for his services, the terms of which were accepted by Mercer on September 13, 2001 (the \u201cFee Agreement\u201d). The Fee Agreement provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">Following up our discussions, I write this letter to present a fee proposal to you concerning your new business venture, Mercer Venture, Inc., d/b/a Social Work Associates, Inc. (hereafter referred to as Mercer Ventures). I propose to represent Mercer Ventures in the State of Maryland in a lobbying, political consulting, and strategy development capacity relative to the Company\u2019s plans to develop and obtain contracts and arrangements with various county, municipal, and State government agencies and departments in order to provide and perform on a privatized basis staffing agencies and case management functions. In addition, I would be willing and able to assist your company with any business development and activities in other states and jurisdictions outside of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">I propose commencing the month of September 1, 2001, a monthly retainer fee of $2,000.00 plus reimbursement for any necessary and reasonable expenses such as postage, duplicating costs, long distance telephone calls, mileage, fax expense, and legislative meals and entertainment. Any significant or unusual expenses would have to be approved and authorized by you before being incurred. These fees and expenses would be paid and continue on a regular basis once your company attains a financial cash flow, and ability to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">The nature and scope of my services for the monthly retainer would include and encompass performing lobbying services, giving advice, consultation, strategy and be a resource concerning legislative and political and government matters at both the State and local levels, attending and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>participating in all necessary and required meetings, monitoring and watchdogging on behalf of the Company, and providing information to your companies as to matters of concern and importance with its work and relationships with the State of Maryland, as well as any political subdivision in the State and generally performing any and all other such similar and related services and activities as you may request of me. In this regard, I also would register as a lobbyist and fully comply and conform with the State\u2019s applicable law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">It is further understood and agreed that in addition to and separate and apart from payment of the aforementioned monthly fee retainer fee and any further increase thereof, Mercer Ventures will compensate me one percent (1%) of the first year receivable for continuing representation and services be <em>[sic] </em>performed, provided, and made available when and after each separate facility and/or site or location that is opened in which I was involved in securing and participated in obtaining, and/or any contract and performance of services which is entered into by your company with any government entity, unit or agency in the State of Maryland or any other state or jurisdiction in which I worked on the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">As to and concerning any private contracts and business which I assist and help on obtaining for your company it is understood and agreed upon that separate from and in addition to any monthly fee arrangement as set forth herein I also will receive and be paid a monthly agreed upon bonus and reward for such private contract or business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">It is understood that this relationship and fee arrangement can be renegotiated and changed at any time by mutual agreement of the parties as they develop and experience this work relationship, and that except for the provision and understanding herein to compensate me when and after any contract is entered into a government unit, Mercer Ventures can terminate the same monthly fee relationship at the Company\u2019s discretion at any time after giving thirty days prior written notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>On November 13, 2001, Bereano filed a lobbying registration form with the Commission, declaring, under oath, his intention to perform executive and legislative action lobbying on behalf of Social Work Associates, a subsidiary of Mercer. Bereano indicated that the effective date for lobbying on behalf of Social Work Associates for \u201cany and all legislative and executive matters concerning staffing and case management foster care, children and social services issues\u201d was November 1, 2001 to October 31,2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Later, on December 1, 2001, Bereano sent an invoice to Mercer requesting a $2,000 retainer for the months of September, October, November, and December. He also requested payment for expenses that included long distance phone calls, mileage, duplicating, and $393.34 in \u201cLegislative Meals [and] Expenses.\u201d Again, in an invoice dated January 16, 2002, Bereano requested payment in the amount of $24,000 for \u201cprofessional [s]ervices [r]endered,\u201d and a $2,000 retainer for January. He also sought reimbursement for expenses, including $454.39 in \u201clegislative meals and expenses.\u201d Bereano sent similar invoices to Mercer billing for his monthly retainer fee and seeking reimbursement of \u201clegislative expenses,\u201d meals and entertainment, mileage, duplicating, and long distance telephone calls on February 6, 2002, March 1, 2002, April 1, 2002, May 1, 2002, and June 1, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Tra\u00edna sent Bereano a letter dated May 17, 2002, detailing Mercer\u2019s recent projects. The letter was accompanied by an \u201cOrganizational Capability\u201d statement, listing among Mercer\u2019s \u201cmajor clients\u201d the following State Agencies: the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services; the Department of Assessments and Taxation; the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; the Department of Business and Economic Development; and the Department of Human Resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Approximately one month later, in a letter dated June 12, 2002, Tra\u00edna stated the following with regard to the Fee Agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">Following our recent conversation, I understand someone from the <em>Baltimore Sun </em>has reviewed our letter agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>from September 2001 and has misinterpreted part of the letter stating that he believes that it contains a \u201ccontingency agreement.\u201d As you and I are aware, the intention of any portion of the fee agreement was not a contingency fee, but instead additional compensation for ongoing services that we were going to budget at 1%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">Clearly, this was not a contingency arrangement because you were to be paid additional compensation for additional services that would be required under any new contract. You would not have been paid if you did not provide additional services. You would not have been paid for winning the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">Despite the misinterpretation by the <em>Baltimore Sun, </em>I think it would be prudent to amend our contract to ensure that the contract isn\u2019t misinterpreted in the future and to be sure that it is in compliance with all Maryland State Regulations. I would like to replace the entire paragraph in which the language <em>\u201c1% </em>of the first year receivable for continuing representation and services to be performed, provided and made available\u201d is mentioned to instead include the following \u201c[f]rom time to time, Mr. Bereano\u2019s compensation will be reviewed and adjusted based on the size of the company at the time and scope of services required by Mr. Bereano.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">I would also appreciate if you would correct the apparent error regarding compensation received from Mercer Ventures, Inc., which was reported to the State Ethics Commission.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">I think it is a good time to amend this contract in that we have not successfully bid on any government contracts and the alleged \u201ccontingent fee agreement\u201d discussed herein was never utilized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">After receiving Traina\u2019s June 12 letter, the language providing Bereano with one percent of first year receivables for \u201cany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>contract and performance of services\u201d entered into by Mercer \u201cwith any government entity, unit, or agency\u201d secured by Bereano, or for which he worked, was removed from the Fee Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Subsequently, on June 13, 2002 and December 2, 2002, Bereano filed General Lobbying Activity Reports indicating that he had performed lobbying activities on behalf of Social Work Associates from November 1, 2001 to October 31, 2002, and had received $26,000 in total compensation. He also reported that he had expended $200 in \u201cgifts to officials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\n<em>The Ethics Complaint and Commission Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The Commission initiated a complaint against Bereano on September 19, 2002, alleging that he had entered into three contracts, including the Fee Agreement, which constituted engagements for lobbying services for compensation that was contingent upon some legislative or executive action in violation of S.G. \u00a7 15-713(1). Following a preliminary hearing by the Commission and several continuances, a hearing on the merits commenced on June 25, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">At the hearing, Bereano testified that, having drafted the initial legislation that prohibited lobbying for contingency fees while serving in the office of the Senate President, he was \u201cwell aware\u201d that contingency fee arrangements were prohibited in Maryland. According to Bereano, he drafted the Fee Agreement with Mercer, but the language regarding the additional fee for one percent of first year receivables was included at Traina\u2019s request. He did not intend to create a contingency fee and did not know of Mercer\u2019s contracts with State agencies or its intentions to procure contracts with State agencies. Bereano stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">The intent of this document[,] [the Fee Agreement,] and the drafting of this document was in compensation for continuing work and it was phrased by saying continuing representation and services to be performed. That is a condition precedent and a continuing condition to the receipt of additional compensation, which, respectfully, in the draft<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>ing of this I did not consider to be a contingency arrangement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">With regard to the modification and termination provisions in the Fee Agreement that provided that the agreement could be modified except for Mercer\u2019s agreement to compensate Bereano \u201cwhen and after\u201d \u201cany contract and performance of services ... is entered into\u201d by Mercer \u201cwith any government entity, unit, or agency in the State of Maryland or any other state jurisdiction,\u201d Bereano claimed that that provision merely evidenced that the intent of the Fee Agreement was not limited to lobbying Maryland State agencies, but was intended to cover lobbying activities before county and municipal governments, as well as governments outside Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Despite the language of the Fee Agreement, his registration with the Commission, and his filing several lobbying activity reports, Bereano claimed not to have performed any lobbying activities on behalf of either Mercer or Social Work Associates. When asked about the invoices he sent to Mercer requesting payment for mileage, phone calls, and legislative meals and expenses, Bereano stated that the expenses related to social events attended by himself and Tra\u00edna, after which Bereano would \u201cpick up not only [his] meal but [Traina\u2019s] meal.\u201d Through the invoices, Bereano sought reimbursement from Tra\u00edna. Bereano asserted that, even though he had not lobbied for Mercer or Social Work Associates, he registered with the Commission and filed lobbying activity reports \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d When questioned about the disclosure on a General Lobbying Activity Report that he had given $200 in \u201cgifts for officials,\u201d he could not explain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Neither the Commission nor Bereano called Tra\u00edna to testify at the hearing. At the conclusion of the Commission\u2019s case, Bereano moved for judgment, which the Commission granted on two of the counts in the complaint relating to clients and contracts other than Mercer and the Fee Agreement. The sole remaining issue was whether, under the Fee Agreement, Bereano was engaged for lobbying activity for compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>that was contingent upon the outcome of legislative or executive action in violation of S.G. \u00a7 5-713(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">On June 30, 2003, the Commission issued its final decision and order, in which it concluded that Bereano had knowingly and willfully violated S.G. \u00a7 15-713(1). It determined that the \u201cclear and unambiguous language of the [Fee][A]greement clearly contemplated the lobbying of various State government agencies and departments.\u201d The Commission acknowledged that Bereano testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">he was unaware that Mercer ... had any public contracts at the time the [F]ee [AJgreement was entered in September 2001; that he did not learn of the contracts with State agencies until he received a letter from Mr. Tra\u00edna in May 2002; that the language in the [FJee [AJgreement related to \u201c1% of the first year receivables\u201d was added to the agreement at Mr. Traina\u2019s request and Mr. Tra\u00edna sent the language to him for that clause; and that he advised Mr. Tra\u00edna that contingency fees are illegal under State law; that the agreem\u00e9nt was intended to address private business activities; that all his activities were in the private sector and that he had no activities involving State officials on behalf of Mr. Tra\u00edna; that he has had no lobbying activity; that he did not give any gifts to officials on behalf of Mercer ...; that he did not lobby or even monitor legislation during the 2002 session on behalf of Mercer ... ; that he only registered as a regulated lobbyist out of an \u201cabundance of caution;\u201d and that he kept detailed time records for each client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The Commission, however, found his testimony \u201cless than credible and incongruous with the plain language of the documents submitted into evidence,\u201d many of which Bereano filed with the Commission attesting to their correctness and truthfulness under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The Commission commented that, under the Fee Agreement, Mercer was \u201chir[ingj [Bereano] to obtain State contracts in Maryland and his testimony that it was not until nine months after the [FJee [AJgreement that he became aware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>that Mr. Tra\u00edna had some existing contracts with State agencies, is not credible.\u201d Furthermore, the Commission took exception to Bereano\u2019s contention \u201cthat he did \u2018nothing at the State level[,]\u2019 \u201d observing that he registered as a lobbyist for Mercer on November 13, 2001, for the period of November 1, 2001 through October 31, 2002. Bereano also filed a General Lobbying Activity Report on June 12, 2002, disclosing, under oath, \u201call legislative and executive matters concerning staffing and case management, and social service issues.\u201d In that report, Bereano claimed to have made $200 in \u201cgifts to or for officials or employees or their immediate families,\u201d which, at the hearing, he denied doing, but could not explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In addition, the Commission noted that Bereano submitted invoices to Tra\u00edna seeking reimbursement for \u201clegislative expenses\u201d and \u201clegislative expenses and meals.\u201d Although he professed to have maintained detailed records for each of his clients, Bereano did not produce documentation to explain the invoices or lobbying activity reports. Because Bereano insisted that the language regarding compensation of one percent of first year receivables was added to the Fee Agreement at Traina\u2019s request and Bereano did not call Tra\u00edna to testify, the Commission inferred that Traina\u2019s \u201ctestimony would not have supported [Bereano\u2019s.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">According to the Commission, the fact that Bereano may not have actually secured contracts for Mercer or have been compensated pursuant to the terms of the contingency clause of the Fee Agreement was \u201cirrelevant\u201d because S.G. \u00a7 15-713(1) proscribes a registered lobbyist from \u201cbeing engaged for lobbying purposes\u201d for compensation that is contingent upon legislative or executive action. Bereano had registered as a lobbyist on behalf of Mercer and billed for \u201clegislative expenses\u201d under a contract, the \u201cunambiguous\u201d language of which provided for compensation of one percent of all first year receivables for each facility, location, or contract Bereano was \u201cinvolved in securing\u201d for Mercer \u201cwith any government entity, unit or agency in the State of Maryland.\u201d Therefore, the Commission found Bereano in violation of S.G. \u00a7 15-713(l)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Acting under S.G. \u00a7 15-405(d) and (e), the Commission exercised its authority to suspend or revoke the registration of a \u201cregistered lobbyist\u201d who \u201cknowingly and willfully violated Subtitle 7\u201d of the Ethics Law. Because Bereano did not register with the Commission on behalf of Mercer until November 13, 2001, after the November 1, 2001 effective date of S.G. \u00a7 15-713, the Commission concluded that it was not applying S.G. \u00a7 15-405 retroactively. It also noted that Bereano remained registered as a lobbyist for Mercer with the Fee Agreement governing his compensation until June 12, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Interpreting the \u201cknowin[g] and willfu[l]\u201d language of S.G. 15-405(e), the Commission determined that the \u201ccivil definition\u201d of \u201cwillfully\u201d was applicable, and under that definition a person was found to act \u201cwillfully\u201d where his or her \u201c \u2018act is intentional, or knowing, or voluntary, as distinguished from accidental/ \u201d (quoting <em>Pacific Mortgage &amp; Investment Group, Ltd. v. Horn, </em>100 Md.App. 311, 641 A.2d 913 (1994)). The Commission interpreted \u201cknowing\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d as \u201c \u2018(1) having or showing awareness or understanding; well informed (a knowing waiver of the right to counsel)[;][and] (2) deliberate; conscious/\u201d (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 872 (7th ed.1999)). Applying those definitions to its factual findings, the Commission determined that Bereano could not be said to have \u201caccidentally\u201d entered into the Fee Agreement because he was admittedly \u201cwell aware\u201d of the prohibition against contingency fees, was responsible for drafting the Fee Agreement, and intentionally included the language creating a contingency fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The Commission concluded that, \u201cbased on the violation, the lack of credibility of [Bereano], and [his] long history as a lobbyist that a suspension and fine are in the public interest and necessary to protect the integrity of the governmental process.\u201d Through its order, the Commission suspended Bereano\u2019s lobbying registrations for ten months, prohibited him from engaging in lobbying activities for a ten month period, reprimanded him, and fined him $5,000. The Commission also ordered Bereano to submit all fee agreements for lobbying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>activity before the legislative and executive branches of the State government following the expiration of the ten month suspension for a period of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Bereano petitioned the Circuit Court for Howard County for judicial review, and the circuit court affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision on December 28, 2004. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">We review the decision of the agency, not the decision of the circuit court. <em>Abbey v. Univ. of Maryland, </em>126 Md.App. 46, 53, 727 A.2d 406 (1999). In reviewing an administrative agency\u2019s decision, we are \u201c \u2018limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 67-68, 729 A.2d 376 (1999) (quoting <em>United Parcel Serv. v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226 (1994)). In other words, we must decide \u201c \u2018 \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 68, 729 A.2d 376 (quoting <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apartments, </em>283 Md. 505, 512, 390 A.2d 1119 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">We review an agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it under the assumption that its decision is <em>prima facie </em>correct and presumptively valid. <em>Marzullo v. Kahl, </em>366 Md. 158, 172, 783 A.2d 169 (2001). We recognize that \u201c \u2018it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence\u2019 and to draw inferences from that evidence.\u201d <em>CBS, Inc. v.

Moreover, we \u201cwill review an adjudicatory agency decision solely on the grounds relied upon by the agency.\u201d <em>Department of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v.

We do, however, give deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own rules and regulations, and we give the agency\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute it administers considerable weight. <em>Maryland Div. of Labor &amp; Indus. v. Triangle Gen. Contractors, Inc., </em>366 Md. 407, 416, 784 A.2d 534 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Bereano presents a series of alternative arguments premised on his contention that there was insufficient evidence to support the Commission\u2019s finding that he knowingly and willfully violated S.G. \u00a7 15-713(1). First, he argues that, because he \u201cdid not communicate with or set up meetings with officials of the Legislative or Executive Branch on behalf of Mercer, his activities fail to satisfy the requirements of [S.G.] \u00a7 15-701.\u201d Therefore, he was not required to have registered as a regulated lobbyist for Mercer and was not required to file lobbying activity reports. In other words, because he performed no lobbying activity, he was not a \u201cregulated lobbyist\u201d and could not have been in violation of S.G. \u00a7 15-713(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Secondly, he argues that the Fee Agreement contained \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d contracts. Under the \u201cMonthly Retainer Provisions,\u201d included in the second and third paragraphs of the Fee Agreement, Bereano was to \u201cbe a resource concerning legislative and political and government matters at both the State and local levels.\u201d If, as a result of receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the $2,000 retainer from Mercer for performing his obligations under the \u201cMonthly Retainer Provisions,\u201d he was \u201crequired\u201d to register as a lobbyist pursuant to S.G. \u00a7 15-701 and file lobbying activity reports, \u201cnothing in the Monthly Retainer Provisions of the [Fee Agreement] or in the record below ... provided Bereano should solicit or secure from the executive branch of the Maryland State government any procurement contract-either a specific contract or executive procurement generally.\u201d \u201cTherefore, the lobbying registration statements, the lobbying billing and lobbying activity report arise only from the receipt of the fee provided for in the Monthly Retainer Provisions, and are irrelevant and have nothing to do with the allegation of lobbying to procure or solicit \u2018a [S]tate contract.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">As to the Commission\u2019s reliance upon the billing statements and lobbying activity report in finding that Bereano, while a regulated lobbyist, was engaged for lobbying purposes for compensation contingent upon legislative or executive action, he argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">The fact that [he] reported legislative activity (and not executive branch activity at all) under the broad range of lobbying categories contained in [S.G.] \u00a7 15-701 is not evidence that he violated [the] [S.G.] \u00a7 15-713 prohibition against being engaged for the outcome of executive branch procurement, any more than it is evidence that Bereano engaged in any of the myriad activities authorized in the Mercer Agreement. The lobbying activity statements and billing statements confirm this and make no reference of any solicitation or procurement of an executive branch contract, or any contingency fee activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">With regard to the remainder of the Fee Agreement, which provided for compensation of one percent of the first year receivables of any facilities, locations, or contracts with governmental entities, units, or agencies in the State of Maryland secured by Bereano, he maintains that he only attempted to obtain \u201cprivate sector contracts for Mercer\u201d and \u201cset up no meetings for Tra\u00edna with any state or government agency.\u201d He asserts that there was no evidence that he lobbied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>obtain procurement contracts or that he was compensated for securing a procurement contract for Mercer.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Bereano also claims that the Fee Agreement was a broad contract intended to cover numerous jurisdictions, including lobbying in jurisdictions where lobbying for a contingency fee would not be an ethical violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">We conclude that the legislative intent of S.G. \u00a7 15-713(1) proscribes the <em>contracting </em>for lobbying services by regulated lobbyists for compensation contingent upon legislative or executive action. Therefore, violation of the statute is not dependent upon the actual performance of lobbying or other services under the contract. As we shall explain, it is being \u201cengaged for,\u201d rather than being \u201cengaged in,\u201d lobbying for a contingency fee that is precluded by S.G. \u00a7 15-713(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The Court of Appeals \u201chas stated many times \u2018that the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intention.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v.

reported that he made $200 in gifts to officials during that period that he could not explain; and billed Mercer $1,197.73 for \u201clegislative meals and expenses\u201d and \u201clegislative expenses\u201d between December 1, 2001 and May 1, 2002, the Commission found Bereano\u2019s testimony that he had not performed lobbying services on Mercer\u2019s behalf \u201cless than credible.\u201d <em>See </em>S.G. \u00a7 15 \u2014 701(a)(l)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Bereano\u2019s testimony conflicted with the filings he submitted to the Commission under oath. Giving proper deference to the authority vested with the Commission to resolve disputes of fact and draw inferences from the facts, we cannot say that the Commission\u2019s findings that Bereano had performed lobbying activity requiring registration under S.G. \u00a7 15-701 and was, therefore, a \u201cregulated lobbyist\u201d as defined by S.G. \u00a7 15-102(hh) are not supported by substantial evidence in the record. In fact, in his brief, Bereano appears to concede that his receipt of the $2,000 monthly retainer and activities \u201crequired\u201d him to register as a lobbyist for Mercer and file lobbying activity reports and disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>We next consider whether the Fee Agreement, under which Bereano performed lobbying services, provided for compensation contingent upon the outcome of legislative or executive action. Maryland adheres to the objective law of contract interpretation, which \u201cgenerally requires giving legal effect to the clear terms of a contract and bars the admission of prior or contemporaneous agreements or negotiations to vary or contradict a written contractual term.\u201d <em>Calomiris v. Woods, </em>353 Md. 425, 432, 727 A.2d 358 (1999) (citing <em>Equitable Trust Co. v. Imbesi, </em>287 Md. 249, 271-72, 412 A.2d 96 (1980)). \u201cThe requirement that courts give legal effect to the unambiguous provisions of a contract and the rule that prohibits the admission of parol evidence for ascertaining the parties\u2019 intent provide a necessary legal foundation for the certainty of contracting parties.\u201d <em>Calomiris, </em>353 Md. at 433, 727 A.2d 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Referring to Traina\u2019s June 12, 2002 letter, Bereano claims that it was not the intent of the parties to the Fee Agreement to create a contingency fee, but only to recognize that he would need to perform additional services for any contracts that he may secure for Mercer. While appellant recognizes that the language may resemble a contingency fee, he argues that the parties never contemplated that he would lobby, nor did he lobby, to secure State agency contracts. In addition, the Fee Agreement was intended to apply to multiple jurisdictions where contingency fee lobbying was not prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Despite Bereano\u2019s explanations of the intentions of the parties, the plain language of the Fee Agreement supports the Commission\u2019s interpretation that Bereano was \u201cengaged for lobbying purposes\u201d on behalf of Mercer \u201cto develop and obtain contracts and arrangements with ... State government agencies and departments.\u201d For his success in obtaining \u201ccontracts] and performance of services ... with <em>any </em>government entity, unit or agency in the State of Maryland,\u201d he was to be compensated one percent of the first year receivable in addition to the $2,000 monthly retainer. (Emphasis added.) In fact, the securing of government contracts was such an integral part of the Fee Agreement that all of the provisions of the Fee Agreement were subject to modification \u201cexcept for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>the provision and understanding ... to compensate [Bereano] when and after any contract is entered into [with] a government unit.\u201d Even if the percentage of the first year receivable was intended as a flat fee for continuing services, the contract still provides for compensation that is contingent upon the executive action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Even if the Fee Agreement included Bereano\u2019s activities on Mercer\u2019s behalf in jurisdictions other than Maryland, by its terms, the Fee Agreement clearly related to, and included, Bereano\u2019s activities before Maryland\u2019s executive and legislative branches. Additionally, the Commission found, and the record supports the finding, that Bereano performed services under the agreement necessitating his registration as a \u201cregulated lobbyist\u201d under S.G. \u00a7 15-701.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Even if Bereano did not actually perform lobbying or other services initiating the contingency provisions of the Fee Agreement,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we are not persuaded that the Commission erred in finding him in violation of S.G. \u00a7 15-713(1). As explained above, the legislature sought to prohibit \u201cregulated lobbyists\u201d from \u201cbeing engaged,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>contracting, for lobbying purposes for compensation that was contingent upon legislative or executive action. Because the \u201cengagement\u201d continues for so long as the contract is in effect, an entity engaged under such an agreement is in violation of the statute until the termination of the agreement or until the entity is no longer a \u201cregulated lobbyist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The effective date of S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 15-405 and 15-713 was November 1, 2001. Bereano registered as a lobbyist for Mercer on November 14, 2001, indicating his intention to lobby on its behalf for \u201cany and all legislative and executive matters concerning staffing and case management foster care, children and social services issues.\u201d According to the Commission\u2019s findings, which are supported by substantial evidence in the record, Bereano\u2019s registration was required under S.G. \u00a7 15-701. As a result, the Commission was authorized under S.G. \u00a7 15-405(e) to sanction Bereano for any violation of Subtitle 7 of the State Government Article.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>In support of our interpretation that the legislature sought to prohibit the mere <em>contracting </em>for lobbying purposes for contingency fee compensation, we note that, in enacting the Public Ethics Law, the General Assembly \u201cdeclare[d] that the people have a right to be assured that the impartiality and independent judgment of those officials and employees will be maintained,\u201d and found it \u201cevident that this confidence and trust is eroded when the conduct of the State\u2019s business is subject to improper influence or even <em>the appearance of improper influence.\u201d </em>S.G. \u00a7 15-101(a) (emphasis added). Interpreting S.G. \u00a7 15-713(1) to prohibit only successful lobbying for contingency compensation would not serve the stated legislative purpose. Therefore, that Mercer never \u201csuccessfully bid on any government contracts\u201d and Bereano was never compensated under the contingency fee provisions are not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Nevertheless, the Commission may only sanction an individual for \u201cknowin[g]\u201d and \u201cwillful!]\u201d violations. State Government \u00a7 15-405 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">(d) <em>Same </em>\u2014 Subtitle 7. \u2014 If the Ethics Commission determines that a respondent has violated Title 7 of this title, the Ethics Commission may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">(1) require a respondent who is a regulated lobbyist to file any additional reports or information that reasonably relates to information required under \u00a7\u00a7 15-730 and 15-704 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">(2) impose a fine not exceeding $5,000 for each violation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">(3) subject to subsection (e) of this section, suspend the registration of a regulated lobbyist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>(e) <em>Suspension or revocation of registration. </em>\u2014 (1) If the Ethics Commission determines it necessary to protect the public interest and the integrity of the governmental process, the Ethics Commission may issue an order to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">(i) suspend the registration of an individual regulated lobbyist if the Ethics Commission determines that the individual regulated lobbyist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">1. has knowingly and willfully violated Subtitle 7 of this title ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">According to Bereano, the \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d language of S.G. \u00a7 15-405(e) imposes a <em>\u201cscienter </em>\u201d requirement, whereby the Commission must find that a respondent deliberately intended to violate State Ethics Laws before it is empowered to issue a sanction. As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Tayback, </em>378 Md. 578, 837 A.2d 158 (2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">\u201c \u2018Willful\u2019 has received four different constructions from the courts. The first, and most restrictive, is that an act is wilful only if it is done with a bad purpose or evil motive-deliberately to violate the law. A second interpretation considers an act to be willful \u2018if it is done with intent to commit the act and with a knowledge that the act is in violation of the law.\u2019 That construction does not require that the defendant possess a sinister motivation, but, like the first interpretation, it does require knowledge that the act is unlawful. The third interpretation \u2018requires only that the act be committed voluntarily and intentionally as opposed to one that is committed though inadvertence, accident, or ordinary negligence.\u2019 Under that approach, \u2018[a]s long as there is an intent to commit the act, there can be a finding of willfulness even though the actor was consciously attempting to comply with the law and was acting with the good faith belief that the action was lawful.\u2019 What is required is \u2018an objective intent to commit the act but not necessarily a knowledge that the act will bring about the illegal result.\u2019 Finally ... some courts have gone so far as to find an act willful even though it was not committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>intentionally, but through oversight, inadvertence, or negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 589, 837 A.2d 158 (quoting <em>Deibler v. State, </em>365 Md. 185, 776 A.2d 657 (2001)). The <em>Tayback </em>Court noted that, \u201cin the majority of applications, the third definition was accepted, ie., that the act be committed voluntarily and intentionally, not accidentally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the Court of Appeals found that the third definition had been consistently applied in attorney grievance matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">For purposes of S.G. \u00a7 15-405, we agree with the Commission that a suspension or revocation of registration is appropriate where it is shown that the respondent intentionally and voluntarily entered into a lobbying agreement in violation of the S.G. \u00a7 15-713(1). Therefore, we are also not persuaded that the Commission erred as a matter of law in reprimanding Bereano, fining him, suspending his lobbying registration, and in prohibiting him from engaging in lobbying activity for a period of ten months. We are similarly not persuaded that the Commission\u2019s decision to do so constituted an abuse of the discretion afforded to it under S.G. \u00a7 15-405(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Bereano also contends that the Commission retroactively applied the provisions of S.G. \u00a7 15-405, in violation of the Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>State Ethics Commission v. Evans, </em>382 Md. 370, 855 A.2d 364 (2004). He explains that the Fee Agreement was entered into on September 13, 2001, before the effective date of S.G. \u00a7 15-405. He claims the only act that violated S.G. \u00a7 15-713(1) for which he could be sanctioned was his entering into the Fee Agreement and notes that, at that time, the Commission was without authority to sanction a regulated lobbyist. Because he did not actually engage in any lobbying for State procurement contracts and S.G. \u00a7 15-713 does not provide for a continuing violation, appellant claims his subsequent registration and filings with the Commission are not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>In <em>State Ethics Commission v. Evans, </em>382 Md. 370, 855 A.2d 364 (2004), Evans, a well known Maryland registered lobbyist, was convicted of nine counts of wire and mail fraud in the United States District Court as a result of his lobbying activities. He was sentenced to thirty months\u2019 imprisonment on September 29, 2000. After serving his sentence, Evans registered as a regulated lobbyist on behalf of five clients on May 24, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Thereafter, the Commission initiated a complaint against Evans pursuant S.G. \u00a7 13 \u2014 405(e)(l)(ii), which, effective November 1, 2001, authorized the Commission to \u201crevoke the registration of an individual regulated lobbyist if the Ethics Commission determines that, based on acts arising from lobbying activities, the individual regulated lobbyist has been convicted of bribery, theft, or other crime involving moral turpitude.\u201d Based upon his wire and mail fraud convictions, the Commission revoked Evans\u2019s registrations. When the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County reversed the Commission\u2019s revocation on the grounds that the Commission had impermissibly applied S.G. \u00a7 15-405(e) retroactively, the Court of Appeals granted <em>certiorari </em>to consider whether the legislature intended to authorize the Commission to suspend or revoke the registration of regulated lobbyist for acts occurring prior to the effective date of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">In holding that the Commission\u2019s decision constituted an erroneous retroactive application of S.G. \u00a7 15-405(e), in contradiction of the legislative intent, the Court of Appeals noted that, with certain limited exceptions, including the prohibition of engaging in lobbying activity for compensation contingent on executive or legislative action, between 1979 and October 31, 2001, \u201cthe law governing lobbyists was essentially restricted to requiring them to register with the State Ethics Commission and to file semi-annual reports.\u201d <em>Evans, </em>382 Md. at 374, 855 A.2d 364. While lobbyists were subject to criminal prosecution under S.G. \u00a7 15-903, the Commission was not authorized to suspend or revoke a lobbyist for ethics violations. It could only issue a cease and desist order, which it could then seek to enforce through judicial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Recognizing the lack of \u201cclear ethieal standards and effective administrative enforcement\u201d of lobbying activity, in 1999, the legislature created the Study Commission on Lobbyist Ethics to \u201ccollec[t] information about lobbying practices, formulat[e] a Code of Ethics for lobbyists, propos[e] legislation, and repor[t] its findings to the Governor and the General Assembly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374-75, 855 A.2d 364. In its report, the Study Commission recommended, among other things, \u201cprohibiting certain conduct on the part of lobbyists\u201d and \u201cauthorizing the State Ethics Commission to impose administrative fines and to suspend or revoke a lobbyist\u2019s registration for certain ethical violations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375,855 A.2d 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The Study Commission\u2019s recommendations were enacted by the 631st Act of the 2001 Session, which, effective on November 1, 2001, created, among other things, S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 15-405 and 15-713. State Government \u00a7 15-405(e) permits the Commission to revoke the registration of any regulated lobbyist based upon a conviction for a crime of moral turpitude that arose from lobbying activities. The Commission is required to initiate a complaint within two years of the date the conviction became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In determining whether the legislature intended to authorize the Commission to sanction regulated lobbyists for convictions occurring prior to November 1, 2001, the <em>Evans </em>Court explained the following general principles relating to the retroactive application of statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">\u201c(1) statutes are presumed to operate prospectively unless a contrary intent appears; (2) a statute governing procedure or remedy will be applied to cases pending in court when the statute becomes effective; (3) a statute will be given retroactive effect if that is the legislative intent; but (4) even if intended to apply retroactively, a statute will not be given that effect if it would impair vested rights, deny due process, or violate the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 381, 855 A.2d 364 (quoting <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v.

That implicates the first and third principles. Applying the presumption of prospectivity, a statute will be found to operate retroactively only when the [legislature clearly expresses an intent that the statute apply retroactively.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">\u201cIf [the Court] concluded] that the [legislature did intend for the statute to have retroactive effect, [the Court] must then examine whether such effect would contravene some Constitutional right or prohibition. That implicates the second and fourth principles.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\"><em>Evans, </em>382 Md. at 381-82, 855 A.2d 364 (quoting <em>Kim, </em>376 Md. at 289-90, 829 A.2d 611). Finally, the <em>Evans </em>Court explained that, although a statute may be applied in proceedings occurring after its effective date, so long as that application regulates activity occurring prior to the effective date of the statute, its application is retroactive. <em>Evans, </em>382 Md. at 382, 855 A.2d 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">As applied to Evans, the Court of Appeals determined that S.G. \u00a7 15-405(e) was applied prospectively \u201cin the sense that the registrations were filed after the effective date,\u201d but \u201cthe statute was clearly applied retroactively, ..., in that the sole ground for revocation was an act \u2014 a conviction \u2014 that occurred prior to the effective date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, S.G. \u00a7 15-405(e) was \u201capplied in a way that \u2018determine[d] the legal significance of acts or events that occurred prior to its effective date.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 382, 855 A.2d 364 (quoting <em>Kim, </em>376 Md. at 289, 829 A.2d 611). The <em>Evans </em>Court noted the legislature is presumed to know the Court\u2019s holdings concerning the retroactivity of legislation, and explained that had the legislature \u201cwanted the statute to apply to Evans or persons in his status, it would have to have taken some affirmative action, expressly or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>necessary implication, to make that clear[.]\u201d <em>Evans, </em>382 Md. at 384, 855 A.2d 364. Absent such a clear legislative intent, the longstanding presumption against retroactive application of legislation was applicable, and the Court affirmed the circuit court\u2019s reversal of the Commission\u2019s sanctioning of Evans.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">We are persuaded that the application of S.G. \u00a7 15-405 in the instant case is distinguishable from that in <em>Evans. </em>In <em>Evans, </em>the convictions, <em>i.e., </em>the act occasioning the revocation of his registrations, occurred prior to November 1, 2001. Although Bereano entered into the Fee Agreement with Mercer before the effective date of S.G. \u00a7 15-405,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> he acknowledged, and the Commission found, that the Fee Agreement controlled his activities with Mercer until June 12, 2002, when the contingency fee language was removed. Because an entity is in violation of S.G. \u00a7 15-713(1) under a lobbying services contract providing for compensation contingent upon legislative or executive action until the contract is terminated or the entity is no longer a regulated lobbyist, Bereano was engaged under the Fee Agreement for lobbying purposes for compensation contingent upon the outcome of executive action after November 1,2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Bereano\u2019s retroactive application argument focuses on the entering into the Fee Agreement as the critical act and the date of the Fee Agreement as the critical date. He contends that a regulated lobbyist is not in continuing violation of S.G. \u00a7 15-713 simply because he or she remains \u201cengaged for lobbying purposes\u201d under a contingency fee agreement. This would mean that a regulated lobbyist could continue to lobby under a contract entered into prior to November 1, 2001, providing for a contingency fee, and not be subject to the Commission\u2019s sanctioning authority under S.G. \u00a7 15-405. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>That result, we believe, would appear illogical and clearly contrary to the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Bereano also contends that the Commission erred in applying the so called \u201cmissing witness rule.\u201d \u201cThe \u2018missing witness rule\u2019 or \u2018empty chair doctrine\u2019 permits an adverse inference to be drawn from a party\u2019s failure to call a material witness, when the circumstances are such that the party should naturally have called the missing witness.\u201d Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook </em>\u00a7 409(B), at 142 (3d ed.1999). Discussion of the rule most often arises in the context of the appropriateness of granting a jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The missing witness rule has long been applied by Maryland courts in civil cases. <em>Christensen v. State, </em>274 Md. 133, 135, 333 A.2d 45 (1975); <em>Hayes v. State, </em>57 Md.App. 489, 495, 470 A.2d 1301 (1984). As explained by the Court of Appeals in <em>Hoverter v. Dir. of Patuxent Inst., </em>231 Md. 608, 609, 188 A.2d 696 (1963):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">In a civil case it is well settled that failure of a party to produce an available witness who could testify on a material issue, if not explained, gives rise to an inference that the testimony would be unfavorable, and is a legitimate subject of comment by counsel in argument to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Elsewhere, the Court has said: \u201cThe unfavorable inference applies, however, only where it would be most natural under the circumstances for a party to speak, call witnesses, or present evidence.\u201d <em>Radin v. Supervisor of Assessments of Montgomery County, </em>254 Md. 294, 301, 255 A.2d 413 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">The Court of Appeals first applied the missing witness rule in a criminal case in <em>Christensen:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-10\">\u201cThe failure to call a material witness raises a presumption or inference that the testimony of such person would be unfavorable to the party failing to call him, but there is no such presumption or inference where the witness is not available, or where his testimony is unimportant or cumulative, or where he is equally available to both sides. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>presumption or inference that the testimony of a missing witness would be unfavorable is applied most frequently when there is a relationship between the party and the witness, such as a family relationship, an employer-employee relationship, and, sometimes, a professional relationship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aad\"><em>Christensen, 274 </em>Md. at 134-135, 333 A.2d 45 (quoting 1 Underhill <em>Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 45 (rev. 6th ed. P. Herrick 1973)). Accord <em>Davis v. State, </em>333 Md. 27, 48, 633 A.2d 867 (1993); <em>Robinson v. State, </em>315 Md. 309, 314, 554 A.2d 395 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">This Court later indicated that, while the missing witness rule is sometimes \u201creferred to as a presumption,\u201d it \u201cis really a [recognition of a] permissible inference.\u201d <em>Yuen v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 109, 113, 403 A.2d 819 (1979). There, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">The court cannot instruct a jury that it <em>must </em>presume unfavorable testimony upon the absence of a witness. The instruction the <em>advisory </em>instruction in Maryland is that the jury <em>may </em>infer. <em>See United States v. Stulga, </em>584 F.2d 142, 145 n. 1 ([6th Cir.] 1978). The instruction becomes merely a highlighting of a significant void in a party\u2019s case; but even in the absence of an instruction, the jury is not precluded from so inferring. Inferences of all types are always favorable to the factfinders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">The failure to grant an affirmative instruction does not remove the availability of the inference. As a consequence, whatever prejudice may usually come from not giving an advisory instruction is diminished, because the inferential thought process is still available. The prejudice is simply that such an inference is not given preferred instructional attention over any other inferences available from the testimony or absence of testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 113-14, 403 A.2d 819 (footnote omitted). <em>See also Patterson v. State, </em>356 Md. 677, 684-85, 741 A.2d 1119 (1999)(citing <em>Yuen </em>with approval and opining that \u201c[a]n evidentiary inference, such as a missing evidence or missing witness inference, however, is not based on a legal standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>but on the individual facts from which inferences can be drawn and, in many instances, several inferences may be made on the same set of facts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In this case, the Commission, in its opinion, recounted Bereano\u2019s explanation that the \u201clegislative meals and expenses\u201d and \u201clegislative expenses\u201d for which he sought reimbursement from Mercer were, in fact, social events that he attended with Tra\u00edna and where no lobbying activity occurred. At such events, according to Bereano, he would \u201cpick up\u201d the cost of his meal as well as Traina\u2019s and bill Mercer later. Bereano also claimed that the language relating to compensation of one percent of first year receivables for government contracts entered into by Mercer was added at Traina\u2019s request and that the parties did not contemplate that Bereano would lobby to secure State agency contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In explaining that it did not find Bereano\u2019s testimony credible, the Commission remarked that Tra\u00edna was present on Bereano\u2019s witness list, but Bereano did not call him to testify. The Commission determined that, \u201c[b]ecause Mr. Tra\u00edna did not appear and testify, we make the inference pursuant to the \u2018missing witness rule\u2019 that his testimony would not have supported [Bereano\u2019s] testimony particularly in view of [Bereano\u2019s] incongruous testimony.\u201d In a footnote, the Commission quoted <em>Hayes, </em>57 Md.App. at 495, 470 A.2d 1301, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">\u201cThe Court of Appeals of Maryland has consistently applied th[e] [missing witness] rule in civil cases and held that where a party fails to take the stand to testify as to facts peculiarly within his knowledge, or fails to produce evidence <em>(e.g., </em>testimony by certain witnesses) the fact finder may infer that the testimony not produced would have been unfavorable to that party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Here, it was for the Commission, as the fact finder, to resolve disputes of fact and to draw inferences from those facts. <em>CBS, Inc. v. Comptroller of Treasury, </em>319 Md. 687, 698, 575 A.2d 324 (1990) \u201c \u2018[I]t is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence\u2019 and to draw inferences from that evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>dence.\u201d (quoting <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller of Treasury, </em>302 Md. 825, 834-35, 490 A.2d 1296 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In <em>Garrison v. State, 88 </em>Md.App. 475, 486-87, 594 A.2d 1264 (1991), a criminal case in which the appellant\u2019s father was a key figure in his alibi, we reasoned that \u201cappellant\u2019s father was peculiarly available to appellant and less available to the State; his testimony would have buttressed the appellant\u2019s credibility; his father was not called to testify in his behalf; and the relationship between the appellant and his father would naturally be one of interest or affection.\u201d \u201cThus,\u201d we concluded, \u201cit may be assumed, at the least, that appellant\u2019s father could not substantiate [appellant\u2019s alibi]; and, at worst, it may be assumed that the testimony of appellant\u2019s father would have been in contravention of the testimony appellant would have offered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487, 594 A.2d 1264.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In this case, where credibility was a particularly important issue, a reasonable trier of fact could reasonably conclude that if Traina\u2019s testimony would have corroborated Bereano\u2019s testimony and buttressed his credibility, it would have been natural to have called him for that purpose. <em>See Bruce v. State, </em>318 Md. 706, 569 A.2d 1254 (1990); <em>Robinson v. State, </em>315 Md. 309, 554 A.2d 395 (1989). Traina negotiated and signed the fee agreement on behalf of Mercer. He was, for all practical purposes, a party to that agreement, and the facts about the intention of the parties in regard to the agreement were peculiarly within his knowledge. Not only had Traina been included on Bereano\u2019s witness list, but because of their personal and business relationship, Bereano was obviously in the better position to know what his testimony would be. Therefore, the Commission could draw the adverse inference from Bereano\u2019s failure to call Traina to testify about the intent of the lobbying contract and to support Bereano\u2019s explanation of the billing for \u201clegislative meals and expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Rather than offering an explanation of why he could not or did not call Traina, appellant directs our attention to one of the exceptions identified in <em>Christensen: </em>\u201c \u2018[T]here is no such ... inference where the witness ... is equally available to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>both sides.\u2019 \u201d <em>Christensen, </em>274 Md. at 133, 333 A.2d 45 (quoting Underhill at \u00a7 45). <em>Accord Davis, </em>333 Md. at 48, 633 A.2d 867; <em>Robinson, </em>315 Md. at 314, 554 A.2d 395. This Court said in <em>Yuen </em>that the party against whom the inference is drawn must \u201c \u2018ha[ve] it peculiarly within his power to produce\u2019 \u201d the missing witness, <em>Yuen v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 109, 112, 403 A.2d 819 (1979) (quoting <em>Graves v. United States, </em>150 U.S. 118, 121, 14 S.Ct. 40, 37 L.Ed. 1021 (1893)). In <em>Hayes, </em>we stated it somewhat differently and said that the witness must be \u201cpeculiarly available\u201d to that party, <em>Hayes, </em>57 Md.App. at 494, 470 A.2d 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In <em>Hayes, </em>we noted that, whereas \u201c[i]n civil cases, the unfavorable inference applies where it would be most natural under the circumstances for a party to speak, or present evidence,\u201d the Supreme Court of the United States, \u201cin applying the rule to criminal cases articulated the rule somewhat more restrictively ... in that the witness must not only be \u2018naturally\u2019 accessible to the party but must be \u2018peculiarly\u2019 so.\u201d <em>Hayes, </em>57 Md.App. at 495, 470 A.2d 1301 (citing <em>Graves, </em>150 U.S. at 121, 14 S.Ct. 40). We reasoned: \u201cThe primary justification in criminal cases for the stringent requirement that the witness be \u2018peculiarly\u2019 within the control of the party is the need to protect the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.\u201d <em>Hayes, </em>57 Md.App. at 499, 470 A.2d 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">More recently, this Court has utilized this same criminal case terminology regarding witness availability in civil cases. <em>See S. Mgmt. Corp. v. Mariner, </em>144 Md.App. 188, 199, 797 A.2d 110 (2002) (stating that, \u201c[fjor the instruction to be warranted, the missing witness must be in the \u2018peculiar control\u2019 of one party\u201d) (citing <em>Hayes, </em>57 Md.App. at 494-95, 470 A.2d 1301); <em>DiLeo v.

As we shall explain, we are persuaded that Tra\u00edna was peculiarly available to Bereano, rather than equally available to both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Appellant contends that because Tra\u00edna was equally available to the Commission through subpoena, he was not peculiarly within Bereano\u2019s control. The appellant in <em>Davis </em>made a similar argument in regard to the mother of his children, who was present at the trial and clearly subject to subpoena. Citing <em>United States v. </em>Young, 463 F.2d 934, 942 (D.C.Cir. 1972) (citing <em>Burgess v. United States, </em>440 F.2d 226 (D.C.Cir. 1970); <em>Stewart v. United States, </em>418 F.2d 1110, 1115 (D.C.Cir. 1969)), the Court of Appeals stated that \u201c \u2018 \u201cavailability\u201d of a witness to the Government must be judged \u201cpractically as well as physically.\u201d ... And whether a person is to be regarded as equally available to both sides may depend not only on physical availability but on his \u201crelationship\u201d to the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis, </em>333 Md. at 49, 633 A.2d 867. Relationships that most frequently generate an adverse \u201cmissing witness\u201d inference include \u201c \u2018 \u201ca family relationship, an employer-employee relationship, and, sometimes, a professional relationship.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 633 A.2d 867 (quoting <em>Robinson v.

The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">Underlying this principle is the realization that despite a party\u2019s theoretical ability to subpoena the witness\u2019s testimony, there is a practical concern that certain relationships may engender a very strong bias which would undermine the utility of that witness\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-7\"><em>Davis, </em>333 Md. at 50, 633 A.2d 867. <em>See also McDuffie v.

Tra\u00edna may have been physically available to the Commission by subpoena, but in a practical sense, he was not equally available to the parties. This personal and business relationship gave Bereano superior access to Tra\u00edna and made Tra\u00edna \u201cpeculiarly\u201d available to Bereano. There is no indication that that relationship had changed, and, in the absence of some explanation, it would seem most natural for Bereano to call Tra\u00edna as a witness in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">In his reply brief, in regard to his failure to offer some explanation for not calling Tra\u00edna to testify, Bereano argues that the Commission also gave no explanation for not calling Tra\u00edna, whom it had interviewed, and who was apparently on its witness list, and that when Bereano was asked whether Tra\u00edna would be called to testify and he answered that he would not, the Commission did not ask him for an explanation. During his testimony, Bereano invoked Traina\u2019s name numerous times, and at one point, presumably to bolster his testimony, Bereano said: \u201cThe truth of the matter is that this language [in the September 2001 letter] was Mr. Traina\u2019s language\u2014 [H]e gave me this language and I know if he were here under oath he would say that to you as well.... \u201d Commission\u2019s case centered on the language of the fee agreement itself. Because Bereano was attempting to explain the intent of the agreement, and why he filed certain reports, it was incumbent upon him, and not the Commission, to explain Traina\u2019s absence. In the absence of some explanation for not calling Tra\u00edna, we perceive no error in the Commission\u2019s drawing an adverse inference from his failure to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-11\">. Subsequent to filing of the opinion in this case on November 9, 2006, appellant filed a Motion for Reconsideration to Court Panel or in the Alternative Request for En Banc Hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">Essentially, the reconsideration motion raised three general arguments regarding the Commission\u2019s application of the missing witness rule in this case: (1) that appellant was denied fundamental due process because he did not receive prior notice of the application of the missing witness rule; (2) that the missing witness rule should not apply to administrative agency proceedings in general because the strict rules of evidence do not apply and to the Commission's proceedings in particular because the staff counsel had the obligation to submit \"all available evidence\" to the Commission; and (3) that Traina was equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>available to both parties and not within the \u201cpeculiar control\u201d of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">The arguments developed in appellant\u2019s brief and reply brief regarding the missing witness rule are directed to the equal availability of Tra\u00edna to both parties. The argument that the missing witness rule should not be applied in administrative agency proceedings generally, and in a Commission proceeding in particular, was not raised. The only statement that might suggest the due process notice argument developed in the reconsideration motion is the statement in appellant\u2019s reply brief that, \u201d[w]ithout asking Bereano why Tra\u00edna did not testify, the Commission found that his non appearance violated the missing witness rule.\u201d Reply brief at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">As to appellant\u2019s continuing violation argument, it is essentially the same as the argument previously considered by the Court. Appellant\u2019s motion is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-14\">. Prior to November 1, 2001, the prohibitions on regulated lobbyists were established by Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-706 of the State Government Article, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-15\">A regulated lobbyist may not be engaged for lobbying purposes for compensation that is dependent in any manner on:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-16\">(1) (i) the enactment or defeat of legislation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-17\">(ii) any other contingency related to legislative action; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-18\">(2) (i) the outcome of any executive action relating to the solicitation or securing of a procurement contract; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-19\">(ii) any other contingency related to executive action.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b179-10\">. In a lobbying activity report filed May 31, 2002, Bereano reported total compensation from Social Work Associates in the amount of $138,000.

This conclusion is consistent with prior interpretations of the Commission regarding lobbying for contingency fee contracts. In advisory Opinion No. 88-13 (June 28, 1988), the Commission considered whether a contract between a law firm and a client, under which the law firm would be compensated a flat fee for future legal services upon the award of a State procurement contract to the client, violated a predecessor to S.G. \u00a7 15-713(1), Md.Code of Maryland Art. 40 A \u00a7 5-104. <em>Opinions of the Maryland State Ethics Commission: 1987-98 Opinions 87 through 98-10 </em>1307. Under the proposed agreement, the law firm's being retained to implement future contracts was contingent upon the client being awarded the contract. Although not registered as a lobbyist on behalf of the client, the law firm proposed to represent the client in the bidding and negotiation in relation to the State procurement contract. Under the Commission's broad interpretation of \"legislative action,\" which included \"almost any matter potentially within the jurisdiction of the [ljegislature,\u201d the law firm's involvement with members of the legislature in relation to the contract would implicate the lobbying registration requirements of the Public Ethics Law. <em>Id. </em>at 1310. Moreover, even though the fee agreement did not provide for compensation until the client was awarded the contract at issue, the Commission opined that, generally, compensation during a particular reporting period is done on an accrual basis so that \"[t]he registration requirements of the [l]aw can not be avoided simply by agreeing that payment will be delayed until a later date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, \"the promise of a future retainer ... can be viewed as a compensation, reward, benefit, or value to be transferred for services rendered as a [lobbying] registrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1310-11. And, \"[i]f such an agreement is contingent upon the successful conclusion of some legislative action, then in [the Commission's] view, the prohibition of [Art. 40A] \u00a7 5-104 would be violated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1311.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b196-6\">. The Commission found that Bereano had not been compensated under the contingency provisions of the Fee Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b196-7\">. Pursuant to S.G. \u00a7 15-405 the Commission is only authorized to sanction \"regulated lobbyists.\u201d It may, however, issue an injunction against an entity that has entered into a contract that violates State Ethics Laws. With regard to \"respondents\u201d that the Commission determines have violated Maryland's Ethics Laws but are not \"regulated lobbyists,\u201d S.G. \u00a7 5-405(c) authorizes the Commission to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">(1) issue an order of compliance directing the respondent to cease and desist from the violation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">(2) issue a reprimand; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">(3) recommend to the appropriate authority other appropriate discipline of the respondent, including censure or removal, if that discipline is authorized by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Under S.G. \u00a7 15-405(d), the Commission may not sanction an individual who enters into a contract that provides for lobbying contingent on executive or legislative action if the individual takes no action under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>a contract because the individual would not be required to register as a regulated lobbyist under S.G. \u00a7 15-701; that is not the case here. Nor does this case concern a regulated lobbyist who enters into a contingency fee agreement for lobbying purposes for a different client than the one for which the entity was required to register under S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 15-701 and 15-703.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b203-7\">.
