We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">Donald Rankin, appellant, was charged in the Circuit Court for Charles County with first degree burglary, first degree sex offense, two counts of second degree sex offense, conspiracy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>commit first degree burglary, and conspiracy to commit a second degree sex offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">On June 21, 1999, appellant entered into a plea agreement with the State. The prosecutor explained that appellant would enter a plea to the count charging conspiracy to commit a second degree sex offense. The prosecutor proffered: \u201cThe only limitation on sentence is the Court had bound itself to an active cap of no more than three years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The trial court told appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">Okay. I\u2019m told that the agreement is if that plea is accepted that the State will dismiss all the other counts at the time of sentencing. In addition, the active portion of the sentence, that\u2019s the portion that\u2019s not suspended, cannot exceed three years. The Court could, however, as part of the sentence, impose the sentence where the suspended portion exceeds three years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Appellant told the trial court that he understood. The trial court set a date for sentencing, and the court indicated it would ask that the presentence investigation report be received at least three days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">At sentencing, on August 13, 1999, the prosecutor told the trial court that \u201c[t]he victim has indicated to me that she wants absolutely no contact with the defendant whatsoever and I would ask that it be extended not only to the victim but the victim\u2019s family, her children and her parents.\u201d Defense counsel merely said, \u201cYour Honor, I believe [appellant] wants to submit to the mercy of the Court.\u201d Asked if he wanted to say anything, appellant said,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cNo, sir.\u201d The trial court then told appellant: \u201cAnd I warn you that if you violate probation you will run the risk of doing substantially all of the back up time. Do you understand that?\u201d Appellant stated that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>The trial court imposed a sentence of twenty years, with all but three years suspended, followed by a period of five years probation. He then advised appellant of the terms of his probation and his appeal rights. Afterward, the prosecutor <em>nol prossed </em>the remaining counts. Defense counsel told the trial court: \u201cThank you, Your Honor. I [will] read his order for probation to him as we sit back at the chairs now, if I may.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The \u201cPlea/Sentence Agreement\u201d filed on June 21, 1999 provides: \u201cDefendant will plead guilty to:\u201d and, handwritten on the form is \u201cConspiracy to Commit 2\u00b0 Sex Offense (Amended count # 7) (Alford plea).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The form recites \u201cState will dismiss other charges/cases as follows:\u201d, with everything after charges crossed out. It also states: \u201cCourt will,\u201d (then in handwriting,) \u201cimpose an active cap of no more than 3 years. Court may impose additional suspended time.\u201d On the next line is printed: \u201cThere is no other sentencing limitation except that provided by law.\u201d The agreement is signed by the prosecutor, appellant, appellant\u2019s trial counsel, and Judge Henderson, and dated \u201c6/21/99.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Appellant was released from incarceration on January 28, 2000, and on February 22, 2001, the court was informed by the Department of Parole and Probation that appellant had committed a new offense. On January 8, 2003, appellant admitted violating probation and was sentenced to serve ten years of the suspended sentence to run consecutive to the new sentence imposed on the case forming the basis for appellant\u2019s violation of probation. On January 13, 2006, appellant filed a Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence, claiming that the plea agreement did not include any term of probation. The trial court denied the motion on January 24, 2006, in a Memorandum and Order, stating that the agreement \u201cmade no comment about the length or terms of probation\u201d and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>terms imposed \u201cwere within the limits provided for by statute.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Al2\">The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion. He argues, as he did below, that the plea agreement did not include a period of probation and that the trial court\u2019s adding the probation to his sentence rendered the sentence illegal. He asks that we strike the probation from his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The State responds that probation is implicit in every suspended sentence. It also asserts that, should we conclude that the plea agreement did not include probation, the proper remedy is to void the agreement in its entirety and to have appellant tried on the original charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Plea Agreements</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">We review the question of whether a plea agreement has been violated de novo. <em>Tweedy v. State, </em>380 Md. 475, 482, 845 A.2d 1215 (2004). In <em>Tweedy, </em>the Court of Appeals noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYl\">\u201cPlea agreements are an accepted procedure throughout the United States and are recognized as an important component of the criminal justice system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 484, 845 A.2d 1215 (citing <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 260, 92 S.Ct. 495, 498, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971) stating that plea bargaining \u201cis an essential component of the administration of justice\u201d). The Court noted the <em>Santobello </em>Court\u2019s holding that \u201c \u2018when a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484, 845 A.2d 1215, (quoting <em>Santobello, </em>404 U.S. at 262, 92 S.Ct. at 499).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">\u201c[ T]he law is well settled that, in the absence of any jurisdictional defect, such agreements are based on contract principles and must be enforced.\u201d <em>Hillard v. State, </em>141 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Md.App. 199, 207, 784 A.2d 1134 (2001).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c[SJeveral courts have noted that the terms of the plea agreement are to be construed according to what a defendant reasonably understood when the plea was entered.\u201d <em>Tweedy, </em>380 Md. at 482, 845 A.2d 1215. In addition, \u201c[t]he words employed in the contract are to be given their ordinary and usual meaning, in light of the context within which they are employed.\u201d <em>Ridenour v. State, </em>142 Md.App. 1, 6, 787 A.2d 815 (2001). We construe the agreement as a whole, to give effect to all parts of the contract. <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Cook, </em>386 Md. 468, 497, 872 A.2d 969 (2005). In determining a defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding of the agreement at the time he entered into it, \u201cwe consider terms implied by the plea agreement as well as those expressly provided.\u201d <em>United States v. Bunner, </em>134 F.3d 1000, 1003 (10th Cir.1998). See <em>also People v. Manzanares, </em>85 P.3d 604, 608 (Colo.App.2003) (stating that \u201cterms of a plea agreement may be implied as well as expressed plainly on the agreement\u2019s face.\u201d) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>2004 WL 500849 (Colo.2004); <em>State v. Brooke, 134 </em>Idaho 807, 10 P.3d 756 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Suspended Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Md.Code, Article 27 \u00a7 641A, effective at the time of appellant\u2019s sentencing, provided, in part:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak8\">Suspension of sentence or imposition of probation following judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">(a) In general. \u2014 (3) The court may impose a sentence for a specified period and provide that a lesser period be served in confinement, suspend the remainder of the sentence and grant probation for a period longer than the sentence but not in excess of 5 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Thus the language of the statute indicates that, when a trial court suspends a sentence, it will impose probation as a matter of course. The connection between a suspended sentence and probation is also illustrated, albeit in a different context, in <em>Moats v. Scott, </em>358 Md. 593, 751 A.2d 462 (2000). There, the Court of Appeals explained the options available to a sentencing judge, including imposing a \u201csplit sentence\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">A third option-one that is frequently used-is the \u201csplit sentence\u201d provided for in \u00a7 641A(a)(3). That subsection allows a court to \u201cimpose a sentence for a specified period and provide that a lesser period be served in confinement, suspend the remainder of the sentence and grant probation for a period longer than the sentence but not in excess of 5 years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 595, 751 A.2d 462; <em>see also Cathcart v. State, </em>397 Md. 320, 327, 916 A.2d 1008 (2007)(stating that if a court imposes a split sentence, \u201cthere must be a period of probation attached to the suspended part of the sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The significance of the probationary period is explained in <em>State v. Dopkowski, </em>325 Md. 671, 602 A.2d 1185 (1992): \u201cThe trial court, upon its determination that a probationer has violated one or more conditions of probation, enjoys many options. \u2018These options vary from continuing the probation to reimposing the full remaining term of a suspended sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678, 602 A.2d 1185 (quoting <em>Maus v. State, </em>311 Md. 85, 107, 532 A.2d 1066 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Application To Plea Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>it is clear that a probationary period was implicit in the terms of the plea agreement. Although the prosecutor did not specifically discuss probation, he told the trial court that the only sentencing limitation in the agreement was that the \u201cactive cap,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the executed portion of the sentence, was three years. The written agreement recited that there could be additional suspended time and that there was \u201cno other sentencing limitation except that provided by law.\u201d Thus the agreement gave the trial court the author!<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>ty to suspend part of the sentence and impose probation, which it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Appellant cites <em>Laurie v. State, </em>29 Md.App. 609, 349 A.2d 276 (1976), arguing that this Court found the imposition of the \u201cimplied suspended sentence\u201d void. Appellant is incorrect. There was no \u201cimplied suspended sentence\u201d in that case because, under the statute, the trial court may impose probation only if he or she suspends a part of the sentence. <em>Benedict v. State, </em>377 Md. 1, 8, 831 A.2d 1060 (2003)(explain-ing that if the defendant violated probation, the court does not impose or reimpose a sentence, but \u201cmerely determines how much of the unserved part of the sentence the defendant must serve in prison.\u201d); Md.Code, Article 27, \u00a7 641A. As this Court explained in <em>Ridenour, </em>\u201ca lesser suspended period of years is carved out of the total sentence and is not executed.\u201d <em>Ridenour, </em>142 Md.App. at 7, 787 A.2d 815. In <em>Laurie, </em>there was no suspended or \u201cunserved\u201d portion of the sentence. 29 Md.App. at 612-13, 349 A.2d 276. In addition, the probationary portion of the sentence was unlawful because it was for an indefinite period. <em>Id. </em>at 614, 349 A.2d 276. Here, the transcript indicates that appellant\u2019s probation had a specific term, of which he was aware.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">We also conclude that a reasonable person in appellant\u2019s position would interpret the plea agreement to include probation. During the sentencing hearing, appellant affirmed as much when the trial judge warned him that, if he violated probation, he would \u201crun the risk of doing substantially all of the back up time.\u201d Appellant said that he understood. Neither appellant nor his counsel objected to the imposition of a probationary period or to any condition of probation. Indeed, at the end of the sentencing hearing, defense counsel said that he would read the order of probation to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Finally, because a period of probation must be attached to a suspended sentence, we hold that the right to impose a period of probation is included in any plea agreement that provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>for a suspended sentence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If we were to hold otherwise, the imposition of a suspended sentence would be meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Other courts have concluded that probation is part of a plea agreement that provides for a suspended sentence. In <em>State v. Brooke, </em>134 Idaho 807, 808, 10 P.3d 756, 757 (2000), the prosecutor agreed to recommend that Brooke be given a sentence of \u201ca one-year fixed penitentiary sentence, zero indeterminate; suspended, give him credit for time served, and have him do a psyehosexual eval prior to sentencing.\u201d At the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor \u201cacknowledged the terms of the plea agreement and made a recommendation for a one-year determinate term, suspended, with credit for time [] served.\u201d <em>Id., </em>134 Idaho at 809, 10 P.3d at 758. The prosecutor noted concerns about Brooke\u2019s evaluation, and requested that the court place Brooke on \u201ca highly supervised probation\u201d and to require Brooke to participate in a sex offender treatment program. <em>Id. </em>The trial court sentenced Brooke to a twelve year sentence with a four-year determinate term. <em>Id. </em>Brooke complained, <em>inter alia, </em>that the prosecutor violated the plea agreement by recommending probation with sex offender treatment. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals of Idaho disagreed, stating that \u201c[a] recommendation for a suspended sentence implicitly contemplates probation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court noted that the statute authorizing a suspended sentence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB3\">empowers a court to \u201csuspend the execution of the judgment ... <em>and </em>place the defendant on probation under such terms and conditions as it deems necessary and expedient.\u201d The conjunctive \u201cand\u201d in this statute indicates that the suspension of a sentence is always to be accompanied by an order of probation. Moreover, it is inherent in the concept of a suspended sentence that the suspension can be revoked, and the sentence executed, if the defendant does not comply with conditions of the suspension. If the \u201csuspension\u201d were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>not revocable, it would not be a suspension but, rather, a commutation of the sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-5\"><em>Id., </em>134 Idaho at 809-10, 10 P.3d at 758-59. (Emphasis in original). The Court concluded that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s request for probation was not a term that was inconsistent with, or even in addition to, the recommendation for a suspended sentence which was an express term of the plea agreement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">In <em>State v. Winer, </em>69 Conn.App. 738, 796 A.2d 491, <em>cert. denied, </em>261 Conn. 909, 806 A.2d 50 (2002), the Appellate Court of Connecticut rejected Winer\u2019s contention that a sentence of eight years, with all but two years suspended, followed by five years of probation, exceeded the terms of his plea agreement. There, Winer had agreed to plead guilty in exchange for a maximum of two years\u2019 incarceration. <em>Winer, </em>69 Conn.App. at 746, 796 A.2d at 497. The court noted that, at sentencing, Winer agreed to \u201can executed sentence of two years incarceration, plus a suspended sentence that could be as long as thirty years.\u201d <em>Id., </em>69 Conn.App. at 748, 796 A.2d at 497. The court further noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">While not required to serve a sentence when imposed, a suspended sentence contemplates the possibility that the defendant could be required to serve the sentence imposed at some later time. It is disingenuous for the defendant now to state that he thought that the maximum amount of time he could be incarcerated for was limited to two years when he specifically acknowledged that he could receive a suspended sentence of up to thirty years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-8\"><em>Id., </em>69 Conn.App. at 748, 796 A.2d at 498. The court also opined that Winer\u2019s failure to object to the probation for a period of fourteen months made \u201cclear that [Winer] contemplated a period of probation when he entered into his plea agreement.\u201d <em>Id., </em>69 Conn.App. at 753, 796 A.2d at 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\"><em>Gammarano v. United States, </em>732 F.2d 273 (2nd Cir.1984), is also instructive. There, Gammarano had pled guilty pursuant to an agreement that his sentence not be longer than two years. <em>Id. </em>at 274. At the sentencing hearing, the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>suspended the imposition of a sentence and placed Gammarano on probation for five years and imposed a fine. <em>Id. </em>at 275. Gammarano agreed in writing to conditions of probation extending five years. <em>Id. </em>He protested the length of the probation only after he had committed another offense. <em>Id. </em>The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded that the five-year period had not violated Gammarano\u2019s \u201creasonable expectation under the plea agreement,\u201d opining that \u201chis inaction indicates that the probation term satisfied his expectations under the plea agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Here, too, appellant\u2019s conduct demonstrated both an understanding and an agreement to the imposition of a probationary period. As previously stated, appellant not only indicated to the court his understanding that he would be placed on probation, but failed to object to the probationary period or its conditions. More importantly, his over five years of inaction clearly shows that the sentence imposed met his reasonable expectations under the plea agreement. It is disingenuous for him to now claim, when his probation has been revoked, that he did not consider the probation to be a component of the agreement, and thus his suspended sentence of seventeen years was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">The sentence imposed was in accordance with the plea agreement that appellant entered into. The trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to correct an illegal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-13\">. Because appellant\u2019s question deals solely with his plea agreement, we need not discuss the facts of the offenses with which appellant was charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-10\">. The transcript indicates that defense counsel responded to the trial court\u2019s inquiry, but the context suggests that it was appellant who answered the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b429-7\">. In <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 37, 91 S.Ct. 160, 167, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970), the United States Supreme Court held that when there was a factual basis for a guilty plea, a State could permit an individual accused of a crime to enter a guilty plea without admitting his participation in the crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b431-8\">.
