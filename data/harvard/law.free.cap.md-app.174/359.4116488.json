Co. v. Bryan, </em>103 Md. 514, 539-40, 525, 64 A. 44 (1906). The rule in <em>Belvidere </em>was reaffirmed in 1930 and again in 1937. <em>See Owners\u2019 Realty Co. of Baltimore City v.

Since 1937, no Maryland appellate decision has been called upon to decide whether the rule first enunciated in <em>Belvidere </em>is still binding precedent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>On August 30, 2000, Jane Correia was a passenger in an elevator owned and operated by Johns Hopkins Health Services Company and Johns Hopkins Hospital (hereinafter collectively \u201cJohns Hopkins\u201d or \u201cappellant\u201d). The elevator came to a sudden stop because of a mechanical defect. Due to injuries allegedly caused by this malfunction, Mrs. Correia and her husband sued Johns Hopkins, and others, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for negligence. The matter was considered by a jury in October 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The Correias introduced evidence that showed that, in the six months prior to the accident, Johns Hopkins had received thirty-two complaints about the elevator Mrs. Correia was in when the accident occurred. The thirty-two complaints, if accurate, indicated that at various times prior to the accident the elevator was dropping, jumping, jerking, skipping, and sometimes trapping passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">At the end of a nine-day trial, the court gave the jury the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">The owner of a passenger elevator, in this case ... Johns Hopkins is the owner of the passenger elevator[,] is bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>to exercise to the highest degree of care and skill and diligence ... practicable under the circumstances to guard against injury to individuals riding on those elevators. This rule of law applies to the owner of the elevator only. It does not apply to the service company [co-defendant] Schindler [Elevator Company].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of Mrs. Correia in the amount of $264,500 and separate $35,500 verdict in favor of Mr. and Mrs. Correia, jointly, for loss of consortium. Both verdicts were against Johns Hopkins; the jury found that co-defendant Schindler Elevator Company was not negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In this appeal, Johns Hopkins contends, among other things, that the trial judge committed reversible error in giving the instruction quoted above. According to appellant, the owner of a self-operating elevator owes a passenger the same duty that any other property owner owes its invitee, i.e., the duty to use reasonable care to see that the portion of the property that the invitee is expected to use is safe. In support of its position, Johns Hopkins advances four major arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">First, according to Johns Hopkins, \u201cthe application of a common carrier theory of liability to modern building owners is no longer appropriate,\u201d although such a heightened standard of care \u201cmay have been appropriate one hundred years ago when <em>Belvidere </em>decided the question as a matter of first impression.\u201d Second, \u201cthe cases upon which the trial court\u201d relied in giving the instruction at issue are factually distinguishable from this case. Third, the instruction should not have been given because elevator owners are not common carriers under Maryland law. Fourth, since <em>Belvidere </em>was decided, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals has decided a case that suggests that \u201cthe proper standard of care for an elevator owner is that of reasonable care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The common law rule in the District of Columbia and fourteen of our sister states is in accord with Johns Hopkins\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>position that the duty of an owner or operator of an elevator to its passengers is to use ordinary or reasonable care and not the highest degree of care. <em>See Lowrey v.

(Beale, <em>The History of the Carrier\u2019s Liability </em>in Selected Essays in Anglo-American Legal History (Assn, of Am. Law Schools, edit., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>1909) p. 148.) Carriers of goods are bailees and, at \u201cearly law goods bailed were absolutely at the risk of the bailee.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, carriers of goods for reward were \u201c \u2018responsible absolutely for the goods delivered, even when lost by theft, and regardless of negligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 149, fn. 4)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">The precursor to recognizing a heightened duty of care for carriers of persons came in 1680, when an English court applied the rule regarding carriers of goods to personal property that a passenger on a stagecoach had delivered to the driver, but which the driver failed to return at the end of the journey. <em>(Lovette v. Hobbs </em>(1680) 89 Eng.Rep. 836.) The court rejected the argument that the driver of a stagecoach could not be a common carrier regarding property brought by a passenger, stating: \u201c[I]f a coachman commonly carries] goods, and take[s] money for so doing, he will be in the same case with a common carrier, and is a carrier for that purpose, whether the goods are a passenger\u2019s or a stranger\u2019s____\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 837.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">The extension of applying the heightened duty of care for carriers of goods to carriers of persons for reward \u201cis probably of American origin, finding its earliest expression in 1839 in <em>Stokes v. Saltonstall </em>[38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 181, 10 L.Ed. 115, 1839 WL 4317 (1839)].\u201d (3 Harper &amp; James, The Law of Torts, <em>supra, </em>The Nature of Negligence, \u00a7 16.14, p. 507.) In <em>Stokes, </em>a passenger in a stagecoach was injured when the coach was upset. The court notes that a carrier of goods was absolutely liable for the loss of or damage to such goods regardless of the cause \u201cexcept the act of God, and the public enemy,\u201d but recognized that \u201ca contract to carry passengers differs from a contract to carry goods.\u201d <em>(Stokes, supra, </em>38 U.S. at p. 191.) \u201cBut although he does not warrant the safety of the passengers, at all events, yet his undertaking and liability as to them, go to this extent: that he ... shall possess competent skill; and that as far as human care and foresight can go, he will transport them safely.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Restating this standard, the court required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>the driver to act \u201cwith reasonable skill, and with the utmost prudence and caution.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 193.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">29 Cal.Rptr.3d 352, 113 P.3d at 43 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Today the leading case in Maryland equating the duty owed to a passenger by the owner/operator of an elevator to that of a common carrier is still <em>Belvidere. </em>In <em>Belvidere, </em>the plaintiff, a guest at a hotel, was riding in an elevator that was manned by a Belvedere Hotel employee. 103 Md. at 526-27, 64 A. 44. The plaintiff was in the process of stepping out of the elevator onto the second floor when the elevator started downward, which caused the plaintiff to fall for a distance of twelve to fourteen feet. <em>Id. </em>The trial judge in <em>Belvidere </em>instructed the jury that the hotel owed the highest degree of care toward its elevator passengers. The question addressed in <em>Belvidere </em>was whether that instruction was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The <em>Belvidere </em>Court said that the instruction accurately stated the law. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">There appears to be an entire concurrence among the standard text writers upon this subject in supporting the instruction given in this case. <em>Shearman and Redfield on Negligence </em>state the law thus: \u201cFor the same reason \u2014 a regard for human life \u2014 that common carriers are required to exercise the highest degree of care for the safety of their passengers, irrespective of any contract of carriage, a like degree of care is exacted of a landlord in transporting persons by elevator between the several floors of his building. <em>He is therefore bound, to use the greatest care, not only in providing, safe and suitable cars, appliances, and machinery for control, but also in managing these means of transportation.\u201d </em>Vol. 2, \u00a7 719A. The passage cited from this author, \u00a7 719 in <em>[People\u2019s Bank v. Morgolofski, </em>75 Md. 432, 23 A. 1027 (1892)], will be found to refer to elevator <em>shafts </em>left open as places of danger to those engaged near them, and not to the operation of the elevator itself as a means of transportation for those authorized to use it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqco\">103 Md. at 535-36, 64 A. 44 (some emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The <em>Belvidere </em>Court then proceeded to analyze cases from numerous other jurisdictions dealing with the duty owed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>passengers by the owner/operator <em>of </em>elevators. <em>Id. </em>at 536-40, 64 A. 44. The Court concluded its opinion by stating that it adopted the views expressed by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in <em>Fox v. Philadelphia, </em>208 Pa. 127, 57 A. 356 (1904), because that decision was \u201cgrounded both in reason and authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540, 57 A. 356. The views expressed in the <em>Fox </em>case and adopted by the Court of Appeals were these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">\u201cThe foundation of the rule for the protection of a passenger is in the undertaking of the common carrier which is to carry safely; but another reason for it is, that when the passenger commits himself to the carrier he does so in ignorance of the machinery and appliances (as well as their defects) used in connection with the means of transportation, and becomes a passive and helpless creature in the hands of the transportation company and its agents. For the same reason, this rule should be extended to those who operate elevators for carrying passengers from one story of a building to another. When they undertake to carry they undertake to carry safely. If it is not their express agreement to do so, it is surely an implied one, and the condition of a passenger caged in a suspended car, is one not only of utter ignorance of what has been done or ought to be done for his safety, but of absolute passiveness and pitiable helplessness when confronted with danger against which human knowledge, skill and foresight ought to have guarded; and the rule has been so extended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting Fox, 57 A. at 358).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Twenty-four years after <em>Belvidere </em>was decided, the Court of Appeals, in <em>Richardson, </em>was once again called upon to examine the duty owed by an owner of an elevator toward its passengers. 158 Md. at 370-71, 148 A. 543. In <em>Richardson, </em>the plaintiff was injured as she was about to board a self-operated elevator. <em>Id. </em>at 371, 148 A. 543. According to the plaintiff, she shoved an elevator door aside and then encountered a \u201csecond door or gate of the elevator\u201d that barred her entrance. <em>Id. </em>at 370, 148 A. 543. The second door had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>small knob, which the plaintiff took hold of to release the latch that controlled the entrance into the elevator car. The plaintiff testified that \u201cshe had barely touched the knob when the elevator door slammed back very rapidly, startling her, and catching her finger\u201d in the door with such force \u201cas to swing her around\u201d as the door closed. <em>Id. </em>at 370-71, 148 A. 543. The plaintiff injured her fingers as a result of the action of the elevator door. In <em>Richardson, </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\"><em>The defendant was engaged in the carriage of its tenants and their servants and visitors by means of an automatic elevator, which was operated by those using it without any assistance, direction, or supervision by the defendant. </em>It was an economical method to cast the burden of its operation upon those having occasion to go to and from the several apartments of the six storied building, but the knowledge of the defendant that it would be run by a number of persons, who would represent a wide range of age, experience, intelligence, and capacity, <em>cast upon the defendant all the more care in the selection and maintenance of the mechanical device which was adopted by this general service. </em>The rule approved by this court is that the landlord <em>engaged in transporting passengers by elevators must exercise great care not only in their operation but in providing safe and suitable equipment. </em>It is a rule which has its sanction in sound public policy, which exacts a high degree of care where security of person and life is frequently involved, under circumstances in which the carrier is in control of the movement <em>or of the equipment. Belvidere Bldg. Co. v. Bryan, </em>103 Md. 514, 534-540, 64 A. 44; <em>Shearman &amp; Redfield on Negligence </em>(6th Ed.), \u00a7 719a and notes; <em>Cooley on Torts </em>(3rd Ed.), p. 1378.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">The smallness of the knob and its closeness to the upright would naturally cause the fingers of the hand of the user to project and be caught and injured between the closing laths of the collapsible door, provided their movement was so rapid as not to afford a warning and opportunity for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>user to let go the knob and withdraw the fingers in time to avoid injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 371, 148 A. 543 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>the plaintiff was in the defendant\u2019s store when she decided to exit an elevator that had been stopped by a store employee at the third floor. 172 Md. at 57, 190 A. 763. The floor of the elevator car, however, was approximately four inches above the level of the third floor. <em>Id. </em>According to the plaintiff, as she lifted her right foot to step to the floor of the building, the elevator dropped suddenly, causing plaintiff to lose her balance and to fall in such a manner as to cause the lower part of her back to strike the elevator car. <em>Id. </em>The Court, citing <em>Belvidere, </em>various text writers, and precedent from other states, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">Many authorities hold that one operating a passenger elevator is a common carrier, and the rule seems almost universal that the degree of care due by the owner of a passenger elevator to those who are expressly or impliedly invited to ride therein is similar to that which a common carrier owes its passengers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 60,190 A. 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The <em>O\u2019Neill </em>Court went on to say that \u201cthe carrier of a person by elevator is required to exercise the highest degree of care and diligence to prevent injury to such person,\u201d <em>id., </em>and that, in light of the rule set forth in <em>Belvidere, </em>the question as to the applicable duty of care was no longer \u201can open one in this state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61,190 A. 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">In the subject case, Johns Hopkins argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-10\">[T]he application of a common carrier theory of liability to modern building owners is no longer appropriate. Such a heightened standard of care may have been appropriate one hundred years ago when <em>Belvidere </em>decided the question as a matter of first impression. However, advancements in the elevator industry and distinctions between elevator owners and common carriers have dissolved many of the justifications for holding elevator owners to the heightened standard applicable to common carriers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>... [C]ommon carrier liability is no longer appropriate for elevator owners because human attendants have been replaced by automatic elevators. In the past, the presence of human attendants justified a heightened standard of liability for elevator owners in two respects. First, elevator attendants were hired, trained, and supervised by the building\u2019s owner, and acted as agents of the building owners. When elevators were operated by persons analogous to bus drivers, taxi drivers, or locomotive engineers, elevator owners bore more similarity to common carriers. Additionally, the presence of human attendants raised the risk of operation by introducing the element of human error. Today, the invention of the automatic elevator has eliminated the nexus between the elevator owner and the active negligence of the human attendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">The passenger elevator was first made possible in 1853 when Elisha Otis invented a safety clamp that prevented elevator cars from falling if the hoist rope broke. 8 <em>New Encyclopedia Britannica </em>1042 (1995). The first such elevator was installed in a building in the United States in 1857, about forty-nine years prior to the <em>Belvidere </em>decision. <em>Id. See also Dallas Mkt. Ctr. Dev. Co. v. Liedeker, </em>958 S.W.2d at 384. As Johns Hopkins stresses, there have been many scientific advancements in elevator technology in the last century. But we fail to see why advancement in elevator technology should <em>reduce </em>the duty owed by owners/operators of elevators to elevator passengers. Such scientific advancements have not changed the fact that an elevator, if not maintained and operated with the highest degree of care, is now, as it was when <em>Belvidere </em>was decided, \u201cin many respects a dangerous machine.\u201d <em>Belvidere, </em>103 Md. 514, 64 A. 44. Moreover, the fact that technology has improved in the last century does not impact upon the main reasons the <em>Belvidere </em>rule was adopted in the first place, i.e., in almost all cases when a passenger steps into an elevator, he or she does so in ignorance of any defects that might exist in the appliance and is \u201ca passive and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>helpless creature in the hands of the\u201d owner/operator of the device. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">At the time <em>Belvidere </em>was decided, the highest degree of care was almost universally imposed in the United States on common carriers who transported human passengers. Since then, motor buses have replaced the stage coach, taxi cabs have replaced Hanson cabs, and overall transportation and safety technology has improved exponentially. Yet the duty owed by the common carrier to its passengers has remained constant. This being so, we can see no principled reason why the duty owed to an elevator passenger should be reduced simply because of technological advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">We agree with appellant\u2019s point that, unlike the situation existing one hundred years ago when the <em>Belvidere </em>case was decided, almost all elevators in this country are now self-operated. We disagree, however, with Johns Hopkins\u2019 contention that the presence of a human elevator attendant in <em>Belvidere </em>constituted, in part, justification for the higher standard of care enunciated in that case. First, the higher standard of care mentioned in <em>Belvidere </em>was said to be imposed not only upon the elevator attendant but also upon the owner of the elevator who was required to \u201cuse the greatest care\u201d in providing \u201csafe and suitable cars, appliances, and machinery.\u201d 103 Md. at 535, 64 A. 44. This point was reinforced in <em>Richardson, </em>decided about seventy-five years ago, which dealt with a plaintiff injured while entering onto a self-operated elevator. 158 Md. at 371, 148 A. 543. In the <em>Richardson </em>case, the Court of Appeals affirmed a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and in doing so held that the elevator owner owed the highest degree of care not only in the operation of the elevator but also \u201cin providing safe and suitable equipment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That holding is important in this case because the primary act of negligence alleged against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Johns Hopkins was that it did not provide safe and suitable equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The Ohio Court of Appeals has ruled that the duty to exercise the highest degree of care</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak2\">is even more exacting in the case of automatic elevators because of their distinguishing features from manually operated elevators designed to be run by an attendant, where the automatic elevator is designed to be operated by its passengers without the assistance of a trained attendant, and because of these automatic features it is said that operating owners and ones under contract to service and inspect must act with a higher degree of care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"><em>Norman v. Thomas Emery\u2019s Sons, Inc., </em>7 Ohio App.2d 41, 218 N.E.2d 480, 482 (1966). We need not go so far as the Ohio Court of Appeals did in <em>Norman. </em>For our purposes, it suffices to say that we can see no good reason to reduce the duty owed by the owner of an elevator simply because the elevator installed is automatic rather than one operated by an attendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Appellant next argues that common carrier liability is now inappropriate because building owners no longer service and maintain their elevators. In this regard, Johns Hopkins stresses that it paid co-defendant Schindler Elevator Company, a licensed elevator contractor, $36,000.00 per month to ensure that the elevators on its property operated safety and effectively; moreover, argues appellant, Johns Hopkins, at the time of the accident, \u201cwas not an expert in the inspection, maintenance, repair, replacement, or safety of [its] elevators.\u201d By contrast, according to appellant, when <em>Belvidere </em>was decided, the Court was addressing a situation where the owner of the premises, the Belvedere Hotel, had its own engineer who maintained the elevators and was on duty at the time of the accident. <em>See Belvidere, </em>103 Md. at 530, 64 A. 44. While Johns Hopkins does not say so directly, it impliedly argues that the duty to use the highest degree of care should be held to be delegable because it, unlike the licensed elevator contractor it hired, does not have the requisite expertise to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>perform the necessary elevator maintenance and repair. While it may be true that Johns Hopkins is lacking in expertise \u2014 as far as elevator maintenance is concerned \u2014 it does not follow logically that it therefore does not have the duty of exercising the highest duty of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Appellant cites no case from any jurisdiction standing for the proposition that the higher duty of care is owed only in situations where the elevator owner performs its own maintenance and repair. Moreover, we can see no appropriate reason for such a rule, inasmuch as, in many elevator cases (including the one <em>sub </em>judice), one of the acts of negligence alleged against the owner/ operator is that the defendant failed to call in an expert to fix the elevator after it was put on notice that the elevator was malfunctioning.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Additionally, in a number of cases from sister jurisdictions, which apply the same rule as set forth in <em>Belvidere, </em>the Court has held that the owners/operators had the duty to exercise the highest degree of care for the safety of their passengers, even though, in those cases, the owner had hired third parties to perform elevator maintenance work. <em>See Little Rock Land Co. v. Raper, </em>433 S.W.2d at 840; <em>Kentucky Home Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Wise, </em>364 S.W.2d at 339; <em>Otis Elevator Co. v. Seale, </em>334 F.2d at 929 (applying Louisiana law); <em>Cash v. Otis Elevator Co., </em>684 P.2d at 1042; <em>M &amp; R Inv. Co. v. Anzalotti, </em>773 P.2d at 730; <em>Norman v. Thomas Emery\u2019s Sons, Inc., </em>218 N.E.2d at 481; and <em>Smith v. Munger, </em>532 P.2d at 1203-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we reject Johns Hopkins\u2019 argument that the rule first enunciated in <em>Belvidere </em>should be either overruled or modified simply because the owner/operator of the elevator has contracted with a third party to maintain and repair that device.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Johns Hopkins also argues that the <em>Belvidere </em>rule should be overruled because \u201celevator transport shares little in common with carriers.\u201d Appellant\u2019s argument continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\">Maryland courts emphasize that common carriers are of a \u201cpublic\u201d nature; they have variously been described as satisfying an \u201curgent public need\u201d serving the public \u201cindiscriminately\u201d and \u201caffect[ing] the public interest.\u201d <em>Gunther v. Smith, </em>78 Md.App. 508, 510, 553 A.2d 1314 ... (1989).... Additionally, common carriers are obligated to \u201cserve all who apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In contrast, Johns Hopkins is a private institution. Although Johns Hopkins elevators may well serve a large number of people, Johns Hopkins does not undertake to transport the public in the manner of a common carrier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">Additionally, unlike common carriers, elevator owners do not charge fares. Maryland case law has noted that the heightened standard available to common carriers arises in part from the fact that the passenger compensates the carrier for safe passage, thus creating a \u201ccontract of transportation.\u201d <em>St. Michelle v. Catania, </em>252 Md. 647, 654, 250 A.2d 874 ... (1969) (plaintiff who was robbed and raped by taxicab driver was deemed a passenger because contract of transportation had not been completed); <em>Ragonese v. Hilferty, </em>231 Md. 520, 526, 191 A.2d 422 ... (1963) (compensated carrier owes the highest degree of care to their passengers); <em>Belvidere[,] </em>103 Md. at 539, 64 A. 44 ... (owner of building and elevator receive no compensation for transporting passengers and was not a common carrier).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Arguably at least, it may be true, as Johns Hopkins contends, that \u201celevator transport shares little in common with [common] carriers.\u201d There is usually no contract of carriage, fares are almost never charged, and ofttimes the public at large is not invited into the facility where the elevators are located. But the same was true when <em>Belvidere </em>was decided. Moreover, it should be noted that the <em>Belvidere </em>Court specifically said that the owner/operator of an elevator was <em>not </em>a common carrier. 103 Md. at 539, 64 A. 44. The court\u2019s reference to common carrier liability plainly was made in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>order to show that the duties undertaken by the owner/operator of an elevator were the same as the responsibilities undertaken by a common carrier, and thus each should have a similar duty to protect their passengers from harm. <em>Id. </em>at 540, 64 A. 44 (quoting <em>Fox v. Philadelphia, </em>208 Pa. 127, 57 A. 356 (1904)). See also language used by the <em>Belvidere </em>Court at 103 Md. at 535, 64 A. 44 (\u201cFor the same reason \u2014 a regard for human life \u2014 that common carriers are required to exercise the highest degree of care for the safety of their passengers irrespective of any contract of carriage \u2014 a like degree of care is exacted of a landlord in transporting persons by elevator between the several floors of his building.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Johns Hopkins also claims that the higher duty of care set forth in <em>Belvidere </em>should be abandoned because that standard \u201chas been applied to elevator owners [only] in a limited number of cases since its inception.\u201d This argument is unpersuasive. Unless a case can be distinguished on its facts, this Court does not have the option of disregarding Court of Appeals\u2019 decisions that have not been overruled, no matter how old the precedent may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Appellant\u2019s penultimate assertion concerning the court\u2019s instruction is that \u201cthere is case law in Maryland supporting the proposition that the duty of an elevator owner to a passenger is that owed by a property owner to an invitee.\u201d Johns Hopkins points out that in the case of <em>Swann v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America, </em>95 Md.App. 365, 620 A.2d 989 (1993), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Dover Elevator Co. v. Swann, </em>334 Md. 231, 638 A.2d 762 (1994), the jury was instructed that the elevator owner owed the plaintiff/invitee the duty of reasonable care. <em>Id. </em>at 416, 638 A.2d 762. In the course of a forty-nine page opinion, \u201c[w]e perceive[d] no error\u201d in giving the aforementioned instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 417, 638 A.2d 762. The \u201c[w]e perceive no error\u201d statement was made in response to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the court erred when it failed to instruct the jury that the property owner had \u201ca non-delegable duty to correct all unreasonable risks, or to warn invitees of them, if they knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>or should have known of such risks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416, 638 A.2d 762. Johns Hopkins maintains that the statement by the <em>Swann </em>Court implies that the rule set forth in <em>Belvidere </em>was considered to be no longer applicable. That argument has no merit. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney in <em>Swann </em>never suggested that the rule first enunciated in <em>Belvidere </em>should be followed, and <em>Belvidere </em>and its progeny was not even mentioned in our opinion. Under such circumstances, the \u201cwe perceive no error\u201d statement was non-binding dicta insofar as the <em>Belvidere </em>rule is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Lastly, Johns Hopkins contends that the instruction given by the trial judge concerning the heightened standard of care was bound to have confused the jury because the court also instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">Now, an invitee is a person who is invited or permitted to be on another person\u2019s property for purposes related to the owner or occupant\u2019s business. The duty owed to an invitee is reasonable care to see that the portions of the property which the invitee may be expected to use are safe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ao-\">Appellant\u2019s counsel never contended at trial that the instructions were confusing. Thus, this issue is not preserved for review. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-520(e) (\u201cNo party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">In summary, we hold that in Maryland the legal principles first enunciated in <em>Belvidere </em>are still applicable. The owner of an elevator presently owes passengers the duty to exercise the highest degree of care and skill in operating and maintaining the device. The trial judge did not err in instructing the jury as to the duty owed by Johns Hopkins to Mrs. Correia.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Johns Hopkins also contends that on several occasions the trial court committed reversible error in allowing plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>counsel to ask questions that should have been disallowed and in denying its motion for mistrial. The facts set forth in Section A below are pertinent to those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Johns Hopkins, at all times here relevant, owned and operated 120 elevators. Four of those elevators were in the Nelson Building, which was located on the East Campus of Johns Hopkins Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">For several years prior to July 1, 2000, appellant\u2019s elevators were maintained by Montgomery Kone Elevator Company. In the spring of 2000, however, Johns Hopkins put out for competitive bidding a contract for the maintenance of the elevators. The successful bidder was Millar Elevator Service Company, now known as Schindler Elevator Company (referred to hereinafter as \u201cSchindler\u201d). Schindler took over maintenance of the elevators on July 1, 2000, which was approximately two months before Mrs. Correia\u2019s accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Prior to the acceptance of its bid, Schindler proposed to install new equipment in the four Nelson Budding elevators. The exact work to be performed was not mentioned, however, nor was a specific price set.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">On August 30, 2000, Jane Correia was a passenger on Elevator No. 2 in the Nelson Building. This slow-speed (357 feet per minute) elevator was descending from the fifth to the first floor when it came to an unexpected and abrupt stop. Mrs. Correia, who had previous back problems, immediately complained of significant pain in her back due to the jolt she received as a result of the stop. She was taken by wheelchair to the Johns Hopkins Emergency Room and later underwent surgeries due to injuries she claimed were caused by the elevator\u2019s malfunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Sometime in September 2000, two representatives of Schindler inspected the four elevators in the Nelson Building.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>inspection was not as a result of Mrs. Correia\u2019s accident. Instead, the inspection was made as a follow-up to the proposal Schindler made before it was awarded the maintenance contract by Johns Hopkins. The purpose of the inspection was to allow Schindler to make a proposal concerning what upgrades were needed in the four Nelson elevators, to specify the exact work that needed to be performed, and to propose a price.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">One of Schindler\u2019s representatives who inspected the elevators in September 2000 was Charles Stump (\u201cStump\u201d). He supervised other Schindler mechanics who worked at Johns Hopkins to make sure they did their jobs properly, and he was Schindler\u2019s man in charge of the elevators at Johns Hopkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">When Stump made his September 2000 inspection, he did so in the company of one of Schindler\u2019s elevator mechanics. After the inspection, Stump prepared an \u201cupgrade/repair proposal\u201d and sent it to Johns Hopkins on October 6, 2000 \u2014 about five weeks after the subject accident. This upgrade/repair proposal (hereafter \u201cthe October 6 report\u201d) was marked for identification at trial as plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 54. It was not, however, introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">At trial, Stump was asked numerous questions about the observations he had made concerning the four Nelson elevators as reflected in the October 6 report. In the excerpt from the report set forth below, we have emphasized the portion of plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 54 about which Stump was asked questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap4V\">REPLACE CAR DOOR GIBS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\"><em>The [elevator] car door gibs, which are what guide the door panel in alignment, are very worn or damaged. </em>These gibs should be replaced with new ones to prevent car door problems and costly repairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">REPLACE CAR DOOR HANGERS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\"><em>Your elevator car door hangers are worn, damaged or do not meet current safety standards. </em>To meet code and avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>undue and costly breakdowns, they should be replaced with modern hangers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">REPLACE CAR DOOR CLUTCH</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">The existing car door clutch assembly shall be replaced in order to facilitate the installation of the new door operator and associated equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">HOISTWAY:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">REPLACE DOOR OPERATOR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\"><em>Your door operator no longer meets safety code. It is worn\u25a0, damaged </em>and components are becoming increasingly more difficult to obtain due to [obsolescence]. To achieve reliable as well as safe operation, your existing door operator should be replaced with a current model.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmW\">REPLACE HOISTWAY DOOR INTERLOCKS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av0\"><em>The present interlocks are damaged, or do not comply with current code requirements. This presents a potential safety hazard. </em>The interlocks should be replaced with new ones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">REPLACE HOISTWAY DOOR HANGERS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\"><em>The present door hangers are worn, damaged or do not meet current safety standards. </em>They should be replaced with hangers conforming to current code requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD3\">REPLACE HOISTWAY DOOR GIBS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aei\"><em>The present door gibs, which are what guide and hold the door panel in alignment, are worn or damaged. </em>To avoid door opening/closing problems, new gibs should be installed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">At trial, Patrick McPartland, an elevator expert called by plaintiffs, explained that an elevator interlock device is a mechanism that insures that the elevator will not run with the door open. He opined that the subject accident occurred when \u201cthe [descending] elevator clipped the interlock\u201d and caused the elevator to come \u201cto an unexpected abrupt stop and reverse directions.\u201d He further testified that it was unusual for an elevator, such as the one in which Mrs. Correia was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>riding, to come to such an abrupt stop. In Mr. McPartland\u2019s opinion, the reason that the interlock mechanism was \u201cclipped\u201d by the elevator was because \u201cthe door components, the roller, the gibs [, the devices that guide and hold the door panels in alignment, as well as other] ... components of the door were not properly maintained, [and were] broken or in bad condition\u201d at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">B. <em>The Court\u2019s Grant of a Continuing Objection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">On October 4, 2005, which was the first day of trial, counsel for Schindler and Johns Hopkins jointly voiced their concern that plaintiffs\u2019 attorney might attempt to introduce into evidence testimony concerning the fact that after the accident Johns Hopkins had \u201cmodernized\u201d the elevators in the Nelson Building.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Counsel for the Correias assured the court that the plaintiffs did not intend to introduce evidence of subsequent remedial repairs. One of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel said, however, that he did intend to say in opening statement that (1) Stump inspected the elevators in the Nelson Building and prepared a report (i.e., plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 54) based on that inspection; and (2) Stump said in his deposition that the worn and damaged condition of the elevator components in the Nelson Building that he saw when he inspected the elevators were not conditions that occurred overnight but instead were conditions that would have been in existence for at least two months before his inspection. The court ruled that counsel could relate in opening statement what Stump observed when he inspected the elevators, but post-accident repairs or post-accident repair recommendations could not be mentioned. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>that point, defense counsel did not object to the court\u2019s resolution of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">On the second day of trial, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel called Stump as a witness. Counsel for both defendants made an oral motion <em>in limine </em>in which they objected to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s being allowed to ask Stump about the observations he made in September 2000. The first ground for exclusion raised by defense counsel was that Stump\u2019s September 2000 observations as to the condition of the elevators were not relevant to an accident that occurred prior to those observations. The second ground for objection was that the testimony of Stump about his September observations ran afoul of Maryland Rule 5-407, which, with certain inapplicable exceptions, prohibits introduction of evidence concerning remedial repairs made post-accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The court ruled that Stump would not be allowed to testify as to any post-accident repairs or recommendations for repairs. Concerning the relevancy of Stump\u2019s observations made in September 2000, the court said that the observations were relevant because (according to appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s proffer) the worn and defective condition of the elevator components \u201cobviously didn\u2019t just get that way overnight\u201d and therefore represented the condition of the elevators when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Stump testified on direct examination that he had worked about twenty years in the elevator industry and had been trained, for about three-and-one-half years, as an apprentice elevator mechanic. As an apprentice, he served as a helper to mechanics and learned how elevators worked. Since 1989, he had worked as an elevator sales representative whose duties included advising customers as to what they needed to do in terms of preventative maintenance for elevators. When he prepares proposals concerning the condition of a customer\u2019s elevator, like he did when he prepared his October 6 report, he does so with the assistance of a mechanic superintendent, i.e., a person who supervises other elevator mechanics. The proposals he prepares include, without direct attribution, ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>servations made by the maintenance superintendent. The proposals are based on Stump\u2019s expertise and that of the maintenance superintendent. At that point of Stump\u2019s testimony, a bench conference occurred, and the trial court granted both defense counsel \u201ca continuing objection\u201d to any questions put to Stump regarding the observations he made in September 2000, as reflected in the October 6 report he signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">On direct examination, Stump was asked whether \u201cafter July 1, 2000,\u201d he, along with an elevator maintenance superintendent, performed an inspection of the door equipment in the elevators located in the Nelson Building. Initially, Stump said he could not remember doing such an inspection. His memory improved when he was shown Exhibit 54, which he admitted he had written. Stump then attempted to evade responsibility for statements that appear in the report by saying that the report was written based on a computer program, which he called a \u201cmacro system,\u201d whereby one simply \u201cclicked ... a mouse\u201d and the computer caused the statements in the report to be made. According to Stump, the words spewed forth by the computer could not be edited. For obvious reasons, that explanation was not accepted by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. Eventually plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was successful in casting substantial doubt on the veracity of the \u201cmacro system\u201d excuse when he and Stump engaged in the following exchange.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">PLAINTIFFS\u2019 COUNSEL: Now, let\u2019s talk a little bit about this observation that you put in your report, observation that you arrived at based on your inspection in September. You had to affirmatively hit a key or button or something to make that statement appear in that report, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">Q. So it took intentional acts by you to make sure something goes into the report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Q. You are not testifying in front of the members of the jury that was some kind of wild mistake that that language was in this report, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">Q. And you are also telling these ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that the language that went into this report was language you wanted to be in there, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">Q. You signed this report at the end, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">Q. You testified both in deposition and today that every word in that report was true and accurate; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">A. That\u2019s my testimony, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-11\">Q. You also read through this document before you sent it out, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-13\">Q. Make sure it wasn\u2019t [sic] a typo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-15\">Q. Make sure there wasn\u2019t a factual mistake?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-17\">While on direct examination, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel steered clear of any question that might elicit a response from Stump indicating what repairs he had recommended. Instead, the examination focused on statements made in the report as to the condition of the elevators in the Nelson Building that he observed, e.g., \u201cgibs are very worn or damaged,\u201d car door hangers \u201care worn, damaged, or do not meet current safety standards,\u201d \u201cpresent interlocks are damaged, or do not comply with current code requirements ... presenting] a potential safety hazard.\u201d In regard to the problem with-the interlocks, Stump testified, without objection, that if the interlock is worn or damaged this creates a safety hazard because it can cause the elevator to make an abrupt, unexpected stop. Stump further testified on direct examination that, based on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>observations, the problems he observed were \u201clongstanding\u201d and were present \u201ceven before July of 2000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Shortly before direct examination was concluded, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel asked Stump to read to the jury what he had written concerning his observations of the \u201choistway door hangers ... door gibs and ... door rollers.\u201d His answer to that question was: \u201cThe present door hangers are worn, damaged, or do not meet current safety standards. This is replaced \u2014 \u201d Counsel for Johns Hopkins asked that the answer be stricken. The motion was granted, and the jury was immediately instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">Ladies and gentlemen, any testimony offered with respect to what should have been done with respect to observations of conditions, you are not to consider. That is not something of a factual nature that should be before you. You are to disregard it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">On cross-examination by Schindler\u2019s counsel, it was brought out, for the first time, that the report plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had been questioning Stump about was dated October 6, 2000, and that the inspection that resulted in the report was made \u201ca few days before\u201d the report was sent. Schindler\u2019s counsel then asked Stump:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">Now, let\u2019s start with the first thing he asked you about which was <em>replacing </em>car door gibs, that is in that document you have there in front of you; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">After Stump answered that question in the affirmative, the court asked counsel to approach the bench. The trial judge then admonished Schindler\u2019s counsel as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">Counsel, I thought I had been very careful in limiting the testimony to what was worn and damaged. And I thought the only reference that ... had made to replacing something, I struck from the record. I mean, you seem to be opening everything that you asked me to keep closed. In other words, you have asked me to make sure the jury didn\u2019t hear anything about replacing anything, any remedial steps, and your very question, before he responded to, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>couched in the context of a remedial action. So I need to know where we are. If [you] did abandon that issue, so be it. If not, let me know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Schindler\u2019s counsel told the court that his question had been asked inadvertently and requested that the court tell the jury to disregard the question and the answer. The trial court did so.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Shortly after the jury was told to disregard Stump\u2019s answer concerning the need to replace certain elevator parts, Stump said in another of his answers that at the time he wrote Exhibit 54 it \u201cmade sense to do that upgrade at that time.\u201d Although neither defense counsel objected, the court immediately called counsel to the bench and once again scolded Schindler\u2019s counsel for bringing out the fact that Stump had recommended that parts be replaced. This prompted counsel for Johns Hopkins to ask for a mistrial</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Als\">because of the jury being told the equipment is obsolete and needs to be replaced, that recommended by [Schindler], that\u2019s the whole basis of [the rule barring evidence of] subsequent remedial measures. We have to deal with the door being opened. That is a violation in the courtroom. I just don\u2019t see how you can unring the bell at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">... I would just add, this is the second time, that\u2019s the second, not the first time, second time that we have heard referred to replacing parts of the elevator. <em>I think the court made the right decision keeping out the subsequent remedial measures. Since the court was very careful and excluding anything about that, and I think the court\u2019s ruling that only the portion of that report that the founda</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>tion is laid, that the equipment, the condition of the equipment before August 30th was admissible, and I think that was handled at very [sic] direct examination by [plaintiffs\u2019 counsel] of his witness. </em>But when we start talking about replacement, at least twice now, the jury has to have the inference, pretty clearly, [Schindler] recommended this, and even if the date comes out, it\u2019s ultimately after August. So I think the case law is very clear that the information should not have come in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The court denied the mistrial motion but instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">Ladies and gentlemen, you are to disregard any reference to anything that should be replaced or anything that should be done. You are not to consider that at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Counsel for Johns Hopkins then cross-examined Stump and got Stump to say on three separate occasions that the report he authored was written on October 6, 2000, which was after the subject accident. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, on re-direct examination, once again elicited testimony from Stump that the report was based on observations made post-accident. Later, on further examination by Johns Hopkins counsel, the same point was again driven home when Stump said twice more that the report was written after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">III. <em>ANALYSIS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">Johns Hopkins argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-11\">The trial court abused its discretion in admitting the October 6, 2000[,] Upgrade/ Repair Proposal from Mr. Chas Stump, of [Schindler], to Johns Hopkins (\u201cthe Proposal\u201d), as Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 54.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">This argument is without merit because plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 54 was not admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">Alternatively, Johns Hopkins contends that the court erred in allowing plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to question Stump about what he observed in September of 2000 as reflected in his October 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>report.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> According to appellant, the observations Stump made in September 2000 were irrelevant because \u201cJohns Hopkins did not have knowledge of the information contained ... in [Exhibit 54] at the time of the incident.\u201d In this appeal, Johns Hopkins stresses that the evidence was uncontradicted that (1) Schindler never advised it prior to the accident \u201cthat Elevator 2 was unsafe for use\u201d or (2) that Johns Hopkins had no pre-accident knowledge of the unsafe conditions referenced in the October 6, 2000, proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">This argument overlooks the fact that Schindler was a co-defendant and that Stump was Schindler\u2019s man in charge at Johns Hopkins. Schindler was sued on the theory that it was negligent in its maintenance of the elevators in the Nelson Building. As to Schindler, Stump\u2019s September 2000 observations were highly relevant because, according to Stump, the worn and defective condition of the elevator parts had existed for at least two months before his inspection. Those conditions therefore existed when the subject accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Beginning on July 1, 2000, Schindler had three full-time mechanics on duty whose sole job was to maintain the elevators owned by Johns Hopkins. Schindler\u2019s agents inspected all of the elevators at Johns Hopkins in June 2000, and its mechanics thereafter regularly worked in and around the elevators in the Nelson Building. Arguably, at least, if the observations made by Stump in September of 2000 were true, a reasonable juror could conclude that Schindler\u2019s agents should have discovered the defective conditions of the el\u00e9va<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>tors and warned Johns Hopkins about those conditions prior to the subject accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Additionally, the post-accident observations of Stump were relevant because it helped plaintiffs show what caused the accident and gave meaning to the expert opinions rendered by McPartland and other knowledgeable witnesses who said that worn or damaged elevator door equipment \u2014 clutches, interlocks, hangers and other components \u2014 can cause an elevator to stop abruptly, as it did on the date of the subject accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Appellant asserts that while Stump\u2019s testimony regarding his September 2000 observations might \u201carguably\u201d have been admitted \u201cto implicate [Schindler\u2019s] knowledge of the [elevator] door equipment\u201d prior to the accident, Stump\u2019s knowledge \u201cshould not have been imputed to Johns Hopkins because before the accident it was unaware of these conditions.\u201d The short answer to that contention is that, at least as far as is shown in the record, no one at trial ever attempted to impute Stump\u2019s knowledge to Johns Hopkins. In fact, the opposite was covered specifically by the court\u2019s instructions. The jury was told:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">On the issue of whether Johns Hopkins was negligent, you are not to consider any evidence about the condition of Nelson Elevator No. 2 that was made known to Hopkins by [Schindler] after the incident of August 30, 2000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Appellant next argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">[ T]he trial court prejudiced Johns Hopkins by permitting [p]laintiffs to question Stump for an extended period of time about ... [plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 54] without referencing the October 6, 2000[,] date. The date\u2019s redaction was an attempt to avoid introducing evidence of subsequent remedial measures. <em>However, the redaction gave the jury the impression that Johns Hopkins knew of the conditions in the Proposal at the time of the August 30, 2000[,] incident. </em>The first and only question [p]laintiffs asked Stump regarding the date of the Proposal was, \u201cYou done [sic] an inspection of the Nelson elevator door equipment after June, after July 1st of 2000; is that correct?\u201d Stump <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>answered affirmatively, and the obvious inference was that the inspection had been done after July 1, 2000, but <em>before </em>August 30, 2000. Such an impression was highly prejudicial to Johns Hopkins, and as is discussed below, was not capable of being cured through the issuance of a limiting instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">(Reference to extract omitted.) (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">We reject the suggestion that, at the end of the evidentiary phase of the case, any juror had been misled into believing that Johns Hopkins knew of the contents of the proposal preaccident. Stump told the jury on seven separate occasions that the report he prepared was dated October 6, 2000. The jury also was told repeatedly that the subject accident occurred on August 30, 2000. Moreover, Stump said, several times, that the observations that formed the basis for the report were made in September of 2000. Under such circumstances no juror could possibly have missed this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Johns Hopkins next argues that, even assuming that testimony concerning Exhibit 54 had some probative value, that value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect because (1) Exhibit 54 was not based on an opinion by an expert; (2) it was not based on Stump\u2019s personal observations of the elevator\u2019s internal equipment; (3) Stump\u2019s opinions as to the condition of the elevator equipment was of limited value inasmuch as it was based solely on the age of the equipment, coupled with his observation of the opening and closing the elevators doors; and (4) Exhibit 54 was merely a product of a \u201ccomputer-generated \u2018macro system.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">We shall first address appellant\u2019s assertion that \u201c[t]he low probative value of this computer-generated document did not outweigh the prejudice engendered by\u201d testimony concerning it. In <em>Thomas v. State, </em>397 Md. 557, 579, 919 A.2d 49, 62 (2007), the Maryland Court of Appeals reiterated the rule that governs this issue. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">Petitioner argues that even if the evidence is relevant and admissible, the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>its probative value, and therefore, the evidence should have been excluded. We disagree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\">The admission of evidence is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed unless there is a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Kelly v. State, </em>392 Md. 511, 530, 898 A.2d 419 (2006); <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 404-05, 697 A.2d 432 (1997). We stated in <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">\u201cAt the outset, we note that the admission of evidence is committed to the considerable and sound discretion of the trial court. In that regard, all relevant evidence is generally admissible. A corollary to that rule is that irrelevant evidence is not admissible. To be relevant, evidence must tend to establish or refute a fact at issue in the case. Once a finding of relevancy has been made, we are generally loath to reverse a trial court unless the evidence is plainly inadmissible under a specific rule or principle of law or there is a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">Nonetheless, as we said in <em>Williams [v. State, </em>342 Md. 724, 737, 679 A.2d 1106 (1996), overruled on other grounds, <em>Wengert v. State, </em>364 Md. 76, 89 n. 4, 771 A.2d 389 (2001)]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">\u2018[a] finding by the trial judge that a particular piece of evidence is relevant, however, does not mean that evidence is <em>automatically </em>admissible. Even relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. As with the trial court\u2019s relevancy determination, a decision to admit relevant evidence over an objection that the evidence is unfairly prejudicial will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\"><em>Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. at 404-05, 697 A.2d 432 ... (emphasis in original) (some internal citations omitted). The trial judge considered the evidence and ruled it admissible. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals[\u2019] conclusion that \u201cany possible prejudicial effect of [the evidence at issue] did not so clearly outweigh the probative value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>the evidence so as to render the circuit court\u2019s admission of the evidence an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Thomas [v. State], </em>168 Md.App. [682,] 713, 899 A.2d 170 [(2006)]. We find no error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Johns Hopkins\u2019 argument, when reduced to its essence, is that Stump, who was not admitted at trial as an expert, simply did not know what he was talking about when he criticized the condition of the elevators in his October 6 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Stump, at the time of trial, worked for Schindler. When plaintiffs\u2019 counsel tried to qualify Stump as an expert, the witness gave a series of answers making it appear that, even though he signed the October 6 report, he was not an elevator mechanic and the opinions he set forth in that report resulted from only a cursory examination of the elevators. At a bench conference, prior to allowing questioning regarding the observations set forth in the report, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel said that at deposition Stump never indicated that he had a limited role in writing the report; plaintiffs\u2019 counsel also pointed out, accurately, that Stump was an authorized agent of Schindler and that the statements in the report, as to Schindler, constituted an admission, which bound that defendant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial judge concurred with the argument that Stump\u2019s statements were admissible as an admission against Schindler; the court also made the observation that Stump \u201cseem[ed] to be making an effort to protect his employer.\u201d The trial judge went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">It would be utterly inappropriate ... [in light of] this report, which is so clearly written, and so definitive in the way it is written, to then let this man try to get on the stand and basically deny this report or deny any responsibility for the report and put it on some sudden development that was never brought to anyone\u2019s attention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>After voir dire, the extent to which Stump was willing to stand by what was said in the report varied depending on who was asking the questions. When Schindler\u2019s counsel posed the questions, Stump said he was no expert, that he never examined the internal mechanisms to the elevators, that the statements in the report were based mainly on the age of the elevators, that prior to writing the report he only rode the elevators and examined the exteriors of the doors, and that the report was computer generated and afforded him no ability to edit it. But when examined by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, Stump swore that everything he wrote in the October report was true <em>and accurate; </em>he also admitted that, although the report was written on a computer, \u201cthe language that went into [the] report was language\u201d he wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Using the test set forth in <em>Thomas, </em>we cannot say that the possible prejudicial effect of allowing Stump to be questioned about the report \u201cso clearly outweigh[ed] the probative value of the evidence so as to render the circuit court\u2019s admission of the evidence an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>397 Md. at 580, 919 A.2d at 63 (quoting <em>Thomas v. State, </em>168 Md.App. at 713, 899 A.2d at 189).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Appellant argues that the trial court committed reversible error in denying its motion for mistrial. The motion for mistrial was based on three answers given by Stump. The first answer occurred when plaintiffs\u2019 counsel asked Stump to read to the jury what he had said concerning his observations of certain elevator door components. Unfortunately, Stump did not read precisely what he had written. Instead he said that \u201cthe present door hangers are worn or do not meet current safety standards. This is replaced \u2014 \u201d The judge evidently construed that answer as indicating that Stump had recommended replacement. Accordingly, at appellant\u2019s request, the jury was told to disregard \u201cany testimony offered with respect to what should have been done\u201d as a result of observations the witness made.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The second problem arose when Stump gave an affirmative answer to a question asked by Schindler\u2019s counsel that indicated that the report Stump prepared had recommended <em>replacing </em>\u201ccar door gibs.\u201d The court promptly told the jury that they were to focus on what \u201cthe evaluation^] and inspection reveal[ed]\u201d and not about \u201csomething being replaced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The third problem, and the one that prompted a mistrial request, was when Stump said that at the time he wrote Exhibit 54 \u201cit made sense to do an upgrade.\u201d Although the motion for mistrial was denied, the court once again told the jury that they were to disregard any statement by the witness concerning anything \u201cthat should be replaced.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">Whether to order a mistrial rests in the discretion of the trial judge, and appellate review of the denial of the motion is limited to whether there has been an abuse of discretion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>State v.

Each time Stump touched on the subject of either recommendations for. replacing parts or actual post-accident replacement of elevator parts, the jury was told immediately to disregard the testimony. Jurors are presumed to have understood and to have followed the court\u2019s instructions. <em>See State v. Gray, </em>344 Md. 417, 425 n. 6, 687 A.2d 660 (1997).

The statements by Stump that resulted in a mistrial motion did not involve the causation issue.

In <em>Otis Elevator Co. v. Embert, </em>198 Md. 585, 84 A.2d 876 (1951), the Court hinted, but did not decide, that an elevator owner/operator owed a higher degree of care to its passengers than to an ordinary invitee. The <em>Embert </em>case involved a claim by a passenger in a self-operated elevator who sustained injuries when she opened the doors and stepped into an elevator, which had been stopped by another passenger about twelve-and-one-half inches below floor level. <em>Id. </em>at 592-93, 84 A.2d 876. The plaintiff, Embert, sued the owner of the elevator and Otis Elevator Company (\"Otis\u201d), which had a contract to maintain the device. <em>Id. </em>at 589-90, 84 A.2d 876. The elevator had been installed in 1930 and had no self-leveling mechanism, <em>id. </em>at 589, 84 A.2d 876, but at the time of the accident (1949) self-leveling devices were \"very expensive\u201d and not in general use in this country. <em>Id. </em>at 591-92, 84 A.2d 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Embert failed to show that the elevator was defective, nor did she introduce any evidence showing that Otis had failed to keep the elevator in good repair. <em>Id. </em>at 595, 84 A.2d 876. At trial, the theory of negligence against the owner of the elevator was, apparently, that the owner was negligent in failing to warn passengers to \u201cwatch their step\u201d and to refrain from stopping the elevator car by opening the inner door before the elevator was level with the landing. <em>Id. </em>at 600, 84 A.2d 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The jury in <em>Embert </em>returned a verdict against both the elevator owner and Otis in regard to plaintiff's claim in chief but found in favor of Otis on the owner\u2019s third-party claim for indemnity. <em>Id. </em>at 587, 84 A.2d 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">On appeal, Otis challenged the plaintiff's verdict against it, but the owner did not. <em>Id. </em>The question decided in <em>Embert </em>concerned \"the scope of Otis's undertaking when it signed the maintenance contract\u201d with the owner. <em>Id. </em>at 600, 84 A.2d 876. In answering that question, the Court assumed, but did not decide, that within the scope of Otis\u2019 undertaking to maintain the elevators, it owed plaintiff the same degree of care that the elevator owner owed her. <em>Id. </em>The Court, however, did not say what that duty was. The Court did say, however:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">In discussing the degree of care required of those who transport passengers in elevators this court has recognized that an elevator, especially if not maintained and operated with great care, \"is in many respects a dangerous machine.\u201d <em>Belvidere Building Co. v.

Rock Creek Terrace Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>308 Md. 432, 520 A.2d 361 (1987). In that case, the plaintiff was a firefighter who, due to \"heavy smoke,\u201d accidentally stepped into an open elevator shaft and was injured. <em>Id. </em>at 436-37, 520 A.2d 361. The plaintiff claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that the property owner owed him a duty of care similar to that owed by a common carrier. The Court of Appeals rejected that argument when it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">\u201d[ T]he higher duty a common carrier owes extends only to its passengers.\u201d <em>Sheridan v.

In <em>Otis Elevator Co. v.

At trial, counsel for plaintiffs and counsel for Schindler indicated in a bench conference that the date of the inspection was September 6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>2000, but in front of the jury the date of the inspection was referred to as \u201csometime in September 2000.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\">. Johns Hopkins says in its brief that it and Schindler filed, on September 30, 2005, a motion <em>in limine </em>based on Maryland Rule 5-407 \"to exclude any documents, testimony and arguments concerning subsequent remedial measures\u201d taken by the parties. We have reviewed the docket entries and the record, and have been unable to find any indication that such a motion was filed. But whether such a motion was filed or not is of no moment, because at trial the court granted a similar oral motion, which prohibited counsel from asking questions about subsequent repairs and post-accident recommendations for upgrades or repairs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\">. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-9\">Members of the jury, before we took that momentary recess, there was a question posed by [Schindler\u2019s counsel] with respect to something being replaced. That is an issue that is not before you. You shouldn't even consider anything that's with regard to anything that could have been done. We are only to focus on the question asked, and what the evaluation and inspection reveal.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b416-6\">. In its brief, Johns Hopkins also argues that the court erred in permitting plaintiffs' counsel to use plaintiffs' Exhibit 54 to question \"A1 Ringer,\u201d an elevator technician employed by Schindler. According to appellant's brief, these questions were allowed despite \"defendants\u2019 repeated objection.\u201d Mr. Ringer was asked questions based on the observations Stump recorded in Exhibit 54, but those questions were not objected to and were asked prior to the time defense counsel were given a continuing objection to such questions. Thus, the issue of whether the court erred in respect to Ringer's testimony is waived. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-517(a) (an objection is waived unless it is made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for the objection become apparent).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b420-8\">. <em>See B &amp; K Rentals &amp; Sales Co. v.

There is another serious flaw in appellant\u2019s argument that the \u201cslight\" probative value of the testimony at issue was outweighed by its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The prejudicial effect of the testimony to which appellant directs our attention in his brief was that, during questioning of Stump about his report, the jury learned of remedial repairs. But when the trial judge made his decision to give defense counsel a continuing objection to any question regarding Stump\u2019s September 2000 observations, the judge did not know, and had no way of predicting, that the report would prejudice Johns Hopkins. In this regard, it should be remembered that, before granting defense counsel a continuing objection, the court told counsel that, although they could question Stump about the observations he made in September 2000, Stump could not be asked about post-accident recommendations as to steps that should be taken to modernize the elevators. After the continuing objection was granted, defense counsel made no further objection. Thus, at the time the court made the ruling that appellant criticizes on appeal, the court had no prejudice to balance against what appellant calls the slight probative value of the observations made by Stump in his report.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">At oral argument, appellant\u2019s counsel said that the \u201cprejudicial effect\u201d about which appellant complains is the prejudice caused by all the questions to which the defendants were given a continuing objection. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>That prejudice, as we understand appellant's oral argument, was that the testimony may have led the jury to believe that appellant, prior to the accident, had <em>actual knowledge </em>of the condition of the elevators mentioned in the October 6 report. We fail to see any possibility of such prejudice in light of a jury instruction specifically on this point, coupled with the fact that after Stump left the stand it was crystalline that Stump never reported to appellant the bad condition of the elevator doors until after the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
