Following a bench trial in the Circuit Court for Worcester County, appellant was found guilty of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. He was sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">Prior to trial, appellant moved to suppress evidence of the marijuana recovered from the trunk of his vehicle. The denial of that motion is the subject of this appeal. Appellant presents one question, which we have rewritten as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-12\">Does the odor of burnt marijuana emanating from the passenger compartment of a vehicle, by itself, establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>probable cause to search the vehicle\u2019s trunk under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">On October 27, 2004, Maryland State Police Trooper Larry Fortino was operating radar in an unmarked patrol vehicle on U.S. 13 in Worcester County. Radar indicated that a gray Chevy Impala with Virginia tags was traveling southbound at 62 miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour zone. A traffic stop was initiated. When the vehicle pulled off onto the shoulder of the highway, appellant was driving the vehicle. Another person was in the passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Trooper Fortino approached the vehicle and asked appellant for his driver\u2019s license and registration. Appellant produced a Virginia driver\u2019s license and a rental agreement for the vehicle. He became argumentative, claiming that he frequently traveled U.S. 13 and had never before been stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">While Trooper Fortino conversed with appellant, he smelled \u201can odor of burnt marijuana emanating from the vehicle.\u201d He informed appellant that the odor had been detected and asked him to exit the vehicle. Appellant denied having marijuana in the car. By this time, a deputy with the Worcester County Sheriffs Office arrived at the scene. The deputy remained with appellant while Trooper Fortino walked around to the passenger side of the vehicle and asked the passenger to exit the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">The deputy searched the vehicle\u2019s interior, including the glove compartment and ashtray, in addition to the air filter and hubcaps. No evidence of a crime was discovered during the search. Appellant\u2019s car key was used to open the trunk of the vehicle. Inside, six and one-half pounds of marijuana were recovered from a black suitcase. The record indicates that either the deputy or Trooper Fortino had requested the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>assistance of a drug-detecting dog, which did not arrive until after the contraband had been recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">On December 8, 2004, appellant was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Appellant filed a motion to suppress the marijuana recovered from the vehicle. Following a hearing, the motion was denied. On July 12, 2005, the case proceeded on an agreed statement of facts that included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">A full search of the vehicle was conducted. Two large packages were located in a black suitcase in the trunk. The packages contained a large amount of suspected marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">The evidence was submitted for analysis to the Maryland State Police crime lab, who tested it, and determined that it was in fact marijuana. It was approximately six and a half pounds of marijuana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">\u201cIn considering a denial of a motion to suppress, we are limited to the record of the suppression hearing.\u201d <em>Whiting v. State, </em>160 Md.App. 285, 300, 863 A.2d 1017 (2004). Where, as here, the circuit court does not make factual findings on the record,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">the appellate court will accept that version of the evidence most favorable to the prevailing party. It will fully credit the prevailing party\u2019s witnesses and discredit the losing party\u2019s witnesses. It will give maximum weight to the prevailing party\u2019s evidence and little or no weight to the losing party\u2019s evidence. It will resolve ambiguities and draw inferences in favor of the prevailing party and against the losing party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-11\"><em>Morris v. State, </em>153 Md.App. 480, 490, 837 A.2d 248 (2003). As a question of law, we review, <em>de novo, </em>whether appellant\u2019s motion to suppress was properly denied. <em>In re David S., </em>367 Md. 523, 529, 789 A.2d 607 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The Fourth Amendment ordinarily requires that a warrant be secured prior to conducting a search. <em>Maryland v. Dyson, </em>527 U.S. 465, 466, 119 S.Ct. 2013, 144 L.Ed.2d 442 (1999). An exception to the warrant requirement is the \u201cautomobile exception,\u201d known as the <em>\u201cCarroll </em>Doctrine.\u201d <em>State v. Harding, </em>166 Md.App. 230, 241, 887 A.2d 1108 (2005). \u201cIf a car is readily mobile and probable cause exists to believe it contains contraband, the Fourth Amendment ... permits police to search the vehicle without more.\u201d <em>Dyson, </em>527 U.S. at 467, 119 S.Ct. 2013 (quoting <em>Pennsylvania v. Labron, </em>518 U.S. 938, 940, 116 S.Ct. 2485, 135 L.Ed.2d 1031 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">In <em>Daniels v. State, </em>172 Md.App. 75, 89, 913 A.2d 617 (2006), we explained probable cause as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-9\">[PJrobable cause is a flexible, common-sense standard. It merely requires that the facts available to the officer would \u201cwarrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief,\u201d <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 162, 45 S.Ct. 280, 288, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925), that certain items may be contraband or stolen property or useful as evidence of a crime; it does not demand any showing that such belief be correct or more likely true than false. A \u201cpractical, non-technical\u201d probability that incriminating evidence is involved is all that is required. <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 176, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1311, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949); <em>Riddick v. State, </em>319 Md. 180, 194-95, 571 A.2d 1239 (1990).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>In a probable cause analysis, we consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Cox v. State, </em>161 Md.App. 654, 669, 871 A.2d 647 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">We have held that the odor of burnt marijuana, alone, affords probable cause to search the passenger compartment of a vehicle under the \u201cautomobile exception.\u201d In <em>Harding, </em>166 Md.App. at 233, 887 A.2d 1108, \u201ca strong odor of burnt marijuana emanating from the passenger compartment\u201d of the defendant\u2019s pickup truck provided probable cause to search the passenger compartment of his vehicle. A search of the air bag compartment resulted in the recovery of a pistol, a bag of marijuana, and a partially-smoked marijuana cigarette. <em>Id. </em>After the defendant\u2019s arrest, \u201cthe officers discovered a large package of additional marijuana hidden in a spare tire that was in the covered bed of the pickup truck.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">On review, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">Any question as to whether the odor of marijuana alone can provide a police officer probable cause to search a vehicle was dispelled by the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Johns, </em>469 U.S. 478, 482, 105 S.Ct. 881, 83 L.Ed.2d 890 (1985), where Justice O\u2019Connor wrote for the Court: \u201cAfter the officers came closer and detected the distinct odor of marijuana, they had probable cause to believe that the vehicle contained contraband.\u201d To similar effect, <em>see Ford v. State, </em>37 Md.App. 373, 379, 377 A.2d 577 (\u201cknowledge gained from the sense of smell alone may be of such character as to give rise to probable cause for a belief that a crime is being committed in the presence of the officer\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>281 Md. 737 (1977). <em>See also United States v. Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 111, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965) (smell of mash whiskey); <em>Seldon v. State, </em>151 Md. App. 204, 232, 824 A.2d 999 (odor of cocaine, if believed, would have established probable cause), <em>cert. denied, </em>377 Md. 114, 832 A.2d 206 (2003); <em>Mullaney v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 248, 257, 246 A.2d 291 (1968) (\u201cThat the smell of distinctive odors can constitute evidence of crime and of probable cause is well settled.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>252 Md. 732 (1969); Andrea L. Ben-Yosef, Annotation, <em>Validity of Warrantless Search </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>of Motor Vehicle Based on Odor of Marijuana-State Cases, </em>114 A.L.R.5th 173, 189 (2003) (\u201cThe majority of courts have found that the odor of marijuana alone supplies the probable cause for a warrantless search.\u201d); Andrea L. Ben-Yosef, Annotation, <em>Validity of Warrantless Search of Motor Vehicle Based on Odor of Marijuana-Federal Cases, </em>188 A.L.R. Fed. 487, 497 (2003) (same).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 240, 887 A.2d 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">We have stated that \u201c[m]any of the cases applying the <em>Carroll </em>doctrine have found probable cause to search the trunk of a motor vehicle based on evidence apparent to a police officer after a lawful search of the passenger compartment of the vehicle.\u201d <em>Whiting v. State, </em>125 Md.App. 404, 415, 725 A.2d 623 (1999) (and cases cited therein). In this case, the search of the passenger compartment of the vehicle produced no additional evidence of the presence of marijuana in the vehicle. Appellant contends that, under the circumstances, any probable cause to search the passenger compartment of a vehicle based solely on the odor of burnt marijuana would not extend to the vehicle\u2019s trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">In <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 824-25, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982), the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0f\">The scope of a warrantless search of an automobile ... is defined by the object of the search and the places in which there is probable cause to believe that it may be found. Just as probable cause to believe that a stolen lawnmower may be found in a garage will not support a warrant to search an upstairs bedroom, probable cause to believe that undocumented aliens are being transported in a van will not justify a warrantless search of a suitcase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">If probable cause justifies the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it justifies the search of every part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of the search.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVz\"><em>See also Whiting, </em>125 Md.App. at 411-12, 725 A.2d 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">In <em>California v. Acevedo, </em>500 U.S. 565, 580, 111 S.Ct. 1982, 114 L.Ed.2d 619 (1991), the Supreme Court stated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>\u201cpolice may search an automobile and the containers within it where they have probable cause to believe contraband or evidence is contained.\u201d In that case, officers of the Santa Ana Police Department were conducting surveillance of an apartment, which they knew contained marijuana. <em>Id. </em>at 566-67, 111 S.Ct. 1982. Acevedo drove to the apartment, entered, \u201cstayed for about ten minutes, and reappeared carrying a brown paper bag that looked full.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567, 111 S.Ct. 1982. He placed the bag in the trunk of his vehicle. <em>Id. </em>As he drove out of the parking lot, he was stopped by police. \u201cThey opened the trunk and the bag, and found marijuana.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). The Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">[T]he police had probable cause to believe that the paper bag in the automobile\u2019s trunk contained marijuana. That probable cause now allows a warrantless search of the paper bag. The facts in the record reveal that the police did not have probable cause to believe that contraband was hidden in any other part of the automobile and a search of the entire vehicle would have been without probable cause and unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 580, 111 S.Ct. 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">In <em>U.S. v. Carter, </em>300 F.3d 415, 422 (4th Cir.2002), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, citing <em>Acevedo, </em>stated that \u201cprobable cause must be tailored to specific compartments and containers within an automobile.\u201d In <em>Carter, </em>twenty defendants were named in an indictment stemming from a series of arrests in a housing project in Fayetteville, North Carolina. <em>Id. </em>at 420. Five appellants were joined for trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">One of the defendants, Jerry McRae, had been pulled over for speeding. <em>Id. </em>The officer who initiated the traffic stop \u201ctestified that when he approached the vehicle, he smelled burnt marijuana in the air.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He asked McRae for permission to search the vehicle; McRae refused. <em>Id. </em>The officer released a drug-sniffing dog from his patrol vehicle and the dog alerted \u201cwhen walking by the driver\u2019s side door.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on the dog\u2019s alert, the officer \u201csearched the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>passenger compartment of the vehicle and found a quantity of marijuana on the passenger side of the center console.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An additional search of the locked trunk of McRae\u2019s vehicle resulted in the recovery of a kilogram of cocaine within a locked suitcase that was inside of the trunk. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The court stated that the officer\" \u201cclearly had probable cause to search the passenger compartment of McRae\u2019s vehicle without a warrant, based on the burning marijuana he smelled as he approached the car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422. As to whether the officer \u201calso had probable cause to search the locked trunk of the car and the closed suitcase inside the trunk,\u201d the government argued that the \u201cdog\u2019s \u2018alerting\u2019 on the driver side of the car gave [the officer] probable cause to search the <em>entire </em>vehicle: including the trunk and the suitcase.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In response to that argument, the court stated that the government \u201coverstates the matter,\u201d but concluded that the search of the trunk and the suitcase was proper because the dog\u2019s alert \u201cwas sufficiently close to the trunk to give [the officer] probable cause to believe it contained contraband.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit explained <em>Ross </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">The Supreme Court has made a distinction between probable cause to believe that drugs are in a particular section of the car, and probable cause to believe that drugs are generally within the car. In <em>Ross, </em>the Court stated, \u201cprobable cause to believe that a container placed in the trunk of a taxi contains contraband or evidence does not justify a search of the entire cab.\u201d <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 824, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 2172, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982). Whereas on the next page, the Court states, \u201cif probable cause justifies a search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it justifies the search of every part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of the search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, if officers have probable cause to believe that contraband is in only one part of a car, then they are limited to that area. If, on the other hand, officers have probable cause to believe that contraband is located somewhere in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>car, but they don\u2019t know exactly where, then they can search the entire vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\"><em>U.S. v. Seals, </em>987 F.2d 1102, 1107 n. 8 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\n<em>Officers May Search the Trunk</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Only a few jurisdictions have considered the issue presented in this case. One jurisdiction has opined that the odor of burnt marijuana, alone, establishes probable cause to search the trunk of a vehicle. Another, in dicta, has indicated that it would so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">In <em>U.S. v. McSween, </em>53 F.3d 684, 685 (5th Cir.1995), the driver of a vehicle was stopped by two Texas Department of Public Safety officers for driving in excess of the posted speed limit. One of the officers asked the driver if he could search the car, including the trunk. <em>Id. </em>The driver consented. <em>Id. </em>The officer \u201cnoticed the smell of burnt marihuana\u201d but did not find any evidence in the vehicle during the initial search to confirm his belief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">Under the hood of the vehicle, the officer removed a rag from a hole in the vehicle\u2019s fire wall and found a brown paper bag. <em>Id. </em>Believing that the bag contained marijuana, the officer arrested the driver. <em>Id. </em>at 685-86. The car was impounded and additional marijuana, as well as cocaine, were discovered in the hole under the hood of the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">On appeal, the driver argued that: (1) his consent to search the car did not extend to areas under the hood of the vehicle and (2) \u201ceven if the odor of marihuana gave [the officer] probable cause to search, the search should have been limited to the passenger area, where [the officer] detected the smell.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687. The court disagreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-12\">It is well settled that, in a case such as this, the detection of the odor of marihuana justifies \u201ca search of the entire vehicle.\u201d <em>[U.S. v.] Reed, </em>882 F.2d [147,] 149 [ (5th Cir. 1989) ]. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Ross, </em>\u201cIf probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>cause justifies the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it justifies the search of every part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of the search.\u201d 456 U.S. at 825, 102 S.Ct. at 2173. <em>See also United States v. Johns, </em>469 U.S. 478, 482, 105 S.Ct. 881, 884, 83 L.Ed.2d 890 (1985). The Court further observed that, if there is probable cause to suspect that the vehicle contains contraband, then the search may extend not only to closed containers, but also to a \u201ccar\u2019s trunk or glove compartment.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>456 U.S. at 823, 102 S.Ct. at 2172. The same reasoning applies to the area under the hood, where drugs may also be concealed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Iowa</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">In <em>State v. Longo, </em>608 N.W.2d 471, 473 (Iowa 2000), the Supreme Court of Iowa did not directly address the issue as factors in addition to the odor of burnt marijuana supported the court\u2019s conclusion that probable cause existed to search the trunk of a vehicle. It did state, however, \u201cWe have substantial doubts as to the validity of [the defendant\u2019s] theory that the smell of burnt marijuana only gives rise to a lawful search of the passenger portion of the vehicle and not the trunk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">\n<em>Officers May Not Search the Trunk</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Four jurisdictions have held that the odor of burnt marijuana, alone, does not establish probable cause to search the trunk of a vehicle. Appellant urges that we follow their lead.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">The Tenth Circuit has held, in at least five cases, that the odor of burnt marijuana (or burnt methamphetamine), alone, does not provide a sufficient basis to search the trunk of a vehicle. <em>See U.S. v. Bradford, </em>423 F.3d 1149, 1160 (10th Cir.2005); <em>U.S. v. Wald, </em>216 F.3d 1222, 1226 (10th Cir.2000); <em>U.S. v.

Nielsen, </em>9 F.3d 1487, 1491 (10th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Interpreting the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ross, </em>the Tenth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">[Although the smell of burnt marijuana emanating from a vehicle provides probable cause to search the passenger compartment of that vehicle, if that search fails to uncover corroborating evidence of contraband, probable cause to search the trunk of the vehicle does not exist. This rule is premised on the common-sense proposition that the smell of burnt marijuana is indicative of drug usage, rather than drug trafficking, and because it is unreasonable to believe people smoke marijuana in the trunks of cars, the mere smell of burnt marijuana does not create the fair probability that the trunk contains marijuana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-7\"><em>Wald, </em>216 F.3d at 1226 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">In <em>Wald, </em>216 F.3d at 1224, an officer with the Utah Highway Patrol stopped a vehicle that had a badly cracked windshield. The officer approached the vehicle and spoke with the driver and his passenger, who owned the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>The officer noted that both men appeared to be nervous and that the passenger had bloodshot and glassy eyes. <em>Id. </em>at 1224-25. While speaking to the driver and passenger, the officer detected the odor of burnt methamphetamine. <em>Id. </em>at 1225. The passenger of the vehicle consented to a search of the passenger compartment of his car. <em>Id. </em>The search did not reveal any evidence of a crime. <em>Id. </em>In a subsequent pat-down search, the officer recovered two pipes from the passenger\u2019s jacket pocket. <em>Id. </em>The officer then searched the trunk of the vehicle and recovered two packages containing methamphetamine in addition to two torches used to smoke the narcotic. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">On review, the Tenth Circuit held that the odor of burnt methamphetamine, alone, did not provide the requisite probable cause to search the trunk of the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 1228. In reaching that conclusion, the court distinguished between \u201cburnt\u201d and \u201craw\u201d forms of contraband and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Had [the officer] testified that he detected the odor of <em>raw </em>methamphetamine, such evidence, if based upon proper foundation, would have sufficed to provide probable cause for the trunk search. In the instant case, however, [the officer] testified that he smelled only <em>burnt </em>methamphetamine, not <em>raw </em>methamphetamine, and that burnt methamphetamine has a distinctively pungent odor.... [T]he strong odor of burnt methamphetamine, whether or not it can permeate trunks, does not provide probable cause to search a trunk, because it is unreasonable to think someone smoked drugs in the trunk of a car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Ohio</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Relying, in part, on the Tenth Circuit\u2019s distinction between burnt and raw marijuana, the Supreme Court of Ohio, in a 4-3 decision, recently held that \u201c[t]he odor of burnt marijuana in the passenger compartment of a vehicle does not, standing alone, establish probable cause for a warrantless search of the trunk of the vehicle.\u201d <em>State v. Farris, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 519, 849 N.E.2d 985, 996 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">In <em>Farris, </em>an Ohio Highway Patrol trooper stopped a vehicle traveling in excess of the posted speed limit. <em>Id. </em>at 988. The trooper approached the right side of the vehicle and the driver lowered the passenger side window. <em>Id. </em>At that time, the trooper detected \u201ca light odor of marijuana coming from inside the car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The driver was asked to exit the vehicle and a pat-down search was conducted. <em>Id. </em>No contraband was found. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Without <em>Miranda </em>warnings,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the trooper \u201casked whether there were any drugs or drug devices in the car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The driver responded that there was a marijuana pipe located in the trunk of the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>The trooper then gave the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to the driver and elicited the same ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>mission. <em>Id. </em>A second trooper searched the passenger compartment of the vehicle and found no evidence of drug paraphernalia. <em>Id. </em>The trunk was then opened and the trooper conducting the search discovered the pipe and cigarette papers. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">On review, the court concluded that \u201cevidence obtained as the direct result of statements made in custody without the benefit of a <em>Miranda </em>warning should be excluded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 996. Therefore, the prosecution had to demonstrate that the troopers had probable cause to search the trunk of the vehicle based solely upon the \u201clight odor of marijuana coming from inside the car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that the troopers did not have probable cause to search the trunk. <em>Id; see also State v. Coston, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 278, 859 N.E.2d 990, 994 (2006) (\u201cThe search based on probable cause on marijuana vehicle, but not the trunk.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">California</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">In 1976, the Supreme Court of California announced that if evidence of marijuana recovered in the passenger compartment of a vehicle suggests only <em>casual use, </em>as opposed to <em>dealing, </em>probable cause to search the trunk of the vehicle is not established. <em>Wimberly v. Superior Court, </em>16 Cal.3d 557, 128 Cal.Rptr. 641, 547 P.2d 417, 427 (1976). We shall refer to this as the \u201cuser-dealer\u201d distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">In <em>Wimberly, </em>two California Highway Patrol officers in a patrol car initiated a traffic stop for a vehicle that was speeding and driving erratically. 128 CaLRptr. 641, 547 P.2d at 420. One of the officers, approaching the vehicle, observed a jacket, a paper bag, a tobacco pipe, and 12 marijuana seeds resting on the floor at the passenger\u2019s feet. <em>Id. </em>At the officer\u2019s request, the passenger handed the officer the pipe. <em>Id, </em>The officer observed burnt residue and detected the odor of burnt marijuana. <em>Id. </em>Both officers detected the same scent emanating from within the car. <em>Id. </em>The officer searched the passenger compartment of the vehicle. A small quantity of marijuana was recovered from the passenger\u2019s jacket, but no other contraband was found inside of the car. <em>Id. </em>The officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>then used the car keys to open the trunk. <em>Id. </em>Several pounds of marijuana were recovered from the trunk. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">In considering whether the evidence obtained and detected by the officers in the passenger compartment of the vehicle provided probable cause to search the trunk, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">[L]ogic compels that we ... differentiate between the [casual narcotics user and the dealer of narcotics] and recognize that all casual users are not dealers. Here, the erratic driving, the plain view observation of the marijuana seeds adjacent to the pipe, the odor of burnt marijuana, the burnt residue in the pipe, and the small quantity of marijuana secreted in the jacket indicate only that petitioners were casual users of marijuana. It was thus proper to search adjacent areas of the vehicle ... but it was not reasonable to infer that petitioners had additional contraband hidden in the trunk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Idaho</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">In <em>State v. Schmadeka, </em>136 Idaho 595, 38 P.3d 633, 637 (2001), the Court of Appeals of Idaho considered whether the slight odor of burnt marijuana, alone, established probable cause to search the trunk of a vehicle. In reaching its conclusion, the court relied on the \u201cuser-dealer\u201d and \u201cburnt-raw\u201d distinctions discussed in <em>Wimberly </em>and <em>Wald.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">In <em>Schmadeka, </em>an Idaho State Police trooper spotted a vehicle with a large crack running across the center of the windshield and noticed that the driver of the vehicle was not wearing his seatbelt. 38 P.3d at 634. The trooper initiated a traffic stop. <em>Id. </em>When the trooper approached the driver, he observed what he believed to be an illegal firecracker in plain view<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and detected \u201ca slight odor of marijuana coming through the open window\u201d of the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>When ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>tioned about the odor, the driver had no explanation for it. <em>Id. </em>The trooper asked the driver to exit the vehicle and conducted a pat-down search. <em>Id. </em>at 634-35. A \u201cprolonged search of the passenger compartment\u201d of the vehicle was conducted. <em>Id. </em>at 635. The trooper identified a jacket in the rear seat of the vehicle as the source of the odor. <em>Id. </em>No evidence of marijuana was recovered from either the passenger compartment of the vehicle or from the jacket. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The trooper also searched the trunk of the vehicle. There, he found evidence of methamphetamine paraphernalia and arrested the driver. <em>Id. </em>After repeated requests, the driver eventually consented to a search of his residence. <em>Id. </em>Authorities recovered further evidence of methamphetamine manufacturing, in addition to methamphetamine, marijuana, and drug paraphernalia. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Relying, in part, on the \u201cuser-dealer\u201d distinction, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">The existence of probable cause to search the interior of a car is not necessarily sufficient to justify a search of the car\u2019s trunk. In <em>Wimberly v. Superior Court, </em>16 Cal.3d 557, 128 Cal.Rptr. 641, 547 P.2d 417, 424-427 (1976), the California Supreme Court explained that observations that support only the inference of casual drug usage \u2014 the odor of burnt marijuana in the passenger compartment \u2014 do not reasonably support the inference that there is additional contraband hidden in the trunk. Rather, there must be specific articulable facts supporting probable cause to believe that the contraband or evidence is, in fact, concealed in the trunk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 637-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">As to the \u201cburnt-raw\u201d distinction, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\">The Tenth Circuit\u2019s distinction between the odor of burnt marijuana in the passenger compartment (alone insufficient to establish probable cause for a search of the car\u2019s trunk) and that of raw marijuana (sufficient alone to establish probable cause for a search of the trunk) applies common sense in viewing the totality of the circumstances to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>mine the existence of probable cause. As explained in <em>Wald:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\">[The distinction] is premised on the common sense proposition that the smell of burnt marijuana is indicative of drug usage, rather than drug trafficking, and because it is unreasonable to believe people smoke marijuana in the trunks of cars, the mere smell of burnt marijuana does not create the fair probability that the trunk contains marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">216 F.3d at 1226. Thus, we conclude, as did the district court below, that the odor of burnt marijuana alone, when recognized by a person or canine qualified to recognize the odor, is only sufficient to establish probable cause for a warrantless search of the portion of the automobile associated with that odor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The \u201cuser-dealer\u201d distinction has been criticized by the California Courts of Appeal. <em>See People v. Hunter, </em>133 Cal.App.4th 371, 34 Cal.Rptr.3d 818 (2005); <em>People v. Dey, </em>84 Cal.App.4th 1318, 101 Cal.Rptr.2d 581 (2000). A well-recognized Fourth Amendment treatise states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">[T]he recent cases of this genre have in the main rejected the <em>Wimberly </em>approach. In doing so, they have labeled the user-dealer distinction in this context as \u201cillogical and unreasonable\u201d because it is untrue \u201cthat users, whether occasional, regular, or habitual, are not likely to hide additional contraband in the trunk.\u201d Also, it is argued that police should not be burdened \u201cwith having to make another judgment call \u2014 whether a certain amount of marijuana, cocaine, or other drug found on a person or in some container makes the person a casual user or a dealer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvW\">3 LaFave, Search &amp; Seizure \u00a7 7.2 (4th ed.2007) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">The Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, in <em>Osban v. State, </em>726 S.W.2d 107, 109 (Tex.Cr.App.1986), <em>overruled on other grounds, Heitman v. State, </em>815 S.W.2d 681 (Tex.Cr.App.1991), explained the fallacy of the user-dealer distinction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>[ E]ven though there is a distinction between users and dealers and the latter are <em>more </em>likely to have additional contraband hidden in the trunk, this does not mean that users, whether occasional, regular, or habitual, are <em>not </em>likely to hide additional contraband in the trunk. Under the logic of <em>Wimberly, </em>an officer who discovers a driver and passenger each in possession of a prohibited weapon, cannot search the trunk of their vehicle because no evidence exists that the suspects deal in illegal weapons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In <em>US. v. Burnett, 791 </em>F.2d 64 (6th Cir.1986), the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit rejected the user-dealer distinction. Two ounces of marijuana were observed by an officer of the Cincinnati Airport Police on the floorboard of a driver\u2019s vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 65. The officer arrested the driver and an occupant of the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>After the vehicle was impounded, officers discovered, during an inventory search, 245 grams of cocaine located within a resealed champagne box. <em>Id. </em>at 65-66. On appeal, the Sixth Circuit was asked to determine whether the finding of only two ounces of marijuana in the passenger compartment of the vehicle supported probable cause to search the vehicle\u2019s trunk.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 66-67. The court held that it did and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">The focal point of appellant\u2019s argument is that two ounces of marijuana found on the floorboard of the car indicates that the appellant is only a casual user of narcotics as opposed to a dealer. Consequently, it is argued that [the officer] had probable cause to search only the passenger area of the car and not the trunk. The appellant is asking this Court to burden the police with having to make another judgment call \u2014 whether a certain amount of marijuana, cocaine, or other drug found on a person or in some container makes the person a casual user or a dealer. Determining the existence of probable cause to search on the amount of contraband initially found is a line which need not and should not be drawn. Probable cause has never been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>defined quantitatively and the appellant\u2019s theory that \u201csmaller is not necessarily bigger\u201d must be rejected. From the long history of litigated drug cases, it is evident that neither the casual user nor the dealer fits any precise description or category.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 67 (footnote omitted); <em>see also U.S. v. Turner, </em>119 F.3d 18, 20 (D.C.Cir.1997) (\u201cWhile it may be true that evidence of narcotics distribution would constitute [a] stronger cause to believe additional contraband [is] in [a] trunk, ... [appellant] might have hidden additional drugs not necessary for his current consumption in areas out of plain sight, including the trunk of the car.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The reality is that marijuana and other illegal drugs, by their very nature, can be stored almost anywhere within a vehicle. The location-specific principle that \u201cprobable cause must be tailored to specific compartments and containers within an automobile,\u201d <em>Carter, </em>300 F.3d at 422, does not apply when officers have only probable cause to believe that contraband is located somewhere within the vehicle, rather than in a specific compartment or container within the vehicle. <em>See Seals, </em>987 F.2d at 1107 n. 8. The odor of burnt marijuana emanating from a vehicle provides probable cause to believe that additional marijuana is present elsewhere in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">At oral argument, appellant\u2019s counsel stated that it is \u201cnot realistic\u201d to assume that an individual who is brave (or perhaps foolish) enough to smoke marijuana while driving would have the forethought to conceal any unused marijuana in the trunk of his or her vehicle. That argument rests on essentially the same premise underlying the \u201cburnt-raw\u201d and the \u201cuser-dealer\u201d distinctions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That is, mere users of marijuana keep their raw marijuana close at hand to avoid the inconven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>ience of going outside the passenger compartment of a vehicle for their next smoke. For that reason, drug users do not hide their unused stash in the trunk of their vehicles. Traffickers in marijuana, on the other hand, do not use drugs while transporting raw marijuana for distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">As counsel acknowledged at oral argument, \u201cit may very well be true in a lot of cases\u201d that one who smokes openly in his or her vehicle might also store marijuana in the trunk.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is not unreasonable for an officer to believe that the odor of burnt marijuana indicates current possession of unsmoked marijuana somewhere inside of the vehicle, including the trunk.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That belief reasonably applies to both traffickers and users because simple possession is a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">To adopt appellant\u2019s argument, the trunk, or any other area outside of the passenger compartment, becomes a safe harbor for the transportation of drugs for both users and traffickers who use drugs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We are not persuaded that a Fourth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>ment reasonableness analysis dictates that result. Probable cause is \u201ca flexible, common-sense standard\u201d to be applied in a \u201cpractical\u201d and \u201cnon-technical\u201d manner. <em>Daniels, </em>172 Md. App. at 89, 918 A.2d 617. The result we reach meets that standard because it eliminates the need to distinguish between burnt, burning, or raw marijuana and avoids speculation over whether a person is a user or a trafficker and, depending on which he or she is, where, within a vehicle, he or she would conceal any additional marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-15\">. Appellant presents the question as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-16\">Did the court err in denying Wilson\u2019s motion to suppress marijuana found in the trunk of his car after a traffic stop for speeding, where the only basis for probable cause to search the car was the fact that the stopping officer smelled an odor of burnt marijuana emanating from the open driver\u2019s side window?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b470-10\">. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b472-10\">.

Appellant does not contend that the search of the trunk would not extend to the suitcase in the trunk.

When there is probable cause to search for contraband in a car, it is reasonable for police officers \u2014 like customs officials in the founding era \u2014 to examine packages and containers without a showing of individualized probable cause for each one. A passenger\u2019s personal belongings, just like the driver\u2019s belongings or containers attached to the car like a glove compartment, are 'in\u2019 the car, and the officer has probable cause to search for contraband in the car.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b477-9\">.
