The Board suspended Dr. Cornfeld\u2019s license to practice medicine until he satisfied certain conditions, and imposed a three year probationary period thereafter. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City affirmed the Board\u2019s order. Cornfeld appeals, raising five issues for our review, which we rephrase as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">I. Did the Board err in concluding that Dr. Cornfeld engaged in unprofessional conduct \u201cin the practice of medicine\u201d by making misrepresentations during hospital peer review and Board investigations?</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">II. Did the Board violate section 14-401(i) of the Medical Practice Act by failing to complete its investigation within 18 months, or to explain its delay, requiring dismissal of the complaint against Cornfeld?</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">III. Is the Board\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Cornfeld violated the standard of care by leaving an anesthetized patient unattended in the operating room supported by substantial evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">IV. Is the sanction imposed by the Board \u201cso disproportionate to the alleged offense as to constitute arbitrary and capricious agency action\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">V. Did the administrative law judge abuse her discretion by excluding certain evidence offered by Dr. Cornfeld?</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">We shall hold that Dr. Cornfeld\u2019s false statements to hospital peer reviewers and Board investigators constituted \u201cprofessional misconduct in the practice of medicine.\u201d Finding substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s decision, no abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>of discretion, and no error of law, we shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">STATUTORY SCHEME GOVERNING PHYSICIAN DISCIPLINE</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In Maryland, physicians are governed by the Medical Practice Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), <em>codified at </em>Md.Code (1981, 2005 RepLVol., 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 14-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Health Occupations Article (HO). The Act is administered by the Board,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which has both licensing and disciplinary responsibilities. <em>See </em>[\u00b6] \u00a7 14-205, \u00a7 14-206, \u00a7 14-313. In performing these duties, the Board has adopted regulations. <em>See </em>Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 10.32.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Under the Act, the Board has authority to discipline physicians for enumerated reasons. Section 14 \u2014 404(a) identifies 40 specific bases for disciplinary action, two of which explicitly pertain to conduct committed \u201cin the practice of medicine.\u201d Section 14-404(a)(3) permits the Board to discipline a licensee who \u201c[i]s guilty of immoral or unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine[.]\u201d Section 14 \u2014 404(a)(ll) authorizes discipline of a physician who \u201c[wjillfully makes or files a false report or record in the practice of medicine[.]\u201d In addition, section 14-404(a)(22) allows disciplinary action against a licensee who \u201c[flails to meet appropriate standards as determined by appropriate peer review for the delivery of quality medical and surgical care performed in [a] ... hospital[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">In <em>Md. Bd. of Physicians v. Bernstein, </em>167 Md.App. 714, 719-21, 894 A.2d 621 (2006), we detailed the Board\u2019s process for investigating and adjudicating complaints against physicians, and the ensuing process of judicial review.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>The Act authorizes the Board to reprimand a licensed physician, place a licensee on probation, or suspend or revoke a license to practice medicine for enumerated reasons .... When an allegation that may constitute grounds for disciplinary action under the Act comes to the Board\u2019s attention, the Board generally initiates an investigation. [\u00b6] \u00a7 14-401(a); COMAR 10.32.02.03A. If the allegation concerns the standard of care and, after an investigation, the Board elects to pursue further investigation, the Board then refers the complaint to the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of Maryland (\u201cMed Chi\u201d) physician peer review.

CO-MAR 10.32.02.03(B)(2). If the Board files a charge, it refers the matter to an administrative prosecutor and sends notice to the physician. COMAR 10.32.02.03(C)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">At that point, the physician is entitled to a contested case hearing before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), in the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d), pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl. Vol.), section 10-201 et seq. of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d). [\u00b6] \u00a7 14-405(a); <em>see also </em>COMAR 10.32.02.03(D). Following the hearing, the ALJ issues findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a proposed disposition. COMAR 10.32.02.03(E)(10).... Either party may file exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s findings and proposed disposition. COMAR 10.32.02.03(F).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">The Board is not bound by the decision of the ALJ. After receiving the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision, the Board must review the record and the ALJ\u2019s proposal, and hold a hearing on any exceptions. COMAR 10.32.02.03(F). It then issues a final decision stating its findings of facts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>conclusions of law, and a disposition of the charge. CO-MAR 10.32.02.03(E)(10).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">The Board\u2019s final decision is subject to judicial review in the circuit court in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, and then to appeal to this Court.

Elliott, </em>170 Md.App. 369, 907 A.2d 321 (reviewing standards for appellate review of Board decision overruling ALJ), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 Md. 12, 912 A.2d 648 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">We recount the facts as they were found by the Board.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Cornfeld practices obstetrics and gynecology. On October 28,1999, he performed a Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP) on a 31 year old patient admitted to Montgomery General Hospital (MGH), in order to remove abnormal cervical tissue. The patient was placed under general anesthesia for the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The excision procedure is performed with a Bovie machine, which is a surgical instrument that heats up a fine metal wire shaped into a loop, which in turn is connected to a \u201cBovie pencil.\u201d The pencil and loop are inserted through the vagina to remove abnormal tissue.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">Dr. Cornfeld had a card on file at MGH stating that his preference was to have the Bovie machine set at 70 for coagulation and 70 for cervical conization (\u201ccutting\u201d) procedures such as the one he performed that day. But the operating room nurse responsible for overseeing the equipment and patient preparation that day, Sheryl Dickey, initially set the Bovie machine at 50 for both coagulation and cutting, in accordance with standard settings used in most procedures. Dr. Cornfeld instructed Ms. Dickey to change both settings to 70, and she did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>During the procedure, Dr. Cornfeld burned the patient twice, causing a laceration of approximately 6 centimeters. He repaired this with two large Vicryl stitches.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Nurse Dickey notified a nurse supervisor who was in the operating room, Joan Fitzgerald, of the burn and sutures. After observing the burn, Fitzgerald left the operating room to consult a supervisor. When Dr. Cornfeld announced that he had concluded the procedure, Nurse Dickey asked the anesthesiologist not to wake the patient because another surgeon would be coming in to review the patient. Nurse Fitzgerald returned and advised Dr. Cornfeld that she had been instructed to have another physician cheek the patient before she left the operating room. Dr. Cornfeld replied, \u201cDo what you need to do,\u201d then left the operating room. No other surgeon was in the operating room at the time. It was at least two to three minutes before Dr. Thomas Vincent arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Dr. Vincent reviewed the patient, removed the sutures, and resutured the laceration with smaller sutures. After concluding the repair, Dr. Vincent located Dr. Cornfeld, explained what he had done, and asked Dr. Cornfeld what had happened. Dr. Cornfeld discussed the case with Dr. Vincent while the patient was in recovery. The patient did not suffer any severe or long-term effects from the laceration or suturing.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">MGH suspended Cornfeld\u2019s hospital privileges shortly after the incident. In July 2000, in a peer review investigation by the hospital, Dr. Cornfeld stated under oath:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">I don\u2019t think anybody in our department ever sets a bovie at 70 or a cautery at 70 as a starting point. I haven\u2019t heard that they did____ I thought it was routine that when I would come in this thing would be set at 40 or 50.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Following its investigation and peer review, the hospital revoked Dr. Cornfeld\u2019s privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">The Board initiated an investigation in January 2000. In February 2000, through his attorney, Dr. Cornfeld filed written and signed responses to the Board\u2019s inquiry, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>The nurse who operates this machine was negligent in setting the machine to a heat of seventy to eighty whereas the appropriate setting used by Dr. Cornfeld is forty. Dr. Cornfeld has performed this surgery on many occasions at [MGH] and at other hospitals. Dr. Cornfeld has standing instructions for the setting of forty, and in every Leep Cone Biopsy, other than this one, the nurse operating the machine has set it to forty without specific instructions from Dr. Cornfeld other than the standing instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">The Board filed charges against Dr. Cornfeld in November 2003, alleging both violations of standards of care and unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine. The three alleged violations of the standard of care in treating the patient consisted of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">1. Setting the Bovie machine too high for patient safety; Performing an inadequate repair of the laceration caused by the burn; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">2. Leaving an anesthetized patient unattended by another surgeon in the operating room.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">After an evidentiary hearing, an administrative law judge initially found that Dr. Cornfeld breached all three standards of care applicable to these charges. After hearing and exceptions, however, the Board concluded that \u201c[t]he clear and convincing evidence demonstrates only that Dr. Cornfeld left an anesthetized patient unattended in the operating room and thus violated section 14-404(a)(22).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">The Board\u2019s separate charge of \u201cunprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine\u201d was based on Cornfeld\u2019s statements regarding his instructions for settings on the Bovie machine. These were made to the hospital during its peer review investigation, and to the Board during its investigation and disciplinary proceedings. The ALJ concluded that these statements were misrepresentations because Dr. Cornfeld had standing instructions to set the Bovie machine at 70, and specifically instructed Nurse Dickey to increase the setting from 50 to 70 before the procedure in question began. Because Dr. Cornfeld\u2019s misrepresentations were made during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>hospital peer review and Board investigation, however, the ALJ determined that they did not fall within \u201cthe practice of medicine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The Board sustained the State\u2019s exception to that conclusion, determining that Dr. Cornfeld\u2019s misrepresentations during hospital peer review and Board proceedings occurred in the practice of medicine, and violated [\u00b6] section 14-404(a)(3). The Board reasoned that \u201c[b]oth MGH\u2019s and the Board\u2019s investigations involved the manner in which Dr. Cornfeld practiced medicine\u201d and \u201cthe manner in which he had treated a patient.\u201d In support, it cited its own precedents that making a false application or submitting false testimony for a Board proceeding are \u201cclearly within the practice of medicine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The Board sanctioned Dr. Cornfeld by revoking his license to practice medicine until he satisfied certain enumerated conditions, including obtaining \u201ca neuropsychological evaluation\u201d and report, undergoing \u201ca psychiatric evaluation\u201d and therapy as recommended, and completing an \u201cethics course,\u201d all of which would be selected and reviewed by the Board. Once his suspension lifts, Dr. Cornfeld would continue on probation for three years, during which his practice is subject to \u201cBoard review and peer review\u201d at the Board\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Review Of Board\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">The standards governing judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision regarding Dr. Cornfeld are set forth <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 67-69, 729 A.2d 376 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">A court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow; it is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>In applying the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court decides whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached. A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. A reviewing court must review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence and to draw inferences from that evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\">Despite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions, a court\u2019s task on review is not to substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency. Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.

Comm\u2019n on Medical Discipline, </em>301 Md. 426, 483 A.2d 76 (1984),\u201d which construed the practice of medicine to exclude physician misconduct involving a civil malpractice trial, rather than by its later decisions in <em>Banks, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>354 Md. at 76, 729 A.2d 376, and <em>Finucan v.

We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><em>McDonnell, Banks, </em>and <em>Finucan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In <em>McDonnell, </em>the Court of Appeals reversed a ruling that a physician\u2019s efforts to influence expert witnesses who were scheduled to testify against him in a medical malpractice trial<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> constituted sanctionable conduct in the practice of medicine, within the meaning of the predecessor to current section 14-404(a)(3). <em>See McDonnell, </em>301 Md. at 437, 483 A.2d 76. Dr. McDonnell\u2019s inappropriate contacts are detailed in <em>Meyer v. McDonnell, </em>40 Md.App. 524, 525-26, 392 A.2d 1129 (1978). The first interference occurred during trial and resulted in the witness refusing to testify.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The second incident occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>after McDonnell became \u201cincensed\u201d at the testimony of another expert witness.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The <em>McDonnell </em>Court specifically rejected the Attorney General\u2019s argument that such misconduct \u201cwas inextricably related to the practice of medicine\u201d because it \u201coccurred in the utilization of his medical office and. while he was acting as a physician[.]\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 433-34, 483 A.2d 76. Reviewing the language of the statute, the Court of Appeals observed that the legislature</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">expressly outlined and defined nineteen forms of physician misconduct, some of which had no immediate connection with the diagnosis, care or treatment of patients or the practice of medicine, such as habitual intoxication, conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>of a crime of moral turpitude, or the personal use of illegal drugs. In only two of the nineteen described types of misconduct are the disciplinary infractions explicitly limited to a physician\u2019s act \u201cin his practice as a physician,\u201d i.e.: \u201c(8) Immoral conduct of a physician in his practice as a physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">(9) Willfully making and filing false reports or records, in his practice as a physician.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 435-36, 483 A.2d 76.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">For this reason, the <em>McDonnell </em>Court concluded, \u201cit is not any immoral conduct of a physician, or any willful filing of a false report which constitutes \u2018unprofessional conduct\u2019; rather, the misconduct must occur in the physician\u2019s \u2018practice as a physician.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435, 483 A.2d 76. Given the \u201cpunitive aspect\u201d of the Board\u2019s disciplinary proceedings, and that the legislature intended these provisions to reach only immoral conduct that is \u201cdirectly tied to the physician\u2019s conduct in the actual performance of the practice of medicine, <em>i e., </em>in the diagnosis, care, or treatment of patients.[,]\u201d the Court held that the statutory language \u201cshould be strictly construed against the disciplinary agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436-37, 483 A.2d 76. Thus, conduct that has merely \u201ca general or associative relationship to the physician in his capacity as a member of the medical profession\u201d is not sanctionable by the Board. <em>Id. </em>at 437, 483 A.2d 76. Applying this view of the statute, the Court of Appeals concluded that, although \u201cDr. McDonnell\u2019s act in initiating the improper phone calls was related to his professional practice,\u201d the calls were \u201cnot done in the course of the actual practice of medicine[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 71, 729 A.2d 376 (1999), the Court of Appeals affirmed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Board\u2019s decision that a physician\u2019s sexual harassment of hospital employees occurred in the practice of medicine. The doctor argued unsuccessfully that \u201cnone of his conduct [was] within the practice of medicine because, when it occurred, he was not diagnosing, treating or evaluating patients,\u201d but \u201cmerely \u2018chatting or socializing with co-workers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Following courts elsewhere, the Court of Appeals rejected such \u201can extremely technical and narrow definition of the practice of medicine.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 74, 729 A.2d 376. The <em>Banks </em>Court reasoned that limiting section 14-404(a)(3) to misconduct that occurs \u201cin a non-clerical task\u201d committed \u201cin the immediate process of diagnosing, evaluating, examining, or treating a patient\u201d \u201cwould lead to unreasonable results and render the statute inadequate to deal with the many situations which may arise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73, 729 A.2d 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Instead, the Court concluded, the touchstone for determining whether misconduct occurred \u201cin the practice of medicine\u201d must be whether it was \u201csufficiently intertwined with patient care\u201d to pose a threat to patients or the medical profession. <em>See id. </em>at 76-77, 729 A.2d 376. When the misconduct occurs \u201cin a hospital setting,\u201d the answer to that question is one the Board \u201cis particularly well-qualified to deeide[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76, 729 A.2d 376.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">The Board could reasonably hold that Dr. Banks\u2019s conduct of sexually harassing hospital employees was within the practice of medicine because he was on duty and in the working areas of the hospital. When on duty, Dr. Banks was responsible for admitting patients, caring for patients, and assisting in the operating room and emergency department.... When Dr. Banks was on duty he was there for the purpose of practicing medicine; <em>i.e., </em>for the \u201cdiagnosis, care, or treatment of patients.\u201d Dr. Banks sexually harassed his co-workers who were present in the working areas of the hospital in connection with the practice of medicine. This conduct has more than merely a \u201cgeneral or associative relationship\u201d to Dr. Banks\u2019s capacity as a member of the medical profession. The connection to the practice of medicine was sufficient for the Board to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>conclude that it is \u201cin the actual performance of the practice of medicine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><em>Id. at </em>72-73, 729 A.2d 376 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Of particular interest to this appeal is the manner in which the <em>Banks </em>Court distinguished <em>McDonnell.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">We agree with the Board that this case is distinguishable from <em>McDonnell. </em>In <em>McDonnell, </em>the physician\u2019s conduct occurred during judicial proceedings against him based upon conduct constituting malpractice. His conduct did not occur in the workplace where he was present for the purpose of practicing medicine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 72, 729 A.2d 376 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">In its most recent decision interpreting the \u201cpractice of medicine\u201d language in section 14-404(a), the Court of Appeals held that a physician\u2019s misconduct in engaging in consensual sexual relations with patients under his care occurred in the practice of medicine. In <em>Finucan v. Md. Bd. of Physician Quality Assur., </em>380 Md. 577, 597, 846 A.2d 377 (2004), the Court reiterated its holding in <em>Banks </em>\u201cthat if the physician\u2019s misconduct relates to the effective delivery of patient care, the misconduct occurs in the practice of medicine.\u201d It again rejected a \u201cnarrow interpretation\u201d of \u201cthe practice of medicine,\u201d this time dismissing arguments that the Board\u2019s authority to sanction misconduct is limited to actions while the physician is \u201c \u2018on duty\u2019 in medical environs,\u201d or to actions that \u201creflect[ed] adversely on his technical skills as a physician.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 598, 601, 846 A.2d 377. To the contrary, the Court reasoned, misconduct need not \u201craise doubts about the individual\u2019s grasp of particular technical skills.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601, 846 A.2d 377. It is enough that the misconduct \u201cindicate[s] unfitness to practice medicine\u201d by \u201craising] reasonable concerns that an individual abused ... the status of being a physician in such a way as to harm patients or diminish the standing of the medical profession in the eyes of a reasonable member of the general public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601, 846 A.2d 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Quoting our opinion, Judge Harrell pointed to \u201cfour particularly cogent points\u201d supporting the Board\u2019s conclusion that Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Finucan\u2019s misconduct was intertwined with patient care in such a manner that it posed a threat to his patients and \u201cdiminishe[d] the standing of the medical profession as caregivers.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 598, 601, 846 A.2d 377. Specifically, Finucan\u2019s sexual relationships (1) \u201cgrew directly out of ... and were entangled with\u201d his physician-patient relationships, (2) \u201cexploited, to his own ends, the trust that his patients placed in him as their physician[,]\u201d (3) \u201crisked losing ... the objectivity that any physician must have when caring for patients[,]\u201d and (4) \u201cdamaged his patients emotionally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598-99, 846 A.2d 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Dr. Cornfeld\u2019s Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Relying on <em>McDonnell, </em>Dr. Cornfeld argues that the responses he gave to hospital and Board investigators<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> concerning what happened in the MGH operating room on October 28, 1999 did not constitute \u201cthe practice of medicine.\u201d In Cornfeld\u2019s view, his misconduct, like Dr. McDonnell\u2019s, did not occur \u201cin the practice of medicine\u201d because it \u201ctook place in the context of \u2018judicial proceedings\u2019 against the doctor due to allegations of inappropriate medical care.\u201d The doctor argues that the Board erred \u201cin suggesting that in issuing <em>Banks </em>the Court of Appeals intended to so dramatically broaden the definition of the phrase \u2018practice of medicine\u2019 to encompass facts such as presented in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">To be sure, unlike <em>Finucan </em>and <em>Banks, </em>the misconduct in this instance does not consist of predatory sexual behavior involving patients or hospital co-workers. Moreover, like <em>McDonnell, </em>this case involves misconduct that occurred during proceedings that arguably \u201cadjudicated\u201d the medical propriety of Dr. Cornfeld\u2019s care. In light of the Court of Appeals\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>rejection of a \u201cnarrow view\u201d of the practice of medicine in both <em>Banks </em>and <em>Finucan, </em>however, we do not agree with Dr. Cornfeld that <em>McDonnell </em>so narrowly defined the practice of medicine that it necessarily excludes professional misconduct during hospital peer reviews and Board disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">The discussion in <em>McDonnell of </em>what constitutes the practice of medicine was limited. The Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis simply stated that it must be \u201cdirectly tied to the physician\u2019s conduct in the actual performance of the practice of medicine, <em>i.e., </em>in the diagnosis, care, or treatment of patients!.]\u201d <em>McDonnell, </em>301 Md. at 435, 483 A.2d 76. We find nothing in <em>McDonnell </em>to suggest that all misconduct during an adjudicative proceeding is necessarily excluded from the \u201cpractice of medicine,\u201d or that a physician\u2019s dishonesty during hospital peer review and Board investigation of patient care cannot be \u201cdirectly tied to\u201d his practice of medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Moreover, <em>McDonnell </em>is factually distinguishable in critical respects. Dr. McDonnell\u2019s misconduct consisted of interfering with prospective witnesses in a medical malpractice trial involving his former patient. He initiated improper phone calls from his medical office, in an effort to influence testimony by fellow physicians, by warning them that there would be professional consequences for testifying against him. But McDonnell did not discuss his diagnosis or treatment of any patient. <em>See id. </em>at 429-30, 483 A.2d 76; <em>Meyer, </em>40 Md.App. at 525-27, 392 A.2d 1129. Thus, his misconduct did not occur in the practice of medicine, because it did not concern patient care issues and did not involve the exercise of McDonnell\u2019s judgment as a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In its subsequent decisions in <em>Banks </em>and <em>Finucan, </em>the Court of Appeals examined in greater detail the scope and policies underlying the standard it articulated in <em>McDonnell. </em>Explicitly rejecting a \u201cnarrow view\u201d of the \u201cpractice of medicine!,]\u201d the Court emphasized that the nature and effect of a particular act of professional misconduct determines whether it occurred in the practice of medicine. Misconduct reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>ably may be considered to be in the practice of medicine when it \u201crelates to the effective delivery of patient care[.]\u201d <em>See Finucan, </em>380 Md. at 597, 846 A.2d 377; <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 74, 729 A.2d 376. Such a relationship may be established by evidence that the physician abused his status as a physician in a manner that either harmed patients, created a substantial risk of harm to them, or diminished the standing of the medical profession as caregivers. <em>See Finucan, </em>380 Md. at 601, 846 A.2d 377; <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 74, 729 A.2d 376. The presence of one or more of these effects sufficiently ties the physician\u2019s misconduct to the exercise of medical judgment and duties to warrant a finding that it occurred \u201cin the practice of medicine.\u201d <em>See Finucan, </em>380 Md. at 598-99, 846 A.2d 377; <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 62-64, 729 A.2d 376; <em>McDonnell, </em>301 Md. at 436-37, 483 A.2d 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Given the blatant \u201con the job\u201d sexual misconduct of Drs. Banks and Finucan, neither of those decisions definitively answers whether Dr. Cornfeld\u2019s misconduct occurred in the practice of medicine. We have not found a reported case considering whether a treating physician\u2019s dishonesty in hospital peer review or state disciplinary proceedings falls within \u201cthe practice of medicine.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>The Board\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Cornfeld\u2019s false statements to the hospital and the Board constituted \u201cprofessional misconduct in the practice of medicine\u201d has \u201cconsiderable weight\u201d in this Court, because the Board\u2019s expertise in interpreting and applying [\u00b6] section 14-404(a) is \u201centitled to judicial respect,\u201d particularly in a case involving misconduct in a hospital setting. <em>See Finucan, </em>380 Md. at 590, 846 A.2d 377; <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 69, 729 A.2d 376. In this instance, we agree with the Board that Dr. Cornfeld\u2019s false statements \u201cinvolved the manner in which [he] practiced medicine\u201d and \u201cthe manner in which he treated a patient,\u201d such that they are \u201cdirectly tied to\u201d the \u201ceffective delivery of patient care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Dr. Cornfeld stated under oath to his fellow physicians at MGH that, as a matter of routine, he expected the bovie machine \u201cwould be set at 40 or 50,\u201d when in fact he had given standing written instructions to the hospital, as well as specific instructions to operating room nurses on the day of the surgery, to set the machine at 70. Cornfeld made these false statements to peer reviewers at the hospital where he performed the surgery in question, and repeated them to Board investigators, in order to influence decisions concerning the quality of his medical care to a patient and his fitness to practice medieine at MGH specifically, and in Maryland generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">We are persuaded that Cornfeld\u2019s dishonesty in hospital peer review proceedings and the Board investigation qualifies as unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine. There can be no debate that a physician\u2019s lack of veracity regarding events in an operating room constitutes unprofessional conduct. Indeed, as this Court recognized long ago, fundamental principles of medical ethics require that \u201c[a] physician shall deal honestly with patients and colleaguesf.]\u201d <em>Dr. K. v.

As every physician knows, hospital peer review is not merely a necessary condition to maintaining the privilege to treat patients at that hospital, but it also serves an important patient care purpose. <em>See, e.g., Brem v.

These misrepresentations were made to persons responsible for evaluating Cornfeld\u2019s medical care to patients at MGH. Such misrepresentations therefore were \u201cdirectly tied\u201d to medical \u201ctreatment\u201d and \u201csurgery,\u201d within the statutory definition of \u201cpractice medicine.\u201d <em>See </em>[\u00b6] \u00a7 14-101(l); <em>McDonnell, </em>301 Md. at 437, 483 A.2d 76. Indirectly, as well, such dishonesty \u201cdiminishes the standing of the medical profession as caregivers.\u201d <em>See Finucan, </em>380 Md. at 597, 601, 846 A.2d 377; <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 74, 729 A.2d 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The same false statements were made to the Board, a governmental agency responsible for investigating and disciplining physicians for professional misconduct. \u201cThe Board\u2019s mission [is] to regulate the use of physician\u2019s licenses in Maryland,\u201d <em>Dr. K., </em>98 Md.App. at 118, 632 A.2d 453, in order \u201cto protect and preserve the public health[.]\u201d <em>Comm\u2019n on Medical Discipline v.

This differs from the witness tampering by Dr. McDonnell in the course of a civil malpractice case, a proceeding whose purpose is to obtain compensation for the plaintiff, which is not brought for the purpose of maintaining high standards in the medical profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">A contrary conclusion \u201cwould lead to unreasonable results.\u201d <em>See Banks, </em>354 Md. at 75, 729 A.2d 376. To exclude dishonesty in hospital peer review proceedings as sanctionable misconduct in the practice of medicine would mean that lying directly to a patient about what occurred during her surgery would qualify as unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>but lying to a hospital about the same surgery during peer review proceedings concerning that same patient would not qualify as unprofessional misconduct in the practice of medicine. A similar discordant result would follow if we were to hold that Cornfeld\u2019s false statement to the Board did not fall within the scope of practicing medicine. Such an anomaly would severely undermine the purpose of section 14-404.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">We hold that the Board had a reasonable factual and legal basis to conclude that Cornfeld\u2019s lie, made under oath in his capacity as a treating physician, about his own medical judgment and performance in surgery, in order that his treatment of a patient\u2019s condition would be approved by peer reviewers and the Board, constituted unprofessional misconduct \u201cin the practice of medicine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Delay In Board Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">[\u00b6] section 14-401 (j) addresses the length of a Board investigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">(j)(l) <em>Time for disposition of complaint. </em>\u2014 It is the intent of this section that the disposition of every complaint against a licensee that sets forth allegations of grounds for disciplinary action filed with the Board shall be completed as expeditiously as possible and, in any event, within 18 months after the complaint was received by the Board. (2) If the Board is unable to complete the disposition of a complaint within 1 year, the Board shall include in the record of that complaint a detailed explanation of the reason for the delay. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Dr. Cornfeld complains that \u201cthe Board did not complete its investigation or dispose of the complaint ... within 18 months from the date the complaint was filed,\u201d and did not otherwise explain the reasons for the delay. The investigation was opened on January 12, 2000, but charges were not issued for more than three years, until November 21, 2003. Dr. Cornfeld contends that he repeatedly raised the untimeliness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>investigation to the Board, but the Board failed to comply with either the statutory time frame or the statutory requirement that any extension beyond one year be explained in detail on the record. In his view, \u201c[t]he Board would have there be no consequence at all for its failure to comply with the Medical Practice Act.\u201d The proper remedy, he contends, is dismissal of the charges for failure to comply with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">We agree with the Board that any viable complaint that Dr. Cornfeld may have had about the Board\u2019s delay and failure to explain, as required by section 14-401(j), does not merit dismissal of the charges. To be sure, we are troubled by the length of time between initial complaint and filing of charges, as well as the Board\u2019s apparent disregard of the \u201cextension explanation\u201d provision in the statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we concur that this is another instance when the legislature\u2019s failure to include a penalty for failure to act within a prescribed time indicates that the provision is directory, rather than mandatory. <em>See, e. g., Md. State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Frank, </em>272 Md. 528, 533, 325 A.2d 718 (1974) (rule without sanction for violation is more likely to be directory); <em>Pope v.

Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance, </em>132 Md.App. 447, 456, 752 A.2d 1217, <em>cert. denied, </em>360 Md. 275, 757 A.2d 811 (2000), this Court held that the legislative history of the 18 month period in section 14 \u2014 401(j)(l) indicates that this time frame is directory, not mandatory. <em>See </em>1988 Md. Laws, ch. 109 (providing that \u201ctime ... frames for ... completing the disposition of complaints ... are directory to the Board ... and may not be construed as a defense or bar to a complaint or any action on a complaint against a licensee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>in any proceedings arising out of th[e] Act\u201d). For the same reason, we conclude that the ensuing explanation requirement in subsection (j)(2) is also directory rather than mandatory. It would be inconsistent to hold that failing to explain why an investigation is taking longer is mandatory. In accordance with [\u00b6] \u00a7 14-405(g), therefore, \u201chearing of charges may not be ... challenged by any procedural defects alleged to have occurred prior to the filing of charges[,]\u201d including complaints that the Board failed to comply with section 14 \u2014 401(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Moreover, Dr. Cornfeld had a full and fair opportunity to be heard concerning the charges against him. He has never contended that the lack of explanation for the delay prejudiced him. These are not circumstances in which such prejudice might be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Violation Of Standard Of Care</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Dr. Cornfeld challenges whether, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s finding by clear and convincing evidence that he left an anesthetized patient \u201cunattended\u201d in the operating room. He points to a hospital form completed at the time of the incident, which states that he left the operating room at 11:35 and that Dr. Vincent entered at 11:35, as \u201cmore reliable evidence as to what occurred on October 28, 1999, than testimony of witnesses who were testifying from their recollection of an event that took place years in the past.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Moreover, Dr. Cornfeld asserts, the evidence shows that the patient was attended at all times in the OR by the anesthesiologist (Dr. Wei), the circulating nurse (Ms. Dickey), and a nurse technician (Ms. Calpin). In addition, he reiterates his testimony that \u201cit is not unusual for the surgeon to leave the operating room before the patient wakes up\u201d for a variety of reasons, including taking and viewing x-rays.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">The Board counters with the following evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\u2022 Dr. Vincent stated that Dr. Cornfeld was not in the operating room when he arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u2022 Nurse Sherry Dickey reported that Joan Fitzgerald, the nurse supervisor in the operating room, \u201ctold Dr. Cornfeld that we could not take the patient out of the OR until another doctor saw the patient. He said \u2018do what you have to do\u2019 and left the room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\u2022 Ms. Calpin, a certified operating room technician during the biopsy, made a written statement shortly after the incident, stating that Dr. Cornfeld sutured the laceration, then \u201ctook his gown off &amp; left the room. Dr. Vincent arrived a few minutes later[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">\u2022 Nurse Dickey also testified that \u201cthe data entry on the computer system\u201d used to complete the form cited by Dr. Cornfeld \u201conly allowed a five minute increment. And, basically, we rounded off lower or higher to the five minutes depending on what time it was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">\u2022 The Board\u2019s expert witness testified that the standard of care required that Dr. Cornfeld \u201cshould have stayed\u201d in the operating room \u201cuntil Dr. Vincent arrived. And then he could have explained to Dr. Vincent what happened and ask for Dr. Vincent\u2019s opinion if anything further needed to be done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AWZ\">\u2022 MGH\u2019s Medical Staff Executive Committee concluded that \u201cit was inappropriate\u201d for Dr. Cornfeld \u201cto leave the OR before the patient was extubated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-15\">\u2022 MGH\u2019s OB/GYN Review Committee concluded that Dr. Cornfeld inappropriately \u201cleft an anesthetized surgical patient unattended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-17\">We agree with the Board that the cited evidence provides a substantial factual basis for the Board\u2019s finding that Dr. Cornfeld violated the applicable standard of care. In particular, the Board was entitled to credit Nurse Dickey\u2019s explanation that the \u201c11:35\u201d arrival and departure times on the report cited by Dr. Cornfeld resulted from the five minute increment limitation on data entries. Moreover, Dr. Cornfeld\u2019s reliance on the 11:35 a.m. time report is undermined by his admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>that he \u201cexited the operating room upon being informed that Dr. Vincent \u2018would be right there\u2019 as he left.\u201d As for the contention that leaving was acceptable, the Board had substantial evidence to reject that view, given the contrary opinions expressed by the Board\u2019s expert and the hospital peer reviewers.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Dr. Cornfeld complains next that \u201cthe sanction imposed by the Board ... is so disproportionate to his alleged offense as to constitute an abuse of discretion, and arbitrary and capricious agency action.\u201d In support, he points to his \u201clong and fruitful career,\u201d apart from this \u201csingle procedure\u201d on a patient who was not harmed during this \u201ccommon and uncomplicated procedure.\u201d Moreover, he points out that the Board concurred with him that there was insufficient evidence to show \u201cthat the setting for the Bovie machine caused the burn\u201d and that the disputes regarding laceration repair \u201cwere legitimate matters of professional disagreement.\u201d In Cornfeld\u2019s view, the sanction is simply too harsh for leaving the. operating room just before Dr. Vincent arrived. Indeed, he contends, the patient \u201cherself did not see this matter as a big issue, and continued to have confidence in Dr. Cornfeld seeking him out to deliver her next child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">This Court has held that an administrative agency with disciplinary and licensing authority \u201chas broad latitude in fashioning sanctions within [those] legislatively designated limits,\u201d so that it may place conditions on any suspension or probation. <em>See Neutron Prods., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Environment, </em>166 Md.App. 549, 584, 890 A.2d 858, <em>cert. denied, </em>392 Md. 726, 898 A.2d 1005 (2006); <em>Blaker v.

Mullan, </em>381 Md. 157, 171, 848 A.2d 642 (2004). Thus, if the sanction is \u201clawful and authorized,\u201d the Board \u201cneed not justify its exercise of discretion by findings of fact or reasons articulating why the agency decided upon the particular discipline.\u201d <em>Md. Aviation Admin. v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 581, 873 A.2d 1145 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">We cannot say as a matter of law that the sanctions against Dr. Cornfeld exceeded the discretionary range given to the Board. The Board has statutory authority to \u201cplace any licensee on probation or suspend ... a license\u201d for violations of the Medical Practice Act. <em>See </em>[\u00b6] \u00a7 14-404(a). Dr. Cornfeld violated the Act by inappropriately leaving the operating room and by misrepresenting his instructions to hospital personnel. We cannot say that suspension and long term probation for Cornfeld\u2019s breach of the standard of care and professional misconduct are so \u201cextreme and egregious\u201d as to warrant judicial intervention. <em>See Mullan, </em>381 Md. at 171, 848 A.2d 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Evidentiary Rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Dr. Cornfeld\u2019s final assignment of error concerns evidentiary rulings by the ALJ. The Administrative Procedure Act protects a party\u2019s right to \u201ccall witnesses,\u201d \u201coffer evidence, including rebuttal evidence,\u201d \u201ccross-examine any witness,\u201d and \u201cpresent summation and argument.\u201d SG \u00a7 10-213(f). Although Dr. Cornfeld acknowledges that an ALJ may exclude evidence that is \u201cincompetent, irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious,\u201d SG \u00a7 10-213(d), he contends that \u201can ALJ can go too far, ... and that is what occurred in this case,\u201d when she denied Dr. Cornfeld his \u201cright to pursue any theories of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Specifically, Dr. Cornfeld contends the following rulings crippled his defense:</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">\u2022 That he was not permitted to elicit testimony about an incident that occurred the day before the surgery at issue in these proceedings, which could have established the bias of the same operating room nurse and technician who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>assisted him on October 28. The doctor proffered to the Board that, on that day, he performed a vaginal hysterectomy with the assistance of \u201cseveral witnesses against him, in which the nurses failed to keep a catheter drained resulting in a hole in the patient\u2019s bladder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\u2022 That he also was prevented from eliciting testimony on cross-examination that \u201cthese nurses and the scrub technician were smiling and giving high fives to each other on October 28, 1999 when Dr. Cornfeld left the operating room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">\u2022 Finally, that he was not permitted to \u201ctestify about what he believed to be the true motive behind his suspension of privileges at MGH \u2014 the hospital\u2019s unwritten policy to seek the retirement or removal of all doctors over the age of 70.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">After reviewing the portions of the record cited by Dr. Cornfeld in support of these complaints, we cannot say that the Board denied Cornfeld his right to defend himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Dr. Cornfeld cites only four pages of transcript in support of his claim that he was denied an opportunity to present evidence regarding the operating room incident on October 27. None of these support his complaint that the ALJ intentionally or unreasonably thwarted his presentation of evidence to support his \u201cpayback\u201d theory of the case arising from the \u201cday before\u201d incident.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Moreover, we agree -with the Board that the ALJ did not err in refusing to permit Cornfeld to question Peter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Monge, the CEO of MGH, about the number of physicians over 70 years old who hold privileges at MGH, on the ground that none of the charges against Cornfeld concerned his age. Dr. Cornfeld proffered that such evidence \u201ccould be material because there is a law of age discrimination, and they would have to find an alternate ... reason\u201d for revoking his hospital privileges. The ALJ allowed Cornfeld to testify that MGH wanted him out, and that he had been urged to retire because he was over 70. This was sufficient to present his defense theory that the charges arising from the October 28 surgery were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
