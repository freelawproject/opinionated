In July 2000, the Ohio Adult Parole Authority denied parole and continued Rollins\u2019s sentence until its maximum term.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">In 2001, Rollins filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Alen County for a writ of habeas corpus to compel appellee, his prison warden, to immediately release him from prison. The court of appeals dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">In his appeal as of right, Rollins claims that the court of appeals erred in dismissing his petition. He asserts that he is entitled to release from prison because of good-time credit earned under former R.C. 2967.19,1994 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 571,145 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 6437.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">Rollins\u2019s claim is meritless. Former R.C. 2967.19 does not entitle him to release from prison before he serves the maximum term of his sentence. <em>State ex rel. Bealler v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 36, 36, 740 N.E.2d 1100, 1101. And he has no inherent or constitutional right to be released prior to the expiration of his sentence. <em>State ex rel. Lanham v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 425, 427, 687 N.E.2d 283, 284-285.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">Based on the foregoing, Rollins is not entitled to the requested writ of habeas corpus. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b696-14\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
