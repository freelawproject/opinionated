Biros, was convicted of the aggravated murder of Tami Engstrom and sentenced to death. He was also convicted and sentenced to prison for felonious sexual penetration, aggravated robbery, and attempted rape. The court of appeals upheld the death sentence but set aside the findings of guilt of aggravated robbery as it related to the felony-murder charge and the death specification charging murder during an aggravated robbery. <em>State v. Biros </em>(Dec. 29, 1995), Trumbull App. No. 91-T-4632, unreported. On direct appeal as of right, we reinstated the findings of guilt as to aggravated robbery, affirmed the remaining convictions, and affirmed the death penalty. <em>State v. Biros </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 426, 678 N.E.2d 891, certiorari denied, <em>Biros v. Ohio </em>(1997), 522 U.S. 1002, 118 S.Ct. 574, 139 L.Ed.2d 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Subsequently, the trial court denied Biros\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, and the court of appeals affirmed. <em>State v. Biros </em>(May 28, 1999), Trumbull App. No. 98-T-0051, unreported, 1999 WL 391090. We declined to accept Biros\u2019s appeal. <em>State v. Biros </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 1406, 716 N.E.2d 1168.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">On September 15, 2000, Biros filed an application with the Trumbull County Court of Appeals to reopen his appeal from his conviction pursuant to App.R. 26(B) and <em>State v. Murnahan </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 60, 584 N.E.2d 1204, alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel before that court. However, the court of appeals found that Biros had failed to show good cause for filing his application more than ninety days after that court\u2019s judgment was journalized, as required by App.R. 26(B)(2)(b). <em>State v. Biros </em>(Dec. 27, 2000), Trumbull App. No. 91-T-4632, unreported. Hence, that court denied Biros\u2019s application to reopen his appeal. The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">In his first proposition of law, Biros argues that he had good cause for the late filing of his application for reconsideration under App.R. 26(B) and relies, in part, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>upon <em>Paris v. Turner </em>(C.A.6, 1999), 187 F.3d 637, decision reported without opinion; opinion at 1999 WL 357815, to support his claim of good cause. However, our disposition of Biros\u2019s remaining propositions, on the merits, negates any need to decide that issue.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ao1\"><em>Dennis Watkins, </em>Trumbull County Prosecuting Attorney, and <em>LuWayne Anuos, </em>Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AnU\"><em>David Bodiker, </em>State Public Defender, and <em>Angie Greene, </em>Assistant Public Defender, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In his second and third propositions of law, Biros asserts that his counsel have established a genuine issue as to whether he was denied the effective assistance of counsel in his initial appeal to the court of appeals. The two-pronged analysis found in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, is the appropriate standard to assess whether Biros has raised a genuine issue as to the ineffectiveness of appellate counsel in his request to reopen under App.R. 26(B)(5). <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 24, 25, 701 N.E.2d 696, 697; <em>State v. Reed </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 534, 535, 660 N.E.2d 456, 458. \u201cTo show ineffective assistance, [Biros] must prove that his counsel were deficient for failing to raise the issues he now presents and that there was a reasonable probability of success had he presented those claims on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Sheppard </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 329, 330, 744 N.E.2d 770, 771, citing <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus. Moreover, to justify reopening his appeal, Biros \u201cbears the burden of establishing that there was a \u2018genuine issue\u2019 as to whether he has a \u2018colorable claim\u2019 of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Spivey, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 25, 701 N.E.2d at 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">We have reviewed Biros\u2019s assertions of deficient performance by appellate counsel and find that Biros has failed to raise \u201ca genuine issue as to whether [he] was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal\u201d before the court of appeals, as required under App.R. 26(B)(5). Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b357-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
