On September 1, 1998, the BWC discovered an error in its calculation. On December 18,1998, it notified claimant that:</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\u201cThe average weekly wage was incorrectly calculated resulting in an underpayment in your claim. Your corrected average weekly wage is $174.08. BWC will issue a payment to you for the underpayment. However, adjustments will be limited to compensation paid for the two-year period prior to September 1, 1998, the date the error was discovered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">On December 31, 1998, claimant formally objected to the bureau\u2019s order. A district hearing officer (\u201cDHO\u201d) then reset the AWW at $206.60, and ordered an adjustment to all compensation previously paid. The DHO found that no application for readjustment had been filed in the claim, rendering inapplicable R.C. 4123.52\u2019s two-year statute of limitations that presumably motivated the bureau\u2019s repayment restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">The BWC appealed. A staff hearing officer, in turn, vacated the DHO\u2019s order and permitted recoupment only to December 31, 1996, the date two years prior to claimant\u2019s objection to the bureau\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Claimant filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging that the Industrial Commission/BWC abused their discretion in refusing to readjust all prior compensation. The magistrate recommended that the commission pay compensation retroactive to September 1, 1996, <em>i.e., </em>two years prior to the discovery of the error. The court of appeals ordered the commission to adjust all compensation previously paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-13\">The parties agree that claimant merits some measure of recovery for the amount of compensation that she was underpaid. They only disagree on the amount, based on the length of the recoupment.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-14\">The controversy arises from varying interpretations of R.C. 4123.52. It is, at times, a very confusing statute that intermixes a general grant of continuing jurisdiction with several statutes of limitations. The relevant portion reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>'\u201c[T]he commission shall not make any modification, change, finding, or award which shall award compensation for a back period in excess of two years prior to the date of filing application therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">This short passage is replete with perils. Consecutive reference to \u201cmodification,\u201d \u201cchange,\u201d \u201cfinding,\u201d and \u201caward\u201d suggests substantive distinctions between the terms. Reference to \u201capplication,\u201d without more, has also produced problems. See <em>State ex rel. Gen. Refractories Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 82, 541 N.E.2d 52. Finally, the prohibition against retroactively \u201cawarding\u201d compensation in excess of two years is also a potential source of trouble. Taken together, they render particularly perplexing matters of underpayment or overpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The BWC argues that the statute of limitations began to run on September 1, 1998 \u2014 the day the bureau discovered the error. The staff hearing officer pegged it to December 31,1998 \u2014 the date of claimant\u2019s written objection. The DHO and the court of appeals concluded that the statute of limitations was never triggered because no application had been filed. We agree that the statute of limitations was never triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The statute of limitations indeed begins running as of the date of the application for relief, and any discussion of that term starts with <em>Gen. Refractories. </em>At issue was the date to which \u2014 based on the two-year statute of limitations in R.C. 4123.52 \u2014 temporary total disability compensation (\u201cTTD\u201d) could be backdated. A March 23, 1982 doctor\u2019s report diagnosed right femoral necrosis as the cause of claimant\u2019s inability to work. Because that condition had not been allowed, the self-insured employer informed claimant that no consideration could be given to the condition, including the payment of any related compensation. Claimant responded on June 23,1983, with a motion for additional allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">A DHO allowed the condition. On May 15, 1985, claimant moved for TTD related thereto. A second DHO granted the motion and, after construing claimant\u2019s 1983 additional allowance motion as an \u201capplication for compensation,\u201d awarded TTD from March 16,1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">The employer appealed, arguing that claimant\u2019s 1985 formal TTD motion was the point from which to measure claimant\u2019s right to retroactive compensation. We disagreed. We initially observed that R.C. 4123.52 did not specify how an application was to be made. Consequently, the failure of the additional-allowance motion to contain a compensation demand was not dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">We cited four factors in determining whether an application existed: (1) 'the document\u2019s contents, (2) the nature of relief sought, (3) how the parties treated the document, and (4) the liberal construction mandate of R.C. 4123.95. Applying those factors, we emphasized three things: (1) the employer knew that claimant had been off work since March 16, 1982, for medical reasons, (2) the employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>itself made reference to compensation in its response to the initial doctor\u2019s report, and (3) claimant\u2019s additional allowance motion was generated by the employer\u2019s response to the doctor\u2019s report. Therefore:</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u201cPut in perspective, if appellant had considered necrosis as an allowed condition, the result would have been the payment of compensation for the condition and the June 23, 1983 motion would not have been necessary. Thus it appears obvious, as the commission and the court of appeals found, that the parties treated the application for allowance of the additional condition as an application for an additional award of compensation.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Gen. Refractories, </em>44 Ohio St 3d at 84, 541 N.E.2d at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The most immediate dilemma is one of identification. In <em>Gen. Refractories, </em>there were two clear requests for action, that is, two potential applications \u2014 the additional-allowance motion and the TTD motion. Resolution merely required choosing between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Here, there is no motion. There is simply a bureau order and claimant\u2019s written objection to it. The former comports least with the criteria set forth by <em>Gen. Refractories. </em>That case instructs the reviewer to examine the \u201cnature of the relief <em>sought.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 83, 541 N.E.2d at 54. This implies a request. The bureau order is not requesting relief. It is exactly what its name indicates \u2014 an order. It states what is to be done and how it is to be accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">We are uncomfortable with this reasoning because we recognize that when the bureau exercises <em>sua sponte </em>its continuing jurisdiction to correct a mistake, an order such as this is usually all that issues. The BWC does not apply for permission to act. Thus, if the bureau order lacks value for purposes of the two-year statute of limitations, does that mean that the bureau is not bound by the statute of limitation? Going a step further, one wonders whether the BWC even has continuing jurisdiction to order any recoupment if, as the court of appeals held, R.C. 4123.52 does not apply at all. These are questions that have no ready answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">Claimant\u2019s written objection more closely conforms to some of the elements set forth in <em>Gen. Refractories </em>because it indeed seeks relief. Unlike that case, however, claimant\u2019s submission was not initiating, it was responsive. Therefore, construing this objection as an application effectively penalizes claimant for actively participating in her case. Claimant\u2019s acquiescence would have kept the BWC\u2019s September 1, 1996 recoupment date intact. If her objection constitutes an application, recoupment is limited to December 31, 1996, costing claimant four months of underpaid benefits. This conflicts with the liberal-construction mandate of <em>Gen. Refractories.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The third proposed date is September 1, 1998. It is the date on which the BWC realized its mistake. While generous, it, too \u2014 for various reasons \u2014 does not satisfy <em>Gen. Refractories. </em>As demonstrated by its third criterion \u2014 treatment of the application by the parties \u2014 inherent in that evaluation is knowledge by the parties of a dispute. A party cannot respond to something that it does not know exists. The BWC discovered the miscalculation on September 1,1998. Claimant did not know that a miscalculation had occurred, however, until she received the bureau\u2019s December 18, 1998 order \u2014 the shortcomings of which have already been discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Analysis has thus come full circle and herein lies the dilemma, as no answer distinguishes itself. We find that the court of appeals\u2019 judgment is truest to R.C. 4123.52 and <em>Gen. Refractories. </em>Because the statute of limitations in R.C. 4123.52 requires an application to trigger it and nothing satisfies <em>Gen. Refractories\u2019 </em>outline of an application, then the statute of limitations has not been invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b261-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AdZ\">Cook, J., concurs in judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b261-10\">Lundberg Stratton, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b261-11\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AmN9\">dissenting. I dissent from the majority opinion and would calculate payment from September 1, 1988, the date the BWC discovered the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">I believe that the clear intent of R.C. 4123.52 is to apply to <em>all </em>adjustments to changes in awards. R.C. 4123.52 refers to <em>\u201cany </em>modification, change, finding, or award.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The majority finds the phrase \u201cfiling application\u201d removes from the statute all BWC-discovered mistakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">This penalizes the diligent claimant and rewards the claimant who fails to discover a mistake. The claimant who discovers a mistake and files an application to correct such a mistake is only entitled to back pay two years from the application. If the claimant sits on his or her rights or doesn\u2019t challenge the finding, and the BWC discovers the mistake, the majority awards that claimant compensation back to the <em>beginning.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">I believe that the intent of the legislature in putting in the limitation was to require due diligence on a claimant\u2019s part to verify and challenge awards while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>limiting the fund\u2019s liability for errors occurring long ago. Today\u2019s decision erodes that responsibility and, in fact, actually rewards the irresponsible.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AZD\"><em>Shapiro, Kendis &amp; Associates Co., L.P.A., </em>and <em>Rachel B.
