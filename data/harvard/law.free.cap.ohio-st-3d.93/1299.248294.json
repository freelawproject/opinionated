This cause is pending before the court as an appeal and cross-appeal from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County. It appears from the records of this court that appellee/cross-appellant has not filed a memorandum in response and in support of cross-appeal, due September 13, 2001, in compliance with the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court and therefore has failed to prosecute the cross-appeal with the requisite diligence. Upon consideration thereof,</p>\n<p id=\"Autn\">IT IS ORDERED by the court that the cross-appeal be, and hereby is, dismissed, <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ar-R\">The appeal of the state of Ohio remains pending.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
