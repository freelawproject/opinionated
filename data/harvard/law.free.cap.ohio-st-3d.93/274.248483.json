Hartman, raises thirteen propositions of law. Finding none meritorious, we affirm his convictions. We have also independently weighed the aggravating circumstance against the mitigating factors and compared his sentence to those imposed in similar cases, as R.C. 2929.05(A) requires. As a result, we affirm defendant\u2019s convictions and sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">Defendant met Winda Snipes at a bar in Akron, Ohio, sometime during 1997. Subsequently, they engaged in sexual intercourse on several occasions. During the late afternoon of September 9, 1997, defendant went to Snipes\u2019s apartment and brutally murdered her by tying her to the bed, stabbing her one hundred thirty-eight times, slitting her throat, and cutting off her hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder, kidnapping, and tampering with evidence, and sentenced to death. In order to establish defendant\u2019s guilt, the state introduced statements defendant had made to the police and to a fellow inmate in jail, and the testimony of a co-worker that defendant mentioned cutting off a victim\u2019s hands as a way to eliminate evidence in the O. J. Simpson case. The state also introduced as evidence defendant\u2019s bloody tee-shirt and Snipes\u2019s watch recovered from defendant\u2019s apartment, and forensic testimony linking defendant to the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\n<em>State\u2019s case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Around 2:20 a.m. on September 9, 1997, defendant met Snipes at the Bucket Shop, an Akron bar. Defendant kissed Snipes on the cheek and they talked. Thereafter, defendant and Snipes left the bar and they went to her apartment across the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Around 3:00 a.m., David Morris, an acquaintance of defendant and Snipes, left the Inn Between, another Akron bar. While walking past Snipes\u2019s apartment on his way home, Morris observed Snipes and defendant through the upstairs window of her apartment. Morris testified that Snipes was yelling at defendant about touching stuff that was not his. Defendant closed the window blinds and \u201cobviously she wasn\u2019t very happy about it\u201d because she \u201cscolded\u201d him and reopened the blinds.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">That afternoon, at around 4:30 p.m., Snipes was observed crossing a street in a nearby business district. She was never seen alive again.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Defendant had the day off from work on September 9. According to Richard Russell, a bartender at the Inn Between, defendant entered the bar at around 8:00 p.m. and appeared nervous and hyper, and talked excessively. Thereafter, defendant was in and out of the bar five to six times between 9:00 and 10:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Defendant first contacted the police on September 9 with a series of anonymous 911 calls, which he later admitted to. His first 911 call at 9:59 p.m. reported the location of a mutilated body. The police officers dispatched to Snipes\u2019s address entered Snipes\u2019s apartment building and checked around, but left after finding nothing unusual. Meanwhile, defendant viewed the police unit\u2019s arrival and departure while hiding behind a tree across the street. Defendant then made another 911 call telling the police to return to the apartment building and provided further instructions on the body\u2019s location.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">Akron police officers responding to this call entered Snipes\u2019s unlocked apartment and found her naked, mutilated body lying on the bedroom floor. Snipes\u2019s leg was draped across the bed, a pair of pantyhose tied her ankle to the bed leg, and a white plastic chair was on top of her body. Snipes\u2019s hands were cut off and have never been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">Around 10:45 p.m., defendant was at the Inn Between with Morris, while police units were across the street investigating Snipes\u2019s murder. Morris, having learned that Snipes had been murdered, suggested to defendant that he should talk to the police, since Morris had observed defendant at Snipes\u2019s apartment the previous evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">Shortly before midnight, defendant approached Detective Gregory Harrison while he was at a mobile crime lab parked outside Snipes\u2019s apartment. Defendant walked up to Harrison and said, \u201cI hear it\u2019s pretty bad in there,\u201d and asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>if Harrison had \u201cever seen anything so gruesome.\u201d Later that evening, defendant approached Harrison a second time and spontaneously mentioned that Snipes was a whore, \u201cthat she slept around a lot,\u201d and that \u201che had slept with her * * * and he had even slept with her the night before at 3:00.\u201d In their final contact at around 3:00 a.m., defendant was \u201ckind of mumbling to himself\u2019 and Harrison heard defendant say that \u201cshe was a whore, she was a big whore, she got what she deserved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Between 11:30 p.m. and 12:15 a.m., defendant also approached Akron Police Lt. John A. Lawson near the murder scene and, \u201crather abruptly said, You\u2019re going to find my semen in her and my prints over there.\u2019 \u201d When Lawson asked why, defendant said he \u201chad been with her earlier that morning, the morning of the 9th,\u201d and that he had had sex with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">At 12:15 a.m. on September 10, defendant spoke to Detective Joseph Urbank in front of the apartment building. Defendant began their conversation by announcing that \u201che had sex with the victim the night before.\u201d Moreover, defendant said he did not know her name but \u201conly knew her as psycho bitch and that everybody knew that if you got drunk and were homy you went to go see her, you went to go see psycho bitch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Defendant also told Urbank that he went to Snipes\u2019s apartment at 2:30 a.m. on September 9, and \u201cshe started dancing a little bit.\u201d He \u201clifted her onto the bed, undressed her,\u201d and \u201cthey started having vaginal intercourse.\u201d Defendant said that he was disappointed because Snipes refused to have anal intercourse, and he left her apartment around 3:30 a.m. However, defendant claimed that he did not know anything about the murder until the bartender at the Inn Between told him about it on the evening of September 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Around 6:00 a.m. on September 10, police took defendant to the Akron police station, where he was interviewed by Lawson and Urbank. During his interview, defendant denied making the 911 calls, and denied hiding behind a tree across from Snipes\u2019s apartment. Then, defendant changed a part of his story and admitted hiding behind a tree near the murder scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Following the September 10 police interview, the police searched defendant\u2019s apartment with his consent. The police seized defendant\u2019s bloody tee-shirt from underneath the headboard of his bed, a pair of his jeans, and his boots. Police found a knife on his dresser and Snipes\u2019s wristwatch on defendant\u2019s bed stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Police took defendant to the police station after the search of his apartment. While awaiting transfer to the Summit County Jail, defendant approached Detective John R. Gilbride and blurted out, \u201cI was the one that called the police\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m the one that found the body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Defendant told Gilbride he had been sexually involved with Snipes since February 1997, and had sexual intercourse with Snipes during the early morning hours of September 9. Defendant stated that \u201cafter having sex the psycho bitch threw him out of the apartment stating that her boyfriend was coming over.\u201d He left around 3:30 a.m. and returned to his own apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">According to Gilbride, defendant said that he slept until 6:00 p.m. on September 9, and then took the bus to the Inn Between bar around 7:30 p.m. Gilbride testified that while going into the Inn Between bar, defendant noticed a light on in Snipes\u2019s apartment and decided to visit her. According to Gilbride, defendant gained entry to the apartment through an unlocked door and claimed that he found her dead body in her bedroom. Defendant said that he unsuccessfully tried to pick her body off the floor, noticed that her hands had been cut off, and \u201cfreaked out.\u201d Thinking \u201cI\u2019m going to get busted for this,\u201d defendant washed her blood off his hands and clothes, tried wiping down everything he touched, removed evidence linking him to her apartment, and went home.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Snipes was stabbed one hundred thirty-eight times. Bruising on her ankles indicated that she was alive when she was tied to the bed. Additionally, sperm was found in her vagina and anus. The medical examiner concluded that Snipes had died from strangulation and a slit throat either in the late afternoon or early evening of September 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Police found defendant\u2019s bloody fingerprint on the leg of the white chair draped over Snipes\u2019s body, and police found another of defendant\u2019s fingerprints on Snipes\u2019s bedspread. An expert witness testified that the long linear blood patterns found on defendant\u2019s tee-shirt and Snipes\u2019s bedspread were applied by a long-bladed knife. Further, the blood patterns found on defendant\u2019s tee-shirt were applied while the tee-shirt was lying flat, and not while defendant was wearing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">At trial, the prosecution introduced a set of defendant\u2019s knives, including a meat cleaver, a knife, and a knife sharpener that defendant kept at the Quaker Square Hilton, where he worked as a chef.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Christopher Hoffman, a Hilton co-worker, testified that he talked to defendant in August 1997 about the O.J. Simpson trial. According to Hoffman, defendant said that Simpson could have disposed of evidence against him by cutting off the victim\u2019s hands and eliminating \u201cfibers and hair and skin that might be found on the fingernails.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">Bryan Tyson, a fellow inmate at the Summit County Jail, testified that during a jailhouse conversation, defendant admitted that he had killed Snipes. According to Tyson, defendant said that \u201che pushed himself on her, something in his mind snapped, she was hitting him, he lost his temper, did things he regretted, killed her.\u201d Then, defendant said that he had \u201ctried to make it look like a burglary,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>admitted cutting off Snipes\u2019s hands, and mentioned a hacksaw, and jokingly said \u201c \u2018Don\u2019t leave home without it,\u2019 like the credit card commercial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\n<em>Defense case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Jessica O\u2019Neill, an acquaintance of defendant, talked on the phone with defendant on September 9. Phone records showed that O\u2019Neill called defendant\u2019s apartment and spoke with him at 3:12 p.m. and 4:50 p.m. She also claimed that she talked with defendant on the phone around 6:30 or 7:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The defense also introduced evidence suggesting an alternative suspect, Jeff Nichols. Nichols lived across the hallway from Snipes\u2019s apartment until he moved out of his apartment around September 1, 1997. Nichols worked as a handyman for the apartment building and had access to the landlord\u2019s keys to other apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">In January 1997, Jeffrey Barnes, a friend of Snipes, was visiting Snipes\u2019s apartment when Nichols came to her door. According to Barnes, Nichols \u201cgot up right to her door and then he said, \u2018Slit the bitch\u2019s throat, cut her up,\u2019 and called her a slut and all other kind of vulgar names.\u201d Barnes reported this incident to the police upon hearing about Snipes\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">On an evening prior to September 1, 1997, Linda Zarski, a neighbor in Snipes\u2019s apartment building, heard Snipes pounding on Nichols\u2019s door and screaming that she wanted her shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">On another occasion prior to the murder, Linda Kinebrew, a neighbor living at the apartment, \u201cheard [Nichols] arguing, telling [Snipes] to let him in and she wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">Carol Parcell, defendant\u2019s mother, provided an alibi. Defendant lived at his mother\u2019s apartment, and Parcell claimed that when she came home on September 9 at 6:15 p.m., her son was sleeping in his bedroom. According to Parcell, defendant woke up at 7:00 p.m., got ready, left the apartment at 7:30 p.m., and returned to the apartment around 8:15 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">Defendant testified on his own behalf. He admitted having sex with Snipes several times over the past year and during the early morning hours of September 9 when he was at Snipes\u2019s apartment. After having sex, defendant returned to his apartment at about 3:30 a.m., slept until 6:15 p.m., left his apartment at 7:35 p.m., and returned to the Inn Between bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">Before reaching the Inn Between, defendant noticed that Snipes\u2019s bathroom light was on at her apartment, and he decided to visit her to see if he could \u201cget laid.\u201d Defendant entered Snipes\u2019s apartment through an unlocked door and found her mutilated body in the bedroom. Defendant tried to \u201cget her up and put her on the bed * * * to see if there was anything else I could help with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Defendant \u201cfreaked out\u201d after noticing Snipes had no hands and realized he \u201ccould get in a lot of trouble\u201d if he was placed at the scene. Thus, he washed her blood off his hands, wiped down the cupboards, chair handles, and anything else he might have touched, gathered whatever items he could find that belonged to him, and left Snipes\u2019s apartment. Defendant \u201cran home\u201d and threw the items taken from Snipes\u2019s apartment into a nearby dumpster. Upon arriving home, defendant changed his shoes and hid the bloody tee-shirt so that his mother would not find it.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Thereafter, defendant hurried back to the Inn Between bar and started drinking. When he was \u201csemi-intoxicated,\u201d defendant made the anonymous 911 calls reporting the location of Snipes\u2019s body, admitted standing behind a tree watching the police arrive at Snipes\u2019s apartment, and later approached the police to report that he had been at the apartment the previous evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Defendant introduced photographs taken of his naked body following his arrest to show the absence of bruises and injuries. Defendant explained that a cut on his elbow had occurred at work while he was moving crates.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Defendant acknowledged talking with Chris Hoffman about the O.J. Simpson case but did not recall discussing anything about cutting off a victim\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Defendant knew Tyson as a fellow inmate but denied making any jailhouse admissions that he murdered Snipes.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">\n<em>Trial result</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">The grand jury indicted defendant on two counts of aggravated murder, including one count of murder with prior calculation and design and one count of felony murder. A capital specification relating to murder during a kidnapping was included in the felony murder count. He was also charged with kidnapping and tampering with evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">The jury found defendant guilty of all offenses and recommended death for Snipes\u2019s murder. The trial court sentenced defendant to ten years for kidnapping, five years for tampering with evidence, and death for the aggravated murder of Snipes.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">Defendant now directly appeals to this court as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">In proposition of law I, defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for the aggravated felony murder, the capital specification, and the separately charged kidnapping offense, all on the basis that the state had failed to prove kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>In reviewing a record for sufficiency, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, following <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560. \u201c[T]he weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of the facts.\u201d <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The capital specification that defendant was convicted of was kidnapping: \u201ccommitting, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit kidnapping.\u201d R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). Defendant was also convicted of the separate offense of kidnapping Snipes. R.C. 2905.01, as charged in this case, prohibits using force, threat, or deception to remove a person from the place where she is found or restrain her liberty for purpose of facilitating the commission of a felony or flight thereafter, to terrorize or inflict serious physical harm, or to engage in sexual activity against her will. R.C. 2905.01(A)(2), (3) and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Defendant argues that in view of <em>State v. Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345, the state failed to present sufficient evidence of either the elements of kidnapping or an animus separate from the aggravated murder to sustain his convictions on these charges.</p>\n<p id=\"ACyK\">In <em>Logan, </em>we held that where murder is the underlying crime, \u201ca kidnapping in facilitation thereof would generally constitute a separately cognizable offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135, 14 O.O.3d at 379, 397 N.E.2d at 1352. However, the test to determine whether the kidnapping was committed with a separate animus so as to support a separate conviction is whether \u201cthe restraint or movement of the victim is merely incidental to a separate underlying crime\u201d or, instead, whether it has a \u201csignificance independent of the other offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus; see, also, <em>State v. Simko </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 483, 488, 644 N.E.2d 345, 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">In <em>State v. Seiber </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 4, 564 N.E.2d 408, we found kidnapping where the defendant and his accomplice entered a bar with guns drawn, blocked the exit, and repeatedly ordered bar patrons to lie on the floor. The defendant then spent several minutes roaming the bar, threatening to kill several people. When one of the patrons refused to comply with the demands, the defendant shot and killed him. Under these facts, we held in <em>Seiber </em>that a jury could reasonably conclude that the defendant had restrained the murder victim of his liberty and that this evidence was sufficient to support the kidnapping charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Here, the facts present more compelling evidence of kidnapping than in <em>Seiber. </em>Defendant tied Snipes to the bed, gagged her, stabbed her one hundred thirty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>eight times, slit her throat, and strangled her to death. Moreover, bruising on Snipes\u2019s anides established that she was alive when she was tied to the bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The evidence therefore shows that Snipes\u2019s kidnapping, <em>i.e., </em>the restraint, was completed prior to her murder and that the restraint was not merely incidental to her murder. Therefore, the prosecution presented sufficient evidence to prove not only kidnapping, but also an animus for kidnapping separate from Snipes\u2019s aggravated murder. Accordingly, we reject proposition I.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\n<em>Trial issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\"><em>Other acts evidence. </em>In proposition of law III, defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting \u201cother acts\u201d evidence in three instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">First, defendant claims that the trial court erred by permitting testimony about knives and the introduction of knives that were never connected to the murder. However, defendant\u2019s failure to object to this evidence at trial waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Childs </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 56, 62, 43 O.O.2d 119, 123, 236 N.E.2d 545, 549. See, also, <em>State v. Greer </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 236, 244, 530 N.E.2d 382, 394, applying the waiver rule to capital cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">The admission of defendant\u2019s knives rested upon a question of relevancy. Evid.R. 401 provides: \u201c \u2018Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d The admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. See <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">The police went to the Quaker Square Hilton where defendant worked as a chef and seized a set of knives belonging to him. At trial, the prosecutor introduced into evidence defendant\u2019s cutlery set consisting of a knife sharpener, a high carbon knife, and a meat cleaver.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">The admission of defendant\u2019s knives showed defendant\u2019s easy access to a possible murder weapon and his familiarity with using knives. Such evidence was particularly relevant, since Snipes was stabbed one hundred thirty-eight times, her throat was slit, and her hands were cut off.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">Moreover, the medical examiner\u2019s testimony suggested that the assailant probably knew what he was doing when he cut off the victim\u2019s hands. He pointed out that this \u201cdisarticulation is such that there is a cut right at the end of the bone, radius bone, * * * and the cut is such that bone itself was not sawed or cut. There are ligaments in this area so that one can cut across the ligaments and the hand can be removed with just [a] few incisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Thus, defendant\u2019s ownership of a set of knives and his familiarity and use of knives at work were relevant considering the surgical precision of the removal of Snipes\u2019s hands. Therefore, we reject any claim that this evidence constituted plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Defendant next claims that the trial court erred by allowing testimony about his prior DUI convictions. Detective John Gilbride was present when defendant was being held at the police station on September 10 awaiting transport to the county jail. Defendant and Gilbride began to talk. The prosecutor asked Gilbride the following question on direct examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u201cQ. Okay. So, then, what did he tell you about the morning of September 8th?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">\u201cA. He stated on the morning of September 8th he left his home to go to work at the Quaker Square Hilton. He states that he\u2019s a cook at that establishment and on this day he was working from nine to five.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\u201cHe states he rides the bus to and from work due to a previous DUI.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">However, the defense counsel failed to object to this evidence at trial, and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Childs, </em>14 Ohio St.2d at 62, 43 O.O.2d at 123, 236 N.E.2d at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Moreover, we find that this evidence supported the defense theory of the case and that any error was harmless. In his testimony, defendant emphasized that he was a heavy drinker and consumed large amounts of alcohol on September 8 and 9. Further, defendant testified that he had <em>several </em>DUIs and had actually lost his driver\u2019s license as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">Defendant testified that his intoxication explains his behavior. For example, his intoxication explained why he approached police at the murder scene. According to defendant, \u201cI started thinking that I was drunk when I was there [in Snipes\u2019s apartment] and I was drunk that morning before, there\u2019s places that I touched all over the place that I don\u2019t remember; so I figured eventually they would find my fingerprints there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">Here, defendant\u2019s admitted history of alcohol abuse, including his admission of having previous DUIs, was presented as an important part of his defense. Thus, Gilbride\u2019s testimony about defendant\u2019s DUI was not plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">Finally, defendant claims that the trial court erred by allowing testimony that he had blood on his boots because he \u201cface stomped\u201d a black man six months before.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">The police found boot marks in Snipes\u2019s kitchen and bathroom and seized defendant\u2019s boots at the police station. When they took his boots, defendant asked, \u201cWhat are they looking for, DNA?\u201d Urbank said yes, and asked, \u201cWould there be any reason that there would be any blood or hair on your boots?\u201d Defendant said no, \u201cexcept that he faced stomped a black guy six months ago.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Since defendant did not object to this testimony, the defense waived all but plain error. <em>Id. </em>We find no plain error because of the compelling evidence of guilt. Moreover, this evidence was properly admitted because it demonstrated that defendant was concerned that the police would find blood on his shoes and he was trying to provide an alternate explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Under Evid.R. 404(B), \u201c[ejvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove\u201d a defendant\u2019s character as to criminal propensity. \u201cIt may, however, be admissible [to show] motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Defendant changed his stories to police concerning his whereabouts and activities as the evidence mounted pointing to him as the murderer. For example, defendant initially denied hiding behind the tree across from Snipes\u2019s apartment and denied making the 911 calls to the police. But as evidence of his guilt mounted, he admitted doing both. In a similar vein, defendant\u2019s claim that he \u201cface stomped\u201d a black man appears as a farfetched explanation to further deflect police suspicion that he killed Snipes. Such evidence helped to establish defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt and was properly admitted. See <em>State v. Richey </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 353, 357, 595 N.E.2d 915, 921; <em>State v. Tibbetts </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 161, 749 N.E.2d 226, 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">In conclusion, we find that the trial court did not commit plain error, and reject this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\"><em>Fingerprint evidence. </em>In proposition of law IV, defendant challenges the admission of digitally enhanced fingerprint evidence. First, defendant claims that Patrick Warrick, the state\u2019s fingerprint expert, lacked the necessary expert qualifications to testify regarding such evidence. Second, defendant attacks the reliability of digitally enhanced fingerprint evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Patrick Warrick, a fingerprint examiner from the King County Sheriffs Office in Seattle, Washington, testified that by using digitally enhanced imaging, he concluded that a fingerprint found on Snipes\u2019s bedspread was defendant\u2019s fingerprint. However, Warrick also compared the fingerprints without using digitally enhanced imaging and reached the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">Defendant does not challenge Warrick\u2019s expert credentials as a general latent fingerprint examiner or Warrick\u2019s identification of defendant\u2019s print on the bedspread by traditional comparison of the prints. Moreover, the trial court properly admitted Warrick\u2019s expert opinion on digitally enhanced fingerprint evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">In addition to the requirement of relevancy, expert testimony must meet the criteria of Evid.R. 702, which provides that a witness may testify as an expert if:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u201c(A) The witness\u2019 testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons * * *;</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u201c(B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony;</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u201c(C) The witness\u2019 testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">We find that the first prong of the rule was satisfied, since expert testimony was necessary to make fingerprint comparisons. We find that the second prong of the test also satisfied, since defendant never challenged or objected to Warrick\u2019s expert qualifications at trial. However, defense counsel did point out to the judge that Warrick\u2019s testimony was \u201cblazing new ground\u201d and that the scientific reliability of the digital enhancement method had not been established. The trial court accepted the reliability of digitally enhanced fingerprint evidence, finding that \u201cthe use of the computer in this instance is no different than * * * would be the use of an overhead projector, microscope, a magnifying glass or anything else like that that would enhance an expert\u2019s ability to make his determination and therefore I find that there\u2019s nothing \u2014 no new trails being blazed here and I\u2019m overruling the objection for that reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">We have designated four factors to be considered in evaluating reliability of scientific evidence: \u201c(1) whether the theory or technique has been tested, (2) whether it has been subjected to peer review, (3) whether there is a known or potential rate of error, and (4) whether the methodology has gained general acceptance.\u201d <em>State v. Nemeth </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 202, 211, 694 N.E.2d 1332, 1338-1339, citing <em>Miller v. Bike Athletic Co. </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 607, 611, 687 N.E.2d 735, 740. However, it is important \u201cto emphasize that none of these factors is a determinative prerequisite to admissibility.\u201d <em>Nemeth </em>at 211, 694 N.E.2d at 1339, citing <em>Miller </em>at 612-613, 687 N.E.2d at 741. See, also, <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">In this case, the third prong of the rule was satisfied, since digitally enhanced imaging meets Evid.R. 702(C)\u2019s reliability standard. Warrick testified that the King County Sheriffs Office has used digitally enhanced fingerprint analysis for \u201capproximately a year and a half.\u201d Other potential testimony establishing the reliability of digitally enhanced fingerprint evidence was not introduced because of the trial court\u2019s ruling that the method was in fact reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Moreover, in <em>State v. Hayden </em>(1998), 90 Wash.App. 100, 950 P.2d 1024, the court approved the admissibility of digitally enhanced fingerprint evidence utiliz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>ing the <em>Frye </em>standard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Frye v. United States </em>(C.A.D.C.1923), 293 F. 1013. The <em>Hayden </em>court considered expert testimony, articles from forensic journals, and other matter in concluding that evidence obtained through digital imaging enhancement of latent fingerprints is \u201cgenerally accepted in the relevant scientific community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109, 950 P.2d at 1028. <em>Hayden's </em>conclusion that digitally enhanced fingerprint evidence was admissible under the more stringent <em>Frye </em>standard supports our conclusion that digitally enhanced fingerprint evidence meets Evid.R. 702(C)\u2019s reliability standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">We find,that Warrick\u2019s testimony that defendant\u2019s fingerprint was found on Snipes\u2019s bedspread was properly admitted. Once properly before the court, the expert\u2019s conclusions became a matter for the trier of fact. <em>State v. Nemeth, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 211, 694 N.E.2d at 1339. Thus, we reject proposition IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\"><em>Expert qualifications. </em>In proposition of law V, defendant claims that the trial court should not have allowed four of the state\u2019s expert witnesses to testify because the court failed to make a threshold determination concerning their qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Evid.R. 702(B) provides that a witness may qualify as an expert by reason of his or her specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education. Neither special education nor certification is necessary to confer expert status upon a witness. The individual offered as an expert need not have complete knowledge of the field in question, as long as the knowledge he or she possesses will aid the trier of fact in performing its fact-finding function. <em>State v. Baston </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 418, 423, 709 N.E.2d 128, 133; <em>State v. D\u2019Ambrosio </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 185, 191, 616 N.E.2d 909, 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Pursuant to Evid.R. 104(A), the trial court determines whether an individual qualifies as an expert, and that determination will be overturned only for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 53, 58, 4 OBR 144, 148, 446 N.E.2d 444, 448. The issue arises from the following four expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">James Wurster. Wurster, a forensic scientist, had worked at the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\u201cBCI\u201d) since 1978. Wurster\u2019s educational qualifications included a master of science degree and course work at the Bloodstain Institute, the Serological Research Institute, and various FBI courses. He testified as to the presence of bloodstains on defendant\u2019s boot, his tee-shirt, and a chair leg from Snipes\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>While the state never formally tendered Wurster as an expert, defendant\u2019s counsel never objected or challenged his qualifications to testify. Thus, defendant waived all but plain error.,, Crim.R. 52(B); <em>State v. Baston, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 423, 709 N.E.2d at 133. We find no plain error and find that Wurster\u2019s experience as a forensic scientist qualified him to testify at trial about the presence of blood on various items.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Cynthia Mayle. Mayle, a fingerprint examiner, worked for BCI since 1995. Her prior experience included work as a fingerprint examiner for the Cleveland and Philadelphia police departments. Mayle\u2019s educational background included a bachelor\u2019s degree from Cleveland State University and attendance at the advanced latent fingerprint course at the FBI Academy in Quantico. Mayle had also lectured on fingerprint techniques at the FBI Academy. Mayle identified defendant\u2019s bloody palm print on a chair leg from Snipes\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Although Mayle was not formally tendered as an expert, defendant did not object to her qualifications, and waived all but plain error. <em>Id. </em>We find no plain error and find that Mayle was fully qualified to expertly testify that defendant\u2019s palm print was found on Snipes\u2019s chair leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Patrick Warrick. As discussed earlier, Warrick, a latent fingerprint examiner, identified defendant\u2019s fingerprint on Snipes\u2019s bedspread. Warrick has a bachelor\u2019s degree in criminology along with \u201cnumerous courses in crime scene investigation, latent print development, latent print processing, latent print comparisons, crime scene photography, [and] evidence photography.\u201d Warrick\u2019s experience as a latent fingerprint examiner included employment with the Long Beach and Santa Monica, California police departments (over eight years\u2019 total), and his current employment with the King County, Washington Sheriffs Department (five and a half years).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Although Warrick was not formally tendered as an expert witness, defendant\u2019s objections to Warrick\u2019s expert testimony did not challenge Warrick\u2019s qualifications. On that point, he waived all but plain error. <em>Id. </em>We find no plain error and also find that Warrick was qualified to identify defendant\u2019s fingerprint on Snipes\u2019s bedspread.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Rod Englert. Englert, a forensic consultant, testified that long linear blood patterns found on defendant\u2019s tee-shirt and Snipes\u2019s bedspread were applied by a long-bladed knife. Moreover, the blood transfers were applied while the tee-shirt was lying flat, and not while defendant was wearing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">Englert\u2019s educational qualifications included a bachelor of science degree, graduation from the FBI Academy, and completion of postgraduate work at two universities. Englert\u2019s experience included more than twenty-five years as a police homicide investigator. Following his retirement from law enforcement, Englert became a consultant in crime scene reconstruction and blood pattern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>evidence. Englert has lectured on these topics \u201caround the world over 530 times for the last 25 years in this subject,\u201d he has published articles on crime scene reconstruction, and he has \u201ctestified in the United States about 230 times as an expert.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">As with other experts in this case, the state did not formally tender Englert as an expert. However, the trial judge found that Englert was \u201ccertainly qualified as an expert\u201d when he overruled a defense objection to a blood spatter demonstration in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Defendant\u2019s counsel entered <em>general </em>objections to Englert\u2019s opinion that a long-bladed knife likely caused the blood transfer stains found on defendant\u2019s tee-shirt and Snipes\u2019s bedspread and Englert\u2019s opinion that the tee-shirt was not being worn when the blood transfer stains were applied. The court overruled the first two objections and sustained the third. The prosecutor rephrased the question, and the testimony proceeded without question.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Defendant\u2019s counsel also objected to Englert\u2019s opinion \u201cregarding the freshness of blood,\u201d since \u201c[h]e hasn\u2019t acquired a pathology or doctor\u2019s degree\u201d and such testimony is not \u201cwithin his expertise.\u201d The trial court overruled this objection \u201cbecause it\u2019s not for the purpose of medical diagnosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Under Evid.R. 702(B), an expert may be qualified by <em>specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education </em>to give an opinion that will assist the jury to understand the evidence and determine a fact at issue. See <em>State v. Biros </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 426, 452, 678 N.E.2d 891, 912-913 (eleven years\u2019 experience as a forensic scientist in bloodstain analysis was sufficient qualifications for blood spatter testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">Although Englert was not a medical doctor, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing him to testify as an expert because of his extensive background and experience in bloodstain analysis. See <em>State v. Wogenstahl </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 362, 662 N.E.2d 311, 326 (forensic serologist\u2019s testimony on blood stain analysis permitted although witness was neither a college graduate nor a medical doctor). Cf. <em>Scott v. Yates </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 219, 221, 643 N.E.2d 105, 107 (error to allow expert opinion where witness \u201cfrankly admitted that he was not an accident reconstructionist; that he never had the opportunity to work with an accident reconstructionist; and further, that he had never conducted an accident reconstruction\u201d). Moreover, \u201c \u2018[i]t is a general rule that the expert witness is not required to be the best witness on the subject. * * * The test is whether a particular witness offered as an expert will aid the trier of fact in the search for the truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Tomlin </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 724, 728, 590 N.E.2d 1253, 1257, quoting <em>Alexander v. Mt. Carmel Med. Ctr. </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 155. 159, 10 O.O.3d 332, 334, 383 N.E.2d 564, 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>We find that although Englert was not formally tendered as an expert in crime scene reconstruction and bloodstain and blood spatter analysis, Englert\u2019s education and experience qualified him to provide expert testimony on blood transfers and the freshness of blood. Even though Englert was not a medical doctor, the trial court did not err in permitting Englert\u2019s expert testimony. Thus, we reject proposition V.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><em>Gruesome photographs. </em>In proposition of law VIII, defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting gruesome photographs of the victim, since the prejudicial effect outweighed their probative value. However, defendant fails to specify which photographs were objectionable or exactly why they were inadmissible. The record shows that the trial court admitted several graphic crime scene photos of Snipes\u2019s body and various autopsy photos.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The defense counsel objected to the gruesome photographs in a motion before trial and renewed the objections at trial. The trial court overruled these objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In capital cases, nonrepetitive photographs, even if gruesome, are admissible if relevant and of probative value as long as the probative value of each photograph outweighs the danger of material prejudice to the accused. <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768, paragraph seven of the syllabus; <em>State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 257-258, 513 N.E.2d 267, 273-274. Decisions on the admissibility of photographs are \u201cleft to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 601, 605 N.E.2d 916, 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Crime scene photographs. State\u2019s exhibits 28, 29, 30, and 35 were photographs taken at different angles showing the chair draped over Snipes\u2019s body. State\u2019s exhibit 34 was a distance shot taken across Snipes\u2019s bed showing her body on the opposite floor. State\u2019s exhibit 33 shows Snipes\u2019s body with her left hand cut off. State\u2019s exhibits 32 and 37, which were decidedly gruesome, show Snipes\u2019s body with a gag in her mouth and both hands cut off.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">These photos illustrated the testimony of the detective at the scene, portrayed Snipes\u2019s body in relation to her surroundings, and helped to prove the killer\u2019s intent and lack of accident or mistake. See <em>State v. Goodwin </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 331, 342, 703 N.E.2d 1251, 1262; <em>State v. Mason </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 158, 694 N.E.2d 932, 949. Moreover, the photos at the crime scene supported the prosecution theory that Hartman brutally murdered Snipes in a fit of rage. The photos also corroborated Hoffman\u2019s testimony that defendant discussed cutting off a victim\u2019s hands to eliminate evidence that might be found under the victim\u2019s fingernails.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">We find that no error was committed in admitting these photos, since the probative value of each photograph outweighed any prejudice to the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Medical examiner\u2019s photographs. State\u2019s exhibits 82-84 and 96 present closeups and different angles of Snipes\u2019s head, throat, and chest showing her slit throat, stab wounds, and other injuries. They supported the medical examiner\u2019s testimony as to cause of death. State\u2019s exhibit 85 shows the numerous stab wounds on Snipes\u2019s torso, State\u2019s exhibit 87 portrays bruising and wounds on her lower extremities, and State\u2019s exhibit 88 presents an \u201cX\u201d mark carved into Snipes\u2019s back, which the prosecution suggested represented defendant\u2019s middle initial. State\u2019s exhibit 89 presents a full-body view of wounds on Snipes\u2019s back and lower extremities and State\u2019s exhibit 90 shows stab wounds on the side of her back. State\u2019s exhibits 91-93 show cuts on Snipes\u2019s legs and bruising on her ankle indicating that she was alive when defendant tied her to the bed. Finally, State\u2019s exhibits 94 and 95 portray the stumps of her wrists and show how her hands were cleanly cut off. Photos of Snipes\u2019s wrist stumps supported testimony showing that defendant was familiar with using knives as a chef and accounted for his near-surgical removal of Snipes\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The trial court did not err in admitting these photos. The fourteen autopsy photos illustrated the medical examiner\u2019s testimony and demonstrated defendant\u2019s specific intent to kill. <em>State v. Goodwin, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 342, 703 N.E.2d at 1262; <em>State v. Mason, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 159, 694 N.E.2d at 949. Snipes was stabbed one hundred thirty-eight times all over her body, her throat was slit, her hands were cut off, and her ankles and other areas of her body were bruised. In this case, multiple injuries required multiple photographs. Thus, we find that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting these photographs. See, <em>e.g., State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 108-109, 684 N.E.2d 668, 687-688; <em>State v. Biros, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 443, 678 N.E.2d at 907; <em>State v. Joseph </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 450, 460, 653 N.E.2d 285, 294. Thus, we reject proposition VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\"><em>Guilt phase instructions. </em>In proposition of law XII, defendant challenges the trial phase instructions on the kidnapping specification. Defendant argues that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that they must find that he purposely removed or restrained Snipes.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Defendant, however, failed to object at trial or request specific instructions and thus waived all but plain error. Crim.R. 30(A); <em>State v. Underwood </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus; <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364. The alleged deficiency did not cause a different trial result or create a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804. We find no plain error. Additionally, we find that defendant suffered no prejudice from the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">R.C. 2905.01(A) requires the state to show that the kidnapping involved a purposeful removal or restraint. <em>State v. Avery </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 36, 48, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>709 N.E.2d 875, 883; see, also, <em>State v. Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 270, 15 OBR at 406, 473 N.E.2d 768 at 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">R.C. 2905.01 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u201c(A) No person, by force, threat, or deception, * * * shall remove another from the place where the other person is found or restrain the liberty of the other person, for any of the following <em>purposes:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">* *</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u201c(2) To facilitate the commission of any felony or flight thereafter;</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">\u201c(3) To terrorize, or to inflict serious physical harm on the victim or another;</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">\u201c(4) To engage in sexual activity * * * with the victim against the victim\u2019s will.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court\u2019s kidnapping instructions omitted any explicit reference to \u201cpurpose.\u201d But the trial court\u2019s instructions on kidnapping in the capital specification used the words \u201cto facilitate\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">\u201cKidnapping is the use of force, threat, or deception to remove a victim from the place where he or she is found and/or restraining the liberty of such person <em>to facilitate </em>the commission of any felony or flight thereafter, and/or to terrorize or inflict the commission of any felony or to inflict serious physical harm on the victim and/or to engage in sexual activity with the victim against her will.\u201d The trial court\u2019s instructions on the separately charged offense of kidnapping included the same type of wording.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">While the trial court\u2019s instruction deviated from the purposeful language in the kidnapping statute, the instruction was not misleading and defendant was not prejudiced. \u201cFacilitate\u201d is defined as \u201cto make easier or less difficult: free from difficulty or impediment [as in] to facilitate the execution of a task[;] * * * to lessen the labor of (as a person): assist, aid.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986), at 812. A commonsense understanding tells us that the terms \u201cfor any of the following purposes\u201d and \u201cto facilitate\u201d essentially have the same meaning. Further, there was compelling evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt in the kidnapping <em>(ie., </em>that defendant forcefully tied Snipes to her bed to facilitate, or for the purpose of, brutally terrorizing and murdering her). Moreover, the defense did not object to these instructions, and any deficiency did not amount to outcome-determinative plain error. Thus, we reject proposition XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">\n<em>Penalty phase issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\">Penalty phase instructions. In proposition of law II, defendant objects to three of the trial court\u2019s penalty phase instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-16\">First, defendant argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury to \u201cweigh against the aggravating circumstances the nature and circumstances of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>the offense * * Indeed, defendant submitted a pretrial motion requesting the trial court not to give this instruction, since there was nothing mitigating about the nature and circumstances of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">R.C. 2929.04(B) states that the jury \u201cshall consider, and weigh against the aggravating circumstances proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the nature and circumstances of the offense * * We find that the trial court\u2019s instruction was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Second, defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s instructions did not comport with this court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Brooks </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 148, 661 N.E.2d 1030, in two ways. First, he objects to the following instruction:</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">' \u201cShould the jury\u2019s recommendation be that the death sentence be imposed, the Court must review and evaluate such recommendation and if the Court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors, the Court shall then impose the sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">\u201cOn the other hand, if after considering all of the evidence raised at trial which is relevant to the issues before you, * * * you cannot unanimously agree that the State of Ohio proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances, as I have defined them, outweigh the mitigating factors, then you\u2019ll return your recommendation reflecting that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">\u201cIn this event, you will then proceed to determine which of the three possible life imprisonment sentences to impose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">Defendant asserts that the instruction given by the trial court required the jury to unanimously rule out the death penalty before considering a life sentence in violation of <em>State v. Brooks, supra. </em>In <em>Brooks, </em>the trial court charged the jury that \u201c \u2018[y]ou are now required to determine unanimously that the death penalty is <em>inappropriate before </em>you can consider a life sentence.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 159, 661 N.E.2d at 1040. <em>Brooks </em>found error because the trial court\u2019s instructions conflicted with R.C. 2929.03(D)(2). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">In a pretrial motion, defendant objected to any \u201cacquittal first\u201d type of penalty phase instructions and requested a clarifying instruction stating that \u201c[y]ou are not required to determine unanimously that the death sentence is inappropriate before [you] consider the life sentences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, the trial court never instructed the jury that it had to unanimously reject the death penalty before it could consider a life sentence. The instructions explicitly advised the jurors that if they were unable to unanimously agree to recommend death, they shall consider life sentences. The jury was thus implicitly advised that a single juror could prevent the death penalty. See <em>State v. Stallings </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 280, 294, 731 N.E.2d 159, 174-175. We find that this instruction was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Defendant also argues that the trial court erred by failing to give the \u201clone-juror instruction\u201d mandated in the <em>Brooks </em>case. In <em>State v. Brooks, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 162, 661 N.E.2d at 1042, trial courts were told to explicitly instruct juries that a single juror \u201cmay prevent a death penalty recommendation by finding that the aggravating circumstances in the case do not outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d Here, the trial court erred by not explicitly giving the jury this instruction. However, the trial court\u2019s instructions were consistent with R.C. 2929.03(D)(2), and we find no prejudicial error. See <em>State v. Stallings, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 294, 731 N.E.2d at 174-175.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Moreover, defendant failed to object to the lack of a lone-juror instruction at trial and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Underwood, </em>3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus; see, also, <em>State v. Williams, </em>51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph one of the syllabus. We find that no plain error resulted from the trial court\u2019s failure to give this instruction and, thus, reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">As the third instructional error, defendant argues that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury as to the limited purpose of victim-impact testimony. Defendant\u2019s counsel objected very generally to the state\u2019s victim-impact testimony, but he did not request hmiting instructions. Thus, defendant waived all but plain error. See <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 670, 679, 687 N.E.2d 1358, 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Ella Snipes, the victim\u2019s mother, provided victim-impact testimony. Mrs. Snipes briefly discussed the victim\u2019s early life in North Carolina, the victim\u2019s schooling, her close-knit family, and the victim\u2019s contact with family after moving to Akron. Mrs. Snipes summed up the family impact of the victim\u2019s death by saying, \u201c[I]t\u2019s been around nine months now since our daughter Winda was brutally murdered. It has been an extremely bad time for us and will be from now on. She\u2019ll never leave our heart.\u201d Mrs. Snipes expressed no opinion about the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Victim-impact testimony does not violate constitutional guarantees. See, generally, <em>Payne v. Tennessee </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 808, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720. This court has permitted victim-impact testimony in capital cases when the testimony, as it was here, was not overly emotional or directed to the penalty to be imposed. See <em>State v. Reynolds, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 679, 687 N.E.2d at 1369; <em>State v. Fautenberry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 435, 650 N.E.2d 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Here, it cannot be said that the sentence clearly would have been otherwise but for the lack of instructions regarding victim-impact evidence. See <em>State v. Reynolds </em>at 679, 687 N.E.2d at 1369. Thus, we reject proposition II.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>\n<em>Prosecutorial misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">In proposition of law VI, defendant complains about several instances of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">First, defendant argues that prosecutorial misconduct occurred when the state called Kathryn Snipes-Gaskey, the victim\u2019s sister, and she improperly presented victim-impact testimony as the first prosecution witness during the guilt phase. However, the defense counsel did not object to Snipes-Gaskey\u2019s testimony at trial, and thus waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Tibbetts, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 160-161, 749 N.E.2d at 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Snipes-Gaskey identified the victim\u2019s wristwatch seized from defendant\u2019s apartment. As a prehminary matter, Snipes-Gaskey described her close personal relationship with the victim, discussed her familiarity with the victim\u2019s jewelry, and remembered the wristwatch because their mother purchased the watch for the victim \u201caround Christmas of 1995.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Snipes-Gaskey provided additional testimony describing Snipes\u2019s upbringing, schooling, employment history, her move to Akron in May 1996, and her last trip home in July 1997. Snipes-Gaskey also mentioned the victim\u2019s close family ties, discussed their last phone conversation two days before Snipes\u2019s murder, and mentioned that their parents and grandmother received a final letter from the victim in the mail following Snipes\u2019s murder. Snipes-Gaskey also presented a collage showing photographs of the victim and the victim with her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Snipes-Gaskey\u2019s identification of the victim\u2019s wristwatch was crucial in identifying defendant as the murderer, since the wristwatch was likely stolen by the person who cut off Snipes\u2019s hands. Preliminary testimony depicting SnipesGaskey\u2019s relationship with the victim and her familiarity with Snipes\u2019s jewelry laid the foundation for her identification of the victim\u2019s wristwatch, and this testimony was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Snipes-Gaskey\u2019s testimony about the victim\u2019s employment history, their final phone call, the victim\u2019s final letter to her grandmother, and the introduction of the collage was victim-impact evidence of questionable relevance. Cf. <em>State v. Fautenberry, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 440, 650 N.E.2d at 882-883. Given the fact that Snipes-Gaskey\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot overly emotional or directed to the penalty to be imposed, it cannot be said that the sentence would clearly have been otherwise but for the victim-impact evidence.\u201d See <em>State v. Reynolds, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 679, 687 N.E.2d at 1369. Thus, we find that the admission of SnipesGaskey\u2019s testimony was not plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Second, defendant argues that prosecutor\u2019s closing argument during the penalty phase was improper. Defendant\u2019s first example of the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument includes the following: \u201cBecause certainly Winda Snipes is not here to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>talk about, you know, her feelings and what she went through those last minutes of her life. So, the information from her mother is permitted for your consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">However, defendant failed to object to this argument and waived all but plain error. See <em>State v. Wade </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 182, 7 O.O.3d 362, 373 N.E.2d 1244, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The prosecutor erred in inviting the jury to concentrate on what the victim experienced and was feeling in her last moments of life. As recognized in <em>State v. Wogenstahl, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 357, 662 N.E.2d at 322-323, citing <em>State v. Combs </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 278, 283, 581 N.E.2d 1071, 1077, such argument improperly \u201cinvites the jury to speculate on facts not in evidence.\u201d Although error, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s brief remarks do not rise to the level of outcome-determinative plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Defendant also claims that the prosecutor committed misconduct during the following segment of his penalty phase argument: \u201c[T]he Judge is going to tell you [what] the law is, but I anticipate that, against those aggravating circumstances you weigh the nature and circumstances of this offense.\u201d Again, defendant failed to object to this segment of the argument, and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Wade, </em>53 Ohio St.2d 182, 7 O.O.3d 362, 373 N.E.2d 1244, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Under R.C. 2929.04(B), the jury must weigh proven aggravating circumstances against the nature and circumstances of the offense as a potential mitigating factor. See <em>State v. Wogenstahl, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 361, 662 N.E.2d at 325; <em>State v. Lindsey </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 479, 486, 721 N.E.2d 995, 1004. Accordingly, we find that this segment of the prosecutor\u2019s argument did not involve misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Defendant also argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct during this portion of his penalty phase closing argument: \u201cI think you certainly can consider as a part of the aggravating circumstance this Defendant\u2019s actions after the murder, removing of evidence, trying to wipe down the scene, letting the mutilated body of Winda Snipes lay for several hours before * * * the police are called, fleeing after the commission of a crime. Those kinds of actions can also by considered by you.\u201d The trial court overruled the defense counsel\u2019s objection to these comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">Here, the kidnapping specification was the only aggravating circumstance that the jury could consider during the penalty phase. Thus, it was wholly improper for the state to argue or suggest that the jury may consider the nature and circumstances of the offense as \u201cpart of the aggravating circumstance.\u201d See <em>State v. Wogenstahl, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 344, 662 N.E.2d 311, 321, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>The test for prejudice regarding prosecutorial misconduct in closing arguments is \u2018\u201cwhether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Hessler </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 108, 125, 734 N.E.2d 1237, 1254, quoting <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 318, 470 N.E.2d 883, 885. Here, the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument could not have made any difference in the outcome of the trial, particularly in light of the statutory aggravating circumstance defendant was found guilty of committing and the lack of compelling mitigating evidence. Cf. <em>State v. Wogenstahl, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 360, 662 N.E.2d at 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Moreover, the trial court properly instructed the jury that the only aggravating circumstance in this case was the kidnapping specification. The instruction was very clear in this regard, and we can assume that the jury followed the trial court\u2019s instructions. <em>Id. </em>at 360, 662 N.E.2d at 324-325. Also, our independent reassessment of the sentence can cure this error. <em>State v. Hill </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 210, 661 N.E.2d 1068, 1082. Thus, we reject this complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Finally, defendant argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by improperly introducing victim-impact evidence before the defense opened the door to its admission. However, the state\u2019s introduction of relevant victim-impact testimony is not limited to refuting or rebutting mitigation evidence that the defense has first introduced. See, generally, <em>State v. Fautenberry, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 440, 650 N.E.2d at 883; <em>State v. White </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 433, 446, 709 N.E.2d 140, 154. We find that the testimony was relevant to guilt. Therefore, we reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">In summary, we find no prosecutorial misconduct justifying reversal and we reject proposition VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">\n<em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">In proposition of law VII, defendant raises multiple instances of ineffective assistance of counsel. Reversal of a conviction for ineffective assistance of counsel requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693. Accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">\n<em>1. Concession during final argument in the penalty phase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">Defendant argues his defense counsel was ineffective during final argument in the penalty phase by conceding that \u201c[t]here\u2019s nothing I can do, nothing we can say, no evidence we can put on to reduce the blame that you\u2019ve already ascribed.\u201d Defendant claims that by making this concession about blame, his counsel totally foreclosed any opportunity to avoid the jury\u2019s imposition of the death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>In the instant case, it may appear that defense counsel \u201cconceded blame\u201d during the penalty phase of the trial, but this was after guilt had already been determined. There was, in fact, nothing counsel could do to change the jury\u2019s finding of guilt. A reading of the transcript reveals, moreover, that counsel was merely explaining to the jury that the guilt phase and penalty phases are separate. Counsel merely noted that the jury had already convicted his client and found that he was guilty of the murder and that counsel was now moving beyond that fact to focus the jury\u2019s attention on mitigating factors. Here, his defense counsel forcefully argued throughout his summation that the mitigating factors justified imposition of a life sentence. Counsel\u2019s tactical decision conceding blame maintained the defense\u2019s credibility and allowed counsel to focus the jury\u2019s attention on mitigating factors supporting a life sentence. See <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 40, 553 N.E.2d 576, 595 (counsel not ineffective for conceding guilt in closing argument during the penalty phase). Thus, we find no error in counsel\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\n<em>2. Failure to object to expert testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Defendant argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object to Englert\u2019s opinion on blood-transfer evidence, since Englert did not testify that his opinion was based upon a reasonable degree of scientific certainty. Further, defendant argues that his counsel should have cross-examined Englert on his inadequate expert qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Englert provided his opinion on blood-transfer stains found on defendant\u2019s tee-shirt and Snipes\u2019s stuffed toy rabbit after being asked by the prosecutor if he had formed his opinion to \u201ca reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\u201d During the same series of questions, the prosecutor asked Englert for three more opinions on blood-transfer stains and the freshness of blood without first asking Englert whether his opinion was based on a \u201creasonable degree of scientific certainty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Defense counsel were not ineffective by failing to object to these follow-up questions. After the prosecutor\u2019s first questions, defense counsel could reasonably conclude that Englert would continue to give opinions based on a reasonable degree of scientific certainty. Further objections by defense counsel would only further emphasize the scientific certainty of the witness\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">The failure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffectiveness. \u201cBecause \u2018[objections tend to disrupt the flow of a trial, [and] are considered technical and bothersome by the fact-finder,\u2019 Jacobs, Ohio Evidence (1989), at iii-iv, competent counsel may reasonably hesitate to object in the jury\u2019s presence.\u201d <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 38, 53, 630 N.E.2d 339, 352. Thus, we find that counsel made a legitimate \u201ctactical decision\u201d by not objecting to Englert\u2019s further answers and that this decision was not ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Defendant also argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to cross-examine Englert on his expert qualifications. Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertions, Englert\u2019s qualifications were extremely strong. Englert graduated from the FBI Academy at Quantieo, he had completed postgraduate work at the University of Virginia, and he had twenty-five years of experience as a police homicide investigator, retiring as chief detective. He has lectured all over the world, including at Scotland Yard. He is a published author on crime scene reconstruction and has been teaching for twenty-five years at the Southern Police Institute. He has testified over two hundred times as an expert. By not cross-examining Englert on his background and experience, defense counsel avoided inviting the prosecutor to ask followup questions that might bolster Englert\u2019s qualifications even more in the ey\u00e9s of the jury. Again, we find that counsel made a legitimate tactical decision and were not ineffective. See <em>State v. Jones </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 335, 354, 744 N.E.2d 1163, 1183.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Defendant also claims that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object to Warrick\u2019s expert testimony, since this was the first time that Warrick had ever testified using digitally enhanced fingerprint evidence. Further, defendant attacks counsel\u2019s failure to object to Warrick\u2019s testimony because his written report never stated that the information he utilized was sufficient for him to form an opinion. He also argues that counsel were ineffective for never objecting during Warrick\u2019s testimony that his conclusions were not based on a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">During cross-examination, Warrick admitted that this was the first time he had ever testified using digitally enhanced fingerprint evidence. In this instance, counsel\u2019s effective cross-examination exposed Warrick\u2019s inexperience in testifying about digitally enhanced fingerprint evidence. The jury was properly instructed that they were to decide what weight to give such evidence. See <em>State v. Jones </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 416, 739 N.E.2d 300, 315. We reject this claim of ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Defendant\u2019s attack on counsel\u2019s failure to object to the inadequacy of Warrick\u2019s testimony cannot be evaluated, since Warrick\u2019s January 9, 1998 report was never presented at trial. Moreover, defendant cannot add to the record, since \u201c[a] reviewing court cannot add matter to the record before it * * * and then decide the appeal on the basis of the new matter.\u201d <em>State v. Ishmail </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 402, 8 O.O.3d 405, 377 N.E.2d 500, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">We also find that defendant\u2019s attack on counsel\u2019s delay in objecting to War-rick\u2019s testimony lacks merit. At the conclusion of Warrick\u2019s testimony, counsel moved to strike his testimony because it was not based on a reasonable degree of scientific certainty. As previously discussed, the trial court properly overruled counsel\u2019s motion. Moreover, we find that counsel\u2019s delay in objecting to War-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>rick\u2019s testimony was a \u201ctactical decision,\u201d and reject this claim of ineffectiveness. See <em>State v. Smith </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 424, 441, 721 N.E.2d 93, 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\n<em>3. Failure to object to Urbank\u2019s and Hoffman\u2019s testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Defendant argues that counsel was ineffective because his counsel failed to object to Urbank\u2019s testimony that defendant said that \u201che face stomped a black guy six months ago.\u201d Since this testimony was properly admitted, counsel\u2019s failure to challenge such evidence cannot be considered ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Assuming that such testimony should not have been introduced, any such deficiency constitutes reversible error only where \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 698. Here, compelling evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was presented during his trial and the jury\u2019s \u2019consideration of this improper comment would not have changed the outcome of the case. Therefore, we reject this claim of ineffectiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Defendant also asserts counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to object to Christopher Hoffman\u2019s testimony. Hoffman, one of defendant\u2019s co-workers at the Hilton, testified that defendant mentioned during a conversation in August 1997 that O.J. Simpson could have cut off the victim\u2019s hands and eliminated skin and fiber evidence from the victim\u2019s nails.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Hoffman\u2019s testimony was admissible in establishing defendant\u2019s identity as the murderer. Evid.R. 401; see, also, <em>State v. Sage, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus. Defendant\u2019s comments about cutting off a victim\u2019s hands implicated defendant as Snipes\u2019s murderer, since Snipes\u2019s hands were cut off. In addition, defendant\u2019s comments were made just a month before the murder and tended to prove \u201cprior calculation and design.\u201d See R.C. 2903.01(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">Thus, we find that counsel\u2019s failure to object was not ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">\n<em>4. Failure to utilize DNA evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">Defendant argues that his counsel were ineffective for failing to utilize DNA evidence to establish that defendant\u2019s semen was not present in Snipes\u2019s anus.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">Urbank testified that defendant had told him that he had only vaginal intercourse with Snipes on September 9, although he \u201chad first asked her when they were going up to the apartment if he could have anal intercourse with her and she said yes but later she said no and he was disappointed because they didn\u2019t have any.\u201d At trial, defendant repeated that he had \u201c[j]ust regular vaginal sex,\u201d and no anal sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-13\">Platt, the medical examiner, testified that sperm was found in the victim\u2019s anus. The state conducted no DNA testing. According to Wurster, a BCI forensic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>scientist assigned to the DNA section, he recommended against DNA testing on the semen because \u201cI was given information that the Defendant never denied having sex and DNA would do nothing more than confirm that that was the case.\u201d Moreover, the Akron police did not request DNA testing of the semen, and Wurster was never informed that defendant denied having anal sex with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The defense theory was that someone else had had anal sex with Snipes and killed her on September 9. Thus, defendant claims that his counsel were ineffective for failing to utilize DNA testing to show that his semen was not in Snipes\u2019s anus.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">As an initial matter, \u201cthe failure to call an expert and instead rely on cross-examination does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Nicholas </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 431, 436, 613 N.E.2d 225, 230, citing <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 10-11, 514 N.E.2d 407, 417. Thus, the defense counsel\u2019s decision to rely on cross-examination should be viewed as a legitimate \u201ctactical decision\u201d particularly since the results of a DNA examination may not necessarily have proven favorable for the defense. See <em>State v. Watson </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 1, 13, 572 N.E.2d 97, 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Finally, resolving this issue in defendant\u2019s favor would be purely speculative. \u201cNothing in the record indicates what kind of testimony an * * * expert could have provided. Establishing that would require proof outside the record, such as affidavits demonstrating the probable testimony. Such a claim is not appropriately considered on a direct appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Madrigal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 390-391, 721 N.E.2d 52, 65 (rejecting claim of ineffectiveness for counsel\u2019s failure to utilize an expert on eyewitness identification); <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 606, 734 N.E.2d 345, 357 (rejecting claim of ineffectiveness for counsel\u2019s failure to pursue MRI testing in the penalty phase). Thus, we reject defendant\u2019s claim that counsel\u2019s failure to utilize DNA evidence constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">\n<em>5. Failure to obtain expert testimony on bloodstain</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">Defendant argues counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to obtain expert testimony concerning a bloodstain found on his right boot.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">Wurster testified that he found a small bloodstain on one of defendant\u2019s boots. However, Wurster conducted no confirmatory testing to determine whether the blood stain matched the defendant\u2019s or the victim\u2019s blood type, or even whether it was human or animal blood. Thus, defendant argues that his counsel were ineffective for failing to present expert testimony to establish that the bloodstain found on his boot was animal blood or that it came from the \u201cface stomping\u201d incident or elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>The bloodstain on defendant\u2019s boot was not an issue in the case, since he admitted that the police \u201cwould find the blood of the victim on them.\u201d Moreover, defendant admitted on the stand that he was at Snipes\u2019s apartment and tried to lift her bloody corpse from the floor to the bed, got blood on his hands from trying to lift her body, and ran to the bathroom and began washing all the blood off his hands in the bathtub. Thus, blood could obviously be found on his boots. Counsel could have determined that pursuing testing in light of this evidence was not a wise use of time and resources. Counsel exercised a legitimate tactical decision by not pursuing this questionable line of defense. Thus, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\n<em>6. Failure to conduct meaningful voir dire</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Defendant claims that his counsel were ineffective for failing to adequately voir dire prospective jurors because counsel generally inquired only about the jurors\u2019 ability to be fair and impartial. However, defendant fails to specify which prospective jurors were improperly questioned, or how counsel\u2019s questioning prejudiced his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\u201c \u2018The conduct of voir dire by defense counsel does not have to take a particular form, nor do specific questions have to be asked.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 440, 721 N.E.2d at 110, quoting State <em>v. Evans </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 231, 247, 586 N.E.2d 1042, 1056. Moreover, this court \u201cwill not second-guess trial strategy decisions\u201d such as those made in voir dire, and \u201c \u2018a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Mason, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 157-158, 694 N.E.2d at 949, quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d at 694; see, also, <em>State v. Cornwell </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 560, 569, 715 N.E.2d 1144, 1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">As to defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance in regard to voir dire, defendant fails to establish prejudice, namely, \u201cthat there exists a reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus. Thus, we find that this claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">\n<em>7. Failure to object to prosecutorial misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Defendant recasts his objections to prosecutorial misconduct into ineffective assistance of counsel without showing why counsel\u2019s failure to object made his performance deficient or how reasonably probable that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would be different. <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c \u2018[t]he failure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Fears </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 329, 347, 715 N.E.2d 136, 153, quoting <em>State v. Holloway </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831, 837. Since defendant does not show that any particular failure to object substantially violated any essential duty or was otherwise prejudicial, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>\n<em>8. Failure to object to trial and penalty phase instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Defendant argues that counsel\u2019s failure to object to the trial and penalty phase instructions constituted ineffectiveness. However, defendant fails to specify the instructions that he believes counsel should have objected to as erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Earlier in this opinion, we found no merit in defendant\u2019s allegations of instructional error during either the trial or penalty phase of the trial. Here, defendant similarly fails to demonstrate how counsel\u2019s failure to object was deficient performance or how \u201cthere exists a reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would be different.\u201d <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus. Since counsel\u2019s performance did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness and defendant did not suffer prejudice, we reject this claim of ineffectiveness. See <em>State v. Madrigal, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 397, 721 N.E.2d at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">\n<em>9. Failure to object to \u201cother acts\u201d testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Defendant next argues that his counsel were ineffective for failing to object to \u201cother acts\u201d testimony, making no argument in support and citing pages in the trial transcript that deal with the admission of defendant\u2019s knives into evidence. If any error was committed here, it had nothing to do with \u201cother acts.\u201d The introduction of a set of defendant\u2019s knives from work showed defendant\u2019s easy access to a possible murder weapon and his familiarity with using knives. As discussed earlier, this evidence was extremely relevant, since Snipes was stabbed one hundred thirty-eight times, her throat was slit, and her hands were cut off with surgical precision. We find that counsel were not deficient by failing to object, and we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">\n<em>10. Failure to ensure a complete record</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Defendant argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to ensure that a complete record of the proceedings was made and that, as a result, defendant has lost his chance to argue that an improper contact occurred, prompting the trial judge\u2019s admonition:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">\u201cRemember my admonitions about discussing the case with anyone else. I will also further tell you, folks, that you are not allowed- to ask questions of the lawyers or speak to the lawyers, okay?</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">\u201cIf you have any questions, keep them in your mind, if they answer the questions for you, fine; if they don\u2019t, that\u2019s something that you can consider during your deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">Defendant presents no evidence of any improper contacts, and \u201c \u2018without knowing what happened during those portions of the trial, we are obviously in no position to find that it was prejudicial error not to record them.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 87, 656 N.E.2d 643, 660, quoting <em>State v. Tyler, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>50 Ohio St.3d at 38, 553 N.E.2d at 593. Since defendant neither specifies how the trial record is incomplete nor demonstrates how he was prejudiced, his counsel\u2019s performance cannot be characterized as ineffective assistance. See <em>State v. Davie </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 311, 332, 686 N.E.2d 245, 264; <em>State v. Keith </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 514, 536, 684 N.E.2d 47, 67. Therefore, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">In summary, since none of defendant\u2019s claims establishes ineffective assistance of counsel, we find that proposition YII lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\n<em>Constitutional issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">In proposition of law XI, defendant challenges the constitutionality of the proportionality review that this court conducts in capital cases. However, his claims are without merit. See <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Smith, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 118, 684 N.E.2d at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">In proposition of law XIII, defendant disputes the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death penalty statute. We reject these claims. See <em>State v. Carter, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 607, 734 N.E.2d at 357-358; <em>State v. Clemons </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 438, 454, 696 N.E.2d 1009, 1023; <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Defendant also challenges the Ohio Constitution\u2019s requirement of a direct appeal from the trial court to the Ohio Supreme Court if the death penalty was imposed. We find that this claim also has been resolved. See <em>State v. Smith, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 89, 684 N.E.2d 668, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Clemons, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 454, 696 N.E.2d at 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Further, defendant\u2019s claim that Ohio\u2019s death penalty violates international treaties lacks merit. <em>State v. Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 502, 709 N.E.2d 484, 499; <em>State v. Phillips, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 103-104, 656 N.E.2d at 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">\n<em>Sentencing opinion/Failure to comply with R.C. 2929.03(F).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">In proposition of law IX, defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion failed to explain, as required by R.C. 2929.03(F), why the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">In its opinion, the trial court stated that \u201cthe emphasis was on seeking, identifying and evaluating factors in mitigation of the death sentence, pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(B).\u201d The trial court listed and considered the mitigating factors defendant presented during the penalty phase of the trial. \u201cHaving reviewed all the evidence, and the material presented in mitigation, the Court found [that] the aggravating circumstances did outweigh any factors presented in mitigation in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Defendant complains that the trial court did not explain <em>how </em>it determined that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating circumstances. The trial court should have presented an explanation. However, the court set forth the mitigating factors in detail, evidencing its consideration of defendant\u2019s evidence in making its decision. There is \u201cno requirement\u201d that the trial court explain \u201chow it decides how much weight to give to any one factor. The weight, if any, given to a mitigating factor is a matter for the discretion of the individual decisionmaker.\u201d <em>State v. Filiaggi </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 230, 245, 714 N.E.2d 867, 880.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Furthermore, our independent reassessment of the sentence will eliminate the effect of any deficiencies found in the trial court\u2019s sentencing decision. <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 191, 631 N.E.2d 124, 131. For these reasons, we reject proposition IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\n<em>Weighing and determination of the death penalty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">In proposition of law X, defendant argues that his death penalty must be vacated because the aggravating circumstance does not outweigh the mitigating circumstances. We will address defendant\u2019s argument when we independently review defendant\u2019s death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">\n<em>Independent Sentence Evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\"><em>Aggravating circumstance. </em>Defendant was convicted of the felony murder (kidnapping) aggravating circumstance under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">The evidence against defendant included defendant\u2019s admissions linking him to the crime and the crime scene, his clandestine 911 calls notifying the police of the murder, his destruction of evidence at the crime scene, his derogatory comments about the victim <em>(e.g., </em>\u201cpsycho bitch\u201d and \u201cshe got what she deserved\u201d), the presence of Snipes\u2019s watch and defendant\u2019s bloody tee-shirt at his apartment, Hoffman\u2019s testimony that defendant discussed cutting off a victim\u2019s hands to eliminate evidence, and defendant\u2019s jailhouse confession. Forensic evidence showing defendant\u2019s guilt included fingerprint evidence and expert testimony that the blood patterns on defendant\u2019s tee-shirt were applied by a long-bladed knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">Evidence establishing kidnapping included the victim\u2019s bound and gagged body at the crime scene and medical testimony that the victim was still alive when she was tied to her bed with a pair of pantyhose. Thus, the evidence in the case clearly established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant intentionally murdered Snipes while kidnapping or attempting to kidnap her.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\"><em>Mitigation evidence. </em>Defendant called two mitigation witnesses, his sister and his aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>According to Rhea Wolpert, the defendant\u2019s sister, defendant experienced a turbulent childhood. His mother divorced his stepfather when defendant was four, and defendant moved from Wisconsin to California with his mother and her boyfriend, Ralph. Defendant had difficulty adjusting socially and doing well in school in California. After a few years in California, defendant was sent to Arizona to live with his Aunt Arietta. Aunt Arietta was described as a stable influence in Hartman\u2019s life. Later, defendant moved to New Mexico to live with his natural father.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Defendant returned to California to live with his mother when he was fourteen. While living in California, he started having problems with street kids and experimenting with alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Defendant moved to Wolpert\u2019s residence in Akron when he was seventeen or eighteen. Defendant worked at factory jobs, paid Wolpert rent, and contributed to his share of the bills. According to Wolpert, defendant occasionally had problems drinking alcohol and indicated that there is a family history of alcoholism.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">When defendant was eighteen, he returned to California. He completed a program at a youth home in California, and later moved with his mother to Wisconsin, and then to Akron.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Arietta Hartman, the defendant\u2019s aunt, stated that when defendant was eight, he was sent to live with her because of his disciplinary problems. She was a teacher on a Navajo Indian reservation in Arizona, and defendant was enrolled in a Catholic school on the reservation. She described defendant as a very good and kind boy, but hyperactive. Defendant had problems in school and repeated third grade but his grades improved and he was a \u201cstrong B student\u201d in fourth grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Defendant lived with his aunt for three and one-half years. However, defendant started having problems in school and was rebellious, and he was sent to live with his natural father at age twelve. Defendant\u2019s stepmother was very strict; he started running away from home, and defendant was placed into a juvenile center for theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">Ultimately, defendant moved back to his mother\u2019s home in California. When he was fourteen or fifteen, defendant spent time in a youth home for car theft and alcohol abuse. Later, defendant illegally left the youth home and went to five with his sister in Akron. Defendant later returned to California, turned himself into authorities, and finished his time at the youth home. Thereafter, he returned with his mother to live in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">In proposition of law X, defendant argues that the aggravating circumstance does not outweigh the mitigating factors. Defendant argues that his youth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>(twenty-three at the time of the offense), lack of significant criminal history (five or six convictions for driving under the influence), and the influence of alcoholism on his life should be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Defendant indicates that his substance- and alcohol-abuse problems began at age eleven. Thereafter, he was intermittently homeless and lived on the streets in California, where he used alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs heavily. Defendant says that this pattern of abuse continued through his later teenage years and into his early adult life. He would typically consume a twelve-pack of beer a night, smoke marijuana, and use other drugs, and he was clinically diagnosed \u201cas chemically dependent for alcohol and drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Defendant argues that there are ten important mitigating factors warranting reversal of his death sentence: (1) his family history of alcoholism, (2) hyperactivity and attention deficits contributing to his adjustment problems, (3) his unstable home environment, (4) difficulty in adjusting to different locations and cultures <em>(ie., </em>living on a Navajo Indian reservation), (5) failure to develop childhood trust and emotional bonding, (6) heavy involvement with alcohol and drugs as a youth, (7) alcohol overdose at age twelve, (8) multiple encounters with the criminal justice system, typically involving substance abuse, (9) worsening alcohol dependence as an adult and multiple DUIs, and (10) recent stability as evidenced by his employment as a chef and moving in with his mother to share expenses. Moreover, defendant claims that there is little in his background indicating that he could have or did commit this crime. Also, he claims that there is nothing to suggest that he would commit this type of crime in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Defendant argues that he can remain a productive member of society within the prison environment. By remaining drug- and alcohol-free in prison, defendant claims that he can show his true side: \u201ckind, caring, compassionate, friendly, and industrious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Defendant expressed his sorrow about Snipe\u2019s death but continued to profess his innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">\n<em>Sentence evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">We find that the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the aggravating circumstance with which he was charged, <em>ie., </em>murder during kidnapping, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">We find nothing in the nature and circumstances of the offense to be mitigating. Snipes was gagged and forcefully tied to her bed with a pair of pantyhose and then brutally murdered. The facts show a senseless, horrific murder that lacks any mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">Defendant\u2019s history and background provide only modest mitigating features. Nevertheless, defendant\u2019s childhood was turbulent, as he lived with a succession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>of relatives and parents in different parts of the country. Moreover, alcohol problems were a part of his family\u2019s history and defendant\u2019s alcohol and substance abuse began at age eleven. Defendant\u2019s alcohol dependency undoubtedly contributed to his criminal activity (thefts) and numerous DUI convictions. Despite these difficulties, defendant was gainfully employed and appears to have been a hard worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">We find that the R.C. 2929.04(B)(4) mitigating factor (youth of the offender) applicable but entitled to little weight, since defendant was twenty-three years of age at the time of the offense. See <em>State v. Dunlap </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 308, 319, 652 N.E.2d 988, 998; <em>State v. Ballew </em>(1996), 76 Ohio StSd 244, 257, 667 N.E.2d 369, 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">We conclude that the R.C. 2929.04(B)(5) mitigating factor (lack of a <em>significant </em>criminal history) may be applicable but entitled to little weight, since defendant had at least five previous DUI convictions. See <em>State v. D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 145, 652 N.E.2d at 714 (lack of significant prior criminal record entitled to some weight despite two previous DUIs).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In summary, defendant\u2019s mitigation is only modest. His youth (age twenty-three), his employment history, see <em>State v. Madrigal, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 400, 721 N.E.2d at 72, as well as his lack of a significant prior criminal record (although he committed at least five DUIs), merit some consideration. Also, we accord only modest weight in mitigation to defendant\u2019s dysfunctional family background, his family\u2019s history of alcohol abuse, and his short record of gainful employment. Defendant\u2019s alcohol use undoubtedly affected his judgment and may have played a role in the murder. However, there was no testimony that he was heavily intoxicated before the murder or that alcohol somehow significantly reduced his ability to control his actions that night so as to negate specific intent. Overall, the mitigating factors are of modest significance, and we find that they are outweighed by the aggravating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">We find that the death penalty imposed for aggravated murder of Snipes is appropriate when compared with other kidnapping-murder cases. See <em>State v. Ballew, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 244, 667 N.E.2d 369; <em>State v. Joseph, </em>73 Ohio St.3d 450, 653 N.E.2d 285; <em>State v. Simko, </em>71 Ohio St.3d 483, 644 N.E.2d 345; <em>State v.

Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 243, 15 OBR 379, 383, 473 N.E.2d 768, 775, this court stated that \u201cprolonged restraint, secretive confinement, or significant movement apart from that involved in the underlying crime [are required] in order to justify the application of the aggravating circumstance of kidnapping under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).\u201d In this case, the alleged kidnapping was in reality a series of actions that were incidental to the crime of murder. The sad truth is that it is easier to stab someone over one hundred times if the victim can\u2019t evade you. The majority places great weight on the fact that the victim was tied up before she was lolled. The sad truth is that there was no reason to tie up the victim after she was dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">The record does not contain proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a kidnapping occurred. It is possible to believe that a kidnapping occurred; our system of justice requires more. Without the kidnapping felony-murder specification, this case is a murder case, not a capital murder case. Despite the grisly nature of the crime, that is what it should be. I would reverse the kidnapping conviction and felony-murder conviction and vacate the sentence of death. I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">\u201cProposition of Law No. I: The state failed to introduce sufficient evidence to prove all of the elements of kidnapping beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant Hartman was deprived of his right to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">\u201cProposition of Law No. II: The trial court committed constitutional, reversible error when it instructed the jury during the penalty phase of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">\u201cProposition of Law No. Ill: The trial court erred when it permitted highly prejudicial, nonprobative and irrelevant evidence and testimony to be introduced at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">\u201cProposition of Law No. IV: Computer generated digital enhancement of fingerprints is not a reliable technic [sic] for analyzing fingerprints. Admission of testimony at trial regarding computer enhanced fingerprints denied appellant Hartman a fair trial and due process as guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">\u201cProposition of Law No. V: It was error for the trial court to admit the opinion of witnesses who had not first been qualified as an expert.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ASS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number><em>Sherri Bevan Walsh, </em>Summit County Prosecuting Attorney, <em>Paul M. Marie </em>and <em>Philip D. Bogdanoff, </em>Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u201cProposition of Law No. VI: Persistent and pervasive prosecutorial misconduct prejudicially affected the appellant\u2019s constitutional rights and requires reversal of his conviction and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u201cProposition of Law No. VTI: Defense counsel\u2019s repeated acts and ommissions [sic] deprived appellant of effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth, Eight [sic], and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7\u00a7 9,10, and 16 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\u201cProposition of Law No. VIII: Gruesome, prejudicial and cumulative photographs were admitted into evidence even though there [sic] prejudicial effect outweighed there [sic] probative value in violation of the Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amenments [sic] to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">\u201cProposition of Law No. IX: The trial court erred when it failed to comply with the requirements of R.C. \u00a7 2929.03(F). The trial court\u2019s opinion is constitutionally defective and no independent review can cure tehse [sic] fatal flaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">\u201cProposition of Law No. X: The death sentence in this case must be vacated because the aggravating circumstance does not outweigh the mitigating circumstances and the sentence of death is not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">\u201cProposition of Law No. XI: The proportionality review that this court must conduct in the present capital case pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Section 2929.05 is fatally flawed and therefore the present death sentence must be vacated pursuant to the Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Sections 5 and 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and Ohio Revised Code 2929.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">\u201cProposition of Law No. XII: The trial court committed prejudicial, reversible error when it failed to instruct the jury of an essential element of the kidnapping specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">\u201cProposition of Law No. XIII: Ohio\u2019s death penalty law is unconstitutional. The Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and \u00a7\u00a7 2, 9, 10 and 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution establish the requirements for a valid death penalty scheme. Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2903.01, 2929.02, 2929.021, 2929.022, 2929.023, 2929.03, 2929.04, and 2929.05 (Anderson 1996), do not meet the prescribed constitutional requirements and are unconstitutional on their face and as applied to Brett Hartman.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A6a\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number><em>Irving B.
