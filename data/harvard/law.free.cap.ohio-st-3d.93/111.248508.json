This court later decided, however, that \u201c[r]egardless of the outcome in <em>Milkovich, * </em>* * [t]he Ohio Constitution provides a separate and independent guarantee of protection for opinion ancillary to freedom of the press.\u201d <em>Vail v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 279, 281, 649 N.E.2d 182, 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Now we are asked to determine whether the Ohio Constitution\u2019s separate and independent protection for opinions protects only those statements uttered by media defendants, such as the newspaper and columnist in <em>Vail, </em>or whether a private citizen unaffiliated with the media, such as the appellee here, may invoke the same independent constitutional protection. We agree with the court of appeals that nonmedia defendants may invoke the Ohio Constitution\u2019s independent protection for opinions and affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">On September 25, 1998, the Circleville Herald published a news article entitled \u201cCardinal Market to close doors.\u201d According to the article, Linda McKee, the owner of Linda\u2019s Cardinal Market, a downtown grocery, had decided to liquidate the business due to declining sales, \u201ca general degeneration in the downtown area, a proliferation of mini marts around town, and changing customer habits.\u201d The article also stated that McKee had been unable to come to terms on a new lease with the owner of the building in which the market was located, appellant Isaac Wampler. McKee stated that she would be unable to afford additional rent that Wampler was seeking under the terms of a proposed new lease. The article quoted Wampler as saying, \u201cI did not want [McKee] to leave,\u201d and \u201cI deeply regret that she has made a decision to leave. My commitment was to her. She has been a part of the community for 16 years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Three days later, the Circleville Herald published a letter to the editor signed by appellee, Wallace Higgins. The letter stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">\u201cDear Editor:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">\u201cDowntown Circleville is about to suffer a serious loss. Linda\u2019s Cardinal Market, at the comer of Scioto and West Main streets, is being forced out of business by the exorbitant rent now being demanded by the present owner of the building. Most of us who live in the downtown area have depended on Linda and her predecessors, who have been in the grocery business on that site for the past 50 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">\u201cWard Skinner and Linda have run a friendly and accommodating store. They knew, understood, and sympathized with their customers. Now, because of one man\u2019s self-centered greed, all of that is going to end.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>\u201cToo many downtown properties belong to people who care nothing for Circleville and who have no vision for the future. Circleville is a unique place, and everyone could profit from that uniqueness. Instead, some are trying to make it conform to the world for their own profit. They are willing to sell out to some faceless national corporation with no motive but profit and no interest in our history, our architecture, or our tradition. They cheerfully take the money and run and \u2018let the public be damned!\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u201cThe owner of the Cardinal Market building sold his own Watt Street property, for an astronomical figure, to a mindless corporation. Once he had a taste of the blood of easy money, he has apparently become a ruthless speculator. He would, I\u2019m sure, sell the whole town to heartless corporations so that they might turn it into one great, ugly, sprawling shopping mall. It is pathetic that the whole town must suffer because of the greed of a few uncaring people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Wampler sued Higgins for defamation in the Common Pleas Court of Pickaway County, alleging that Higgins had falsely stated in his letter that Wampler had forced McKee out of business by charging exorbitant rent. Wampler also claimed that Higgins had impugned his personal and professional integrity and reputation by, among other things, falsely describing Wampler as a \u201cruthless speculator.\u201d According to Wampler, Higgins either knew that his statements were untrue or negligently failed to make a reasonable inquiry into the truth of the statements. Wampler asserted that as a result of Higgins\u2019s statements, he had suffered injury to his reputation and business, humiliation, stress, and other unspecified pecuniary and nonpecuniary losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">In his answer, Higgins admitted that he was the author of the allegedly defamatory letter, but asserted that every statement contained therein \u201cwas an honest and good faith expression of opinion.\u201d Higgins later made the same contention in a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted Higgins\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Wampler\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">In its decision and entry granting Higgins\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court cited this court\u2019s decision in <em>Vail </em>for the proposition that \u201cexpressions of opinion are generally protected under Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution as a valid exercise of freedom of the press,\u201d quoting 72 Ohio St.3d at 280, 649 N.E.2d at 184. The trial court noted that \u201cthe Ohio Supreme Court has extended this absolute privilege for opinion only to media defendants (ancillary to \u2018freedom of the press\u2019), and only to statements made directly by, not to, the media.\u201d Despite Higgins\u2019s status as a nonmedia defendant, however, the trial court decided that it would determine whether the statements contained in Higgins\u2019s letter to the editor were opinions under the four-part test adopted by this court in <em>Scott v. News-Herald </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 243, 25 OBR 302, 496 N.E.2d 699, and reaffirmed in <em>Vail. </em>Applying this test, the trial court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>that under the totality of the circumstances, \u201cthe language used by defendant in his letter would be understood by the ordinary reader for just what it is \u2014 one person\u2019s frustration with the perceived plight of many small downtown areas due to small business closures and large corporate takeovers. * * * [T]he average reader would believe that statements contained in defendant\u2019s letter are the opinions of the writer and not facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Wampler appealed the trial court\u2019s decision to the Pickaway County Court of Appeals. In his first assignment of error, Wampler claimed that the trial court erred when it applied the <em>Scott/Vail </em>test to determine whether Higgins\u2019s statements were constitutionally protected opinions. Wampler argued that the Ohio Constitution\u2019s separate and independent protection for opinions applies only to those allegedly defamatory statements made by media defendants. In his second assignment of error, Wampler contended that the trial court should have concluded that the statements contained in Higgins\u2019s letter were actionable statements of fact under the <em>Scott/Vail </em>test \u2014 not merely expressions of Higgins\u2019s opinions. The court of appeals, however, affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in Higgins\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Wampler moved the court of appeals to certify a conflict between its decision and that rendered by the First District Court of Appeals in <em>Conese v. Nichols </em>(1998), 131 Ohio App.3d 308, 722 N.E.2d 541. As Wampler noted, the <em>Conese </em>court had determined that <em>Vail\u2019s </em>\u201cabsolute privilege to [express opinions had] not yet been extended to all statements of opinion, by anyone, or to the media for the republication of the opinion of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315-316, 722 N.E.2d at 546. The Pickaway County Court of Appeals denied Wampler\u2019s motion for certification, however, concluding that the <em>Conese </em>court\u2019s decision did not ultimately turn upon any distinction between media and nonmedia defendants and that any apparent conflict arose from <em>obiter dicta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Wampler appealed to this court, and the cause is now before us upon the allowance of a discretionary appeal. <em>Wampler v. Higgins </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 1430, 736 N.E.2d 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">II. <em>Vail\u2019s </em>Guarantee of Protection for Opinions</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">To place the instant dispute in its proper context, we begin our analysis by briefly examining the historical development of what we described in <em>Vail </em>as Ohio\u2019s \u201cseparate and independent guarantee of protection for opinion ancillary to freedom of the press.\u201d <em>Id., </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 281, 649 N.E.2d at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">In 1964, the United States Supreme Court decided that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution restricts state defamation law, holding that a public official may not recover damages for a defamatory falsehood concerning his or her official conduct unless he or she proves \u201cactual malice,\u201d <em>ie., </em>that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>statement was made with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false. <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan </em>(1964), 376 U.S. 254, 279-280, 84 S.Ct. 710, 726, 11 L.Ed.2d 686, 706.</p>\n<p id=\"AMm\">The United States Supreme Court later decided that the First Amendment does <em>not </em>impose the same strict limitations on the states in suits by private persons alleging defamation on matters of public interest. See <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974), 418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789. The <em>Gertz </em>court determined that some degree of constitutional protection nevertheless applies, holding that (1) states may not permit liability to attach in such cases without requiring <em>some </em>showing of fault, and (2) states may not permit recovery of presumed or punitive damages without a showing of the <em>New York Times </em>brand of malice. <em>Id. </em>at 347-350, 94 S.Ct. at 3010-3012, 41 L.Ed.2d at 809-811. The <em>Gertz </em>court also stated, \u201cUnder the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea. However pernicious an opinion may seem, we depend for its correction not on the conscience of judges and juries but on the competition of other ideas. But there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact.\u201d <em>Id., </em>418 U.S. at 339-340, 94 S.Ct. at 3007, 41 L.Ed.2d at 805. This passage from <em>Gertz </em>eventually became \u201cthe opening salvo in all arguments for protection from defamation actions on the ground of opinion.\u201d <em>Cianci v. New Times Publishing Co. </em>(C.A.2, 1980), 639 F.2d 54, 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">In <em>Ollman v. Evans </em>(C.A.D.C.1984), 750 F.2d 970, the United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, discussed in detail the import of this brief passage from <em>Gertz: </em>\u201cThe statement is clearly <em>dicta. </em>* * * Despite its status as <em>dicta, </em>a majority of federal circuit courts, including this one, have accepted the statement as controlling law.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 974, fn. 6. \u201cBy this statement, <em>Gertz </em>elevated to constitutional principle the distinction between fact and opinion, which at common law had formed the basis of the doctrine of fair comment. Gertz\u2019s implicit command thus <em>imposes upon both state and federal courts the duty as a matter of constitutional adjudication to distinguish facts from opinions in order to provide opinions with the requisite, absolute First Amendment protection.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added; footnote omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Having decided that <em>Gertz </em>imposed this constitutional requirement on courts, the <em>Oilman </em>court adopted a four-part test<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> designed to assist judges in distinguishing, under the totality of the circumstances, actionable statements of fact from nonactionable statements of opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 979-984. The United States Supreme Court declined to review <em>Oilman, </em>over then Justice Rehnquist\u2019s vigorous dissent. See <em>Ollman v. Evans </em>(1985), 471 U.S. 1127, 1129, 105 S.Ct. 2662, 2664, 86 L.Ed.2d 278, 280 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting from, the denial of certiorari, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>argued that the lower courts were erroneously relying on the <em>Gertz </em>dicta to \u201csolve with a meat axe a very subtle and difficult question\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Soon after the United States Supreme Court declined to review <em>Oilman, </em>this court, expressly relying on the <em>Gertz </em>dicta, adopted <em>Oilman\u2019s </em>four-part test for distinguishing actionable factual statements from nonactionable opinions. <em>Scott, </em>25 Ohio St.3d at 245, 25 OBR at 303, 496 N.E.2d at 701 (quoting the <em>Gertz </em>dicta); see, also, <em>id, </em>at 250, 25 OBR at 308, 496 N.E.2d at 705-706 (citing <em>Ollman, </em>750 F.2d at 979, and adopting <em>Oilman\u2019s </em>four-part test). In <em>Scott, </em>a school superintendent alleged that a column published on the sports pages of the News-Herald had falsely accused him of committing perjury at a hearing conducted by the Ohio High School Athletic Association. This court decided, however, that the trial court had correctly granted summary judgment in favor of the newspaper because, under the totality of the circumstances, the article was \u201can opinion, protected by Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution as a proper exercise of freedom of the press.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 25 OBR at 303, 496 N.E.2d at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Four years after <em>Scott, </em>the United States Supreme Court explained that lower courts had misinterpreted the passage from <em>Gertz </em>that had formed the basis for the <em>Ollman/Scott </em>test. <em>Milkovich, </em>497 U.S. at 18, 110 S.Ct. at 2705, 111 L.Ed.2d at 17. In <em>Milkovich, </em>seven justices agreed that \u201cwe do not think this passage from <em>Gertz </em>was intended to create a wholesale defamation exemption for anything that might be labeled \u2018opinion.\u2019 * * * Not only would such an interpretation be contrary to the tenor and context of the passage, but it would also ignore the fact that expressions of \u2018opinion\u2019 may often imply an assertion of objective fact.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The <em>Milkovich </em>court thus squarely rejected the notion that \u201cin every defamation case the First Amendment mandates an inquiry into whether a statement is \u2018opinion\u2019 or \u2018fact.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 19, 110 S.Ct. at 2706, 111 L.Ed.2d at 18. As the court noted, the common law already incorporated a speech-protective privilege of \u201cfair comment\u201d as an affirmative defense to an action for defamation. Id. at 13, 110 S.Ct. at 2703, 111 L.Ed.2d at 14. The privilege of fair comment \u201c \u2018afford[ed] legal immunity <em>for the honest expression of opinion on matters of legitimate public interest when based upon a true or privileged statement of fact.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>quoting 1 Harper &amp; James, Law of Torts (1956) 456, Section 5.28. Given this, and the other \u201cestablished safeguards\u201d already recognized under the First Amendment, the United States Supreme Court expressly declined to recognize \u201cstill another * * * protection for defamatory statements which are categorized as \u2018opinion\u2019 as opposed to \u2018fact.\u2019\u201d <em>Milkovich, </em>497 U.S. at 17, 110 S.Ct. at 2705, 111 L.Ed.2d at 17. The court determined that the \u201cbreathing space\u201d essential for the survival of free expression was \u201cadequately secured by existing constitutional doctrine without the creation of an artificial dichotomy between \u2018opinion\u2019 and \u2018fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19, 110 S.Ct. at 2706, 111 L.Ed.2d at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Though the <em>Milkovich </em>court, in no uncertain terms, determined that the <em>Ollman/Scott </em>approach was <em>not </em>required to satisfy the dictates of the First Amendment, and that such an approach had, in fact, been predicated upon a misinterpretation of the <em>Gertz </em>dicta, this court expressly declined to follow <em>Milkovich </em>on independent state law grounds in <em>Vail, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 281, 649 N.E.2d at 185. In <em>Vail, </em>a candidate for political office sued the Plain Dealer and a columnist after an allegedly defamatory article about the candidate appeared in the newspaper\u2019s Forum section. The article, entitled \u201cGay-basher takes refuge in the closet,\u201d stated that Vail \u201cdoesn\u2019t like gay people\u201d and that she \u201cadded gay-bashing to the repertoire of right-wing, neo-numbskull tactics she is employing * * * in her increasingly distasteful campaign.\u201d Other statements in the article accused Vail of engaging in \u201canti-homosexual diatribe,\u201d and stated, among other things, that \u201cVail wouldn\u2019t be the first candidate to latch onto homophobia as a ticket to Columbus.\u201d The trial court dismissed Vail\u2019s complaint on the basis that the averred defamatory statements were constitutionally protected opinions. The court of appeals reversed, and Vail\u2019s appeal provided our court with the opportunity \u201cto revisit our decision in <em>Scott </em>\u201d and assess the continuing validity of the facVopinion dichotomy we had adopted in that case. <em>Vail, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 280, 649 N.E.2d at 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In <em>Vail, </em>we expressly conceded that, in the interval since <em>Scott, </em>the United States Supreme Court had decided that \u201c \u2018opinion\u2019 is afforded no additional protection under the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281, 649 N.E.2d at 185, citing <em>Milkovich, </em>497 U.S. at 21, 110 S.Ct. at 2707, 111 L.Ed.2d at 19. Even so, we determined that \u201c[rjegardless of the outcome in <em>Milkovich, </em>the law in this state is that embodied in <em>Scott. </em>The Ohio Constitution provides a separate and independent guarantee of protection for opinion ancillary to freedom of the press.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Though we downplayed the significance of our divergence from the United States Supreme Court in <em>Vail, </em>suggesting that \u201cit may be considered a distinction without a difference,\u201d we also expressly noted that \u201cit does alter the method of analysis. The focus shifts to whether the language under question is to be categorized as fact or opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281-282,. 649 N.E.2d at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">After applying the <em>Ollman/Scott </em>test in <em>Vail, </em>we decided that the trial court had correctly dismissed the plaintiffs action for failure to state a claim under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), as \u201cthe ordinary reader would accept this column as opinion and not as fact. Therefore, the statements are protected under Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d <em>Id., </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 283, 649 N.E.2d at 186. <em>Vail\u2019s </em>syllabus reaffirms <em>Scott\u2019s </em>proposition: \u201cWhen determining whether speech is protected opinion a court must consider the totality of the circumstances. Specifically, a court should consider: the specific language at issue, whether the statement is verifiable, the general context of the statement, and the broader <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>context in which the statement appeared.\u201d <em>Id., </em>syllabus, citing <em>Scott, 25 </em>Ohio St.3d 243, 25 OBR 302, 496 N.E.2d 699. Compare <em>Ollman, </em>750 F.2d at 979-984.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">III. <em>Wampler v. Higgins</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The instant dispute centers on the continuing validity, scope, and proper application of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Vail. </em>Both of the lower courts concluded that Higgins was entitled to summary judgment under the four-part <em>Scott/Vail </em>test because the allegedly defamatory statements contained in his letter to the editor were \u2014 as a matter of law \u2014 nonactionable expressions of Higgins\u2019s opinions. Wampler raises three interrelated arguments in support of reversal. First, he urges us to revisit <em>Vail </em>and \u201cadopt the approach set forth in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Milkovich </em>decision.\u201d In the alternative, Wampler urges us to refrain from extending <em>Vail\u2019s </em>rule to cases such as this, in which the defendant is a private citizen unaffiliated with the media. Finally, he contends that \u201c[i]f the four-part test described in <em>Scott </em>and <em>Vail </em>does apply to this case, it was applied incorrectly by the courts below.\u201d For the following reasons, however, we reject each of Wampler\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Wampler first urges us to revisit <em>Vail, </em>to abandon the <em>Scott/Vail </em>test, and to adopt the approach set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Milkovich. </em>In support of this argument, Wampler relies on Justice Pfeifer\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Vail. </em>As Justice Pfeifer correctly observed in that case, Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution not only guarantees that every citizen of our state may freely speak, write, and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects, it also expressly provides that every citizen is \u201cresponsible for the abuse of the right.\u201d <em>Vail, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 285, 649 N.E.2d at 188 (Pfeifer, J., concurring, citing Section 11, Article I, Ohio Constitution). In his merit brief to this court, Wampler refers to this observation in Justice Pfeifer\u2019s concurring opinion and asks us to reconsider our decision in <em>Vail </em>on the basis that the Ohio Constitution \u201cis not broader than the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. To the contrary, it appears to be narrower.\u201d For the following reasons, however, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The qualifying language in Section 11, Article I to which Wampler refers could indeed be interpreted as militating against this court\u2019s recognition of any <em>additional </em>speech-protective safeguards under the Ohio Constitution beyond those that are absolutely <em>required </em>by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the First Amendment. See <em>Vail, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 286, 649 N.E.2d at 188 (Pfeifer, J., concurring). At least one commentator has suggested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>that jurisdictions governed by constitutions explicitly recognizing liability for the abuse of free expression should not extend \u201csupraconstitutional\u201d protections to purely private defamations for which there are no binding federal constitutional requirements. See Elder, Defamation: A Lawyer\u2019s Guide (1993) 59, Section 8.7. Each constitutional restriction on the tort of defamation is in derogation of the common law, under which \u201cdefamatory communications were deemed actionable regardless of whether they were deemed to be statements of fact or opinion.\u201d <em>Milkovich, </em>497 U.S. at 12-13, 110 S.Ct. at 2702, 111 L.Ed.2d at 14, citing Restatement of Torts (1938), Sections 558, 565-567.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In spite of these observations, however, a majority of this court expressly eschewed the <em>Milkovich </em>approach in <em>Vail. </em>Though the United States Supreme Court determined that still another safeguard for allegedly defamatory speech was unnecessary, <em>Milkovich, </em>497 U.S. at 17, 110 S.Ct. at 2705, 111 L.Ed.2d at 17, this court decided that the Ohio Constitution requires a different analytical focus \u2014 a <em>categorical </em>determination of whether, under the totality of the circumstances, an ordinary reader of the allegedly defamatory statements would deem them to be statements of fact or opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Vail, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 281, 649 N.E.2d at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The categorical approach that we reaffirmed in <em>Vail </em>does not conflict with the explicit constitutional qualification noted by Justice Pfeifer in his concurring opinion \u2014 that Ohio\u2019s citizens are <em>responsible for the abuse </em>of their right to free speech. <em>Vail\u2019s </em>\u201cseparate and independent guarantee of protection\u201d for opinions will apply to the benefit of a defamation defendant only when his or her allegedly defamatory statements constitute, as a matter of law, statements of opinion under <em>Scott\u2019s </em>four-part test. Citizens who abuse their constitutional right to freely express their sentiments by uttering defamatory statements of fact will fail <em>Scott\u2019s </em>test and remain liable for the abuse of that right.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See, <em>e.g., McKimm v. Ohio Elections Comm. </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 139, 145, 729 N.E.2d 364, 371, fn. 2 (citing the four-part test from <em>Vail </em>and <em>Scott, </em>and deciding that the average reader of a campaign brochure would view a cartoon contained therein as \u201ca false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>factual assertion\u201d that the incumbent candidate had accepted cash in exchange for a vote to award a construction contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">In addition to the foregoing, the principles of <em>stare decisis </em>militate against accepting Wampler\u2019s invitation to reconsider <em>Vail\u2019s </em>six-year-old interpretation of Section 11, Article I. As the United States Supreme Court has noted, \u201c \u2018the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>is of fundamental importance to the rule of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Patterson v. McLean Credit Union </em>(1989), 491 U.S. 164, 172, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 2370, 105 L.Ed.2d 132, 147, quoting <em>Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp. </em>(1987), 483 U.S. 468, 494, 107 S.Ct. 2941, 2957, 97 L.Ed.2d 389, 410. Like the United States Supreme Court, we recognize that \u201c[o]ur precedents are not sacrosanct, for we have overruled prior decisions where the necessity and propriety of doing so has been established.\u201d <em>Patterson, </em>491 U.S. at 172,109 S.Ct. at 2370, 105 L.Ed.2d at 148. But \u201cany departure from the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>demands special justification.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Arizona v. Rumsey </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 203, 212, 104 S.Ct. 2305, 2311, 81 L.Ed.2d 164, 172. This is true even in cases of constitutional interpretation \u2014 an area in which the United States Supreme Court has determined that the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>is less compelling. See <em>Dickerson v. United States </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 428, 443, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 2336, 147 L.Ed.2d 405, 419 (requiring \u201cspecial justification,\u201d even in constitutional cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Wampler has advanced no compelling justification to revisit <em>Vail </em>and modify our interpretation of Section 11, Article 1. He claims that the <em>Scott/Vail </em>test \u201ccreates confusion and ambiguity\u201d in defamation law and has \u201cskewed the balance\u201d between the preservation of free expression and the maintenance of an individual\u2019s right to guard- his reputation, but he cites only the lower court opinions in this very case as support for this contention. Even if we were to agree with Wampler that the lower courts here misapplied <em>Vail\u2019s </em>four-part test\u2014 which we do <em>not </em>\u2014 we would not abandon <em>Vail\u2019s test on </em>that basis alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Wampler proposes that should we decide against reconsidering <em>Vail, we </em>should at least limit its application to media defendants. In his merit brief, Wampler notes, \u201cTo date, this \u201cCourt has not expressly extended <em>Vail </em>and <em>Scott </em>to encompass situations in which the defendant is a private figure.\u201d See, also, <em>Conese v. Nichols, </em>131 Ohio App.3d at 315-316, 722 N.E.2d at 546. We are not persuaded, however, by Wampler\u2019s proposed distinction between media and nonmedia defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Section 11, Article I is the source of the \u201cseparate and independent\u201d protection for opinions that this court recognized in <em>Scott </em>and later reaffirmed in <em>Vail. </em>See <em>Scott </em>25 Ohio St.3d at 244, 25 OBR at 303, 496 N.E.2d at 701; <em>Vai, </em>72 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>at 281, 649 N.E.2d at 185. It guarantees to \u201c[e]very citizen\u201d the right to publish freely his or her sentiments on all subjects, regardless of that citizen\u2019s association or nonassociation with the press. See <em>Sovchik v. Roberts </em>(May 9, 2001), Medina App. No. 3090-M, unreported, 2001 WL 490015, *3, fn. 1 (\u201cthe plain language of the constitutional provision \u2018[ejvery citizen\u2019 cannot reasonably be construed as applying only to members of the media. * * * This court must give effect to the words used in the Ohio Constitution, and the term \u2018[ejvery citizen,\u2019 should mean just that\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Just as the plain language of Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution fails to support Wampler\u2019s proposed distinction between media and nonmedia defendants, our prior cases interpreting that language likewise endorse no such distinction. It is true, as Wampler notes, that in both <em>Scott </em>and <em>Vail, </em>when this court recognized and reaffirmed the Ohio Constitution\u2019s independent protection for opinions, we did so by explicitly referring to the <em>freedom of the press. </em>See <em>Scott, </em>25 Ohio St.3d at 244, 25 OBR at 303, 496 N.E.2d at 701 (\u201cWe find the article to be an opinion, protected by Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution as a proper exercise of freedom of the press\u201d); <em>Vail, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 281, 649 N.E.2d at 185 (\u201cThe Ohio Constitution provides a separate and independent guarantee of protection for opinion ancillary to freedom of the press\u201d). Wampler contends that because these cases described Ohio\u2019s independent protection for opinions with explicit reference to freedom-of the press, we should decline to recognize that protection in cases such as the one at bar, in which the defendant is a private citizen unaffiliated with the media. We disagree, however, with Wampler\u2019s narrow reading of <em>Scott </em>and <em>Vail.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">In <em>Scott </em>and <em>Vail, </em>the plaintiff sued a newspaper and its columnist. Given that each of the defendants in <em>Scott </em>and <em>Vail </em>was affiliated with the print media, it is not surprising that this court announced its holdings in those cases with reference to freedom of the <em>press. </em>In neither case, however, did this court suggest that Ohio\u2019s categorical protection for opinions would <em>not </em>be available to nonmedia defendants such as Higgins who, though personally unaffiliated with the media, utilize a media forum to comment on a matter of public concern.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Sovchik, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>2001 WL 490015, at *3, fn. 1. This court\u2019s prior express reference to the press, shaped by the status of the parties appearing before the court in those cases, \u201cimplies no endorsement of the principle that speakers other than the press deserve lesser First Amendment protection.\u201d <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc. </em>(1985), 472 U.S. 749, 783, 105 S.Ct. 2939, 2958, 86 L.Ed.2d 593, 618 (Brennan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Wampler claims that in <em>McKimm, </em>we \u201ctacitly acknowledged\u201d that Ohio\u2019s <em>Scott/Vail </em>test is \u201cunwieldy,\u201d and attempted \u201cto bring Ohio closer to the federal test,\u201d under which no categorical protection for opinions applies. As noted above, <em>McKimm </em>concerned an allegedly defamatory cartoon that had been disseminated as part of a campaign brochure. In that case, we reaffirmed <em>Vail\u2019s </em>principle that the freedoms of speech and press are <em>\u201cindependently recognized </em>by the United States and Ohio Constitutions.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>McKimm, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 142, 729 N.E.2d at 369, citing <em>Vail. </em>We analogized federal and state defamation law in <em>McKimm </em>to underscore the fact that under <em>both </em>of these independent systems, when the <em>meaning </em>of an allegedly defamatory statement is in question, courts apply an objective \u201cordinary reader\u201d test to determine whether an allegedly libelous statement is a false statement of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 144, 729 N.E.2d at 371. Such an analogy need not be read to imply that the threshold <em>Scott </em>test required under the Ohio Constitution is \u201cunwieldy\u201d or unduly speech-protective.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>McKimm </em>actually undermines Wampler\u2019s claim that <em>Scott </em>and <em>Vail </em>\u201cskewed the balance\u201d in favor of defamation defendants, for in <em>McKimm </em>we upheld the Ohio Election Commission\u2019s decision to reprimand the candidate who disseminated the defamatory cartoon in his campaign brochure. <em>Id. </em>at 150, 729 N.E.2d at 375. <em>McKimm </em>illustrates that, even after <em>Vail\u2019s </em>reaffirmation of <em>Scott\u2019s </em>fact/opinion dichotomy, Ohio\u2019s citizens remain responsible for the abuse of their constitutional right to freely publish their sentiments.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Courts in several other states have declined to recognize the sort of distinction between media and nonmedia defendants that Wampler proposes here, and we find their reasoning persuasive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition to these courts, the authors of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts, have discouraged courts from distinguishing between media and nonmedia defendants for purposes of access to a constitutional privilege: \u201c[T]he protection of the First Amendment extends to freedom of speech as well as to freedom of the press, and the interests that must be balanced to obtain a proper accommodation are similar. It would seem strange to hold that the press, composed of professionals and causing much greater damage because of the wider distribution of the communication, can constitutionally be held liable only for negligence, but that a private person, engaged in a casual private conversation with a single person, can be held liable at his peril if the statement turns out to be false, without any regard to his lack of fault.\u201d 3 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1977), Section 580B, Comment <em>e.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">We recognize that some state courts have declined to extend the same constitutional protections to nonmedia defendants that are available to media defendants. See, <em>e.g., Greenmoss Builders, Inc. v. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. </em>(1983), 143 Vt. 66, 461 A.2d 414, affirmed on other grounds (1985), 472 U.S. 749, 105 S.Ct. 2939, 86 L.Ed.2d 593. In <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, </em>the Supreme Court of Vermont relied principally on a case from the Supreme Court of Oregon to support its decision distinguishing between media and nonmedia defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 74, 461 A.2d at 418, citing <em>Harley-Davidson Motorsports, Inc. v. Markley </em>(1977), 279 Ore. 361, 366, 568 P.2d 1359, 1362-1363.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">In <em>Harley-Davidson Motorsports, </em>the Supreme Court of Oregon decided that in defamation actions against nonmedia defendants, \u201c[t]he crucial elements * * * which brought the United States Supreme Court into the field of defamation law are missing. There is no threat to the free and robust debate of public issues; there is no potential interference with a meaningful dialogue of ideas concerning self-government; and there is no threat of liability causing a reaction of self-censorship by the press.\u201d <em>Id., </em>279 Ore. at 366, 568 P.2d at 1362-1363. For these reasons, the Supreme Court of Oregon rejected the idea that a private plaintiffs avenue for recovery against a nonmedia defendant \u201cshould be made more difficult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>in situations in which no such constitutional values are involved merely for the sake of securing symmetry of treatment of defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370-371, 568 P.2d at 1365. The Supreme Court of Vermont found the Oregon court\u2019s reasoning \u201cpersuasive and compelling\u201d in <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, </em>143 Vt. at 74, 461 A.2d at 418, but we do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">These cases that disfavor nonmedia defendants are unpersuasive for a number of reasons. First, as we have already noted, the language of our state\u2019s Constitution requires the \u201csymmetry of treatment of defendants\u201d deemed unnecessary by the Supreme Court of Oregon, for Section 11, Article I independently protects the sentiments uttered by \u201c[e]very citizen\u201d regardless of that citizen\u2019s affiliation or nonaffiliation with the media. Moreover, the Supreme Court of Oregon\u2019s rationale in <em>Harley-Davidson </em>\u2014 adopted by the Supreme Court of Vermont in <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet </em>\u2014 rests on the stated premise that restricting nonmedia defendants\u2019 access to constitutional privileges poses no threat to meaningful debate on public issues, and no threat of self-censorship by the press. <em>Harley-Davidson, </em>279 Ore. at 366, 568 P.2d at 1362-1363. The shortcomings of this premise are particularly evident in cases such as the one at bar, concerning a suit against the author of a letter to the editor published in a local newspaper. Constitutionally significant debate on matters of public concern is not the sole province of the media. See <em>Gilbert v. Bernard </em>(Mass.Super.1995), 4 Mass.L.Rptr. 143, 1995 WL 809550. The robust exchange of ideas that occurs each day on the editorial pages of our state\u2019s newspapers could indeed suffer if the nonmedia authors of letters to the editor published in these forums were denied the same constitutional protections enjoyed by the editors themselves. Accord <em>Jacron Sales, Inc. v. Sindorf </em>(1976), 276 Md. 580, 350 A.2d 688; <em>Kotlikoff v. Community News </em>(1982), 89 N.J. 62, 444 A.2d 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In addition, the courts that decided both <em>Harley-Davidson </em>and <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet </em>later questioned the analysis contained in those cases. As the Supreme Court <em>of </em>Oregon itself later admitted, its opinion in <em>Harley-Davidson </em>rested in part upon an incorrect assessment of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s defamation jurisprudence. See <em>Wheeler v. Green </em>(1979), 286 Ore. 99, 107, 593 P.2d 777, 783, fn. 5 (conceding that \u201c[i]n <em>Harley-Davidson </em>* * * we erroneously stated that all of the United States Supreme Court cases limiting actions for libel under the First Amendment involved media defendants. That was true of the cases cited to us on this issue and discussed in the opinion. There were, however, no media defendants in [those cases]\u201d). Similarly, the Supreme Court of Vermont\u2019s decision in <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet </em>was later called into doubt by <em>Ryan v. Herald Assn. Inc. </em>(1989), 152 Vt. 275, 279, 566 A.2d 1316, 1319, fn. 1 (conceding that \u201c[t]he United States Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of this court\u2019s rationale in <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet </em>* * * casts doubt on the vitality of the distinction for constitutional purposes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Finally, several members of the United States Supreme Court have agreed that distinguishing between media and nonmedia defendants for purposes of access to constitutional protections would be improper. When the United States Supreme Court reviewed Vermont\u2019s <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet </em>case, at least five justices agreed in separate opinions that the rights of the media in the context of defamation law are no greater than those enjoyed by other speakers. See <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, </em>472 U.S. at 773, 105 S.Ct. at 2952-2953, 86 L.Ed.2d at 611-612 (White, J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 782-783, 105 S.Ct. at 2957-2958, 86 L.Ed.2d at 617-618 (Brennan, J., dissenting). In his concurring opinion, Justice White stated: \u201cWisely, in my view, Justice Powell does not rest his application of a different rule here on a distinction drawn between media and nonmedia defendants. On that issue, I agree with Justice Brennan that the First Amendment gives no more protection to the press in defamation suits than it does to others exercising their freedom of speech. None of our cases affords such a distinction; to the contrary, the Court has rejected it at every turn. It should be rejected again, particularly in this context, since it makes no sense to give the most protection to those publishers who reach the most readers and therefore pollute the channels of communication with the most misinformation and do the most damage to private reputation.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 773, 105 S.Ct. at 2952-2953, 86 L.Ed.2d at 611-612.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Justice Brennan, joined by Justices Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens, similarly stated: \u201cRelying on the analysis of the Vermont Supreme Court, respondent urged that [we restrict] the applicability of <em>Gertz </em>to cases in which the defendant is a \u2018media\u2019 entity. Such a distinction is irreconcilable with the fundamental First Amendment principle that \u2018[t]he inherent worth of * * * speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public does not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, association, union, or individual.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781, 105 S.Ct. at 2957, 86 L.Ed.2d at 617 (Brennan, J., dissenting), quoting <em>First Natl. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti </em>(1978), 435 U.S. 765, 777, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 1416, 55 L.Ed.2d 707, 718.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Though we diverged in <em>Vail </em>from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s defamation jurisprudence in order to reaffirm the existence of the Ohio Constitution\u2019s separate and independent protection for opinions, we find persuasive reasoning within the high court\u2019s jurisprudence to support our rejection of Wampler\u2019s proposed distinction between media and nonmedia defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>IV. Application of the <em>Ollman/ScottlVail </em>Test</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In his second and third propositions of law, Wampler claims that, even if the Ohio Constitution\u2019s independent protection for opinion speech may be invoked by nonmedia defendants, the trial court erred when it decided, as a matter of law, that Higgins successfully invoked it in this case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">As the trial court noted, we examine the totality of the circumstances in order to determine whether a published statement constitutes an opinion protected by the Ohio Constitution. \u201cConsideration of the totality of [the] circumstances * * * involves at least four factors. First is the specific language used, second is whether the statement is verifiable, third is the general context of the statement and fourth is the broader context in which the statement appeared.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>25 Ohio St.3d at 250, 25 OBR at 308, 496 N.E.2d at 706. \u201cThis analysis is not a bright-line test * * *. \u2018[T]he totality of the circumstances test * * * can only be used as a compass to show general direction and not a map to set rigid boundaries.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vail, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 282, 649 N.E.2d at 185, quoting <em>Scott, </em>25 Ohio St.3d at 250, 25 OBR at 308, 496 N.E.2d at 706. See, also, <em>Ollman, </em>750 F.2d 970, 979-984.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The weight given to any one factor under this inquiry will vary depending on the circumstances of each case. <em>Vail, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 282, 649 N.E.2d at 185. \u201cWhile necessarily imperfect, these factors * * * assist in discerning as systematically as possible what constitutes an assertion of fact and what is, in contrast, an expression of opinion.\u201d <em>Ollman, </em>750 F.2d at 979. Application of the four-factor test allows courts to assess, with some degree of predictability, the actionability of those statements that fall on the spectrum somewhere between paradigmatic statements of fact (such as \u201cMr. Jones had ten drinks at his office party and sideswiped two vehicles on his way home\u201d) and paradigmatic statements of opinion (such as \u201cMr. Jones is a despicable politician\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">In his second proposition of law, Wampler submits that the task of distinguishing between statements of fact and opinion \u201cshould remain the province of the jury, subject only to the condition (as in any case) that there must be sufficient evidence to enable a jury to conclude that the challenged statements are false and defamatory.\u201d As Judge Starr noted for the court in <em>Oilman, </em>however, \u201cthe overwhelming weight of <em>post-Gertz </em>authority [holds] that the distinction between opinion and fact is a matter of law. Although the Supreme Court has never directly addressed this issue, the Court has clearly ruled that questions as to other privileges derived from the First Amendment, such as the qualified privilege as to public officials and public figures, are to be decided as matters of law. Moreover, the predictability of decisions, which is of crucial importance in an area of law touching upon First Amendment values, is enhanced when the determination is made according to announced legal standards and when a body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>of public case law furnishes published examples of the manner in which these standards are to be applied.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 978. We agree with the <em>Oilman </em>court that the applicability of the <em>Ollman/Scott/Vail </em>\u201copinion privilege\u201d in a given case is a question of law for the court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The trial court in this case decided, as a matter of law, that the statements contained in Higgins\u2019s letter to the editor were expressions of his opinions, as opposed to statements of fact, and granted summary judgment in favor of Higgins on this basis. We review the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment <em>de novo, Doe v. Shaffer </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 388, 390, 738 N.E.2d 1243, 1245, citing <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241, 245, and apply <em>Scott\u2019s </em>test below. We emphasize that, although we have chosen to assess the four <em>Scott </em>factors in the order they were enumerated in that case, \u201c[w]e do not * * * suggest that the four-factor analysis is to be undertaken in a rigid lock-step fashion.\u201d <em>Ollman, </em>750 F.2d at 980, fn. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">1. The Specific Language Used</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">As Judge Starr noted in <em>Oilman, </em>it is often appropriate to begin an assessment of the totality of the circumstances by analyzing \u201cthe common usage or meaning of the allegedly defamatory words themselves. We seek in this branch of our analysis to determine whether the allegedly defamatory statement has a precise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>meaning and thus is likely to give rise to clear factual implications. A classic example of a statement with a well-defined meaning is an accusation of a crime\u201d (footnotes omitted), <em>Ollman, </em>750 F.2d at 979-980, whereas \u201cstatements that are \u2018loosely definable\u2019 or Variously interpretable\u2019 cannot in most contexts support an action for defamation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 980. \u201cReaders are * * * considerably less likely to infer facts from an indefinite or ambiguous statement than one with a commonly understood meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In <em>Scott, </em>assessing an allegedly defamatory newspaper column concerning a school superintendent\u2019s testimony at a hearing, we found that this factor weighed in favor of actionability. <em>Scott, </em>25 Ohio St.3d at 251, 25 OBR at 309, 496 N.E.2d at 707. Though the column contained no express statement that the superintendent committed perjury at the hearing, we concluded that \u201cthe clear impact in some nine sentences and a caption [was] that appellant \u2018lied at the hearing after * * * having given his solemn oath to tell the truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Though we decided in <em>Scott </em>that the specific language in the column weighed in favor of actionability, we found this factor outweighed by other factors under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 254, 25 OBR at 311, 496 N.E.2d at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Wampler alleged in his complaint that Higgins\u2019s letter to the editor contained two defamatory statements: (1) that Wampler \u201cforced Ms. McKee out of business by charging her an exorbitant rent\u201d and (2) that Wampler was a \u201cruthless speculator.\u201d In Wampler\u2019s memorandum in opposition to summary judgment, he specifically discussed additional statements contained in Higgins\u2019s letter: (1) that Wampler was possessed of \u201cself-centered greed\u201d and (2) that Wampler sold his property \u201cfor an astronomical sum, to a mindless corporation.\u201d The trial court assessed all of these statements in its opinion and order granting summary judgment, deciding that \u201cthe language used by defendant in his letter would be understood by the ordinary reader for just what it is \u2014 one person\u2019s frustration with the perceived plight of many small downtown areas due to small business closures and large corporate takeovers. The letter conjures a vast array of highly emotional responses that will vary from reader to reader. None is similar to the typical examples of punishable criminal or disciplinary conduct * * (quoting <em>Vail, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 283, 649 N.E.2d at 186, without attribution).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">We agree with the trial court that the specific language employed by Higgins in his letter weighs against actionability. Each of the allegedly defamatory statements at issue here resembles the sort of \u201cloosely definable,\u201d \u201cvariously interpretable,\u201d \u201cindefinite,\u201d and \u201cambiguous\u201d statements discussed in <em>Ollman, </em>750 F.2d at 979-980. Though plainly pejorative in tone, with Higgins describing Wampler as a \u201cruthless speculator\u201d possessed of \u201cself-centered greed\u201d charging \u201cexorbitant rent,\u201d these phrases are all inherently imprecise and subject to myriad subjective interpretations. See <em>Vail, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 283, 649 N.E.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>186 (deciding that a columnist\u2019s accusations that a candidate engaged in \u201canti-homosexual diatribe\u201d and fostered homophobia \u201ccan hardly be defined with crystal clarity,\u201d and were \u201cvalue-laden\u201d and \u201csubjective\u201d). Accord <em>Cole v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., Inc. </em>(1982), 386 Mass. 303, 435 N.E.2d 1021 (Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts holding that a statement that a reporter had engaged in \u201csloppy and irresponsible reporting\u201d was too imprecise to support a defamation action); <em>Buckley v. Littell </em>(C.A.2, 1976), 539 F.2d 882 (holding that an accusation that a columnist was a \u201cfellow traveler\u201d of \u201cfascists\u201d was susceptible of widely different interpretations).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">2. Verifiability</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Under <em>Scott\u2019s </em>test, we also assess whether an allegedly defamatory statement is verifiable. <em>Scott, </em>25 Ohio St.3d at 251, 25 OBR at 309, 496 N.E.2d at 707. We seek to determine whether the allegedly defamatory statements are objectively capable of proof or disproof, for \u201ca reader cannot rationally view an unverifiable statement as conveying actual facts.\u201d <em>Ollman, </em>750 F.2d at 981. \u201cAn obvious potential for quashing or muting First Amendment activity looms large when juries attempt to assess the truth of a statement that admits.of no method of verification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 981-982.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">In <em>Scott, </em>this court decided that this factor, like the first, weighed in favor of the plaintiff, for an accusation of perjury was \u201can articulation of an objectively verifiable event\u201d that could be proven \u201cwith evidence adduced from the transcripts and witnesses present at the hearing.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>25 Ohio St.3d at 252, 25 OBR at 309, 496 N.E.2d at 707. Unlike an accusation of perjury, however, which may be subject to proof or disproof upon the application of facts to an accepted legal standard, the allegedly defamatory statements contained in Higgins\u2019s letter to the editor are simply not amenable to verification. Had Higgins falsely stated that Wampler sought to double or triple McKee\u2019s rent, instead of simply describing Wampler\u2019s proposal as \u201cexorbitant,\u201d this factor may have weighed more in Wampler\u2019s favor. Such a statement, after all, might be verified with reference to McKee\u2019s most recent lease agreement, compared with a proposed lease agreement containing a specific price term. But Higgins\u2019s description of Wampler\u2019s proposed rent as \u201cexorbitant,\u201d much like his characterization of Wampler as \u201cruthless,\u201d and his distaste for Wampler\u2019s \u201cfaceless,\u201d \u201cmindless,\u201d or \u201cheartless\u201d corporate vendee, are standardless statements not amenable to objective proof or disproof. See <em>Vail, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 283, 649 N.E.2d at 186 (finding only the columnist\u2019s references to Vail\u2019s honesty to be objectively verifiable). Moreover, unlike the defendant in <em>McKimm, </em>who indicated to readers that \u201cresearch documentation\u201d was available in support of the claims made in his campaign brochure, Higgins provided no supporting references in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>letter for any of the disparaging remarks he directed at Wampler. See <em>McKimm, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 140, 729 N.E.2d at 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">3. General Context</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\"><em>Scott\u2019s </em>totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry also includes two distinct \u201ccontextual\u201d assessments. <em>Scott, </em>25 Ohio St.3d at 252, 25 OBR at 309, 496 N.E.2d at 707. One of these is a consideration of the \u201cimmediate context\u201d in which the allegedly defamatory statement appears. <em>Ollman, </em>750 F.2d at 983. We examine more than simply the alleged defamatory statements in isolation, because the language surrounding the averred defamatory remarks may place the reasonable reader on notice that what is being read is the opinion of the writer. <em>Scott </em>at 252, 25 OBR at 309, 496 N.E.2d at 707. Put another way, as Judge Starr explained in <em>Oilman, </em>courts should assess \u201cthe entire article or column\u201d because \u201cunchallenged language surrounding the allegedly defamatory statement will influence the average reader\u2019s readiness to infer that a particular statement has factual content.\u201d <em>Ollman, </em>750 F.2d at 979. In <em>Ollman, </em>the court examined an allegedly defamatory column by Rowland Evans and Robert Novak in its entirety. The court decided \u2014 with particular emphasis on hypothetical questions contained in the penultimate paragraph \u2014 that the columnists \u201cmeant to <em>ventilate </em>what in their view constituted the central questions\u201d raised by the plaintiffs possible appointment as chair of a faculty department. (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 987.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Considering Higgins\u2019s allegedly defamatory statements in the context of the entire letter, we find that the average reader of the Circleville Herald would be unlikely to infer that those statements were factual. The gist of Higgins\u2019s letter as a whole is that <em>in his opinion, </em>Wampler forced McKee out of business by charging her too much rent, and that Wampler should have negotiated a lower lease agreement with McKee instead of \u201cselling] out\u201d to a corporation with no direct link to Circleville\u2019s unique history. As in <em>Oilman, </em>the letter\u2019s concluding paragraphs, in particular, place the reader on notice that Higgins sought to \u201cventilate\u201d his personal frustrations and opinions concerning the loss of a valued downtown business \u2014 not to set forth any verifiable statements of fact. See <em>Ollman, </em>750 F.2d at 987. Higgins\u2019s penultimate paragraph is a vague polemic, attacking a hypothetical \u201csome\u201d who \u201ccheerfully take the money and run and \u2018let the public be damned!\u2019 \u201d The final paragraph, though addressed specifically to Wampler, implausibly suggests that Wampler would \u201csell the whole town to heartless corporations so that they might turn it into one great, ugly, sprawling shopping mall.\u201d As in <em>Scott, </em>\u201c[w]hile [the defendant\u2019s] mind is certainly made up, the average reader viewing the words in their internal context would be hard pressed to accept [his] statements as * * * impartial reporting.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>25 Ohio St.3d at 253, 25 OBR at 310-311, 496 N.E.2d at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>4. Broader Social Context \u2014 Genre</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">In addition to examining the allegedly defamatory statements as they appear in context, we also examine \u201cthe broader social context into which the statement fits. Some <em>types of writing or speech by custom or convention </em>signal to readers or listeners that what is being read or heard is likely to be opinion, not fact.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Ollman, </em>750 F.2d at 983. This fourth factor focuses, then, not merely on the internal context within which a particular written statement appears, but on the unmistakable influence that certain \u201cwell established <em>genres </em>of writing will have on the average reader.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In <em>Scott, </em>we noted that the allegedly defamatory column about the wrestling coach \u201cappeared on the sports page \u2014 a traditional haven for cajoling, invective, and hyperbole.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>25 Ohio St.3d at 253, 25 OBR at 311, 496 N.E.2d at 708. In both <em>Vail </em>and <em>Ollman, </em>as here, the allegedly defamatory statements appeared in a forum even more traditionally linked to vigorous expressions of opinion regarding matters of public concern \u2014 the newspapers\u2019 <em>opinion </em>pages. See <em>Vail, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 282, 649 N.E.2d at 185 (noting that the column appeared on the Forum page of the newspaper, and that the words \u201cforum\u201d and \u201ccommentary\u201d \u201cconvey a message that the reader of columns so designated will be exposed to the personal opinions of the writer\u201d); <em>Ollman, </em>750 F.2d at 984 (\u201cit is well understood that editorial writers and commentators frequently \u2018resort to the type of caustic bombast traditionally used in editorial writing to stimulate public reaction,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Natl. Rifle Assn. v. Dayton Newspapers, Inc. </em>[S.D. Ohio 1983], 555 F.Supp. 1299, 1309).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">We agree with the court of appeals that because Higgins\u2019s allegedly defamatory statements appeared in a letter to the editor, \u201ca common forum for citizens of the community to express viewpoints on a wide variety of subjects,\u201d this fourth factor also weighs in Higgins\u2019s favor. Letters to the editor, though at times intemperately worded, are integral to the \u201crobust and uninhibited commentary on public issues that is part of our national heritage.\u201d <em>Kotlikoff </em>89 N.J. at 73, 444 A.2d at 1092. The \u201cvituperative wording\u201d of these letters serves to warn readers that, in contrast to the factual news articles appearing elsewhere in the paper, the letters are part of a \u201csocial forum for personal opinion.\u201d <em>Sall v. Barber </em>(Colo.App.1989), 782 P.2d 1216, 1219. As the Court of Appeals of New York has noted, \u201c[t]he public forum function of letters to the editor is closely related in spirit to the \u2018marketplace of ideas\u2019 * * * that' compelled recognition of the privileges of fair comment, fair report and the immunity accorded expression of opinion. These values are best effectuated by according defendant some latitude to publish a letter to the editor on a matter of legitimate public concern * * * free of defamation litigation.\u201d <em>Immuno AG. v. Moor-Jankowski </em>(1991), 77 N.Y.2d 235, 255, 566 N.Y.S.2d 906, 917, 567 N.E.2d 1270, 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>We do not suggest here that publication of defamatory statements in a letter to the editor will insulate the author from liability in every case. See <em>Scott, </em>25 Ohio St.3d at 252-254, 25 OBR at 309-311, 496 N.E.2d at 707-708 (\u201cwe are not persuaded that a bright-line rule of labeling a piece of writing \u2018opinion\u2019 can be a dispositive method of avoiding judicial scrutiny\u201d). See, also, Annotation, Defamation: Publication of \u201cLetter to Editor\u201d in Newspaper as Actionable (1980), 99 A.L.R.3d 573, Section 4. We merely note that it is commonly known that the authors of letters to the editor are normally not engaged in the business of factual reporting or news dissemination, and that their letters qualify as what the <em>Ollman </em>court described as a \u201cwell established <em>genre\u201d </em>of opinionated speech. See <em>Ollman, </em>750 F.2d at 984. For these reasons, like the first three factors of the <em>Scott </em>test, the fourth factor weighs in Higgins\u2019s favor. Under the totality of the circumstances, therefore, we agree with the court of appeals that the allegedly libelous statements contained in Higgins\u2019s letter to the editor are, as a matter of law, nonactionable expressions of Higgins\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Y. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the Ohio Constitution\u2019s separate and independent protection for opinions, recognized in <em>Scott v. News-Herald </em>and reaffirmed in <em>Vail v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co., is </em>not limited in its application to allegedly defamatory statements made by media defendants. A nonmedia defendant whose allegedly defamatory statements appear in a letter to the editor may invoke the same protection, which may or may not apply depending on the totality of the circumstances. Because we agree with the court of appeals that Higgins could invoke the <em>Scott/ Vail </em>test, and that the statements contained in his letter to the editor were, as a matter of law, nonactionable expressions of his opinions, we affirm the court of appeals\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b238-8\">Moyer, C.J., F.E.

In <em>Humphrey v. Lane </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 62, 68, 728 N.E.2d 1039, 1045, this court determined that the Free Exercise Clause contained in Section 7, Article I of the Ohio Constitution was broader than the parallel federal provision, necessitating divergence from the federal test for religiously neutral, evenly applied government actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b225-9\">. Accordingly, -Wampler\u2019s first proposition of law \u2014 \u201cLibelous statements published by a non-media defendant about a private individual are not constitutionally protected under Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution\u201d \u2014 may indeed be an accurate statement of the law in those cases where the allegedly libelous statements are statements of fact under the <em>ScottfVail </em>test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\"><em>. </em>Indeed, in <em>Scott, </em>this court noted that \u201cExpressions of opinion are generally accorded absolute immunity from liability under the First Amendment\u201d without qualification based on the status of the defendant. <em>Scott, </em>25 Ohio St.3d at 250, 25 OBR at 307, 496 N.E.2d at 705, citing, <em>inter alia, Chaves v. Johnson </em>(1985), 230 Va. 112, 119, 335 S.E.2d 97, 102. The <em>Chaves </em>court had decided that an <em>architect\u2019s </em>statements about a competitor were nonactionable statements of his opinions \u2014 the architect\u2019s nonaffiliation with the media notwithstanding. <em>Chaves, </em>230 Va. at 118-119, 335 S.E.2d at 101. <em>Vail\u2019s </em>syllabus and opinion similarly contain no status-based distinction concerning defamation defendants, providing simply that \u201c[w]hen determining whether <em>speech </em>is protected opinion a court must consider the totality of the circumstances\u201d by applying <em>Scott\u2019s </em>test.

By referring here to the <em>\u201cother privileges </em>derived from the First Amendment\u201d (emphasis added), the <em>Ollman </em>court suggests that what it had previously referred to as \u201cprotection\u201d for opinions, see <em>id. </em>at 975 (\u201cabsolute First Amendment protection\u201d), <em>id., </em>750 F.2d at 975, fn. 7 (\u201cabsolute, constitutionally based protection\u201d) operates, procedurally, as a <em>privilege. </em>See, also, <em>id. </em>at 984 (again referring to the \u201cFirst Amendment\u2019s opinion privilege\u201d). Our majority opinion in <em>Vail </em>never expressly describes the Ohio Constitution\u2019s \u201cseparate and independent guarantee of protection for opinion\u201d as a <em>privilege, </em>though some appellate courts, including the court below, subsequently described it as such. See, <em>e.g., Conese, </em>131 Ohio App.3d at 315-316, 722 N.E.2d at 546; <em>Wampler v. Higgins </em>(May 31, 2000), Pickaway App. No. 2000 CA 5, unreported, 2000 WL 730218, *6; <em>Sovchik v.

The term \u201cprivilege\u201d commonly encompasses <em>affirmative defenses </em>by which a defendant \u201cacknowledges at least part of the conduct complained of but asserts that the defendant\u2019s conduct was authorized or sanctioned by law.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7 Ed.1999) 1215. In this sense, a privilege operates as a legal justification or excuse for admittedly tortious conduct. <em>Id. </em>For the sake of clarity, however, we note that a defendant\u2019s attempt to invoke Ohio\u2019s \u201cseparate and independent guarantee of protection\u201d for opinions may also be proper in the context of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), as was the procedural context in <em>Vail, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 283, 649 N.E.2d at 186 (noting the necessity of construing, under Civ.R. 12[B][6], all inferences in the plaintiffs favor). This approach is justified because one of the elements of a private figure\u2019s cause of action in defamation is a false statement, <em>Davis v. Jacobs </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 580, 710 N.E.2d 1185, and a statement deemed to be an opinion as a matter of law cannot be proven false. See <em>Ollman, </em>750 F.2d at 976.

Plain Dealer Publishing Co. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 279, 285-287, 649 N.E.2d 182, 187-189 (Pfeifer, J., concurring in judgment only), that the Ohio Constitution does not create an additional, separate constitutional privilege for opinion. Instead we should look at whether the statements made are provably false or whether the statements can be reasonably interpreted as stating actual facts about an individual. <em>Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co. </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 1, 19-20, 110 S.Ct. 2695, 2706, 111 L.Ed.2d 1, 18-19. In this case, I believe that there are enough statements within Higgins\u2019s hyperbole that either are provable as false or could be interpreted as stating actual facts about Wampler that Wampler should have survived summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In the end, Wampler may have suffered a few dollars worth of damages \u2014 or whatever the going rate is for an apology.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
