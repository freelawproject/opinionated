The court of appeals affirmed his convictions and sentence. <em>State v. Carter </em>(Nov. 3, 1993), Hamilton App. No. C-920604, unreported, 1993 WL 512859. We also affirmed Carter\u2019s convictions and death sentence. <em>State v. Carter </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 651 N.E.2d 965, certiorari denied (1995), 516 U.S. 1014, 116 S.Ct. 575, 133 L.Ed.2d 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">Subsequently, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to deny Carter\u2019s petition for postconviction relief. <em>State v. Carter </em>(Nov. 14, 1997), Hamilton App. No. C-960718, unreported, 1997 WL 705487. We refused to accept Carter\u2019s appeal of that decision. <em>State v. Carter </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 1467, 690 N.E.2d 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-14\">On June 9, 1999, Carter filed an application with the court of appeals to reopen his initial appeal pursuant to App.R. 26(B) and <em>State v. Murnahan </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 60, 584 N.E.2d 1204, alleging ineffective assistance of his appellate counsel before the court of appeals in his first appeal. However, the court of appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>denied Carter\u2019s application because he had failed to show good cause for the delay in applying to reopen his appeal. <em>State v. Carter </em>(Oct. 21, 1999), Hamilton App. No. C-920604, unreported. Carter did not appeal that decision; hence, that decision became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">On July 19, 2000, Carter requested that the court of appeals appoint counsel for him to prepare and file an application to reopen his direct appeal pursuant to App.R. 26(B). The court of appeals denied Carter\u2019s motion. <em>State v. Carter </em>(Aug. 10, 2000), Hamilton App. No. C-920604, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">On September 28, 2000, Carter\u2019s present counsel filed a second application to reopen his initial appeal pursuant to App.R. 26(B) and <em>State v. Murnahan. </em>The court of appeals denied Carter\u2019s motion to reopen his direct appeal on the basis that App.R. 26(B) \u201cmakes no provision for filing successive applications to reopen.\u201d <em>State v. Carter </em>(Apr. 9, 2001), Hamilton App. No. C-920604, unreported. The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Carter raises five issues in this appeal. In his second proposition, Carter argues that his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to file an appeal to this court, following the court of appeals\u2019 dismissal of his first application to reopen his direct appeal pursuant to App.R. 26(B), constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. However, Carter had no constitutional right to counsel to pursue an appeal to this court following the court of appeals\u2019 denial of his application under App.R. 26(B). <em>State v. Buell </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 1211, 639 N.E.2d 110. Therefore, Carter could not be unconstitutionally deprived of the effective assistance of counsel by his counsel\u2019s failure to file such an appeal. <em>Wainwright v. Torna </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 586, 587-588, 102 S.Ct. 1300, 1301, 71 L.Ed.2d 475, 477-478.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">For the same reason, Carter cannot complain about the court of appeals\u2019 refusal to appoint new counsel to pursue that appeal as he argues in his first proposition. \u201c \u2018[T]he right to appointed counsel extends to the <em>first </em>appeal as of right, <em>and no </em>further.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)\u201d <em>State v. Buell, </em>70 Ohio St.3d 1211, 639 N.E.2d 110, quoting <em>Pennsylvania v. Finley </em>(1987), 481 U.S. 551, 555, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 1993, 95 L.Ed.2d 539, 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">In his third proposition, Carter argues that he established \u201cgood cause\u201d for his failure to file a timely application pursuant to App.R. 26(B). However, the court of appeals dismissed Carter\u2019s first application to reopen his direct appeal, finding no good cause. No appeal was made of that decision. Thus, Carter\u2019s second application to reopen his direct appeal pursuant to App.R. 26(B) is foreclosed by the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>See <em>State v. Bell </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 32, 34, 652 N.E.2d 191, 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">Carter\u2019s fourth and fifth propositions relate to the merits of issues that he claims his former appellate lawyers should have raised.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Carter claims that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>appellate counsel were constitutionally ineffective because they failed to raise twenty-six specific assignments of error on his direct appeal before the court of appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since we have found his successive petition to be barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>we need not consider those issues.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Akz\"><em>Michael K.
