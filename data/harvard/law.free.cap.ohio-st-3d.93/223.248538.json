Dazier was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\u201cCOPD\u201d) on June 8, 1993. For thirty years prior, he was exposed to dust as a rock crusher. He also smoked at least two packs of cigarettes a day for forty to forty-five years. Prior to 1993, Dazier additionally suffered from diabetes, hypertension, gout, and ischemic heart disease. He underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery in 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Shortly after COPD was diagnosed, Dazier filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim seeking allowance of that condition. His claim was allowed for that condition only.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">On April 28, 1995, Dazier filed an application for the determination of his percentage of permanent partial disability (\u201cPPD\u201d) with appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio. He filed no medical evidence in support of his application. On July 27, 1995, he was examined by Dr. Prakash C. Goyal for appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio. In a report issued October 6, 1995, Dr. Goyal wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\"><em>\u201cDiscussion and </em>Opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u201cThe claimant suffers from:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">\u201c1) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, far advanced, with respiratory failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">\u201c2) Ischemic heart disease with a congestive cardiac failure, status post coronary bypass graft surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">\u201c3) Diabetes mellitus.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">\u201cHe has end stage disease process. There is no chance of recovery or going back to work. It is difficult, at this stage, to differentiate how much is due to the impact of his work as a rock crusher, smoking or ischemic heart disease. He has a severe impairment of the whole person. That is, 100% * *</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">On February 21, 1996, the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation mailed a tentative order awarding Dazier a one hundred percent permanent partial impairment. However, apparently, unknown to the bureau, Dazier had died on August 26, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">Dazier\u2019s employer, Dravo Basic Materials Company, Inc., filed a timely objection to the bureau\u2019s order. Two days later, his widow-claimant, Juanita, appellant herein, filed a C-6 \u201cApplication for Payment of Compensation Accrued at Time of Death,\u201d seeking payment of the PPD award.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">Several administrative hearings followed. A district hearing officer ultimately denied the C-6, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-15\">\u201cPursuant to R.C. 4123.57, the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation\u2019s tentative order dated 2/21/96 did not take effect because of the objection filed by the employer on 3/12/96. Because the tentative order did not take effect, neither R.C. 4123.57(A) nor R.C. 4123.60 operates to authorize compensation after the claimant\u2019s death because each section refers to an award that has \u2018been made.\u2019 The District Hearing Officer finds that an award had not been made prior to the claimant\u2019s death because of the employer\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\u201cR.C. 4123.60 also permits an award of compensation after a claimant\u2019s death where the claimant was lawfully entitled to apply for an award and the District Hearing Officer finds evidence in file to warrant an award. However, the District Hearing Officer finds that Dr. Goyal\u2019s 7/27/95 report considers non-allowed conditions and cannot be relied on to award compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">A staff hearing officer modified the order in part, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\u201cThe Staff Hearing Officer finds that Prakash Goyal, M.D., examined the claimant on 07/27/95 and submitted a medical report dated 10/06/95. Dr. Goyal\u2019s report, which states that claimant has a 100% impairment, takes into consideration the non-allowed conditions of Ischemic heart disease with congestive cardiac failure and diabetes mellitus.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\u201cThe Staff Hearing Officer further finds that Dr. Goyal does not relate a Percentage of Permanent Partial Impairment to the allowed condition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">\u201cSince Dr. Goyal\u2019s 10/06/95 report and opinion considers non-allowed conditions[,] said report does not constitute competent medical evidence upon which an award of Permanent Partial Disability or other compensation could be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">\u201cTherefore, the claimant\u2019s C-6 Application is denied and [the] order of the District Hearing Officer is affirmed in all other respects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Further appeal was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">The widow-claimant filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging that the commission abused its discretion in denying her application for accrued compensation. The appellate court disagreed, finding that because (1) Dr. Goyal\u2019s report was not \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting an award and (2), as found by the magistrate, there was no other medical evidence of record, there was simply no evidence upon which an award could be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">This is a tragic situation, but it is one that could have been easily avoided. Contrary to the tenor of the widow-claimant\u2019s brief, the chief impediment to compensation is not statutory, it is evidentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">The widow-claimant left herself in an untenable position when neither she nor her decedent, while he was still alive, submitted any medical evidence in support of the PPD application. This left the couple wholly dependent on the commission doctor\u2019s report. When that report, in turn, proved insufficient \u2014 and decedent was already gone \u2014 the widow-claimant was effectively left with no supporting medical evidence and no way of obtaining any.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-15\">The problem with Dr. Goyal\u2019s report is his failure to estimate a percentage of permanent partial impairment or whole body impairment attributable to the COPD. His assessment of a one-hundred-percent impairment impermissibly took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>into account several nonallowed conditions \u2014 conditions which, according to the death certificate \u2014 clearly contributed to decedent\u2019s death. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Waddle v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 452, 619 N.E.2d 1018. Consequently, the one-hundred-percent figure could not form the basis of an award, and there was no other percentage figure that could be used, because there was no other medical evidence.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A_Sz\"><em>Kondritzer, Gold, Frank &amp; Crowley Co., L.P.A., </em>and <em>Mark R.
