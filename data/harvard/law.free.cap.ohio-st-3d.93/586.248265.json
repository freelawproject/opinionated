The Marshal is to present the log sheets at each council meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">\u00abH* H\u00ed ^</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">\u201cg) There will be a patrol log of every officer on duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">\u00abHi Hi Hi</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">\u201ck) There is to be more patrolling of the Village and each auxiliary shall perform at least fifteen (15) hours a month in the Village and J\u00e9 of those hours to be foot patrol. The Marshal shall perform at least J\u00e9 of his schedule on foot patrol. All hours will be logged.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">\u00abHi Hi Hi</p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">\u201ct) All log sheets will be brought to council meetings for review by council members. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b693-14\">\u00abHi Hi H\u00ab</p>\n<p id=\"b693-15\">\u201cx) The Marshal will keep all records of the officers on duty, and make them available to council as requested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-16\">Relator, Brenda Kim, a village council member since March 2001, had requested these records from respondent, Village Marshal Charles Wachenschwanz, as well as from other village officials, on several occasions, but despite the village solicitor\u2019s advice, they failed to produce these records.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-17\">By letter dated May 30, 2001, Kim requested that Wachenschwanz provide her with access to the following records: (1) logbooks of all Chauncey police personnel from January 1, 2001 through May 30, 2001; (2) time sheets of all Chauncey police personnel from January 1, 2001 through May 30, 2001; and (3) Wachenschwanz\u2019s police report concerning a theft that had occurred at Kim\u2019s home and had been reported by her on June 15, 2000. Wachenschwanz denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-18\">On June 26, 2001, Kim filed a complaint in this court for a writ of mandamus to compel Wachenschwanz to provide her with access to the requested records. Kim also requests reasonable attorney fees. Despite being served with a copy of the complaint, Wachenschwanz failed to file a timely response to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>This cause is now before the court for its determination under S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">We must now determine whether dismissal, an alternative writ, or a peremptory writ is appropriate. S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5); <em>State ex rel. Crobaugh v. White </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 470, 471, 746 N.E.2d 1120, 1122. If it appears beyond doubt that relator is entitled to the requested extraordinary relief, a peremptory writ should issue. <em>State ex rel. DeBrosse v. Cool </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 716 N.E.2d 1114, 1116.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Wachenschwanz was served with a copy of the complaint on July 2, but he failed to file a response within twenty-one days of service, <em>i.e., </em>by July 23, as required by S.Ct-Prac.R. X(5). In deciding whether Kim is entitled to the requested writ, we must look \u201cbeyond the simple admissions resulting from a failure to serve a responsive pleading.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Shimola v. Cleveland </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 110, 112, 637 N.E.2d 325, 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Here, however, like the relator in <em>State ex rel. Youngstown City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Youngstown </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 51, 53, 701 N.E.2d 986, 988, Kim established her right to a writ of mandamus to compel access to the requested records by satisfactory evidence. Attached to her complaint is an affidavit specifying that she requested public records and that Wachenschwanz refused access to those records.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">Under Chauncey Ordinance No. 10-19-99, the log sheets referring to time on duty and mileage used by police personnel are public records that must be presented at each council meeting. In addition, under the ordinance, the patrol log sheets are reviewed by council members at the meetings. Further, there is nothing to counter Kim\u2019s evidence that the police report concerning a theft that had occurred at her home was a public record. In sum, the log sheets, time sheets, and police report appear to be comparable to routine offense and incident reports, which are subject to immediate release upon request. See <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Maurer </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 54, 57, 741 N.E.2d 511, 514; <em>State ex rel. Steckman v. Jackson </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 420, 639 N.E.2d 83, paragraph five of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">Notably, Wachenschwanz has evidently never asserted any exemption from disclosure when denying Kim\u2019s records requests, and he also did not file anything in response to Kim\u2019s mandamus action. \u201c \u2018Exemptions from disclosure must be strictly construed against the public records custodian, and the custodian has the burden to establish an exemption.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Youngstown City School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 53, 701 N.E.2d at 988, quoting <em>State ex rel. Gannett Satellite Info. Network, Inc. v. Petro </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 261, 266, 685 N.E.2d 1223, 1228.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AoKC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>Murray Murphy Moul &amp; Basil, LLP, </em>and <em>Geoffrey J. Moul; Equal Justice Foundation </em>and <em>Gary Smith, </em>for relator.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Based on the foregoing, Kim is entitled to a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel Wachenschwanz to provide her with access to all of the requested records.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">In addition, she is entitled to an award of attorney fees. She has established a sufficient public benefit by access to the requested records, which may result in Wachenschwanz\u2019s abiding by the terms of both R.C. 149.43 and Ordinance No. 10-19-99 of the village of Chauncey in the future. And Wachenschwanz failed to comply with Kim\u2019s requests for records and failed to specify any reasons justifying his noncompliance. <em>State ex rel. Youngstown City School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 54, 701 N.E.2d at 988; <em>State ex rel. Dillery v. Icsman </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 312, 317, 750 N.E.2d 156, 162. Wachenschwanz also did not file anything in opposition to Kim\u2019s mandamus action or her request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Accordingly, we grant the peremptory writ of mandamus and award attorney fees. We order Kim\u2019s attorneys to submit a bill and documentation in support of attorney fees in accordance with DR 2-106(A) and (B). Kim\u2019s counsel are also ordered to submit evidence, preferably including affidavits and a copy of any written fee agreement entered into with Kim, specifying the attorney fees that she actually paid or is obligated to pay her attorneys for this mandamus action. See <em>State ex rel. Calvary v. Upper Arlington </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 1415, 735 N.E.2d 455, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">\n<em>Writ granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b695-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
