Alex died as a result of \u201cshaken baby syndrome.\u201d In <em>State v. Reiner </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 342, 343-345, 731 N.E.2d 662, 666-667, the court set forth the underlying facts of this case:</p>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">\u201cOn June 15,1995, Deborah S. Reiner gave birth to twin boys named Alex and Derek. Both boys were premature at birth but otherwise healthy. The Reiners also had a two-year-old daughter named Amy. Following the birth of the twins, both parents took time off from work to care for them. Matthew Reiner took leave from his job as an engineer from June 15 to July 25, 1995. Deborah Reiner, a dentist, did not return to work until August 14,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-15\">\u201cThe Reiners hired a full-time babysitter, Susan Batt, age twenty-four, to care for their three children. Susan Batt began working on July 25, 1995, under Deborah Reiner\u2019s supervision while Susan Batt became acclimated to the family. During the first week of Susan Batt\u2019s employment, Deborah Reiner spent most of her time at home. In the final two weeks before Deborah Reiner returned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>work, she left the home on several occasions with Amy, leaving Susan Batt alone with the twins. Susan Batt became the full-time exclusive childcare provider on August 14,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">\u201cOver a period of two weeks, the following events occurred. Aex became ill the weekend of August 12, 1995. He appeared to be achy and vomited several times. Deborah Reiner called the pediatrician and then took Aex to an outpatient clinic on Sunday, August 13. The clinic doctor diagnosed stomach flu and recommended that Deborah Reiner give Aex Pedialyte.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">\u201cBy Wednesday, August 16, 1995, Aex had improved and appeared to have recovered. The twins\u2019 pediatrician performed a well-care examination of both boys that day. The results were unremarkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">\u201cDeborah Reiner stayed home with the children on Wednesday, August 23, 1995, her regular day off. Aex seemed achy that day but had no fever. On Thursday, August 24, 1995, Susan Batt telephoned Matthew Reiner at work and reported that Aex had vomited in the morning. He told her to give Aex some Pedialyte. On Friday, August 25, Susan Batt telephoned Deborah Reiner at work to report that Aex had vomited. Deborah Reiner\u2019s mother came over Friday afternoon to help care for the children. Aex remained ill and vomiting over the weekend, still with no fever.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">\u201cOn Monday, August 28, 1995, when Deborah Reiner returned home after work, Susan Batt reported that Aex had eaten well and taken two five-hour naps that day. He appeared achy but did not have a fever, and Susan Batt had given him Tylenol. Susan Batt left the Reiners that evening between 5:30 and 6:00 p.m. Later that evening, Deborah Reiner\u2019s parents stopped by to drop off Amy, who had spent the day with them. They stayed and visited until 7:30 p.m. when Matthew Reiner arrived home.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">\u201cAex vomited again that evening at 9:00 p.m. The couple put the twins to bed at approximately 10:30 that night. Later, they heard Aex whimpering. Matthew Reiner took Aex downstairs. He claimed that he laid Aex on his (Matthew\u2019s) chest to try to get the baby comfortable and to fall asleep. Within a half hour, Aex\u2019s breathing became labored and he became unresponsive. Matthew Reiner took Aex to his bedroom to awaken his wife. She could not get Aex to respond, so Matthew Reiner called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">\u201cWhen emergency personnel arrived, Aex had no pulse and was not breathing. His skin was blue. They transported Aex to a nearby hospital, where he was placed on a respirator. Two days later, on August 30, 1995, Aex was removed from life support and died.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">\u201cDr. James Patrick, Lucas County Coroner, performed an autopsy. He concluded that Aex had died from \u2018shaken baby syndrome.\u2019 Dr. Patrick estimat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>ed that the time of injury was the evening of Monday, August 28, 1995, most likely within minutes of the onset of respiratory arrest when Matthew Reiner had been alone with Alex, but at most, within two to three hours of the onset.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">\u201cA grand jury indicted Matthew Reiner for involuntary manslaughter. The case proceeded to trial. The key issue at trial was the timing of the fatal trauma to Alex. The defense theory was that Susan Batt, not Matthew Reiner, was the culpable party. The defense presented evidence that all three Reiner children had been healthy from birth until the weekend of August 11, 1995, after Susan Batt became employed. Deborah Reiner testified that her children had no medical problems from the time of Alex\u2019s death until the trial, after Susan Batt left the Reiners\u2019 employ. Deborah Reiner also testified that no other family members had contracted a stomach virus or suffered symptoms similar to Alex\u2019s during the last two weeks of August despite their close proximity to Alex, in particular his twin, Derek, who slept in the same crib. There also was evidence of additional injuries to Alex and injuries to Derek. A hospital radiologist testified that x-ray films of Alex taken at the hospital on August 29, 1995, indicated a broken rib and broken leg. Subsequent x-rays of Derek indicated that he suffered from three broken ribs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The Reiners\u2019 babysitter, Susan Batt, was subpoenaed by both the prosecution and the defense. Upon advice of counsel, she invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused to testify. She had also invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege while testifying in the juvenile court proceeding. Batt\u2019s counsel informed the court that she would not testify unless granted full immunity from prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">The prosecutor acknowledged that Batt was not the subject of any criminal investigation. The prosecutor questioned whether a grant of immunity was applicable in this case, since during the investigation Batt had clearly indicated she lacked culpability. Nevertheless, Batt\u2019s counsel insisted that Batt would assert her Fifth Amendment rights if called to testify by either the prosecution or the defense. Consequently, the prosecution requested that the court grant Susan Batt transactional immunity pursuant to R.C. 2945.44 and compel her to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">The court heard arguments from the defense, as well as from counsel for Deborah Reiner and the guardian <em>ad litem, </em>for the Reiners\u2019 children that a grant of immunity to Batt would not further the administration of justice. The court, however, decided that Batt\u2019s testimony should be available and granted her transactional immunity. Susan Batt subsequently testified and denied all culpability. She explained to the jury that she had refused to answer questions without a grant of immunity upon the advice of counsel although she had done nothing wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>On September 23, 1996, a jury convicted Matthew Reiner of involuntary manslaughter. Matthew Reiner appealed his conviction to the Lucas County Court of Appeals. The appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of transactional immunity to Susan Batt. <em>State v. Reiner </em>(Dec. 18, 1998), Lucas App. No. L-97-1002, unreported, 1998 WL 879833.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\"><em>State v. Reiner </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 342, 731 N.E.2d 662 <em>(\u201cReiner F), </em>affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the trial court for a new trial consistent with the court\u2019s opinion. <em>Reiner I </em>concluded that the trial court had wrongfully granted immunity to Susan Batt. <em>Reiner I </em>held that the grant of immunity was unlawful because Batt lacked a valid Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and it seriously prejudiced the rights of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 355, 731 N.E.2d at 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The United States Supreme Court reversed <em>Reiner I </em>to the extent that the opinion held that Batt lacked a valid Fifth Amendment privilege. <em>Ohio v. Reiner </em>(2001), 532 U.S. 17, 121 S.Ct. 1252, 149 L.Ed.2d 158. The United States Supreme Court held that Batt had \u201creasonable cause\u201d to apprehend danger from her answers if questioned at trial, although she denied any involvement in the abuse of the Reiner children. <em>Id. </em>at-, 121 S.Ct. at 1255, 149 L.Ed.2d at 162-163. The court reasoned that Batt spent extended periods of time alone with Alex in the weeks before his death. She was with him within the potential time frame of the fatal trauma. The defense theory was that Batt was responsible for the baby\u2019s death. Under these circumstances, it was reasonable for Batt to fear that her answers to some questions might tend to incriminate her. The Supreme Court stated, \u201cWe do not, of course, address the question whether immunity from suit under \u00a7 2945.44 was appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 121 S.Ct. at 1255, 149 L.Ed.2d at 163. The Supreme Court then remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">Pursuant to <em>Ohio v. Reiner, </em>we reverse <em>Reiner I </em>to the extent that it held that Batt lacked a valid Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Nevertheless, we affirm our decision in <em>Reiner I </em>that the grant of immunity to Batt resulted in serious prejudice to the defendant and did not further the administration of justice. R.C. 2945.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">Immunity is a prosecutorial tool utilized to fulfill the government\u2019s need for testimony. <em>State ex rel. Leis v. Outcalt </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 147, 149, 1 OBR 181, 183, 438 N.E.2d 443, 446. The government typically requests that immunity be granted to a witness who is culpable to some extent but whose testimony will also implicate a defendant. Usually the witness\u2019s involvement in the situation is of a lesser nature. The government is willing to forgo prosecution of the less culpable witness in order to obtain testimony that is necessary to successfully prosecute the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Here, the prosecution did not have two potentially culpable persons. Instead, this was an either/or situation. Either Reiner was guilty or Susan Batt was guilty. The government chose to indict Reiner and claimed that there was insufficient evidence to indict Batt. Batt continually claimed her innocence. However, immunity is not appropriate in the either/or situation; it could actually hinder the search for truth. The jury should have been permitted to hear Batt take the Fifth Amendment and to evaluate her testimony on that basis. The defense would have been able to present its theory of the babysitter\u2019s culpability without the court\u2019s giving the jury the impression that Batt was immune from prosecution because she did not commit the crime. Therefore, it did not further the administration of justice when the trial court agreed to grant her immunity from future prosecution. Instead, it severely prejudiced the rights of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Therefore, we reverse our holding that Susan Batt lacked a valid Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination; however, we affirm our holding that the trial court\u2019s grant of immunity severely prejudiced the rights of the defendant and did not further the administration of justice. Should the state retry the defendant, Batt may assert her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b711-8\">Douglas and F.E.

In <em>State v. Reiner </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 342, 731 N.E.2d 662 <em>(\u201cReiner </em>/\u201d), a majority of this court reversed Reiner\u2019s conviction based on a belief that the trial court should not have granted transactional immunity to Susan Batt in order to compel her testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 352-356, 731 N.E.2d at 673-676. Because Batt had consistently denied culpability for Alex Reiner\u2019s death, the <em>Reiner I </em>majority held that Batt lacked a valid Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and was therefore not entitled to immunity under R.C. 2945.44. <em>Id. </em>at 354, 731 N.E.2d at 674. The United States Supreme Court reversed <em>Reiner </em>7 in a terse <em>per curiam </em>opinion that reiterated a longstanding principle of constitutional law: the Fifth Amendment protects the innocent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>guilty alike. <em>Ohio v. Reiner </em>(2001), 532 U.S. 17,-, 121 S.Ct. 1252, 1254, 149 L.Ed.2d 158, 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Faced with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s reversal, this court has no choice but to recognize the validity of Batt\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Nevertheless, today\u2019s majority offers yet another rationale for reversing Reiner\u2019s conviction. Specifically, the majority holds that the trial court erred in granting Batt transactional immunity as a matter of Ohio law because the grant of immunity \u201cdid not further the administration of justice\u201d and \u201cseverely prejudiced the rights of the defendant.\u201d The majority further opines that in this type of case \u2014 an \u201ceither/or situation,\u201d to use the majority\u2019s phrasing \u2014 immunity is an inappropriate obstacle to the \u201csearch for truth.\u201d For the reasons that follow, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">A trial court may not grant immunity under R.C. 2945.44 unless (1) the witness refuses to testify based on the privilege against self-incrimination, (2) the prosecutor makes a written request to order the witness to answer, and (3) the court informs the witness that he or she will receive transactional immunity. <em>State ex rel. Koren v. Grogan </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 590, 592, 629 N.E.2d 446, 448. Even if these three requirements are satisfied, the trial court may decline to grant immunity if \u201cit finds that to do so would not further the administration of justice.\u201d R.C. 2945.44(A); see, also, <em>State ex rel. Leis v. Outcalt </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 147, 149, 1 OBR 181, 183, 438 N.E.2d 443, 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">The majority concludes that the grant of immunity in this case did not \u201cfurther the administration of justice\u201d and was therefore unlawful. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Reiner ever had standing to challenge the grant of immunity to Batt (on this or any other basis), the majority\u2019s holding is inherently suspect for its failure to acknowledge our deferential standard for reviewing such determinations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>decision whether a grant of immunity would further the administration of justice lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State ex rel. Ney v. Niehaus </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 118, 119, 515 N.E.2d 914, 916. Accordingly, a reviewing court must not disturb the trial court\u2019s decision on this issue absent an abuse of discretion. See <em>id.; State v. Tomlinson </em>(1997), 125 Ohio App.3d 13, 18, 707 N.E.2d 955, 958. When applying this standard of review, an appellate court is not free to substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. <em>Berk v. Matthews </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 161, 169, 559 N.E.2d 1301, 1308. Rather, reversal on appeal is warranted only when the trial court has exercised its discretion unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 173, 404 NE.2d 144, 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">With today\u2019s decision, the majority implicitly holds that the trial court acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably in granting immunity to Batt. But the record reveals anything but an abuse of discretion. Before deciding to grant immunity to Batt, the trial court heard extensive argument from the parties about whether immunity would further the administration of justice. The trial court also allowed (over the state\u2019s objection) the Reiner children\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>and counsel representing Reiner\u2019s wife to offer their arguments opposing immunity for Batt. After hearing all of the arguments, the trial court concluded that the interests of justice were better served by granting R.C. 2945.44 immunity and compelling Batt\u2019s testimony. Although it recognized that this decision foreclosed any future prosecution of Batt for Alex Reiner\u2019s death, the trial court expressly focused its interests-of-justice inquiry on the \u201cinterests of this trial, this defendant and this prosecution.\u201d In the trial court\u2019s estimation, those interests demanded that the state be able to present \u201cthe testimony of one familiar with facts surrounding and preceding the incident,\u201d subject to full cross-examination and penalty for perjury. In other words, Batt\u2019s testimony furthered the administration of justice by aiding the jury\u2019s search for the truth about Reiner\u2019s guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>The majority cites nothing inherently unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable about the trial court\u2019s method of deciding whether to grant transactional immunity to Batt under R.C. 2945.44. While it is true that the grant of immunity to compel Batt\u2019s testimony could have resulted in a cruel twist of fate \u2014 Batt could have conceivably exculpated Reiner and inculpated herself without risk of being prosecuted \u2014 the trial court was not required to second-guess the prosecutor\u2019s discretionary decision to take that risk. See <em>United States v. Doe </em>(1984), 465 U.S. 605, 616, 104 S.Ct. 1237, 1244, 79 L.Ed.2d 552, 562-563 (noting that the decision to seek immunity \u201cnecessarily involves a balancing of the Government\u2019s interest in obtaining information against the risk that immunity will frustrate the Government\u2019s attempts to prosecute the subject of the investigation\u201d). The trial court acted well within its discretion in placing the interests of Reiner\u2019s trial at the forefront of its analysis. In finding otherwise, the majority simply substitutes its judgment for that of the trial court on the question of whether Batt\u2019s immunity furthered the administration of justice \u2014 a decidedly inappropriate approach for an appellate court reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision under an abuse-of-discretion standard. See <em>Davis v. Flickinger </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 415, 421, 674 N.E.2d 1159, 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Even if it were appropriate to utilize a less deferential standard of review, the majority fails to provide a sound explanation of why it believes the trial court acted improperly by granting immunity to Batt. According to the majority, the grant of immunity in a case such as this one (the so-called \u201ceither/or situation\u201d) \u201ccould actually hinder the search for truth.\u201d Under the majority\u2019s reasoning, the search for truth is better served by having a witness invoke his or her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and <em>not testify at all. </em>This view is dubious in that it ignores the effect of a trial court\u2019s grant of immunity to a witness under R.C. 2945.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">When the trial court grants immunity to a witness under R.C. 2945.44, the witness may no longer assert the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination; the trial court may validly compel testimony on matters that could have potentially incriminated the witness absent the grant of immunity. See, generally, <em>Kastigar v. United States </em>(1972), 406 U.S. 441, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212. A grant of immunity thus <em>facilitates </em>the search for truth by allowing the jury to hear testimony from a witness who would otherwise refuse to testify based on the Fifth Amendment privilege. Moreover, a grant of immunity guarantees that a witness will be subject to cross-examination, \u201c \u2018the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>California v. Green </em>(1970), 399 U.S. 149, 158, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 1935, 26 L.Ed.2d 489, 497, quoting 5 Wigmore, Evidence (3 Ed.1940), Section 1367. It is for these very reasons that immunity statutes such as R.C. 2945.44 are \u201cessential to the effective enforcement\u201d of criminal laws and \u201c \u2018part of our constitutional fabric.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kastigar, </em>406 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>U.S. at 447, 92 S.Ct. at 1658, 32 L.Ed.2d at 218, quoting <em>Ullmann v. United States </em>(1956), 350 U.S. 422, 438, 76 S.Ct. 497, 506, 100 L.Ed. 511, 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The majority fails to recognize the important and beneficial consequences of a grant of immunity and instead embraces a puzzling theory. Today\u2019s decision essentially takes the view that no testimony whatsoever (ie., when a witness invokes the Fifth Amendment) serves the search for truth better than full testimony subject to searching cross-examination (ie., when the witness is granted immunity), at least in the so-called \u201ceither/or\u201d situations. The majority\u2019s conclusion is all the more perplexing given its own recognition in this case that \u201c[t]o \u2018further the administration of justice,\u2019 the jury should have been able to hear and evaluate all the evidence to decide whether someone other than Matthew Reiner was responsible for Alex\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Reiner I, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 356, 731 N.E.2d at 675. Despite the trial court\u2019s allowing the jury that very opportunity by compelling Batt\u2019s testimony under a grant of immunity, the majority curiously concludes that immunity somehow prejudiced Reiner\u2019s rights by impeding the search for truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The majority further supports its holding with the notion that Batt\u2019s immunity gave \u201cthe jury the impression that Batt was immune from prosecution because she did not commit the crime.\u201d The interests of justice would have been better served, in the majority\u2019s estimation, if the trial court had permitted the jury to \u201chear Batt take the Fifth Amendment and to evaluate her testimony on that basis.\u201d As a general proposition, however, the majority\u2019s analysis is questionable at best. It is unclear how a trial court\u2019s grant of immunity, in any situation, would give the jury an impression of the witness\u2019s innocence. A jury could \u2014 and more likely would \u2014 infer that a witness who is testifying under a grant of immunity was potentially culpable of some offense relating to the subject matter of his or her testimony. Indeed, the very existence of immunity statutes \u201creflects the importance of testimony, and the fact that many offenses are of such a character that the only persons capable of giving useful testimony are those implicated in the crime.\u201d <em>Kastigar, </em>406 U.S. at 446, 92 S.Ct. at 1657, 32 L.Ed.2d at 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Moreover, the majority\u2019s view that the grant of immunity to Batt somehow acted as a declaration of her innocence fails to find support in the trial record. While Batt was on the witness stand, counsel for both parties repeatedly referred to Batt\u2019s having received immunity after having invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. On one occasion, the jury heard Reiner\u2019s counsel impeach Batt with the fact that she refused to testify until she received immunity:</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">\u201cQ [by Reiner\u2019s counsel] Miss Batt, is it true that as late as yesterday morning you refused in this courtroom, where you were sitting then where you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>are now, to testify as a witness in this case pursuant to subpoena unless and until the State of Ohio through an Order of Her Honor, Judge Lanzinger, granted you immunity from prosecution for any criminal act or acts committed against any one or more of the Reiner children * * *?</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AKM\"><em>Julia R.

Thus, the jury learned (1) that Batt had invoked the Fifth Amendment in two different court proceedings relating to Alex\u2019s death and (2) that Batt had refused to testify at Reiner\u2019s trial until guaranteed immunity from prosecution. Given all the jury heard about the circumstances surrounding Batt\u2019s testimony, the majority\u2019s belief that the trial court somehow gave \u201cthe impression that Batt was immune from prosecution because she did not commit the crime\u201d is profoundly misguided.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">For the foregoing reasons, I decline to join the judgment of the majority and would instead find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting R.C. 2945.44 immunity to Batt. This court\u2019s decision in <em>Reiner I </em>was unfortunate in that it committed an obvious error of constitutional law that the United States Supreme Court thought grievous enough to correct in a summary reversal. Today\u2019s, decision may well be even more unfortunate, for the majority makes a mistake of Ohio law that no higher judicial authority can correct.</p>\n<judges id=\"b716-11\">Moyer, C.J., and Wolff, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-9\">. Some Ohio appellate courts have expressed the view that a criminal defendant lacks standing to challenge a grant of immunity to a witness. See, <em>e.g., State v. Steverson </em>(Sept. 15, 1998), Franklin App. No. 97APA11-1466, unreported, 1998 WL 634949; <em>State v. Minnich </em>(Sept. 30, 1997), Huron App. No. H-96-060, unreported, 1997 WL 614944. Similarly, numerous courts in other states have held that a defendant lacks standing to contest the grant of immunity to a prosecution witness. See <em>People v. Rodriguez </em>(Colo.1996), 914 P.2d 230, 266-267; <em>Kerns v. State </em>(Wyo.1996), 920 P.2d 632, 637; <em>State v. Pierson </em>(1988), 208 Conn. 683, 688, 546 A.2d 268, 270; <em>Smith v. Commonwealth </em>(1982), 386 Mass. 345, 348-349, 436 N.E.2d 377, 379; <em>State v. Ahmadjian </em>(R.I.1981), 438 A.2d 1070, 1078; <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1979), 297 N.C. 600, 606-607, 256 S.E.2d 212, 216; <em>Commonwealth v. Showers </em>(1996), 452 Pa.Super. 135, 153, 681 A.2d 746, 755; <em>People v. Wisely </em>(1990), 224 Cal.App.3d 939, 943-944, 274 Cal.Rptr. 291, 294; <em>State v. Kingbird </em>(Minn.App.1987), 412 N.W.2d 350, 354. A number of federal courts also take this view. See <em>United States v. Ellis </em>(C.A.3, 1979), 595 F.2d 154, 163; <em>United States v. Hathaway </em>(C.A.1, 1976), 534 F.2d 386, 402; <em>United States v. Foster </em>(C.A.7, 1973), 478 F.2d 1001, 1003-1004; but, see, <em>Ellis v. United States </em>(C.A.D.C. 1969), 416 F.2d 791, 799 (recognizing that defendant has standing to challenge grant of immunity \u201cwhere the trial judge went outside his judicial province to grant immunity to a witness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"ABx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>In <em>Reiner I, </em>the majority rejected the state\u2019s contention that Reiner lacked standing to challenge the grant of immunity to Batt. In doing so, the majority relied exclusively on its erroneous Fifth Amendment analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">\u201cThis argument [asserting a lack of standing] assumes that the grant of immunity met the statutory threshold of a valid privilege against self-incrimination. Beca\u00fase Susan Batt lacked a valid Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and the grant of immunity was unlawful, the state\u2019s standing argument lacks merit.\u201d <em>Reiner I, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 356, 731 N.E.2d at 675.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">The <em>Reiner I </em>majority\u2019s standing analysis was inextricably intertwined with the Fifth Amendment analysis. Thus, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of <em>Reiner I </em>necessarily undermines this court\u2019s original resolution of the standing issue. The majority nevertheless decides the merits of the immunity issue in Reiner\u2019s favor without ever explaining how or why Reiner has standing under Ohio law to challenge the grant of immunity to Batt.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
