The majority dismisses this cause pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. X(4)(B) because relators improperly filed an \u201cApplication For Writ of Mandamus\u201d instead of a \u201cpetition\u201d as required by R.C. 2731.04, and because the affidavit of relators\u2019 counsel states that it is based upon \u201cinformation and belief\u2019 instead of \u201cpersonal knowledge.\u201d Because I believe that dismissal for these reasons would, in effect, be elevating form over substance, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">It appears that, in all respects other than the title, the relators\u2019 initial pleading adequately sets forth their request for relief. However, instead of entitling the document a \u201ccomplaint\u201d or \u201cpetition,\u201d relators called it an \u201capplication.\u201d I believe that this defect alone should not result in dismissal. I believe that the terms \u201capplication\u201d and \u201cpetition\u201d are interchangeable and the use of the word \u201capplication\u201d should not render the pleading fatally defective. R.C. 2731.04 sets forth the requirement that \u201c[application for the writ of mandamus must be by petition.\u201d Nevertheless, the title of the statute, although not part of the law itself, is \u201cApplication for writ.\u201d This is a clear indication that to \u201cpetition\u201d is the same as to \u201capply\u201d for a writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">The interchangeable nature of these words is apparent from several definitions. \u201cPetition\u201d is defined as a \u201cformal written <em>request </em>presented to a court.\u201d \u201cApplication\u201d is defined as a <em>\u201crequest </em>for an order not requiring advance notice and an opportunity for a hearing before the order is issued.\u201d To \u201capply\u201d means to \u201cmake a formal <em>request </em>or motion.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7 Ed.1999) 1165, 96. Again, I believe that any distinction between these terms is minor and should not be considered a fatal flaw. In contrast to R.C. 2731.04, both S.CtPrac.R. X(4)(A) and Civ.R. 7(A) provide that an original action, including a mandamus action, be instituted by the filing of a \u201ccomplaint.\u201d Neither rule mentions the word \u201cpetition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">I also do not agree that relators\u2019 affidavit failed to comply with S.CtPrac.R. X(4)(B), which requires that \u201c[a]ll complaints * * * shall be supported by an affidavit of the relator or counsel specifying the details of the claim.\u201d Here, Stephen P. Postalakis, counsel for relators, submitted an affidavit in which he asserts facts that \u201care true to the best of his information and belief.\u201d Because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>did not use the words \u201cpersonal knowledge,\u201d the majority finds that the affidavit is facially defective and cannot support the claim for relief.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AiU\">Blaugrund&gt; <em>Herbert &amp; Martin, Inc., David S. Blaugrund, David S. Kessler </em>and <em>Stephen P. Postalakis, </em>for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A44\"><em>Robert A. Fry, </em>Hancock County Prosecuting Attorney, and <em>Mark C. Miller, </em>Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Neither R.C. 2731.04 nor S.CtPrac.R. X(4)(B) mandates use of the words \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d in the affidavit. So long as the affidavit sets forth the details of the claim, including facts that would be admissible in evidence, and shows affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to those facts, I believe that the affidavit should be deemed sufficient. See <em>State ex rel. Sekermestrovich v. Akron </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 536, 538, 740 N.E.2d 252, 254, citing <em>State ex rel. Nix v. Cleveland </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 379, 384, 700 N.E.2d 12, 17. I believe that the Postalakis affidavit adequately sets forth factual details of the claim that are based upon his personal knowledge, despite the fact that he did not use those words in the document. He was personally involved with the matters addressed in his affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">It has long been a fundamental principle of judicial review in Ohio that courts should decide cases on their merits, not on minor or technical violations. <em>State ex rel. Wilcox v. Seidner </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 412, 414, 667 N.E.2d 1220. \u201cFairness and justice are best served when a court disposes of a case on the merits. Only a flagrant, substantial disregard for the court rules can justify a dismissal on procedural grounds.\u201d <em>DeHart v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 189, 193, 23 O.O.3d 210, 213, 431 N.E.2d 644, 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Consequently, I would not dismiss and instead would review the case on the merits.</p>\n<judges id=\"b796-8\">Douglas and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
