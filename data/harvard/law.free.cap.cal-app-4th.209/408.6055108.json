Plaintiffs alleged that the City\u2019s approval of the project violated the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and provisions of the Visalia Municipal Code regarding permits. They also contend that City\u2019s agreement to reimburse VWR International for street improvements associated with the new facility constituted an illegal expenditure of public funds because it violated a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>section of the Visalia Municipal Code prohibiting payments to developers. In addition, plaintiffs sought a writ of mandate against VWR International to compel its compliance with the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD) rules concerning air pollution from indirect sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The trial court sustained, without leave to amend, the demurrer of VWR International on the grounds that (1) the CEQA claim was time-barred by the applicable 35-day limitations period, (2) plaintiffs lacked standing to obtain a writ of mandate to compel City or VWR International to comply with permitting requirements of the Visalia Municipal Code or SJVAPCD, and (3) plaintiffs\u2019 claim that City authorized the illegal expenditure of public funds was an improper challenge to a discretionary funding decision. On appeal, plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">We conclude that a notice of exemption filed <em>before </em>the final approval of a proposed project is invalid and does not trigger the 35-day statute of limitations set forth in section 21167, subdivision (d). Because plaintiffs have alleged that City approved the project after it filed the notice of exemption, and a demurrer admits the truth of the allegations pled, we cannot conclude at this stage of the proceedings that the 35-day limitations period applies and thus bars the CEQA claim. Therefore, the demurrer to the CEQA cause of action should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Also, we conclude plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that no building permits may be issued for the project without a planned development permit identifies a ministerial duty that City owes the public and that may be enforced by writ of mandate. Furthermore, plaintiffs have standing to enforce this ministerial duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Finally, as to plaintiffs\u2019 claim that City\u2019s reimbursement of VWR International for certain street improvements will be an illegal expenditure of government funds, we will grant plaintiffs leave to amend (1) to identify the specific mandatory provision of the Visalia Municipal Code that the reimbursements allegedly will violate and (2) to allege facts showing how the reimbursements will violate that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">We therefore reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\n<em>The Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">VWR International, a defendant and real party in interest in this litigation, is a global laboratory supply and distribution company, headquartered in Pennsylvania. VWR International proposed building a 500,000- to 750,000-square-foot supply and distribution facility on 32 acres of land located on West Riggin Avenue in Visalia, California. Plaintiffs allege the facility will supply a wide range of laboratory equipment and chemicals, \u201cincluding solvents, salts, acids, and other highly toxic compounds.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In connection with the construction of the facility, improvements will be made to adjacent streets. (The facility and street improvements are collectively referred to as the \u201cproject,\u201d) Plaintiffs allege that when the new facility is open, VWR International plans to close older regional facilities in Brisbane, California; Aurora, Colorado; and San Dimas, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The plaintiffs in this lawsuit are (1) Coalition for Clean Air, (2) Center for Environmental Health, (3) Association of Irritated Residents, (4) Kevin Long, and (5) Teamsters Joint Council 7 (collectively plaintiffs).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Coalition for Clean Air is a California nonprofit corporation with over 300 members throughout the state. Coalition for Clean Air alleges it has seven members and one staff person who regularly breathe the air of Tulare County and surrounding areas and some of its members \u201cwill suffer injury in fact and economic harm as a result of the violations of law related to the VWR Project at issue in this action, including, but not limited to, diminution of property value due to excess air pollution and truck traffic, being forced to breathe heavily polluted air and suffer excess traffic congestion, [and] being exposed to significant risks from the handling, transportation and storage of highly toxic chemicals without proper safeguards.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Center for Environmental Health is an Oakland-based California nonprofit corporation. Center for Environmental Health alleges that it is dedicated to protecting the public from environmental health hazards and toxic exposures. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>It alleges that it has supporters who live near the proposed project and that these supporters will suffer injury as a result of violations of law related to the proposed project.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Association of Irritated Residents alleges that it is an unincorporated association that advocates for air quality and environmental health in the San Joaquin Valley. It further alleges that some of its members reside in Tulare County near the proposed project and they will suffer injury as a result of violations of law related to the proposed project.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Kevin Long alleges that he is a resident of Visalia, pays taxes in Visalia, lives in the vicinity of the proposed project, and will be directly and adversely affected by City\u2019s approval of the project. He also alleges he will suffer injury as a result of violations of law related to the proposed project.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Teamsters Joint Council 7 is a labor organization based in Oakland that alleges it has over 700 members who live, work and recreate in Visalia. It also alleges it has members who live near the proposed project and will be injured as a result of violations of law related to the proposed project. Teamsters Joint Council 7 alleges dozens of its members will lose their jobs at the facility in Brisbane when VWR International moves its operations to the unlawful proposed facility in Visalia.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Besides VWR International, the other defendants in this lawsuit are SJVAPCD, City, its city council, site plan review committee, and a community development director.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">SJVAPCD is an air quality control agency charged with promulgating rules and regulations to reduce air pollution in the San Joaquin Valley. Its jurisdiction covers eight counties, including Tulare County. SJVAPCD promulgated rule 9510, which sets forth its indirect source review program.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>\n<em>The Petitions and Complaints</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">On December 28, 2010, Kevin Long and Teamsters Joint Council 7 filed a verified petition and complaint against City and VWR International. They also notified the Attorney General that the petition had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">On February 1, 2011, a verified first amended petition for peremptory writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief (FAP) was filed, containing eight causes of action, which included alleged violations of CEQA, the land use process of the Visalia Municipal Code, and SJVAPCD\u2019s rule 9510,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and illegal government expenditures.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Coalition for Clean Air, Center for Environmental Health, and Association of Irritated Residents were added as plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\n<em>Allegations of the FAP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">In August 2010, VWR International announced that it intended to build its new distribution facility in Visalia. The proposed site was undeveloped land that had been farmed and was in a planned heavy industrial zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">In September 2010, City\u2019s site plan review committee met to discuss the proposed project and determined that improvements to Riggin Avenue and the preparation of plans for grading and drainage, dust control, and landscaping were needed. At the meeting, the committee directed applicant VWR International to make at least 50 modifications to the proposed project.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">Plaintiffs allege that because the project required modifications, the site plan review committee did not approve the proposed project or issue a planned development permit at the September 2010 meeting. Instead, the site plan review committee concluded that a revised plan addressing its comments and revisions must be submitted for off-agenda review and approval before submissions for building permits or discretionary actions. As a result, the site plan review committee and City staff processed all further permits and actions concerning the proposed project off agenda and there were no public notices or hearings for any further permitting actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>In October 2010, the County of Tulare Resource Management Agency wrote to City urging it to conduct a CEQA review and determine whether the project complied with SJVAPCD rule 9510 for indirect source review.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">On November 3, 2010, City filed a notice of exemption that described the project as the \u201cconstruction of a new 500,499 sq. ft. building on 31.9 acres in the IH (Heavy Industrial) zone\u201d and stated the project was a ministerial action statutorily exempt from CEQA. Plaintiffs allege that City\u2019s notice of exemption was filed \u201cfive days prior to the November 8, 2010 approval of the VWR Project.\u201d The topic of project approval is also addressed by plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that a letter from City\u2019s community development director, dated November 8, 2010, appears to be the first approval of the proposed project of any kind issued by City. That letter stated: \u201cThe revised site plan was submitted for off-agenda review by the committee on October 14, 2010. The Site plan review number 10-113 is approved as a Revise and Proceed to building permits and off-site civil improvement design drawings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Later in November, district 6 of California\u2019s Department of Transportation sent City a letter stating (1) the project would have significant adverse impacts on traffic, (2) a traffic impact study would be required to determine the extent of the impacts and the mitigation needed to reduce the impacts to less than significant, and (3) the project would significantly impact three interchanges on State Route 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">On December 10, 2010, City\u2019s city council exercised its discretion to approve reimbursing VWR International up to $1.5 million for the cost of street improvements associated with the proposed project. The city council authorized the city manager to approve and execute improvement and reimbursement agreements with VWR International. Those agreements are the basis for plaintiffs\u2019 sixth cause of action, which alleges City authorized the illegal expenditure of public funds. The improvements and expenditures are described in greater detail in an unpublished portion of this opinion, which discusses the sixth cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">\n<em>VWR International\u2019s Demurrer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">On February 10, 2011, VWR International filed a demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 FAP, contending (1) the CEQA claims were barred by the statute of limitations, (2) plaintiffs lacked standing to obtain a writ of mandate on the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>claims, and (3) the allegations of illegal government expenditures were insufficient to state a cause of action. City joined in this demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">SJVAPCD did not join in the demurrer. Instead, SJVAPCD and plaintiffs entered a stipulated judgment, described in part IV of this opinion, which effectively resolved the claim against SJVAPCD in the third cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\n<em>Hearing and Order on- the Demurrer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">On April 20, 2011, plaintiffs filed a request for dismissal without prejudice of their fourth, fifth, seventh and eighth causes of action. Thus, the April 26, 2011, hearing on the demurrer proceeded on the four remaining causes of action: the CEQA violations, the permit requirements in the Visalia Municipal Code, SJVAPCD rule 9510, and illegal government expenditures. At the end of the hearing, the court took the matter under submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">On May 2, 2011, the trial court filed its written order, sustaining the demurrer on plaintiffs\u2019 remaining causes of action. The court concluded that (1) the CEQA cause of action was time-barred, (2) plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue the second cause of action concerning violations of permit requirements contained in the Visalia Municipal Code,' (3) plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the third cause of action concerning VWR International\u2019s alleged violation of SJVAPCD\u2019s rule 9510, and (4) the illegal expenditure of government funds alleged in the sixth cause of action was a discretionary funding decision that could not be challenged in a taxpayer suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Later in May 2011, a judgment of dismissal with prejudice was entered in favor of City and VWR International against plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">\n<em>Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">Plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal in July 2011. In August 2011, plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of supersedeas and an immediate stay with this court. The petition asserted that VWR International began construction of the proposed project after entry of the trial court\u2019s judgment and requested a stay of all construction activities pending resolution of the appeal. The Attorney General\u2019s Office filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the petition for writ of supersedeas.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">Shortly after its filing, this court denied the petition for writ of supersedeas.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">I. <em>Matters Concerning the Appellate Record</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">II. <em>Statute of Limitations Applicable To CEQA Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"AF\">A. <em>Background Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">On November 3, 2010, City filed a notice of exemption that referenced Guidelines section 15268<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and stated the project was exempt from CEQA review as a ministerial action. The notice of exemption was in the format for notices of exemption set forth in appendix E of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">On December 28, 2010, (i.e., 55 days later) plaintiffs filed a verified petition and complaint that alleged as its first cause of action that City violated CEQA by failing to conduct any environmental review of the project.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Plaintiffs claimed the project was not exempt from CEQA and City was required to prepare an environmental impact report.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Plaintiffs then filed the FAP, which contained more extensive allegations concerning the timeliness of the lawsuit and the applicable statute of limitations. The FAP contended that the 35-day statute of limitations ordinarily triggered by the filing of a notice of exemption did not apply to the CEQA cause of action because City filed its notice of exemption on November 3, 2010, <em>prior to </em>approving the project on November 8, 2010. Under plaintiffs\u2019 view of the law, a premature notice of exemption has no legal effect and, thus, fails to trigger the 35-day statute of limitations. Plaintiffs supported their position that City approved the project on November 8, 2010, by alleging: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>\u201cThe official City of Visalia Agenda Item Transmittal for the December 10, 2010 City Council meeting states that the VWR Project was \u2018approved by Site Plan Review Committee on November 8, 2010,\u2019\u2014five days after the November 3, 2010 Notice of Exemption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">B. <em>Demurrer and Trial Court\u2019s Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">VWR International\u2019s demurrer asserted the CEQA cause of action was time-barred pursuant to section 21167 because it was filed more than 35 days after City filed the notice of exemption. VWR International supported its demurrer by filing a request for judicial notice of six documents, including the notice of exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Plaintiffs opposed the demurrer, arguing that the notice of exemption must be filed after project approval or it is void <em>ab initio. </em>Plaintiffs also argued that their CEQA claim was timely under the 180-day limitations period that applies when a valid notice of exemption is not filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The trial court sustained the demurrer to the CEQA cause of action without leave to amend, concluding the CEQA claim was time-barred because it was not filed within 35 days of the filing of the notice exemption. The trial court cited <em>Stockton Citizens for Sensible Planning v. City of Stockton </em>(2010) 48 Cal.4th 481 [106 Cal.Rptr.3d 858, 227 P.3d 416] <em>(Stockton Citizens) </em>for the principle that a petitioner has 35 days in which to challenge a notice of exemption that is valid on its face. In the trial court\u2019s view, this principle applied to challenges alleging that the project had not yet been approved when the notice of exemption was issued. Based on this view of the law, the trial court determined that plaintiff\u2019s CEQA claim was barred by the 35-day limitations period.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">C. <em>Demurrer Statute and Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">Code of Civil Procedure section 430.30, subdivision (a) provides that when \u201cany ground for objection to a complaint . . . appears on the face thereof, ... the objection on that ground may be taken by a demurrer to the pleading.\u201d The statute of limitations is a \u201cground for objection to a complaint\u201d for purposes of this provision, and therefore may be raised in a demurrer. <em>(Cochran v. Cochran </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 488, 493 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 540].)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>In a CEQA proceeding, an order sustaining a demurrer on statute of limitations grounds is subject to de novo review on appeal. <em>(Committee for Green Foothills v. Santa Clara County Bd. of Supervisors </em>(2010) 48 Cal.4th 32, 42 [105 Cal.Rptr3d 181, 224 P.3d 920] <em>(Committee for Green Foothills).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Sometimes, it is difficult for demurrers based on the statute of limitations to succeed because (1) trial and appellate courts treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and (2) resolution of the statute of limitations issue can involve questions of fact.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Furthermore, when the relevant facts are not clear such that the cause of action might be, but is not necessarily, time-barred, the demurrer will be overruled. <em>(Committee for Green Foothills, supra, </em>48 Cal.4th at p. 42.) Thus, for a demurrer based on the statute of limitations to be sustained, the untimeliness of the lawsuit must clearly and affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint and matters judicially noticed. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">D. <em>35-day Statute of Limitations</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aqu\">1. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Section 21080, subdivision (b) sets forth certain statutory exemptions from CEQA, including an exemption for ministerial projects. (\u00a7 21080, subd. (b)(1); see Guidelines, \u00a7 15369 [definition of \u201cministerial\u201d].) If a local agency determines that a project is exempt from CEQA as a ministerial project pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 21080 and the local agency approves the project, \u201cthe local agency . . . may file a notice of the determination with the county clerk of each county in which the project will be located.\u201d (\u00a7 21152, subd. (b).) The statute uses the term \u201cnotice of the determination,\u201d but the Guidelines refer to this particular filing as a \u201cnotice of exemption.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7\u00a7 15062, 15374; see <em>Stockton Citizens, supra, </em>48 Cal.4th at p. 488 [this type of notice of determination is otherwise known as a notice of exemption or NOE].)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The benefit that a public agency and project proponent receive from filing a notice of exemption is a shorter statute of limitations. Section 21167, subdivision (d)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> provides for a 35-day limitations period when a notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>exemption is filed, but extends this period to 180 days if a notice of exemption is not filed. <em>(Committee for Green Foothills, supra, </em>48 Cal.4th at p. 44, fn. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The 35-day limitations period triggered by filing a notice of exemption is also addressed in Guidelines section 15112, subdivision (c), which provides: \u201cThe statute of limitations periods under CEQA are as follows: HQ ... HQ (2) Where the public agency filed a notice of exemption <em>in compliance with Section 15062, </em>35 days after the filing of the notice and the posting on a list of such notices.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">2. <em>Contentions of the Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Based on the plain, unambiguous language of Guidelines section 15112, subdivision (c), the parties agree that the 35-day limitations period is triggered only if the notice of exemption complies with Guidelines section 15062.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The disputes in this case concern (1) what is required to comply with Guidelines section 15062 and (2) whether the notice of exemption filed by City meets those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">At oral argument, counsel for VWR International contended that a notice of exemption complies with Guidelines section 15062 if it is \u201cfacially valid.\u201d This contention is based on the California Supreme Court\u2019s use of the term \u201cfacially valid\u201d in adopting the principle \u201cthat flaws in the decisionmaking process underlying a <em>facially valid and properly filed NOE </em>do not prevent the NOE from triggering the 35-day period to file a lawsuit challenging the agency\u2019s determination that it has approved a CEQA-exempt project.\u201d <em>(Stockton Citizens, supra, </em>48 Cal.4th at p. 489, italics added.) Counsel for VWR International also argued that a notice of exemption is facially valid if it contains the information required by Guidelines section 15062, subdivision (a)(1) through (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">In contrast, counsel for plaintiff argued that plain language set forth in subdivisions (a) and (b) of Guidelines section 15062 requires the notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>exemption to be filed after approval of the project. In plaintiff\u2019s view, a notice of exemption filed before project approval is noncompliant and cannot trigger the 35-day statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">3. <em>Analysis of Regulatory Text</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The parties\u2019 dispute requires this court to interpret and apply Guidelines section 15062, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">\u201c(a) When a public agency decides that a project is exempt from CEQA pursuant to Section 15061, and the public agency approves or determines to carry out the project, the agency may, file a notice of exemption. <em>The notice shall be filed, if at all, after approval of the project. </em>Such a notice shall include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">\u201c(1) A brief description of the project,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">\u201c(2) The location of the project (either by street address and cross street for a project in an urbanized area or by attaching a specific map, preferably a copy of a U.S.G.S. 15\u2019 or 7-1/2\u2019 topographical map identified by quadrangle name),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">\u201c(3) A finding that the project is exempt from CEQA, including a citation to the State Guidelines section or statute under which it is found to be exempt,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-10\">\u201c(4) A brief statement of reasons to support the finding, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-11\">\u201c(5) The applicant\u2019s name, if any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-12\">\u201c(b) A notice of exemption may be filled out and may accompany the project application through the approval process. <em>The notice shall not be filed with the county clerk or OPR until the project has been approved.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-13\">\u201c(c) When a public agency approves an applicant\u2019s project, either the agency or the applicant may file a notice of exemption. [!]... [1]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-14\">\u201c(2) When a local agency files this notice, the notice of exemption shall be filed with the county clerk of each county in which the project will be located. Copies of all such notices will be available for public inspection and such notices shall be posted within 24 hours of receipt in the office of the county clerk. Each notice shall remain posted for a period of 30 days. Thereafter, the clerk shall return the notice to the local agency with a notation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>of the period it was posted. The local agency shall retain the notice for not less than 12 months. [][]... [][]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">\u201c(d) The filing of a Notice of Exemption and the posting on the list of notices start a 35 day statute of limitations period on legal challenges to the agency\u2019s decision that the project is exempt from CEQA. If a Notice of Exemption is not filed, a 180 day statute of limitations will apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">We conclude that the foregoing provisions of Guidelines section 15062 unambiguously require notices of exemption to be filed after the project has been approved. The second sentence in subdivision (a) of Guidelines section 15062 provides: \u201cThe notice shall be filed, if at all, after approval of the project.\u201d Similarly, the second sentence of subdivision (b) of Guidelines section 15062 provides: \u201cThe notice shall not be filed with the county clerk... until the project has been approved.\u201d Both subdivisions (a) and (b) of Guidelines section 15062 use the word \u201cshall,\u201d which unambiguously indicates the mandatory nature of the requirement that notices of exemption be filed after the approval of the project. (See Guidelines, \u00a7 15005, subd. (a) [\u201c \u2018shall\u2019 identifies a mandatory element which all public agencies are required to follow\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">This mandatory language plainly means that a notice of exemption filed before project approval does not comply with Guidelines section 15062. It follows that filing a notice of exemption before project approval does not begin the running of the 35-day limitations period set forth in section 21167, subdivision (d). (See Guidelines, \u00a7 15112, subd. (c)(2) [agency required to file \u201ca notice of exemption in compliance with Section 15062\u201d to trigger 35-day limitations period].)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Our literal interpretation of Guidelines sections 15062 and 15112 is not new. It was adopted by the court in <em>County of Amador </em>v. <em>El Dorado County Water Agency </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931 at pages 962 through 965 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 66] <em>(County of Amador). </em>In that case, the court analyzed those provisions of the Guidelines and concluded that \u201ca notice of exemption cannot be filed until after the project is approved.\u201d <em>(County of Amador, supra, </em>at p. 963.) The court also concluded that the agency had not approved the project before filing its notice of exemption and, thus, the notice was invalid and the 35-day limitations period did not bar the plaintiffs CEQA lawsuit. <em>(County of Amador, supra, </em>at p. 963.)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">At oral argument, counsel for VWR International contended that the holding in <em>County of Amador </em>was rejected by the California Supreme Court in <em>Stockton Citizens, supra, </em>48 Cal.4th 481. In VWR International\u2019s view, a facially valid notice of exemption triggers the 35-day limitations period and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>plaintiff who challenges a facially valid notice of exemption on the ground it was filed before project approval must file suit within the 35-day period. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Our examination of the <em>Stockton Citizens </em>opinion revealed that the Supreme Court used the term \u201cfacially valid\u201d twice. <em>(Stockton Citizens, supra, </em>48 Cal.4th at pp. 489, 501.) Both times it was in the phrase \u201ca facially valid and properly filed NOE . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>For example, the court adopted the principle \u201cthat flaws in the decisionmaking process underlying a facially valid and properly filed NOE do not prevent the NOE from triggering the 35-day period to file a lawsuit challenging the agency\u2019s determination that it has approved a CEQA-exempt project.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 489.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">This statement\u2019s reference to a \u201cfacially valid and properly filed\u201d notice of exemption indicates that the Supreme Court believed that a notice of exemption must satisfy two general requirements to be a \u201ccompliant NOE\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and thus trigger the 35-day limitations period. First, it must be facially valid, which means it must contain the information required by Guidelines section 15062, subdivision (a)(1) through (5). Second, the notice of exemption must be properly filed, which means it must comply with the filing requirements specified in Guidelines section 15062, subdivisions (a) through (c). Indeed, the Supreme Court was aware of the filing requirements for notices of exemption, as indicated by its inclusion of the citation \u201csee also CEQA Guidelines, \u00a7\u00a7 15062(a) [NOE shall be filed, if at all, \u2018after approval of the project\u2019], 15374 [NOE may be filed after public agency has decided to carry out or approve a project. . . .].)\u201d <em>(Stockton Citizens, supra, </em>48 Cal.4th at p. 504.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">In addition, we believe that the following dicta in <em>Stockton Citizens </em>addressing when the notice of exemption should be filed supports our interpretation of the Guidelines, rather than VWR International\u2019s position: \u201c[Pjersons seeking to challenge an agency decision on CEQA grounds may not, for purposes of the statute of limitations, go behind the agency\u2019s declaration in an NOE that it <em>has </em>approved a project. Instead, they must bring their action within 35 days after the NOE is filed and posted. Nor does this mean that the agency may therefore file an NOE <em>in advance </em>of an actual project approval, then proceed unmolested to approve the project at its leisure, free of environmental challenges.\u201d <em>(Stockton Citizens, supra, </em>48 Cal.4th at p. 501, fn. 10.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>The court clearly rejected the idea that a notice of exemption could be filed in advance of project approval. Furthermore, its statements that a plaintiff may not go behind the agency\u2019s declaration that it has approved the project and that an action must be brought within 35 days after the notice of exemption is filed and posted cannot be interpreted to mean that plaintiffs must file a lawsuit within 35 days after the filing of a notice of exemption if they intend to pursue the argument that the project was not approved until after the notice of exemption was filed. It is extremely unlikely the Supreme Court intended such an interpretation because it directly conflicts with the text of Guidelines section 15062 and contradicts the court\u2019s use of the term \u201cproperly filed\u201d in the phrase \u201ca facially valid and properly filed NOE.\u201d <em>(Stockton Citizens, supra, </em>48 Cal.4th at pp. 489, 501.)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Furthermore, if the Supreme Court had intended to impliedly overrule <em>County of Amador, </em>it is unlikely its decision in <em>Committee for Green Foothills, supra, </em>48 Cal.4th 32, which was filed a month and a half before <em>Stockton Citizens, </em>would have included the following citation: \u201csee also <em>County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 962-963 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 66] [notice of exemption was not valid, and did not trigger 35-day limitations period, because it was filed before the project was approved] . . . .\u201d <em>(Committee for Green Foothills, supra, </em>at p. 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that <em>County of Amador </em>remains good law insofar as it held that a notice of exemption filed before actual project approval is invalid and does not trigger the 35-day limitations period.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">E. <em>Application of Compliance Requirement to City\u2019s Notice of Exemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The FAP alleges that City\u2019s notice of exemption \u201cwas filed on November 3, 2010, five days prior to the November 8, 2010 approval of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>VWR Project.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 position that the project was approved on November 8, 2010, is supported by the allegations that (1) a November 8, 2010, letter <em>from </em>City\u2019s community development director appears to be the first approval of the proposed project of any kind issued by City; (2) the November 8, 2010, letter stated: \u201cThe revised site plan was submitted for off-agenda review by the committee on October 14, 2010. The Site plan review number 10-113 is approved as a Revise and Proceed to building permits and off-site civil improvement design drawings\u201d; and (3) a City-prepared document setting forth agenda items for the December 10, 2010, City Council meeting stated that the project was \u201capproved by Site Plan Review Committee on November 8, 2010.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">For purposes of the demurrer, we assume these allegations are true <em>(Committee for Green Foothills, supra, </em>48 Cal.4th at p. 42) and, therefore, regard the project as being approved after the notice of exemption was filed. It follows that City\u2019s notice of exemption did not comply with Guidelines section 15062\u2019s requirement that notices of exemption shall be filed after the approval of the project. As a result, City\u2019s noncompliant notice of exemption did not trigger the 35-day limitations period and the demurrer to the CEQA cause of action should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">F. <em>Remand on Timing of Project Approval</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Our decision to overrule the demurrer is not a final determination that the CEQA cause of action was, in fact, timely filed. Instead, it is merely a determination that the dispute over whether the project received actual final approval before the notice of exemption was filed cannot be resolved against plaintiffs at the pleading stage of the proceedings. Because the statute of limitations defense might be established subsequently in this litigation, we will remand for further proceedings in which the parties\u2019 dispute regarding when the project actually was approved can be resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">On remand, the question regarding when the \u201capproval of the project\u201d occurred for purposes of subdivision (a) of Guidelines section 15062 will require application of the definition of \u201capproval\u201d contained in Guidelines section 15352:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">\u201c(a) \u2018Approval\u2019 means the decision by a public agency which commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out by any person. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">\u201c(b) With private projects, approval occurs upon the earliest commitment to issue or the issuance by the public agency of a discretionary contract, grant, subsidy, loan, or other form of financial assistance, lease, permit, license, certificate, or other \u00e9ntitlement for use of the project.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>In <em>Stockton Citizens, supra, </em>48 Cal.4th at pages 505 through 506, our Supreme Court quoted these provisions, stated that \u201c[n]o particular form of approval is required,\u201d discussed the city\u2019s <em>intent </em>to have a letter from the director of its community development department constitute final approval of a Wal-Mart project, and treated the director\u2019s letter as the final project approval. In reaching this conclusion about project approval, the court stated: \u201c[T]here is no indication that any further approvals, other than ministerial building permits, were necessary to build the store.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 506.) The instant case is different because there are questions about further approvals being necessary to complete the project. (See pt. KG., <em>post.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Based on the definition of \u201capproval\u201d in Guidelines section 15352 and the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of that definition, it appears that factual disputes might need to be resolved before the definition can be applied in this case and the date of approval determined.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Alternatively, a motion for summary adjudication of issues might establish that there are no disputes of material fact regarding the application of the definition to the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">G. <em>Subsequent, Discretionary Approvals of Project Activity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">As an alternate ground for their position that the CEQA claim is not time-barred, plaintiffs contend that City took subsequent discretionary actions that required CEQA review. Specifically, plaintiffs contend that on November 8, 2010, City decided to grant VWR International relief from the minimum parking requirements and on December 10, 2010, the City Council voted to approve the improvement and reimbursement agreements for roadwork related to the new distribution facility. Plaintiffs cite <em>Orinda Assn. v. Board of Supervisors </em>(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 1145 [227 Cal.Rptr. 688] for the proposition that if a CEQA project involves both ministerial and discretionary approvals, the exemption available for the approval of the ministerial activity does not apply to the entire project and file later discretionary approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>triggers CEQA review.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Plaintiffs argue that the granting of the parking variance and the December 10, 2010, approval of the expenditure of up to $1.5 million for roadwork reimbursement would trigger CEQA anew for \u201cthe whole of an action.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 15378 [\u201cproject\u201d means the whole of the action].)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 alternate argument and the responses of City and VWR International to that argument cannot be definitively resolved at the pleading stage of this lawsuit. Questions regarding the \u201capproval\u201d of those allegedly discretionary actions entail underlying factual issues of who did what, when the acts occurred, and what the acts meant<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Consequently, plaintiffs\u2019 alternate argument raises additional questions that require further proceedings to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">III. <em>Standing to Sue for a Violation of Permit Requirements</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">IV. <em>Third Cause of Action Regarding Rule 9510</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 third cause of action alleges that VWR International has a duty to submit an application and obtain an indirect source permit from SJVAPCD pursuant to rule 9510 and that SJVAPCD has an ongoing duty to enforce rule 9510. Under the third cause of action, plaintiffs seek to compel SJVAPCD to enforce rule 9510 and to enjoin VWR International from proceeding with the project until it has obtained an indirect source permit in compliance with rule 9510.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">In March 2011, plaintiffs and SJVAPCD entered a stipulated judgment, which the trial court approved and filed. Among other things, the stipulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>judgment stated: \u201cIf the Court finds that any other governmental entity was or is required to issue a discretionary approval with respect to the VWR Project, then the Air District shall require VWR to comply with SJVAPCD Rule 9510 prior to the commencement of construction of the VWR Project, or within ten (10) days of the date of the ruling of the Court, whichever date is later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The stipulated judgment also provided that the trial court would retain jurisdiction to enforce its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The stipulated judgment effectively resolved the claims the third cause of action asserted against SJVAPCD. As a result, the remaining issue regarding the third cause of action is whether plaintiffs can pursue a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 against VWR International, a private entity, based on its failure to apply for an indirect source permit under rule 9510.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The trial court sustained the demurrer as to the third cause of action on the ground that plaintiffs lack standing. The trial court\u2019s order stated that none of the cases cited by plaintiffs analyzed the issue of the standing of a third party under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 to compel a private entity to obtain a permit or comply with a rule of a governmental agency. On appeal, plaintiffs have made no effort to demonstrate that a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 can be issued against a private entity. They simply assert that the FAP alleges sufficient facts to establish public interest standing for enforcing rule 9510.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s determination that plaintiffs have not established that VWR International, a private party, has any <em>public duty </em>that can be enforced by a writ of mandate. Phrased in terms of the mandamus statute, plaintiffs have failed to show that VWR International has \u201ca duty resulting from an office, trust or station\u201d to perform an act. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085, subd. (a).) Therefore, we conclude mandamus does not lie against VWR International. As a result, we will uphold the trial court\u2019s order insofar as it sustained the VWR International\u2019s demurrer to the third cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">V. <em>Illegal Expenditure of Government Funds on Roadwork</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed. The trial court is directed to vacate its order sustaining the demurrer and to enter a new order (1) overruling the demurrer as to the first cause of action, (2) overruling the demurrer as to the claim against City in the second cause, (3) sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend as to the claim against VWR International in the second cause of action, (4) sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend as to the claim against VWR International in the third cause of action, and (5) sustaining the demurrer with leave to amend as to the sixth cause of action.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Appellants shall recover their costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AnC\">Cornell, Acting P.
