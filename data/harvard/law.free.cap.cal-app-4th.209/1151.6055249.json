First, may a party obtain appellate review of an order acquitting a defendant in a nonsummary criminal contempt proceeding? We conclude that the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the federal Constitution precludes such review. Second, may a party successfully defend against an alleged violation of a facially valid stipulated injunction that the trial court had jurisdiction to issue, on the ground that the injunction is invalid? We conclude that the answer to this question is \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-14\">Applying these conclusions in the present case, we deny Wanke, Industrial, Commercial, Residential, Inc.\u2019s (Wanke) writ petition seeking review of an order acquitting Scott Keck and his company, WP Solutions, Inc. (WP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>Solutions), of contempt for violating a stipulated injunction enjoining Keck and WP Solutions from soliciting certain Wanke customers. However, with respect to Wanke\u2019s related appeal from its motion to enforce a settlement agreement that incorporated the stipulated injunction, we conclude that the trial court erred in finding that the stipulated injunction is invalid and refusing to enforce the injunction on that basis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">A. <em>The parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Wanke is a company that installs waterproofing systems in Southern California. Scott Keck and Jacob Bozarth are former employees of Wanke.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While employed by Wanke, Keck and Bozarth signed certain confidentiality agreements as conditions of their employment. In early 2008, Keck and Bozarth left Wanke\u2019s employ and formed their own competing waterproofing company, WP Solutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">B. <em>The underlying action for misappropriation of trade secrets</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">In December 2008, Wanke filed the underlying action in this matter against Keck and Bozarth. Wanke\u2019s complaint alleged that it had \u201cspent a significant amount of time, effort, and money in the acquisition, development, compilation and maintenance of confidential information concerning its customers, business, and products,\u201d including the \u201cidentity of [Wanke\u2019s] existing and prospective customers, the objectives of each customer, the strategies developed for each customer, the identities of key personnel at those customers, the special needs and characteristics of [Wanke\u2019s] existing and potential customers, [and] the histories and account balances of existing customers . . . collectively . . . \u2018Confidential Information\u2019 . . . .\u201d Wanke further alleged that Keck and Bozarth had \u201cmisus[ed] and misappropriat[ed] . . . [Wanke\u2019s] trade secrets . . . including . . . some or all of the Confidential Information.\u201d Wanke also alleged that Keck and Bozarth had \u201cactively targeted and recruited customers of [Wanke] utilizing the confidential business information of [Wanke] . . . .\u201d Wanke\u2019s complaint contained eight causes of action, including a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets. In its prayer for relief, Wanke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>requested that the court issue \u201can order enjoining [Keck and Bozarth] from soliciting [Wanke\u2019s] past or current customers,\u201d in addition to seeking other forms of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">Keck and Bozarth filed a cross-complaint against Wanke for unpaid compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">In October 2009, the parties resolved the action by entering into a settlement and mutual general release agreement (Settlement Agreement).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Among the terms of the Settlement Agreement were that Keck, Bozarth, and WP Solutions would pay Wanke $38,000. In addition, the parties agreed to release each other from any existing or future claims. Keck, Bozarth, and WP Solutions also agreed to a stipulated injunction described in the following paragraph (Stipulated Injunction). The Settlement Agreement provided that the trial court would retain jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, to enforce the terms of the Settlement Agreement and the Stipulated Injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">On October 30, 2009, the trial court entered the Stipulated Injunction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5The Stipulated Injunction, which the parties agreed would remain in force for five years from the date of entry of the order, prohibited Keck, Bozarth and WP Solutions from: \u201cContacting or soliciting any person, entity, project owner, or representative on the customer list of [Wanke] attached hereto as Exhibit \u20181\u2019 (\u2018[Wanke\u2019s] Customers\u2019)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for the purpose of gaining any of their business, provided that, after a period of eighteen (18) months from the date of entry of this order that defendants will not be deemed to have contacted or solicited a person or entity included within the definition of [Wanke\u2019s] Customers if such person or entity initiates the contact with defendants which leads to defendants submitting a bid or proposal to such person or entity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">The Stipulated Injunction also contains various other restrictions related to this provision, including prohibitions on \u201c[sjeeking to redirect and/or redirecting business from [Wanke\u2019s] Customers to Defendants,\u201d and \u201c[supplying labor, equipment, materials or services to any of [Wanke\u2019s] Customers.\u201d The Stipulated Injunction provides for liquidated damages in the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>$50,000 \u201cfor the initial violation of any provision of this order, with the amount of such liquidated damages increasing in increments of [$10,000] for each subsequent violation of any provision of this order, plus [Wanke\u2019s] actual attorneys\u2019 fees, costs and expenses . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">C. <em>Proceedings to enforce the Stipulated Injunction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">1. <em>The Con Am Management proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">a. <em>The order to show cause for contempt and motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">In May 2010, Wanke filed an application for an order to show cause (OSC) requesting that the trial court hold Keck, Bozarth, and WP Solutions (defendants) in contempt for having violated the Stipulated Injunction. In its application, Wanke alleged that defendants had violated the terms of the Stipulated Injunction on 11 separate occasions by, among other things, contacting and/or supplying labor and/or materials to Con Am Management, one of Wanke\u2019s customers that appeared on the \u201cCustomer &amp; Job List\u201d attached to the Stipulated Injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">In June 2010, Wanke filed a motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. In its motion and accompanying brief, Wanke referred to defendants\u2019 alleged violations of the Stipulated Injunction related to Con Am Management, and requested that the court order defendants to pay liquidated damages as provided in the Stipulated Injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">b. <em>The contempt trial/hearing on motion to enforce the Settlement </em>Agreementi<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">On August 9, 2010, the trial court held a combined trial on Wanke\u2019s OSC for contempt and hearing on Wanke\u2019s motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement. At that proceeding, Wanke presented evidence that Keck and WP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>Solutions had repeatedly contacted Con Am Management and had supplied labor to the company, in violation of the Stipulated Injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\">c. <em>The trial court\u2019s statement of decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">On August 11, 2010, the trial court issued a statement of decision. With respect to all 11 counts, the trial court determined that Wanke had established three of the four elements necessary to prove that defendants were in contempt of the Stipulated Injunction. Specifically, the trial court determined that defendants had knowledge of the Stipulated Injunction, that they had the ability to comply with its terms, and that they had willfully disobeyed it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the court concluded that Wanke had failed to establish the \u201cexistence of a lawful order,\u201d which is required before a party may be held in contempt of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The trial court reached this conclusion based on its determination that the Stipulated Injunction was invalid to the extent that it prohibited defendants from soliciting an entity merely because the entity appeared on the customer list attached to the Stipulated Injunction. In making this determination, the court began by reviewing California law pertaining to the enforceability of noncompetition agreements, including Business and Professions Code section 16600.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court summarized this law by noting, \u201c[C]ourts have repeatedly held a former employee may be barred from soliciting existing customers to redirect their business away from the former employer and to the employee\u2019s new business <em>if the employee is utilizing trade secret information </em>to solicit those customers.\u201d The trial court also recognized that, \u201cNumerous courts have concluded [that] customer lists can qualify for trade secret protection.\u201d However, the trial court determined that the Stipulated Injunction was invalid under Business and Professions Code section 16600 because neither the identity of Con Am Management nor its location was a trade secret. The court reasoned as follows: \u201c[H]ad [Wanke] prevailed at trial [in the underlying trade secret action], [Wanke] would not have been entitled to an injunction which protected as its exclusive property the identity or location of [Con Am Management], This is so because anyone, including Keck, could easily identify Con Am as a potential customer. The fact that defendants agreed to the [Stipulated Injunction] does not change the result, given the fact that [Wanke] now seeks to have the court invoke its contempt powers. The court must conclude that the [Stipulated Injunction], to the extent it would protect as a trade secret the mere identity of [Con Am Management] (and forbid any contact with [Con Am Management] for 18 months or 5 years, depending on who initiated the contact) is overbroad and infirm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>On this basis, the court concluded that defendants could not be convicted of contempt and that they were \u201cacquitted\u201d on all 11 counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">After reaching this conclusion, the court proceeded to rule that the Stipulated Injunction <em>could </em>be applied lawfully under the following circumstances: \u201cSo as to avoid striking down the entire [Stipulated] Injunction (which would naturally have the effect of unwinding the entire settlement and consigning the parties to further fruitless and expensive litigation) and (hopefully) as a guide to the parties in arranging their affairs in the future, the court holds that the provisions of the [Stipulated] Injunction apply only to jobs undertaken or proposed to be undertaken for Con Am while defendants Keck and/or Bozarth were employed by [Wanke], . . . Only on these jobs can the defendants be said to be using information they learned while employed at [Wanke] to \u2018identify customers with particular needs or characteristics\u2019 within the meaning of the case law discussed above [addressing the enforceability of noncompetition agreements under California law]. [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">With respect to Wanke\u2019s motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement, the court ruled that \u201cno liquidated damages may be imposed,\u201d because \u201call eleven of the alleged \u2018violations\u2019 were not in fact violations of the [Stipulated Injunction] as interpreted above by the court.\u201d Notwithstanding this conclusion, the trial court ruled that Wanke was entitled to recover attorney fees from defendants in the amount of $17,655 as the prevailing party on the motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court reasoned that \u201calthough [Wanke] did not succeed in having the defendants held in contempt and did not succeed in obtaining an award of liquidated damages,\u201d Wanke did obtain a \u201cdeclaratory judgment regarding the scope and enforceability of the [Stipulated Injunction].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">2. <em>The proceedings involving AV Builders: Saratoga West</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">In September 2010, Wanke filed a motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement with respect to a different customer/job listed in the Stipulated Injunction, AV Builders: Saratoga West.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In its motion, Wanke quoted the trial court\u2019s statement of decision in which the court held \u201c \u2018that the provisions of the [Stipulated] Injunction apply only to jobs undertaken or proposed to be undertaken . . . while defendants Keck and/or Bozarth were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>employed by [Wanke].\u2019 \u201d Wanke contended that \u201c[e]ven under th[is] highly restrictive reading of the [Stipulated] Injunction,\u201d defendants had violated the Stipulated Injunction by performing work for AV Builders on the Saratoga West project. Wanke attached a declaration and supporting exhibits to its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">Defendants filed an opposition to the motion in which they argued, \u201c[o]nly when the Defendants misuse trade secret information, may Defendants be considered in breach of the [Settlement] [Agreement.\u201d Defendants further contended that \u201c[n]either Keck nor Bozarth utilized any information gained from their previous employment to unfairly compete with [Wanke] on the 2009 Saratoga West project.\u201d Defendants supported their opposition with a declaration from Keck in which he discussed the circumstances leading to AV Builders awarding WP Solutions a job on the Saratoga West project.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The trial court issued a tentative order granting Wanke\u2019s motion. In its order, the court recited its August 11 decision that the Stipulated Injunction applied to \u201cjobs undertaken or proposed to be undertaken . . . while defendants Keck and/or Bozarth were employed by [Wanke].\u201d The court proceeded to find that defendants had violated the Stipulated Injunction, as so interpreted. The court ordered defendants to pay Wanke $58,615, including $50,000 in liquidated damages and $8,615 in attorney fees. After a hearing the following day, the court confirmed its tentative order.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">3. <em>The trial court\u2019s final orders</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">On October 1, 2010, the trial court entered two orders. With respect to the contempt proceedings and Wanke\u2019s motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement as to Con Am Management, the court incorporated its August 11 statement of decision and ordered defendants to pay Wanke $17,655 in attorney fees. With respect to Wanke\u2019s motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement as to AV Builders: Saratoga West, the court ordered defendants to pay Wanke $58,615 in liquidated damages and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">D. <em>Proceedings in this court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">1. . <em>Keck and WP Solutions\u2019s appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">Keck and WP Solutions filed an appeal from the trial court\u2019s two October 1 orders. With respect to the trial court\u2019s order concerning Wanke\u2019s motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement as it pertained to Con Am Management, Keck and WP Solutions contend that the court erred in awarding Wanke attorney fees as a prevailing party. Keck and WP Solutions maintain that Wanke was not a prevailing party because the trial court determined both that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>the Stipulated Injunction was invalid, and that Keck and WP Solutions could not be found to be in contempt of the Stipulated Injunction or to have violated the Settlement Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">With respect to the trial court\u2019s order concerning Wanke\u2019s motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement as it pertains to AV Builders: Saratoga West, Keck and WP Solutions contend that the trial court erred in concluding that they violated the Stipulated Injunction and breached the Settlement Agreement by performing work for AV Builders. Specifically, Keck and WP Solutions maintain that the court erred in concluding that they could be found to have violated the Stipulated Injunction and that they were thus liable for liquidated damages, in the absence of evidence that they had misappropriated trade secrets or committed some other independently tortious conduct constituting unfair competition in performing the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">2. <em>Wanke\u2019s cross-appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">Wanke filed a cross-appeal with respect to the trial court\u2019s October 1 order denying its motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement with respect to defendants\u2019 having performed work for Con Am Management. In its cross-appeal, Wanke requests that this court \u201creverse the order of the trial court invalidating the [Stipulated Injunction]\u201d and direct the trial court to \u201cenforcfe] the . . . [Settlement [Agreement with respect to [Con Am Management].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">3. <em>Wanke\u2019s writ petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">In addition to filing a cross-appeal, Wanke also filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the trial court\u2019s October 1 order insofar as the court refused to hold Keck and WP Solutions in contempt for violating the Stipulated Injunction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In its petition, Wanke contends that the trial court erred in concluding that the Stipulated Injunction was not a lawful order and acquitting Keck and WP Solutions of contempt on that basis. Wanke requests that we annul the trial court\u2019s order discharging the OSC for contempt, and direct the trial court to hold Keck and WP Solutions in contempt.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>m.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">A. <em>Wanke\u2019s petition for writ of mandate and cross-appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">In both its petition for writ of mandate and its cross-appeal, Wanke raises the same contention, i.e., that the trial court erred in determining that the Stipulated Injunction was invalid and unenforceable as violative of Business and Professions Code section 16600.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> For the reasons explained below, we conclude that the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the federal Constitution (double jeopardy clause) precludes this court from reviewing the trial court\u2019s acquittal of Keck and WP Solutions on the contempt charges.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, we address the merits of Wanke\u2019s contention in the context of Wanke\u2019s appeal of the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">1. <em>Wanke\u2019s writ petition must be denied because the double jeopardy clause precludes the retrial of Keck and WP Solutions on the contempt charges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">In its writ petition, Wanke asks that we \u201cannul[] the trial court\u2019s order discharging the order to show cause re contempt and command[] the trial court to enter its judgment holding [Keck and WP Solutions] in contempt for violation of the [Stipulated Injunction].\u201d We conclude that the double jeopardy clause precludes this court from affording such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">a. <em>Governing law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">\u201cThe double jeopardy clause[] of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution . . . provide[s] that a person may not be twice placed \u2018in jeopardy\u2019 for the \u2018same offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v.

The <em>Dixon </em>court explained, \u201cWe have held that constitutional protections for criminal defendants other than the double jeopardy provision apply in nonsummary criminal contempt prosecutions just as they do in other criminal prosecutions.

The alleged contempts (i.e., violations of the Stipulated Injunction) did not take place in the trial court\u2019s presence, and they were adjudicated in a trial, not in a summary fashion. For the reasons that follow, we also conclude that the proceeding in the trial court was a <em>criminal </em>contempt proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">In its brief in support of its application for an OSC, Wanke requested that the court hold Keck and WP Solutions in contempt for \u201cviolating the Court\u2019s Order [(i.e., Stipulated Injunction)].\u201d At the contempt trial, when the trial court asked what \u201csentence\u201d Wanke was seeking for Keck and WP Solutions, Wanke\u2019s counsel responded that Wanke was requesting that Keck and WP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>Solutions pay a fine to the court of $1,000 per violation of the Stipulated Injunction, as provided for by statute. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1218, subd. (a).) The object of the proceeding was thus to \u201cpunish <em>past </em>conduct in violation of a court order.\u201d <em>(Nolan W., supra, </em>45 Cal.4th at p. 1237.) Wanke did not seek any \u201cforward-looking remedy imposed to coerce compliance with a lawful order of the court,\u201d as would be the case in civil contempt proceedings. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1236.)</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Further, the trial court clearly regarded the proceedings as criminal in nature, as demonstrated by the court\u2019s statement of decision, in which the court stated, \u201ca criminal contempt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d and noted that the purpose of a contempt proceeding is to \u201cuphold the dignity of the court\u2019s orders.\u201d (See <em>Nolan W., supra, </em>45 Cal.4th at p. 1236 [\u201c \u2018where the object of the proceedings is to vindicate the dignity or authority of the court, they are regarded as criminal in character even though they arise from, or are ancillary to, a civil action\u2019 \u201d].) The trial court also clearly and expressly stated that Keck and WP Solutions were \u201cacquitted\u201d of all of the contempt changes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">In its supplemental brief, Wanke suggests that the double jeopardy clause does not apply to the contempt proceeding in this case because the government did not prosecute the action, and the purpose of the double jeopardy clause is to curb abuse of <em>governmental </em>authority in legal proceedings. While we have given this contention careful consideration, and we acknowledge that the law in this area is not entirely clear, we reject Wanke\u2019s argument under the authority of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Dixon. </em>In <em>Dixon, </em>a private party prosecuted one of the two contempt proceedings at issue in that case, both of which preceded a criminal prosecution.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (See <em>Dixon, supra, </em>509 U.S. at p. 692 [\u201cCounsel for Ana Foster and her mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>prosecuted the action; the United States was not represented at trial . . . .\u201d].) Notwithstanding that a private party had prosecuted the contempt proceeding, the court held that jeopardy attached to that proceeding. In addition, the <em>Dixon </em>court expressly described Michael Foster\u2019s contempt proceeding as one for \u201ccriminal contempt\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 693), and did <em>not </em>limit its broad holding that the protection of the double jeopardy clause attaches to \u201cnonsummary criminal contempt prosecutions\u201d (509 U.S. at p. 696) to those <em>prosecuted by the government.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">One could reasonably argue that <em>Dixon should be </em>limited to nonsummary criminal contempt proceedings that are prosecuted by the government, or on its behalf, and that a contempt trial under Civil Code of Procedure section 1209 is not such a proceeding.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In his separate opinion in <em>Dixon, </em>Justice White appeared to suggest that the contempt proceeding involving Michael Foster had been brought on behalf of the government. (See <em>Dixon, supra, </em>509 U.S. at p. 727, fn. 3 (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of White, J.) [\u201cThat the contempt proceeding was brought and prosecuted by a private party in <em>Foster </em>is immaterial.

However, there is nothing in Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion for the <em>Dixon </em>court that suggests that Foster\u2019s prosecution had been brought on behalf of the United States, or that such a fact was critical to the court\u2019s holding that the double jeopardy \u201cprovision appl[ies] in nonsummary criminal contempt prosecutions . . . .\u201d <em>(Dixon, supra, </em>509 U.S. at p. 696.)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">In addition, the argument that nonsummary criminal contempt proceedings, whether prosecuted by the state or by a private party, are\u2014for lack of a more precise description\u2014sufficiently criminal in nature such that the double jeopardy clause applies, is worthy of serious consideration. In any event, there is no language in <em>Dixon </em>that would support limiting the application of the double jeopardy clause to nonsummary criminal contempt proceedings <em>prosecuted either by the government or on its behalf. </em>Because we are bound by <em>Dixon, </em>we conclude that the double jeopardy clause applies to the criminal contempt proceeding in this case, notwithstanding that it was prosecuted by Wanke.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">Wanke also contends that even if the double jeopardy clause applies to the contempt proceeding in the trial court, appellate review is permitted because Keck and WP Solutions \u201cwere not \u2018acquitted\u2019 as that term is applied in double jeopardy analysis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">\u201cAs a general rule, the elements of contempt include (1) a valid order, (2) knowledge of the order, (3) ability to comply with the order, and (4) willful failure to comply with the order. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Ivey </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 793, 798 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 447].) The trial court found that Keck and WP Solutions \u201ccannot be convicted of contempt\u201d because the Stipulated Injunction was invalid. After making this finding, the court stated that Keck and WP Solutions \u201care acquitted, and they are discharged on all 11 counts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">Wanke contends that despite the trial court\u2019s use of the term \u201cacquitted,\u201d that court\u2019s action did not amount to an acquittal for purposes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>double jeopardy clause because \u201c[t]he reliance by [Keck and WP Solutions] on a legal, as opposed to a factual, defense means that double jeopardy cannot apply to this case . . . .\u201d Wanke\u2019s contention is contrary to well-established authority pertaining to application of the double jeopardy clause. Case law makes it clear that an acquittal bars further proceedings on the charge or charges at issue, even where the acquittal is premised on a trial court\u2019s error of law. (See <em>Smith, supra, </em>543 U.S. at p. 473 [\u201c[A]ny contention that the Double Jeopardy Clause must itself . . . leave open a way of correcting legal errors is at odds with the well established mle that the bar will attach to a[n] . . . acquittal that is patently wrong in law.

The district court in <em>Ogles </em>acquitted a defendant of violating 18 United States Code section 922(a)(1)(A) based on the court\u2019s \u201cadopting] the reasoning of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>49 F.3d 251, 252 (6th Cir. 1995), which held that \u00a7 922(a)(1)(A)\u2019s prohibition against dealing in firearms without a license is not violated when the defendant has a federal firearms license, even if he sold firearms away from the licensed premises.\u201d <em>(Ogles, supra, </em>at p. 1098.) After reviewing United States Supreme Court case law concerning the meaning of an acquittal for purposes of the double jeopardy clause, the <em>Ogles </em>court rejected the government\u2019s argument that \u201cthe district court\u2019s decision rested solely on its resolution of a statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>construction issue . . . ,\u201d and therefore, that the district court\u2019s ruling was \u201ca purely legal determination unrelated to factual guilt or innocence and . . . not... a genuine acquittal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1103.) The <em>Ogles </em>court reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">\u201cIn deciding the Rule 29(a) motion [for judgment of acquittal], the district court adopted the Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 922(a)(1)(A) in <em>Caldwell </em>and concluded that the term \u2018licensed dealer\u2019 does not have a geographic component. After adopting this interpretation, the district court determined that a <em>factual element </em>of the offense\u2014-namely, that Ogles was dealing firearms without a license at the time of the challenged conduct\u2014had not been proven. Notably, the district court stated: \u2018The Court finds . . . that the defendant was a licensed dealer under the statute at the time the transaction took place. Therefore, the judgment of acquittal is appropriate as to Count [Two] of the indictment.\u2019 The judgment here was an acquittal in substance as well as form\u2014a determination that the evidence was insufficient to convict. Whether this determination was ultimately correct or \u2018egregiously erroneous\u2019 is not relevant in evaluating double jeopardy. [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">\u201cThe government suggests that because Ogles did not contest his licensed status, the district court\u2019s ruling did not meet the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of acquittal-\u2014that \u2018whatever its label, [it] actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u2019 [Citation.] The Court\u2019s double jeopardy decisions do not, however, condition an acquittal under Rule 29(a) on the district court\u2019s examination of contested facts. Here, the district court determined that a factual element of the offense had not been proved by the government. What is this if not a \u2018resolution\u2019?\u201d <em>(Ogles, supra, </em>at pp. 1103-1104.)</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">Similarly, in this case, the trial court determined that the Stipulated Injunction was invalid as drafted. As a consequence, the court found that Wanke had failed to establish a factual element of the offense\u2014the violation of a valid court order. In other words, the trial court concluded that the evidence presented at the contempt proceeding was legally insufficient to find Keck and WP Solutions in contempt. This finding constitutes an acquittal for purposes of the double jeopardy clause. <em>(Smalis, supra, </em>476 U.S. at p. 144 [\u201cWhat the demurring defendant seeks is a ruling that as a matter of law the State\u2019s evidence is insufficient to establish his factual guilt.

Accordingly, as in <em>Ogles, </em>the acquittal in this case was one both in \u201csubstance as well as form.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\">Finally, Wanke contends that we may consider the merits of its writ petition because \u201c[e]ven where the double jeopardy clause applies, an exception to the rule exists in situations in which no retrial is necessary.\u201d In support of this contention, Wanke cites to cases in which courts have cited an exception to the bar on further proceedings in the wake of an acquittal that applies <em>when there has been a jury\u2019s verdict of guilt </em>followed by a court\u2019s granting of a motion for acquittal. In such a case, reversal of the acquittal leaves in place the jury\u2019s verdict and the double jeopardy clause is not a bar to appellate proceedings: \u201cOur cases have made a single exception to the principle that acquittal by judge precludes reexamination of guilt no less than acquittal by jury: When <em>a jury returns a verdict </em>of guilty and a trial judge (or an appellate court) sets aside that verdict and enters a judgment of acquittal, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude a prosecution appeal to reinstate the jury verdict of guilty. [Citation.] <em>But if the prosecution has not yet obtained a conviction, </em>further proceedings to secure one are impermissible . . . .\u201d <em>(Smith, supra, </em>543 U.S. at p. 467, italics added.) Here, there has been no prior verdict of guilt that this court could direct to be reinstated on remand. This exception thus has no application in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Because the double jeopardy clause applies to \u201cnonsummary criminal contempt prosecutions\u201d <em>(Dixon, supra, </em>509 U.S. at p. 696) and the \u201cthe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits reexamination of a court-decreed acquittal to the same extent it prohibits reexamination of an acquittal by jury verdict\u201d <em>(Smith, supra, </em>543 U.S. at p. 467), the trial court\u2019s acquittal of Keck and WP Solutions of criminal contempt charges precludes further proceedings pertaining to those charges.

There the superior court had issued a temporary restraining order enjoining acts in violation of a certain agreement, which acts were nevertheless undertaken. Subsequently the Supreme Court of Delaware held that the agreement was void. In the meantime the superior court had issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the parties from giving any effect to the acts performed in violation of the temporary restraining order and from undertaking future acts in violation of the agreement. We held, on appeal from the order granting the preliminary injunction, that such injunction should be vacated insofar as it purported to enforce future compliance with the void agreement, but that it should be sustained insofar as it forbade recognition of the acts undertaken in violation of the temporary restraining order. In answer to the contention that the court lacked \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 to issue a temporary restraining order enforcing compliance with a void agreement, and that acts undertaken in violation of that order should therefore be given recognition, we concluded that the order suffered from no jurisdictional defect because the invalidity of the agreement did not appear upon the face of the order.\u201d <em>(Berry, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at pp. 147-148.)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">The <em>Berry </em>court further noted that the <em>\u201cSignal Oil </em>case might be considered as holding that a temporary restraining order issued on the basis of an error of law of less than constitutional stature is <em>not </em>issued in excess of jurisdiction . . . .\u201d <em>(Berry, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 148, italics added &amp; omitted; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>see <em>Signal Oil, supra, </em>49 Cal.2d at p. 776 [\u201cAt the time the orders in this case were issued, the court had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter, there was no claim that the procedural requirements of the injunction statute had not been met, and there was at least a prima facie showing of facts which would sustain the court\u2019s orders.

Arthur Andersen LLP </em>(2008) 44 Cal.4th 937, 948 [81 Cal.Rptr.3d 282, 189 P.3d 285] <em>(Edwards), </em>the Supreme Court considered whether Business and Professions Code section 16600 rendered invalid portions of a noncompetition agreement that, among other restrictions, precluded an employee from soliciting the clients of his former employer for one year after the termination of his employment with the employer. In analyzing this issue, the <em>Edwards </em>court expressly stated that it was not \u201caddressing] the applicability of the so-called trade secret exception to section 16600, as Edwards does not dispute that portion of his agreement<footnotemark>[26]</footnotemark> or contend that the provision of the noncompetition agreement prohibiting him from recruiting Andersen\u2019s employees violated section 16600.\u201d <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>at p. 946, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">In holding that the noncompetition agreement at issue in that case was invalid, the <em>Edwards </em>court stated: \u201cWe conclude that Andersen\u2019s noncompetition agreement was invalid. As the Court of Appeal observed, \u2018The first challenged clause prohibited Edwards, for an 18-month period, from performing professional services of the type he had provided while at Andersen, for any client on whose account he had worked during 18 months prior to his termination. The second challenged clause prohibited Edwards, for a year after termination, from \u2019soliciting,\u2019 defined by the agreement as providing professional services to any client of Andersen\u2019s Los Angeles office.\u2019 The agreement restricted Edwards from performing work for Andersen\u2019s Los Angeles clients and therefore restricted his ability to practice his accounting profession. (See <em>Thompson v. Impaxx, Inc.[, supra,] </em>113 Cal.App.4th [at p.] 1429 . . .

We agree. As discussed in part m.A.2.a.i., <em>ante, </em>a party may successfully defend against the enforcement of an injunction on the ground that the injunction is invalid only in the narrow circumstance in which the party can demonstrate that the injunction was beyond the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to issue in the first instance. <em>(Gonzalez, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 817.) For the following reasons, it is clear that Keck and WP Solutions made no such showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">It is undisputed that at the time the trial court issued the Stipulated Injunction, the court had personal and subject matter jurisdiction over the parties. It is also undisputed that at the time the court entered the Stipulated Injunction, Wanke had filed a lawsuit in which it contended that Keck and WP Solutions had misappropriated its trade secrets. Wanke requested that the court issue an order enjoining Keck and WP Solutions from soliciting its customers. The court entered the Stipulated Injunction as part of a final resolution of the case. Each of these facts supports the validity of the Stipulated Injunction. (See <em>Signal Oil, supra, </em>49 Cal.2d at p. 776 [concluding order was not issued in excess of its jurisdiction where \u201ccourt had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter, there was no claim that the procedural requirements of the injunction statute had not been met, and there was at least a prima facie showing of facts which would sustain the court\u2019s orders\u201d (fn. omitted)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">In addition, Keck and WP Solutions do not claim that the Stipulated Injunction was \u201cobtained in an unauthorized manner\u201d <em>(Davidson v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 514, 529 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 739]) or in violation of statutory procedures. (Compare with <em>ibid, </em>[\u201cthe 1987 stipulated order was in excess of the court\u2019s jurisdiction because it was not entered in compliance with [Code of Civil Procedures] section 664.6 or some other settlement enforcement mechanism\u201d].) Further, there is nothing on the face of the Stipulated Injunction that indicates that it is unconstitutional or that it violates a statute. (Compare with <em>Gonzalez, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 823 [\u201cwe . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>explained in <em>Berry </em>the overriding principle that an order unconstitutional on its face <em>is </em>in excess of jurisdiction . . ,\u201d].)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">On the contrary, because the Stipulated Injunction is valid to the extent that it protects Wanke\u2019s trade secrets, and one cannot conclude from the <em>face </em>of the Stipulated Injunction that it does <em>not </em>protect Wanke\u2019s trade secrets, the Stipulated Injunction is facially valid. <em>(Berry, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 148 [\u201c[In <em>Signal </em>Oil] we concluded that the order suffered from no jurisdictional defect because the invalidity of the agreement did not appear upon the face of the order.\u201d].) Indeed, by repeatedly arguing that there is <em>substantial evidence </em>to support the trial court\u2019s <em>factual </em>finding that the customer list attached to the Stipulated Injunction is not a trade secret, Keck and WP Solutions implicitly concede that the Stipulated Injunction <em>is </em>facially valid. (Cf. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>113 Cal.App.4th at p. 1430 [\u201cThe issue of whether information constitutes a trade secret is a question of fact.\u201d].)<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">Stated differently, even assuming that Keck and WP Solutions could demonstrate that the trial court erred in issuing the Stipulated Injunction because the customer list attached to the Stipulated Injunction is not a protected trade secret, such a showing would be insufficient to avoid enforcement of the injunction. That is because demonstrating that the trial court <em>erred </em>in issuing the injunction would not be sufficient to demonstrate that the court acted in \u201cexcess of its jurisdiction\u201d in doing so. (See <em>Niklas, supra, </em>211 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>Cal.App.3d at p. 35; <em>Signal Oil, supra, </em>49 Cal.2d at p. 776, fn. 6; see also <em>Gonzalez, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th 804, 818-819 [a party may \u201c \u2018disobey ... [a court] order and <em>raise his jurisdictional contentions </em>when he is sought to be punished for such disobedience\u2019 \u201d (italics added &amp; omitted; quoting <em>Berry, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at pp. 148-149)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">Our conclusion that Keck and WP Solutions have not demonstrated that the trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction in issuing the Stipulated Injunction is also supported by fundamental fairness and common sense. Keck and WP Solutions may not stipulate to an injunction that identifies certain customers whom they will not solicit, in order to resolve claims that they misappropriated Wanke\u2019s trade secrets, then proceed to violate the Stipulated Injunction and defend against its enforcement by claiming that Wanke\u2019s customer list is not a trade secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Further, even assuming that Keck and WP Solutions were permitted to collaterally attack the validity of the Stipulated Injunction, and that they could prove that the customer list attached to the Stipulated Injunction is not a trade secret, they made no such factual showing in this case. Although the trial court appeared to acknowledge in its statement of decision that <em>Morlife </em>requires a fact-specific inquiry to determine whether a customer list is a trade secret, the trial court found that the customer list attached to the Stipulated Injunction was not a protected trade secret <em>in the absence of the submission of any evidence that would support such a conclusion. </em>While Keck and WP Solutions repeatedly assert in their briefing on appeal that the trial court\u2019s factual determination is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d they cite to <em>no </em>such evidence in the record. We have thoroughly reviewed the record and conclude that there is in fact no such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Keck and WP Solutions also appear to contend that, even assuming the customer list attached to the Stipulated Injunction <em>is </em>a trade secret, the Stipulated Injunction is nevertheless invalid. Keck and WP Solutions suggest that the Stipulated Injunction is invalid because, rather than prohibiting the <em>misuse </em>of Wanke\u2019s customer list, the Stipulated Injunction prohibits <em>any </em>solicitation of the customers on the list. We are not persuaded. The <em>Morlife </em>court upheld an injunction that prohibited a group of former employees from soliciting the business of any entity that had done business with Morlife before the employees left their employment with Morlife if the employees had obtained knowledge of the customer during their employment with Morlife. <em>(Morlife, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1527-1528.) Thus, like the Stipulated Injunction, the injunction at issue in <em>Morlife </em>did not narrowly restrict the former employees\u2019 <em>misuse </em>of a customer list. Further, the <em>Morlife </em>court upheld the validity of the injunction at issue in that case because it left the former employees \u201cfree to solicit customers whose identities are not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>trade secrets of Morlife.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1528.) The same is true with respect to the Stipulated Injunction. In short, since the trial court could not conclude, based on the language of the Stipulated Injunction, that it <em>does not </em>protect Wanke\u2019s trade secrets the court erred in concluding that the Stipulated Injunction was an unlawful business restraint. (See <em>Thompson, supra, </em>113 Cal.App.4th at p. 1429 [antisolicitation covenants are valid \u201c <em>\u2018where their enforcement is necessary to protect trade secrets\u2019 \u201d </em>(italics added)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in denying Wanke\u2019s motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement as to Con Am Management.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">B. <em>Keck and WP Solutions\u2019s appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Keck and WP Solutions raise two claims in their appeal, both of which fail in light of our resolution of Wanke\u2019s cross-appeal.

This claim fails in light of our conclusion that the trial court erred in determining that the Stipulated Injunction could not be enforced as drafted. Second, Keck and WP Solutions contend that the trial court erred in enforcing the Settlement Agreement with respect to AV Builders: Saratoga West because such a ruling purportedly \u201cflatly contradicted\u201d its ruling with respect to Con Am Management that the Stipulated Injunction could not be enforced as drafted.

Scott </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 82, 91 [57 L.Ed.2d 65, 98 S.Ct. 2187], upon which Wanke relies on appeal, was not to the contrary, by stating <em>\u201cUnited States </em>v. <em>Scott </em>does not overturn these precedents; indeed, it plainly indicates that the category of acquittals includes \u2018[judgments] ... by the court that the evidence is insufficient to convict.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Smalis, supra, </em>476 U.S. at p. 144.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b939-8\"> In light of our conclusion, we need not consider Keck and WP Solutions\u2019s contention that we should exercise our discretion to deny Wanke\u2019s writ petition as untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b940-8\"> It is well established that an order denying a motion to enforce a settlement is appealable as a final judgment. (E.g., <em>Critzer v. Enos </em>(2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1251 [115 Cal.Rptr.3d 203]; <em>Hines v. Lukes </em>(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1183 [84 Cal.Rptr.3d 689].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b940-9\"> Since Wanke has not argued otherwise, we assume for purposes of this decision that, as with contempt proceedings, a party may defend against a motion to enforce a settlement agreement based on a purported violation of an injunction on the ground the injunction was issued in excess of the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction, and is therefore invalid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b942-7\"> Civil Code section 3426.1, subdivision (d), a provision contained in California\u2019s version of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA; Civ. Code, \u00a7 3426 et seq.), defines the term \u201ctrade secret\u201d as follows: \u201c(d) \u2018Trade secret\u2019 means information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that: [ft] (1) Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and H] (2) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[26]\">\n<p id=\"b944-7\">26 Although the <em>Edwards </em>court stated that the employee had not disputed \u201cthat portion of his agreement\u201d related to the trade secret exception, the opinion did not further describe the nature of this portion of the employee\u2019s noncompetition agreement. <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at p. 946, fn. 4.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b945-8\"> There are three statutory exceptions to Business and Professions section 16600. (See <em>id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 16601, 16602, 16602.5.) It is undisputed that none of these exceptions apply in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b946-7\"> With respect to the facial validity of the injunction, we emphasize that Keck and WP Solutions do not contend that the so-called trade secret exception to the enforceability of noncompetition agreements referred to by the <em>Edwards </em>court is no longer valid. (But see <em>Dowell v. Biosense Webster, Inc. </em>(2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 564, 577 [102 Cal.Rptr.3d 1] [\u201cwe doubt the continued viability of the common law trade secret exception to covenants not to compete . . .\u201d].) On the contrary, Keck and WP Solutions state in their briefing on appeal, \u201c[Business and Professions Code] section 16600 prohibits employee noncompetition agreements unless the agreement falls within a statutory exception (which does not apply here) or is <em>necessary to protect the former employer\u2019s confidential trade secret information.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Further, Keck and WP Solutions make no argument that section 16600 precludes the enforcement of an injunction that is necessary to protect an employer\u2019s trade secrets. Rather, Keck and WP Solutions rely on <em>Morlife </em>and <em>Retirement Group </em>and the cases cited therein, and acknowledge that \u201can employee is free to \u2018solicit\u2019 the customers of its former employer <em>so long as the employee does not use confidential or trade secret information </em>belonging] to the former employer to do so.\u201d (Italics added.) Accordingly, we assume for purposes of this decision that, as Keck and WP Solutions state in their briefing on appeal, \u201cthe misuse of trade secret information ... may be properly enjoined by agreement under [Business and Professions Code] section 16600.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b946-8\"> For example, Keck and WP Solutions contend, \u201c[T]he trial court made the threshold factual determination that the customer information which Wanke sought to enjoin was not wrongfully obtained by [Keck and WP Solutions], but was common knowledge. . . . That factual determination was supported by substantial evidence . . . .\u201d With respect to the merits of Keck and WP Solutions\u2019s contention, there is no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the customer list attached to the Stipulated Injunction is not a trade secret.
