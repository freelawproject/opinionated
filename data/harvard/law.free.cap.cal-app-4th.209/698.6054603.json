J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW7\">Vera Nelson appeals an order recommitting her to the State Department of Mental Health for one year as a mentally disordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>offender (MDO). (Pen. Code,\u00a7 2960 et seq.) Nelson contends the trial court erred by (1) admitting the details of hearsay evidence in medical reports on which expert witnesses relied in forming their opinions that by reason of her severe mental disorder she continued to pose a physical threat to others; (2) allowing expert witnesses to instruct the jury on MDO law and usurp the jury\u2019s factfinding role; and (3) inadequately instructing the jury. We affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In 2002 Nelson was living in a care facility for the mentally ill. Nelson and her roommate had been drinking in their room and an argument erupted. Nelson grabbed her roommate and flung her across the room, causing her to hit a dresser and fall. While she was lying on the floor, Nelson beat her and kicked her in the head, yelling \u201cget up bitch.\u201d Several days later the roommate died from a brain injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">In 2004 the People filed an information charging Nelson with voluntary manslaughter (Pen. Code, \u00a7 192, subd. (a); count 1) and battery with serious bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 243, subd. (d); count 2). As to count 2, the information alleged Nelson personally inflicted great bodily injury within the meaning of Penal Code section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Nelson pleaded guilty to count 1 in exchange for a stipulated three-year prison term and the dismissal of count 2 and the personal infliction allegation. In March 2005 she was committed to Patton State Hospital (Patton) as an MDO, and in 2008, 2009, and 2010 the court issued orders granting the People\u2019s petitions for one-year extensions of her commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">In November 2010 the People petitioned for an additional one-year extension of Nelson\u2019s commitment. A jury trial was held in June 2011. In a motion in limine, the prosecution sought an order allowing it to submit all reliable evidence on which its experts reasonably relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">The People sought to introduce \u201cInterdisciplinary Notes\u201d made by Patton staff members recording three incidents of Nelson\u2019s aggression against other persons during the preceding year. One of the incidents began about 8:50 p.m. on January 2, 2011, and continued to about 1:00 a.m. the next day. Nelson complained to staff that her roommate was playing her radio too loudly. Staff told the roommate to turn the radio down and she complied. Staff left the room, and a few minutes later they heard yells for help. Staff returned and found Nelson choking her roommate. Staff was required to separate Nelson from her roommate. Nelson stated, \u201cthat bitch won[\u2019]t let me sleep, she turned her radio up again.\u201d Nelson was given medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Before long, Nelson attempted to return to her room. When staff attempted to redirect her, she picked up a trash can and threw it at staff, requiring them to activate a safety alarm. When reinforcements arrived, Nelson began swinging at staff with a closed fist. She continued \u201cto fight and struggle,\u201d and she was placed in \u201c5 point restraints for protection of others.\u201d From that point until the incident ended, Nelson continued to \u201cmistreat\u201d staff and spit at staff. She told staff, \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you all up, I am going to one by one,\u201d and, \u201cI\u2019m going to get all of you one by one. I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">On the evening of January 4, 2011, Nelson grabbed another patient by her upper arms and threw her to the floor. Approximately 10 minutes later, when staff was counseling Nelson, she ran toward the patient as if to attack her again. Staff grabbed Nelson\u2019s shirt to hold her back, but the shirt tore and she grabbed the patient and would not let go. Nelson \u201cbegan hissing, spitting and kicking at staff.\u201d Staff wrestled Nelson to the floor and placed her in restraints, as she yelled, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill all you bitches,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll let you bum,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll blow your heads off with a shotgun,\u201d and \u201cKeep me in seclusion and I\u2019m going to show you all what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow night.\u201d Again, Nelson was medicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The third incident occurred on October 12, 2010. A staff member named Dean heard yelling coming from a bathroom. Dean opened the door of the bathroom as Nelson was starting to leave. Dean went to a stall and found a patient sitting on the toilet screaming, \u201cShe hit me. Look at my eye.\u201d Dean noted \u201cslight redness and abrasion to right eye of patient.\u201d After some discussion Dean learned the altercation was over a cigarette.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The People argued the Interdisciplinary Notes were admissible under the business records and public records exceptions to the hearsay rale (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1271, 1280).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The People also argued the threats by Nelson to harm or kill staff members were admissible under section 1220, the party admission exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Nelson also filed a motion in limine. The motion acknowledged the hearsay in the Interdisciplinary Notes was \u201cclearly relevant\u201d to the experts\u2019 opinions on continued risk of harm. Nelson sought a limiting instruction that the hearsay was not admissible to prove the truth of stated matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">The court determined a limiting instruction was unwarranted because the Interdisciplinary Notes had a dual purpose. In addition to assisting the experts in forming their opinions, the hearsay was independently admissible to show the truth of the stated matters under section 1280. As to the multiple hearsay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>in the note on the bathroom incident, the court also found admissibility under section 1240, the spontaneous statement exception to the hearsay rule, and section 1250, the physical condition component of the state-of-mind exception. The court determined the hearsay was trustworthy and reliable because the recording of the bathroom incident was \u201cclose enough in time\u201d to its occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The prosecution presented two expert witnesses, Richard G. Rappaport, M.D., a forensic psychiatrist, and Randy Stotland, Ph.D., a psychologist. Before Dr. Rappaport\u2019s testimony, the court admitted the Interdisciplinary Notes into evidence. Dr. Rappaport testified he reviewed the notes and interviewed Nelson to determine whether she met MDO criteria. He explained she continued to suffer from schizophrenia, a psychotic disorder in which the patient is out of touch with reality and characteristically has hallucinations and delusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The prosecution had Dr. Rappaport read the Interdisciplinary Notes to the jury. In addition, he testified Nelson volunteered to him during the interview that she \u201chad assaulted two women in recent months.\u201d Dr. Rappaport\u2019s report states: \u201cShe did acknowledge that she had several episodes of anger, two fights in the past year, one with ... a patient, who she told to get out of her room when the patient was talking to her roommate.\u201d Nelson admitted she hit the patient and knocked her to the floor, and nurses wrote her up for the conduct. She also admitted she \u201chad a fight with another patient . . . , a roommate, and accused her of being noisy and talking loud at night, which is the reason for her hitting her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Dr. Rappaport testified that while Nelson had improved as to \u201cthe symptoms of hallucinations and delusions,\u201d and she was asymptomatic during the interview, she was not in remission as evidenced by \u201crepeated episodes of aggressiveness and violence with other people.\u201d He added that \u201cher behavior is not controllable on her part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Dr. Stotland testified he met with Nelson, but she declined an interview. He considered her lack of cooperation a red flag because \u201cwhen somebody has committed the type of crime she has, . . . they need to demonstrate that they are being cooperative, that they are no longer a danger. And by being cooperative with staff and evaluating physicians that\u2019s the way you show that you no longer are a danger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">Dr. Stotland testified he had evaluated Nelson in previous years, and she continued to suffer from paranoid schizophrenia. Based on the Interdisciplinary Notes, he believed her conduct was attributable to schizophrenia. Dr. Stotland testified that the January 4, 2011 incident was most distressing because it \u201cis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>so similar to the original manslaughter. She takes this woman and grabs her and throws her down to the floor, very similar to the original offense, same type of behavior.\u201d Dr. Stotland believed Nelson\u2019s illness was not in remission because \u201cshe continue[d] to show this instability and the agitation and getting into fights with people and assaulting people.\u201d Thus, in his view Nelson continued to pose a danger of physical harm to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Nelson presented no evidence. The parties had stipulated that exhibits may go into the jury room during deliberations, and the court allowed the jury to have exhibits 1 through 7, which are the Interdisciplinary Notes. The jury returned a verdict finding Nelson was an MDO, and the court ordered a one-year extension of her commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">\n<em>MDO Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">\u201cAn MDO proceeding is civil, rather than criminal, in nature.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fisher </em>(2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1013 [91 Cal.Rptr.3d 609].) \u201cThe Mentally Disordered Offender Act (MDO Act), enacted in 1985, requires that offenders who have been convicted of violent crimes related to their mental disorders, and who continue to pose a danger to society, receive mental health treatment during and after the termination of their parole until their mental disorder can be kept in remission. [Citation.] Although the nature of an offender\u2019s past criminal conduct is one of the criteria for treatment as [an MDO], the MDO Act itself is not punitive or penal in nature. [Citation.] Rather, the purpose of the scheme is to provide MDO\u2019s with treatment while at the same time protecting the general public from the danger to society posed by an offender with a mental disorder.\u201d <em>(In re Qawi </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1, 9 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 780, 81 P.3d 224].)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">\u201cCommitment as an MDO is not indefinite; instead, \u2018[a]n MDO is committed for . . . one-year period[s] and thereafter has the right to be released unless the People prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he or she should be recommitted for another year.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lopez v. Superior Court </em>(2010) 50 Cal.4th 1055, 1063 [116 Cal.Rptr.3d 530, 239 P.3d 1228].) A recommitment \u201crequires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the patient has a severe mental disorder; (2) the disorder \u2018is not in remission or cannot be kept in remission without treatment\u2019; and (3) by reason of that disorder, the patient represents a substantial danger of physical harm to others.\u201d <em>(People v. Burroughs </em>(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1404 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 729]; see Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2970, 2962.) The phrase \u201c \u2018cannot be kept in remission without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>treatment\u2019 \u201d means \u201cthat one of four specified acts have occurred during the previous year\u2014a violent act except in self-defense, a serious threat, intentional property damage or failure to follow the treatment plan.\u201d <em>(People v. Burroughs, </em>at p. 1407.)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">\n<em>Admissibility of Interdisciplinary Notes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AMj\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Nelson acknowledges the expert witnesses properly relied on the Interdisciplinary Notes in forming their opinions. She asserts, however, that because they contain hearsay and multiple hearsay, the trial court erred by allowing the experts to discuss them in detail, providing the jury with them during deliberations, and refusing her request for a limiting instruction. We disagree with Nelson\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Hearsay is evidence of an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of its contents. <em>(People v. Ortiz </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 377, 389 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 914].) Hearsay is inadmissible unless it comes within an exception to the hearsay rule. (\u00a7 1200.) Multiple hearsay is admissible if each layer falls within an exception to the hearsay rule. (\u00a7 1201.)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">\u201cAn expert witness may express an opinion based on information without regard to the information\u2019s admissibility in evidence.\u201d <em>(People v. Chapman </em>(1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 149, 178 [67 Cal.Rptr. 601]; see \u00a7 801, subd. (b).) Mental health experts routinely rely on interview reports and observations of nontestifying experts. <em>(People v. Cooper </em>(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 731, 746-747 [56 Cal.Rptr.3d 6]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dodd </em>(2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1564, 1569 [35 Cal.Rptr.3d 692].) \u201cA qualified expert is entitled to render an opinion on the criteria necessary for an MDO commitment, and may base that opinion on information that is itself inadmissible hearsay if the information is reliable and of the type reasonably relied upon by experts on the subject. [Citations.] A trial court, however, may not admit an expert opinion based on information furnished by others that is speculative, conjectural, or otherwise fails to meet a threshold requirement of reliability.\u201d <em>(People v. Dodd, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at p. 1569.)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">\u201cHearsay relied upon by experts in formulating their opinions is not testimonial because it is not offered for the truth of the facts stated but merely as the basis for the expert\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>(People v. Cooper, supra, </em>148 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.) \u201cThe reason is clear; if hearsay is admitted for a nonhearsay purpose, it does not mm upon the credibility of the hearsay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>declarant, making cross-examination of that person less important. The hearsay relied upon by an expert in forming his or her opinion is \u2018examined to assess the weight of the expert\u2019s opinion,\u2019 not the validity of their contents.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Nelson relies on this general rule: \u201c \u2018While an expert may state on direct examination the matters on which he relied in forming his opinion, he may not testify as to the <em>details </em>of such matters if they are <em>otherwise inadmis</em>sible.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Coleman </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 69, 92 [211 Cal.Rptr. 102, 695 P.2d 189], italics added, disapproved of on another point in <em>People v. Riccardi </em>(2012) 54 Cal.4th 758 [144 Cal.Rptr.3d 84, 281 P.3d 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 416 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610] [\u201cexpert may not under the guise of stating reasons for an opinion bring before the jury incompetent hearsay evidence\u201d].) \u201cThe trial court has considerable authority and discretion to prevent the wholesale admission of incompetent hearsay, such as by resort to its discretion provided in . . . section 352 and by its use of instructions to the jury.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra, </em>148 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Here, however, the trial court determined the Interdisciplinary Notes the experts relied on were not \u201c \u2018otherwise inadmissible.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Coleman, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 92.) Rather, the court ruled the notes were independently admissible for the truth of their contents under statutory exceptions to the hearsay rule. When hearsay is admitted from other sources, expert witnesses are \u201cnot precluded from reiterating the same facts during their direct examination.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dean </em>(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 186, 193 [94 Cal.Rptr.3d 478] <em>(Dean).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The court admitted the Interdisciplinary Notes under section 1280, the public records exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018The object of this hearsay exception \u201cis to eliminate the calling of each witness involved in preparation of the record and substitute the record of the transaction instead.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Bhatt </em>v. <em>State Dept, of Health Services </em>(2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 923, 929 [35 Cal.Rptr.3d 335] <em>(Bhatt).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Additionally, on the patient\u2019s report to a hospital staff member that Nelson struck her in the eye, the court relied on the spontaneous statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>exception under section 1240,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the physical sensation component of the state-of-mind exception under section 1250 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018 \u201cTo render [statements] admissible [under section 1240] it is required that (1) there must be some occurrence startling enough to produce this nervous excitement and render the utterance spontaneous and unreflecting; (2) the utterance must have been before there has been time to contrive and misrepresent, i.e., while the nervous excitement may be supposed still to dominate and the reflective powers to be yet in abeyance; and (3) the utterance must relate to the circumstance of the occurrence preceding it.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Thomas </em>(2011) 51 Cal.4th 449, 495 [121 Cal.Rptr.3d 521, 247 P.3d 886].)  A declaration of then existing pain is admissible under section 1250 <em>(In re Tanya P. </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 66, 70 [174 Cal.Rptr. 533]), because it has essentially the same indicia of reliability as a spontaneous statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The People also argued the Interdisciplinary Notes were admissible under section 1271, the business records exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As with section 1280, the object of the business records exception is \u201cto eliminate the necessity of calling each witness, and to substitute the record of the transaction or event.\u201d <em>(Loper </em>v. <em>Morrison </em>(1944) 23 Cal.2d 600, 608-609 [145 P.2d 1].) Additionally, for Nelson\u2019s threats to harm or kill staff members the People cited section 1220, the exception for party admissions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (10) \u201cThe rationale underlying this exception is that the party cannot object to the lack of the right to cross-examine the declarant since the party himself [or herself] made the statement.\u201d (Cal.

The People claim the foundation was adequate because Patton produced the notes pursuant to a subpoena duces tecum. \u201c \u2018Although similar to the business records exception [(\u00a7 1271)], the official records exception differs in one important respect. . . . [S]ection 1271 \u201crequires a witness to testify as to the identity of the record and its mode of preparation in every instance. In contrast, . . . [s]ection 1280 . . . permits the court to admit an official record or report without necessarily requiring a witness to testify as to its identity and mode of preparation <em>if the court takes judicial notice or if sufficient independent evidence shows that the record or report was prepared in such a manner as to assure its trustworthiness.\u201d </em>\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bhatt, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at p. 929.)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Nelson, however, failed to preserve appellate review by raising a foundational objection at trial. Her in limine motion was directed solely to the expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>witnesses\u2019 reliance on hearsay to the extent it was otherwise inadmissible. The motion does not address statutory exceptions to the hearsay rule. At the hearing, the court had no inkling of any foundational problem because Nelson agreed \u201cthe People do not have to lay an additional foundation to say that these documents are the documents from the record.\u201d When the court later admitted into evidence the Interdisciplinary Notes for the truth of stated matters, Nelson\u2019s counsel stated that \u201cother than the previous objection made, we have no objection to that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">\u25a0 \u201c \u2018 \u201c[(Questions relating to the admissibility of evidence will not be reviewed on appeal in the absence of a specific and timely objection in the trial court <em>on the ground sought to be urged on appeal.\u201d </em>\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v.

The failure to raise a specific objection to the admission of evidence results in forfeiture of appellate review. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Doolin </em>(2009) 45 Cal.4th 390, 434 [87 Cal.Rptr.3d 209, 198 P.3d 11].) Nelson could not sit idly by and expect relief on appeal. Had she brought foundational problems to the court\u2019s attention, the People presumably could have rectified them.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">In addition to forfeiting review of the admission of hearsay under sections 1271 and 1280, Nelson raised no objection to the court\u2019s reliance on sections 1240 and 1250 insofar as the bathroom incident is concerned. On appeal, she mentions sections 1240 and 1250, and the party admission exception on section 1220, only in passing. She does not claim the statutes were inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">In any event, any arguable error in admitting the Interdisciplinary Notes was harmless under both the state \u201creasonable probabilities\u201d standard <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 837 [299 P.2d 243]) and the federal \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824]) because there was other competent evidence of Nelson\u2019s continued violence. Nelson forthrightly admitted to Dr. Rappaport during her interview that she was recently violent toward other patients in two incidents. Nelson conceded that in one incident she struck a patient and knocked her to the floor, a scenario reminiscent of the voluntary manslaughter charge that resulted in her original commitment. Nelson ignores the admissions she made to Dr. Rappaport.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">Nelson did object to the admission of the Interdisciplinary Notes under sections 1271 and 1280 on the ground they were \u201ctestimonial\u201d in nature, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>thus violated her right of confrontation and cross-examination. Nelson cited <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004) 541 U.S. 36 [158 L.Ed.2d 177, 124 S.Ct. 1354] <em>(Crawford), </em>in which the United States Supreme Court held that in a criminal case the Sixth Amendment\u2019s confrontation clause prohibits the \u201cadmission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless [the witness] was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d (541 U.S. at pp. 53-54.)</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">An MDO proceeding, however, is a civil proceeding. \u201cThere is no right to confrontation under the state and federal confrontation clause in civil proceedings, but such a right does exist under the due process clause.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Otto </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 200, 214 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 327, 26 P.3d 1061].) The Sixth Amendment and due process confrontation rights are not coextensive. <em>(Otto, </em>at p. 209.) Due process in a civil proceeding \u201cis not measured by the rights accorded a defendant in criminal proceedings, but by the standard applicable to civil proceedings.\u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court (Howard) </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 136, 154 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 481].)</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In civil proceedings, \u201c \u2018[d]ue process requires only that the procedure adopted comport with fundamental principles of fairness and decency. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not guarantee to the citizen of a state any particular form or method of procedure.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Parker </em>(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1453, 1462 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 167].) In <em>Otto, </em>our high court explained that the due process rights of a sexually violent predator (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6604) depend on several factors, including \u201cthe government\u2019s interest, ... the function involved, and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement[s] would entail.\u201d <em>(People v. Otto, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 214.)</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Although the Sixth Amendment is inapplicable, \u201cSixth Amendment cases . . . may provide helpful examples in determining the scope of the more limited right of confrontation held by probationers under the due process clause.\u201d <em>(People v. Johnson </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1409, 1412 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 230].) <em>Crawford </em>explained the Sixth Amendment is concerned with a \u201cspecific type of out-of-court statement.\u201d <em>(Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. at p. 51.) <em>Crawford </em>notes, however, that the term \u201capplies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 68.)</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Nelson contends the Interdisciplinary Notes were \u201ctestimonial\u201d because the \u201cprosecutor\u2019s use of these reports, as well as the experts\u2019 reliance on them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>indicates they were prepared, at least in part, for use at trial, leading an objective person to reasonably believe they would be used in that manner.\u201d In <em>People v. Cage </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 965 [56 Cal.Rptr.3d 789, 155 P.3d 205] <em>(Cage), </em>however, the California Supreme Court noted that <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. 36 mentioned, but did not expressly endorse, an objective test for determining whether hearsay was testimonial. <em>(Cage, supra, </em>at p. 984, fn. 14.) <em>Cage </em>explains that <em>Davis v. Washington </em>(2006) 547 U.S. 813 [165 L.Ed.2d 224, 126 S.Ct. 2266] <em>(Davis) </em>\u201cnow confirms that the proper focus is not on the mere reasonable chance that an out-of-court statement might later be used in a criminal trial. Instead, we are concerned with statements, made with some formality, which, <em>viewed objectively, </em>are for the <em>primary purpose </em>of establishing or proving facts for possible use in a criminal trial.\u201d <em>(Cage, </em>at p. 984, fn. 14; see <em>Davis, supra, </em>at pp. 822, 828, 830.) Nelson ignores <em>Davis </em>and <em>Cage.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">We conclude the Interdisciplinary Notes are not testimonial in nature, and thus the due process right of confrontation does not arise. The notes were recorded by hospital staff members for purposes of discipline and the safety of other patients and staff, and the treatment of Nelson required by her conduct. The notes do not suggest staff was concerned with possible future litigation. \u201c \u2018Where nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framers\u2019 design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law ....\u2019\u201d <em>(People v. Johnson, supra, </em>121 Cal.App.4th at p. 1413.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Moreover, there is no ground for reversal because any possible error of federal constitutional dimension was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. at p. 24.) Again, Nelson admitted to Dr. Rappaport that her violence toward others had continued, and one incident was remarkably similar to the underlying crime leading to the original commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">III, IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Haller, J., and Irion, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 3, 2013, S205852.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-10\"> Further statutory references are also to the Evidence Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-9\"> Section 1280 provides: \u201cEvidence of a writing made as a record of an act, condition, or event is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when offered in any civil or criminal proceeding to prove the act, condition, or event if all of the following applies: [ft] (a) The writing was made by and within the scope of duty of a public employee, [ft] (b) The writing was made at or near the time of the act, condition, or event, [ft] (c) The source of information and method and time of preparation were such as to indicate its trustworthiness.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b593-7\"> Section 1240 provides: \u201cEvidence of a statement is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement: [ft] (a) Purports to narrate, describe, or explain an act, condition, or event perceived by the declarant; and [ft] (b) Was made spontaneously while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by such perception.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\"> Section 1250 provides: \u201c(a) Subject to Section 1252, evidence of a statement of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind, emotion, or physical sensation (including a statement of . . . pain, or bodily health) is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when: [ft] (1) The evidence is offered to prove the declarant\u2019s state of mind, emotion, or physical sensation at that time or at any other time when it is itself an issue in the action; or [ft] (2) The evidence is offered to prove or explain acts or conduct of the declarant.\u201d Under section 1252, \u201cEvidence of a statement is inadmissible under this article if the statement was made under circumstances such as to indicate its lack of trustworthiness.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b593-9\"> Section 1271 provides: \u201cEvidence of a writing made as a record of an act, condition, or event is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when offered to prove the act, condition, or event if: [ft] (a) The writing was made in the regular course of a business; [ft] (b) The writing was made at or near the time of the act, condition, or event; [ft] (c) The custodian or other qualified witness testifies to its identity and the mode of its preparation; and [ft] (d) The sources of information and method and time of preparation were such as to indicate its trustworthiness.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b593-10\"> Section 1220 provides: \u201cEvidence of a statement is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when offered against the declarant in an action to which he is a party in either his individual or representative capacity, regardless of whether the statement was made in his individual or representative capacity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b594-8\"> Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Reyes </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 486 [116 Cal.Rptr. 217, 526 P.2d 225] <em>(Reyes), </em>Nelson asserts that \u201caccording to Supreme Court authority, psychiatric records are inadmissible under the business records exception of. . . section 1271.\u201d <em>Reyes </em>made no such blanket ruling.
