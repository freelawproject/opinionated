(Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 387.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant contends (1) the order must be reversed because of failures to comply with the inquiry and notice provisions of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA) (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901 et seq.) and (2) the order improperly delegated to respondent Sacramento County Department of Health and Human Services (the Department) complete discretion to decide whether appellant would receive visitation with the minors. We conclude that both contentions are procedurally barred: Appellant lacks standing to raise her first contention, and her second contention is forfeited for failure to object to the court\u2019s visitation order. Therefore, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Because appellant\u2019s contentions do not require us to discuss the case\u2019s history in depth, we give only an abbreviated summary of relevant facts and procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The minors (Austin A., bom in April 2001, and Michael A., bom in September 2003) were detained in August 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Appellant claimed that the paternal great-grandmother was an enrolled member of the Muscogee Creek tribe and the paternal great-grandfather had Cherokee heritage; therefore, the Department sent the ICWA notice in September 2004 to three Cherokee and five Creek tribes. After the tribes had returned negative responses or had not responded, the juvenile court found at the jurisdictional/dispositional hearing in October 2004 that the ICWA did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">The juvenile court ordered the minors placed in foster care with reunification services for the parents. In May 2005, however, the parents\u2019 services were terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">In June 2005, the juvenile court placed the minors in appellant\u2019s custody under dependent supervision. In September 2005, the court ordered a permanent plan of placement in appellant\u2019s care with a long-term goal of legal guardianship. In January 2007, the court granted appellant de facto parent status.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">The Department consistently doubted that appellant could qualify as a prospective adoptive parent or legal guardian.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But since the minors were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>bonded to her and appeared to be making some progress, and their special needs made them hard to place elsewhere, they remained in her home until March 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Based on repeated reports by the Department throughout 2010 that the minors were suffering from neglect in appellant\u2019s custody and that she appeared unable to care for them properly, in January 2011 the juvenile court ordered a new permanent plan of \u201cout of home placement with an appropriate stable placement with a specific goal of legal guardianship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">In March 2011, the Department filed section 387 petitions seeking the minors\u2019 removal from appellant\u2019s custody and their transfer to foster care.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The detention report recommended weekly supervised visitation for appellant at the social worker\u2019s discretion until it was deemed appropriate to allow unsupervised visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">After a contested jurisdictional/dispositional hearing on the petitions, the juvenile court ordered the minors removed from appellant\u2019s custody and placed with their current caretaker with a goal of legal guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">As to appellant\u2019s visitation, the juvenile court ordered: \u201cThe grandparent(s) . . . may have visitation with the children . . . , consistent with the children\u2019s well being [sic]. The Department . . . shall determine the time, place, and manner of visitation, including the frequency of visits, length of visits, and whether the visits are supervised and who supervises them. The Department\u2019s discretion shall extend to determining if and when to begin unsupervised overnight and weekend visits. . . .\u201d The court referee also stated orally: \u201cI hope that [appellant] will remain actively involved in the children\u2019s lives and will visit them regularly. ... I hope that you will continue to visit and be a positive influence in the children\u2019s lives.\u201d Appellant did not object to the visitation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">I. ICWA Notice and Inquiry</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">Appellant contends the juvenile court and the Department failed to comply with the ICWA\u2019s inquiry and notice provisions at the outset of the proceedings, and because the court did not readdress the ICWA after the section 387 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>petitions were filed, this failure was never corrected. Respondent contends that this contention is barred on grounds of standing and forfeiture, and lacks merit in any event. We agree with respondent that appellant lacks standing to raise any ICWA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Under the ICWA, \u201c[a]ny Indian child who is the subject of any action for foster care placement or termination of parental rights under State law, <em>any parent or Indian custodian from whose custody such child was removed, </em>and the Indian child\u2019s tribe may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate such action upon a showing that such action violated any provision of sections 1911, 1912, and 1913 of this title.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u201c \u2018[Pjarent\u2019 means any biological parent or parents of an Indian child or any Indian person who has lawfully adopted an Indian child . . . .\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(9).)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\u201c \u2018Indian custodian\u2019 means any Indian person who has legal custody of an Indian child under tribal law or custom or under State law or to whom temporary physical care, custody, and control has been transferred by the parent of such child____\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(6).)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">A \u201cgrandparent\u201d is defined by the ICWA as an \u201c \u2018extended family member,\u2019 \u201d not as a parent. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(2).) The ICWA\u2019s definitional provisions do not mention de facto parents. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903.)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">California\u2019s legislation implementing the ICWA adopts these provisions without change. Section 224, subdivision (e) restates the federal standing provision (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914) in substantively identical terms. Section 224.1, subdivisions (a) and (c) state that the terms \u201cparent,\u201d \u201cIndian custodian,\u201d and \u201cextended family member\u201d shall be defined as in the federal law. (See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903.)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Thus, under the plain terms of federal and state law, a grandparent or a de facto parent lacks standing to bring an ICWA challenge unless he or she qualifies as an \u201cIndian custodian.\u201d (See <em>In re S.M. </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1114-1115, fn. 3 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 606] [\u201cquestioning]\u201d standing under the ICWA of grandparent/de facto parent who is not an Indian custodian, but not deciding the issue because a parent was also raising an ICWA claim]; see generally <em>In re J.B. </em>(2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 751, 757-758 [100 Cal.Rptr.3d 679] [applying statutory construction rule <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>to the ICWA].)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">Appellant does not address the plain language of the statutes or attempt to show that she could claim standing as an \u201cIndian custodian.\u201d (Indeed, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>does not even consider the question of standing in her opening brief.) Instead, she asserts in her reply brief: (1) the Department\u2019s claim that she lacks standing relates only to the original proceedings, not to the section 387 proceedings; (2) if the minors are found to be Indian children and a tribe intervenes, she will have preference for placement as a relative (cf. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1912, 1915(b)(1)); (3) because \u201cappellant\u2019s placement-consideration rights are therefore interwoven with the rights of the children as to the application of the provisions of the [ICWA] and relevant state law, she had standing (see <em>In re Patricia E. </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 1, 6 [219 Cal.Rptr. 783])\u201d; and (4) the appellate court in <em>In re S.M., supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th 1108, left the question of a grandparent/de facto parent\u2019s ICWA standing open. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Appellant cites no authority and makes no argument to explain how she could have standing to raise the ICWA on appeal from a section 387 order if she did not have it to begin with. We do not consider assertions made without supporting argument or authority. <em>(Amato v. Mercury Casualty Co. </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1784, 1794 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 73]; <em>Kim v. Sumitomo Bank </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 974, 979 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 834].)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument as to relative placement preference is a non sequitur. Whether she would have such preference if the minors were found to be Indian children is irrelevant to whether she has standing to claim the ICWA error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>In re Patricia E., supra, </em>174 Cal.App.3d 1, on which appellant relies, is not an ICWA case and is therefore inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Finally, although <em>In re S.M., supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th 1108 did not squarely hold that a grandparent or de facto parent lacks standing under the ICWA, its discussion leaves no doubt that the court would have so held if the parent who was simultaneously appealing had not also asserted the ICWA violations. <em>(In re S.M., </em>at pp. 1114-1115, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">For all the above reasons, we conclude that appellant lacks standing to raise an ICWA claim under the plain terms of federal and state law. We therefore need not consider respondent\u2019s alternative argument that appellant lacks standing because she is not \u201caggrieved\u201d by the order being appealed. Nor need we address respondent\u2019s further procedural claim of forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Because appellant lacks standing to raise any claim of an ICWA error, we do not reach the merits of her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>II. Visitation Order<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The orders removing the minors from appellant\u2019s custody and granting visitation to appellant at the Department\u2019s discretion are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Hull, Acting P. J., and Mauro, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-12\"> Undesignated statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b547-13\"> Appellant had a history of criminal convictions and of child protective services involvement with her biological children; in addition, she used medical marijuana daily, and addiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>was suspected. She failed an adoption home study for these reasons, which the Department thought would also probably preclude legal guardianship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b548-14\"> The petitions alleged the juvenile court had found the minors\u2019 placement with appellant to be inappropriate; appellant had failed to follow the orders and recommendations of the court and the Department as to with whom the minors could safely and appropriately interact; and appellant had failed to meet the minors\u2019 educational, emotional, and physical needs. The court had suspended appellant\u2019s educational rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b550-10\"> In any event, given the juvenile court\u2019s undisputed findings that appellant is unable to care for the minors, we see no possibility, even if the ICWA were found to apply, that the court would exercise the ICWA\u2019s relative-placement preference for appellant\u2019s benefit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 661.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
