Appellant is a manufacturer jobber and dealer in wooden ware in Chicago. Appellee is a manufacturer of pails at Keene, N. H. In the summer of 1899 an interview took place between them at Keene. According to appellee the \u201csubject of five-pound pails came up; he (appellant) expressed a wish to handle my goods in the western market. We talked awhile and I came up town with him; possibly conversation would lead him to think that I would later do business with him.\u201d Appellant; testifies appellee \u201c said he had about three customers in the western country that he was supplying; if I would keep away from those three customers he would let me handle the rest of the trade out here, which I agreed to do. Told me he would give me all the goods I wanted; I told him I would probably want two carloads for a starter; \u2018All right,\u2019 he said, \u2018I will send you two carloads for a starter.\u2019\u201d Thereafter appellee sent appellant a sample five-pound jelly pail, and answering his letter of inquiry, wrote him as follows :</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-7\" pgmap=\"237\">\u201c Keene, N. IL, Aug. 7, 1899.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-8\" pgmap=\"237\">Hr. F. K. Higbie,</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-9\" pgmap=\"237\">Dear. Sir: Your letter of August 5th at hand and noted. In reply will say I will send you what five-pound jelly pails you may want at 40c doz. F. O. B. Keene, and will allow \"5 per cent for cash in 10 days, but should expect you to keep away from the Glucose Sugar Ref. Co., Chicago, St. Louis Ref. Co., St. Louis, and Farrell &amp; Co., Omaha, Neb. Respectfully,</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-11\" pgmap=\"237\">J. P. Rust.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-4\" pgmap=\"238\">On September 5, 1899, appellant ordered from appellee 500 dozen jelly pails, and on September 30, 3,500 dozen more. These orders were filled, and appellee brought this suit to recover a balance due thereon.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-5\" pgmap=\"238\">On October 12, 1899, appellant sent appellee an order for a small car of the pails (meaning 3,500 dozen), to which, on October 16, appellee replied as follows:</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-6\" pgmap=\"238\">\u201c Your order for small car five-pound jelly7- pails has been received and noted. I do not see how I can ship before the 10th of November.. I had on my books previous to your order one for 3.500 dozen, about two weeks\u2019 run, and then yours would have to be made, and I will do the best I can to give \\7ou the goods promptly.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-7\" pgmap=\"238\">On October 28, 1899, appellant wrote appellee the following letter:</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-8\" pgmap=\"238\">\u201c Since writing you asking you to ship another carload of five-pound jellies, I find that you shipped my other order in two small cars, and the party I sold the goods to stated one carload would be all he wanted just now, so do not send another carload until I advise you. Just as soon as I dispose of this one I will advise you, but I do not want to get too many in the warehouse.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-9\" pgmap=\"238\">November 4, 1899, appellant wrote appellee that \u201cjust as soon as I can dispose of one of these cars which I have in the warehouse I will send for another car, and will immediately send you instructions on the same.\u201d November 17, 1899, appellant requested appellee to ship him a car of the pails, but appellee refused to ship them.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-10\" pgmap=\"238\">In the suit brought by appellee, appellant filed a plea of the general issue and notice of set-off, claiming that there was a completed contract between the parties wdth reference to the order for 3,500 dozen pails given by appellant in October, and that he had suffered damages by reason of appellee\u2019s breach of the contract in failing and refusing to ship the pails.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-11\" pgmap=\"238\">At the close of the testimony'the court took the case from the jury and directed a verdict for $360, the amount still owdng appellee upon the September orders. This appeal is from a judgment entered on the verdict.</p><attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b239-3\" pgmap=\"239\">S. A. and W. G. French, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b239-5\" pgmap=\"239\">Hoyne, O\u2019Connor &amp; Hoyne, for appellee.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b239-6\" pgmap=\"239\">Mr. Justice Stein</author> <p id=\"AM8\" pgmap=\"239\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b239-7\" pgmap=\"239\">It is not disputed that appellant owed appellee the \u00a7360, for which the latter recovered judgment, and the only question is whether the trial court erred in holding tin t. there was no contract between the parties excepting for the September orders.</p> <p id=\"b239-8\" pgmap=\"239(300) 240(61)\">Appellant\u2019s position is that appellee\u2019s letter of August 7 in connection with the previous interview between them, was a continuing offer subject to revocation at any time, but while unrevoked was converted into a distinct contract by each order of goods from time to time. Looking at the testimony in the most favorable view for appellant, it cannot be said that any obligations arose against either party out of what happened during their summer interview at Keene. Nothing was said about any certain amount of goods to be sold by the one or to be bought by the other, or about the prices to be charged. Nor was any offer made by appellee capable of subsequent acceptance by appellant. The former\u2019s statement of his willingness to let appellant have all the goods he wanted was not an offer in the legal sense of that term. If appellant had accepted it then and there, no contract would have resulted for want of mutuality. Appellant might not want any goods, and he would have been under no obligation to order or accept any. Drake v. Vorse, 52 Ia. 417; Wrisley Co. v. Alkali Works, 107 Ill. App. 379, and cases cited on p. 382; Hoffmann v. Maffioli, 104 Wis. 630; Bailey v. Austrian, 19 Minn. 635, discussed and considered in Furnace Co. v. Manuf\u2019g Co., 110 Ill. 427. The letter of appellee of August 7, upon which appellant next relies, does not better his position. Its language does not indicate that it was intended as an offer but rather as a quotation of prices and a solicitation of orders. Appellant does not seem to have himself regarded it as an offer; so far as appears he did not accept it nor even acknowledge receipt of the letter. Even had the supposed offer been formally accepted, it would not have constituted a contract. A promise by appellant to buy what pails he might want, although the prices and terms of purchase were fixed, was too vague and indefinite for enforcement against him. He was under no obligation to buy any pails. There was no mutuality. See authorities cited supra.</p> <p id=\"b240-4\" pgmap=\"240\">It remains to be determined whether a contract was created by the subsequent correspondence between the parties. To appellant\u2019s order of October 12, appellee answered October 16, as shown in the preceding statement. If this letter operated as an acceptance of the order (which is doubtful), the order was cancelled and countermanded by appellant\u2019s letter of October 28, which directs appellee \u201c not to send another car until I advise you.\u201d This was not a direction to hold the car previously ordered until advised, but to send none at all unless appellant should thereafter desire one.</p> <p id=\"b240-6\" pgmap=\"240\">^ The court ruled correctly in refusingTo^.uhmilJiQ.tlie^iiiry the question whether there was a contract. ( Where there is no dispute as to the la.mnia.gp. of the pa.rti^sJiwfuhlmii.o.rn 1 or in writing) which it is claimed establishes the contract, the question of its existence is purely one of law. In such case it is for the court to construe the_language and see whether the elements of a contract are present. But when there is a dispute as~to what languagajwas used\u2014as there almost always is when a contract by parol is relied on\u2014the jury \"will determine from the proof the question of fact as to the words actually used by the parties and then apply to their finding the law as given them by the court concerning the essentials of a contract.</p> <p id=\"A_7\" pgmap=\"240(79) 241(109)\">So far as the letters that passed between the parties are concerned there was and could be no dispute as to their contents. Nor was there error in not leaving it to the jury to say whether any agreement was entered into at the interview in Keene during the summer of 1899. As we have seen, taking appellant\u2019s own version of what was then said, the minds of the parties did not meet. Even if the October correspondence gave rise to a contract as claimed by appellant, still he was not harmed by the court\u2019s withdrawal of the case from the jury. The suit was brought to recover the balance due on the two orders for goods given in September, transactions entirely distinct from what took place in October. Appellant\u2019s damages for appellee\u2019s refusal to ship him the goods mentioned in the October order were unliquidated. Such damages arising out of a contract unconnected with the subject-matter of the plaintiff\u2019s suit cannot be set off in that suit. DeForrest v. Oder, 42 Ill. 500; Clause v. Printing Press Co., 118 Ill. 612.</p> <p id=\"b241-4\" pgmap=\"241\">The judgment of the Superior Court-is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b241-5\" pgmap=\"241\">Affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
