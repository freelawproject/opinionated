This is an appeal from a judgment for three thousand dollars recovered by appellee against appellant in the Superior Court in an action for personal injuries. The declaration contains two counts. The first alleges that the defendant carelessly and negligently ran its car upon and against the plaintiff and injured her; the second, that the defendant by its servants, did wantonly and wilfully drive and run its car upon and against the plaintiff and injure her. There was a plea of not guilty.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-10\" pgmap=\"195(41) 196(68)\">The evidence showed that the plaintiff at the time of the injury was between ten and eleven years of age; that she started to cross Randolph street from the northwest corner of Ann. Defendant had in Randolph street two street car tracks, the north, the west-bound, the south, the east-bound; the distance between the tracks is four feet and ten inches. A wagon was going west in the north track, andan electric car of defendant east in the south track. Plaintiff crossed the north track immediately behind the wagon, passed the space between the tracks onto the south track and then was struck by said electric car and injured.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-5\" pgmap=\"196\">John A.

A child of ten years may be guilty of such contributory negligence as to bar his recovery for injuries caused by the negligence of another. Heinmann v Kinnare, 190 Ill. 156.</p> <p id=\"b196-10\" pgmap=\"196(12) 197(79)\">m this case it is contended by the appellant that the evidence conclusively shows that plaintiff was guilty of such contributory negligence as to preclude her recovery upon the ground of the negligence of the defendant. With this contention we cannot agree, but hold that the question whether plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence was a question for the jury. The case was not. however, submitted to the jury upon the issue joined as to the negligence of the defendant and the exercise of proper care of plaintiff alone.</p> <p id=\"b197-4\" pgmap=\"197\">Plaintiff, as we have seen, charged in the second count of her declaration that defendant wantonly and wilfully injured her. If the jury found for her under that count, they would have no occasion to inquire or decide whether her act and conduct in stepping upon the south track of defendant when a car in plain sight not far away was coming toward her, did or did not constitute negligence. The case was submitted to the jury upon the issues joined upon the second as well as upon those joined upon the first count, upon the charge that defendant wantonly and wilfully injured her as well as upon the charge that it did so negligently. The instructions requested by defendant were so modified as to submit to the jury the issue joined upon the second as well as those joined on the first count. Two of the instructions so modified are as follows, the modifications consisting in adding the clauses here printed in italics:</p> <blockquote id=\"b197-5\" pgmap=\"197\">9. \u201c If the jury believe, from the evidence under the instructions of the court that there was no negligence or \u25a0toilful and wanton conduct on the part of the defendant in operating said car at the time and place in question, but that nevertheless the plaintiff was injured, then the court instructs the jury to find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b197-7\" pgmap=\"197(94) 198(71)\">13. If the jury believe from the evidence, under the instructions of the court, that the plaintiff was negligent and that her negligence, if any, was the sole cause of the injury herein complained of (and that there was no such wilful and wanton conduct on the part of the defendant as charged in said second count), then they should return a verdict of not guilty, or even if the jury believe from the evidence that the defendant was negligent, still, if the jury believe from the evidence, under the instructions of the court, that the plaintiff at the time of the alleged injury failed to exercise ordinary care for one of her age, discretion and experience for her own safety, and that such failure, if any, proximately helped in any way to bring about the accident which resulted in the alleged injury to the plaintiff, then they should return a verdict of not guilty (under the first count of said declaration).\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"AnU\" pgmap=\"198\">Whether the second count and the issues joined thereon should have been submitted to the jury depends upon the question whether the record discloses evidence upon which the jury might properly find the issues upon that count for plaintiff\u2014might find that the defendant wantonly or wilfully injured the plaintiff. There is in the record no evidence tending to show that the motorman in control of the car which struck the plaintiff saw plaintiff in time to stop the car and avoid injuring her, nor any evidence from which an inference that he purposely and intentionally ran his car against her can justly be drawn. In the absence of evidence of actual intention to injure, the decision of the question under consideration turns upon the question whether from the evidence,' drawing from it the inferences and conclusions most unfavorable to the defendant which they might justly and properly draw, the jury in this case might find that the negligence of the mptorman of the defendant was so gross as to amount to wilful or wanton conduct on his part. Bo witness testified that the car was going at an unusual rate of speed or at a rate greater than that permitted by the ordinances of the city. But one of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses expressed an opinion as to the rate of speed in miles per hour of the car, and he, after stating that it was going at the regular rate, that he could not tell how many miles per hour it was going, in answer to the question how fast in his judgment it was going, said it was going fifteen miles per hour. Some of the other witnesses say that the- car was- going at ordinary speed; others that it was going at less than ordinary .speed; and there is the usual conflict of testimony as to whether a gong was sounded or other signal given as the car approached Ann street.</p> <p id=\"b198-6\" pgmap=\"198(16) 199(296)\">In L. S. &amp; M. S. R. R. Co. v. Bodemer, 139 Ill. 596, it w\u00e1s held by a divided court that the injury to the plaintiff in that case would be regarded as the result of \u201c such gross want of care and regard for the rights of others as to justify the presumption of wilful ness or wantonness.\u201d In the course of the opinion it was said : \u201cWhat is meant by such gross negligence as evidences wilfulness % \u2018It is such a gross want of care and regard for the rights of others as to justify the presumption of wilfulness or wantonness.\u2019 2 Thompson on Negligence, 1264, sec. 52. It is such gross \u2022negligence as to imply a disregard of consequences, or a willingness to inflict injury. Deering\u2019s Law of Negligence, sec. 29.\u201d In that case a iailroad passenger train drawn by a locomotive \u201c was travelling at the unusual speed of 35 or 40 miles per hour in the crowded city of Chicago; over street crossings upon unguarded tracks * * * in conceded violation of a city ordinance as to speed and without warning of the approach of the train by ringing a bell.\u201d Here an electric car with one trailer was running on a public street at the ordinary and permitted rate of speed, and assuming that no signal was given as the car approached Ann street, in our opinion the negligence of the motorman was not such as to imply a \u201c disregard of consequences or a willingness to inflict injury,\u201d nor such as to justify or support the presumption or inference of xvantonness or wilfulness, and, therefore, in our opinion, the court erred in modifying the instruction a'sked for by the defendant and thereby submitting to the jury the question whether the defendant wantonly or\u201e wilfully injured the plaintiff.</p> <p id=\"b199-4\" pgmap=\"199(93) 200(90)\">But there is another objection to the modification of some if not all of the instructions which were modified. The ninth instruction as asked by the defendant was as follows : \u201cIf the jury believe from the evidence under the instructions of the court that there was negligence on the part of the defendant in operating said car at the time and place in question, but that nevertheless the plaintiff was injured, then the court instructs the jury to find the defendant not guilty.\u201d As modified and given it was as follows: \u201cIf the jury believe from the evidence under the instructions of the court that there was no negligence (or wilful and wanton conduct) on the part of the defendant in operating said car at the time and place in question, but that nevertheless the plaintiff was injured, then the court instructs the jury to find the defendant not guilty.\u201d The modification might be proper if there had been any evidence that the motorman purposely or intentionally injured the plaintiff, but in this record there is no such evidence.</p> <p id=\"b200-5\" pgmap=\"200\">The contention of appellee is that the evidence shows such gross negligence on the part of the motorman as to warrant a jury in drawing the inference of wanton and wilful conduct on his part. Plaintiff\u2019s right to a verdict on either count is based upon the negligence of the defendant. Before the jury could find a verdict in the case upon either count they must find that the acts and conduct of the motorman in the control of the car which injured plaintiff amounted to negligence. True, to find the defendant guilty under the second count, they must find a much greater degree of negligence than was required to find a verdict of guilty under the first count, but under the second count they must first find the fact of gross negligence and then infer from the fact of gross negligence the fact of wilful or wanton conduct. '</p> <p id=\"b200-6\" pgmap=\"200\">The ninth instruction as given, in effect tells the jury that they may find the defendant guilty of wanton or wilful conduct although they believe from the evidence \u201c that there was no negligence on the part of the defendant in operating said car at the time and place in question.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b200-7\" pgmap=\"200\">In our opinion, for the reasons and upon the grounds indicated, it was error to give to the jury this instruction as modified. We are further of opinion that the defendant was entitled to have said instruction given to the jury as asked, to have the court instruct the jury in terms \u201c that if they believed from the evidence that there was no negligence on the part of defendant in operating said car at the time and place in question they should find' the defendant not guilty,\u201d and no such instruction was given in this case.</p> <p id=\"b201-3\" pgmap=\"201\">The judgment of the Superior Court will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b201-4\" pgmap=\"201\">Reversed and remanded.</p> <author id=\"b201-5\" pgmap=\"201\">Mr. Justice Stein</author> <p id=\"AIS\" pgmap=\"201\">having presided at the hearing of this case in the trial court, did not participate in the foregoing decision.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
