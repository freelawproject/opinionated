No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372, which respectively lowered the base offense levels and mandatory minimum sentences for crack-cocaine offenses. Abrams contends that, notwithstanding the fact that he was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B 1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, instead of the crack-cocaine guidelines found in \u00a7 2D1.1, he is entitled to a sentence reduction under Amendment 750 and the FSA in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), and <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-25\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority to grant a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012). Section 3582 authorizes a district court to reduce a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>defendant\u2019s prison term if it was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>we held that \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment,\u201d such as Amendment 750, \u201creduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d 541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A) (explaining that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction is not authorized if the relevant amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Because Abrams\u2019 guidelines range was driven by his career offender designation, instead of the crack-cocaine guidelines in \u00a7 2D1.1, he is not entitled to a sentence reduction based on Amendment 750 because it did \u201cnot alter the sentencing range upon which his ... sentence was based.\u201d <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. While Abrams contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman, </em>which concerned eligibility for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief for defendants who enter into plea agreements under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C), called our <em>Moore </em>decision into question, we have already held that <em>Freeman </em>did not overrule <em>Moore </em>and extend \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief to defendants sentenced based on the career offender guideline. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1320-21. We are bound by that holding under the prior panel precedent rule even if, as Abrams insists, <em>Lawson\u2019s </em>analysis was wanting or flawed. <em>See Smith v. GTE Corp., </em>236 F.3d 1292, 1303 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201c[W]e categorically reject any exception to the prior panel precedent rule based upon a perceived defect in the prior panel\u2019s reasoning or analysis as it relates to the law in existence at that time.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">Abrams is also not entitled to relief under the FSA because, as we have also held, the FSA is not a guidelines amendment implemented by the Sentencing Commission, but a statutory change enacted by Congress, and the FSA does not otherwise apply to defendants, like Abrams, who were originally sentenced before the Act took effect on August 3, 2010. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012). Contrary to Abrams\u2019 assertion, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dorsey, </em>which held that the FSA\u2019s lower mandatory minimums apply to pre-Act offenders sentenced after its effective date, did not suggest that the FSA should apply retroactively to defendants sentenced before its enactment. <em>See id. </em>at 378 (\u201cThe Supreme Court in <em>Dorsey </em>carefully confined its application of the FSA to pre-Act offenders who were sentenced after the Act\u2019s effective date.\u201d). Accordingly, the district court properly found that it was not authorized to grant Abrams a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction based on either Amendment 750 or the FSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
