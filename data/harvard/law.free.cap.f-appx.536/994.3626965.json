James challenges the decision to increase her criminal history category level from III to V. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-23\">The district court did not err by departing upward two levels from the criminal history category level of III provided in James\u2019s presentence investigation report. A district court may depart from the recommended sentencing range \u201c[i]f reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of [her] criminal history or the likelihood that [she] will commit other crimes.\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1) (Nov. 2012). The district court reasonably determined that James\u2019s criminal history of III failed to reflect her recidivism and her \u201cprolific criminal history\u201d that consisted of 17 prior misdemeanor convictions, including 13 convictions for petit theft, and two prior felony convictions for forgery and selling cocaine. <em>See United States v. Riggs, </em>967 F.2d 561, 563 (11th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>901 F.2d 988, 989 (11th Cir.1990). James argues that \u201cher criminal history is a prod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>uct of\u2019 the death of her father and of \u201cher drug abuse,\u201d but James amassed several convictions before her father\u2019s death and continued her life of crime after completing two rounds of drug counseling and a comprehensive treatment program. The district court reasonably determined that James \u201cmore accurately fit into a criminal history category of [V],\u201d and James does not contest the degree of that departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">We AFFIRM James\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
