On appeal, Mr. Brewer contends that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because he was eligible for a sentence reduction, and a number of mitigating factors supported his motion. He also argues that the district court erred by relying on the same facts to deny his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion that it used to determine his original sentence, and by depriving him of the opportunity to contest the facts from the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) that the court relied upon in denying his motion. Having considered the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">In 1996, a jury found Mr. Brewer guilty of the following: (1) conspiring to possess with intent to distribute, and to distribute, cocaine and cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (Count 1); (2) distributing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Counts 5-6); (3) employing a person under the age of 18 to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 861(a) (Count 8); and (4) using a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (Count 9). According to the PSI, from 1992 to 1995, Mr. Brewer and an associate ran a drug operation in which they distributed crack cocaine (at least 1.925 kilograms) and powder cocaine. During this time, Mr. Brewer operated a car wash that posed as a front for much of the drug activity. In 1994, two separate incidents of gun violence were linked to his drug operation. Mr. Brewer also employed a 14-year old individual to distribute the drugs for him at one point during the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">Mr. Brewer\u2019s convictions on Counts One, Five, Six, and Eight were grouped together for sentencing purposes. Using the Sentencing Guidelines applicable at the time, the PSI calculated a base offense level of 38, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, because his offenses involved more than 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base. The PSI then raised Mr. Brewer\u2019s offense level to 39, under \u00a7 2D1.2, for his use of an individual under 18 in a narcotics offense. The PSI also applied a four-level increase, under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), for Mr. Brewer\u2019s leadership role in the offense, as well as a two-level increase, under \u00a7 3C1.1, for obstruction of justice. This placed Mr. Brewer\u2019s total offense level at 45. Mr. Brewer had no prior criminal history. As a result, based on an adjusted offense level of 45 and a criminal history category of I, his recommended sentence under the then-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines was life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">At sentencing, the district court adopted the PSI\u2019s factual recitation and guideline calculations. The court sentenced Mr. Brewer to life imprisonment on Count One, 20 years\u2019 imprisonment on Count Five, 40 years\u2019 imprisonment on Count Six, and 85 years\u2019 imprisonment on Count Eight, all to run concurrently. Additionally, the court imposed a statutorily mandated 60-month consecutive sentence for Count Nine. The district court entered a final judgment, and Mr. Brewer appealed. On appeal, we affirmed Mr. Brewer\u2019s convictions and sentences on Counts One, Five, Eight, and Nine, but vacated Count Six on double jeopardy grounds. <em>See United States v. Brewer, </em>199 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2000). The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>imposed the same sentences on remand, and Mr. Brewer again received a total sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\">In 2011, Mr. Brewer filed the present <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, arguing that the district court had the authority to reduce his total sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) after enactment of Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines. He asserted that the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as well as his post-sentencing conduct \u2014 which included completing several courses and passing the General Education Development (\u201cGED\u201d) test \u2014 supported granting his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">In analyzing the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court correctly noted that Mr. Brewer\u2019s total offense level had decreased from 45 to 41, and that his amended sentencing guideline range was now 324 to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment, plus the statutorily mandated 60 months for Count Nine. Nonetheless, the court declined to grant Mr. Brewer\u2019s request for a sentence reduction. He then filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">We review a district court\u2019s decision not to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cAn abuse of discretion can occur where the district court applies the wrong law, follows the wrong procedure, bases its decision on clearly erroneous facts, or commits a clear error in judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>415 F.3d 1257, 1266 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">Mr. Brewer argues that the district court erroneously relied on his offense and ignored his post-conviction rehabilitation conduct in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. When considering a motion for a sentence reduction, the district court undertakes in a two-step analysis: (1) the court must recalculate the sentence under the amended sentencing guidelines by determining the new base level under the amended guideline range and using that new base level to determine a new sentence; and (2) the court must consider the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) and determine, in its discretion, whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). During the first step, only the amended sentencing guideline is changed; all other guideline application decisions remain the same. <em>See id. </em>Under the second step, the district court \u201cmust consider the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as well as public safety considerations, and <em>may consider </em>the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct, in evaluating whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s sentence is warranted and the extent of any such reduction.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n.1(B)) (emphasis added). The district court is \u201cnot required to articulate specifically the applicability, if any, of each factor, as long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account.\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), \u201c[t]he court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary ...\u201d to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, adequately deter criminal conduct, protect the public, and provide the defendant with needed correctional treatment. Additionally, the court must consider the nature and circumstance of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the sentencing guideline range, any pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines revised the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in \u00a7 2D1.1(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750. As a result, the revised \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) now gives Mr. Brewer a base offense level of 34 because his case involved 1.925 kilograms of cocaine base, which falls between the range of 840 grams and 2.8 kilograms in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(3). After applying his unaffected level increases to the amended base offense level, Mr. Brewer\u2019s total offense level decreased from 45 to 41, giving him an amended guideline range of 324 to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment, plus the additional 60 months for Count 9. Thus, Mr. Brewer was eligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Because Mr. Brewer was eligible for a sentence reduction, the district court had to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the public\u2019s safety, and then use its discretion to determine whether his sentence should be reduced. <em>See Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1256. The district court relied upon the following factors to conclude that Mr. Brewer was \u201ca dangerous individual from whom society should be protected as long as possible\u201d and deny his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion: (1) Mr. Brewer\u2019s obstruction of justice by attempting to influence a witness; (2) the fact that, \u201cfor years,\u201d Mr. Brewer had carried out his drug operation out of his car wash business; (3) the substantial quantity of crack cocaine involved; (4) the gun-related violence involved in his drug operation; and (5) Mr. Brewer\u2019s use of a 14-year old to carry out the drug transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Mr. Brewer argues that the district court gave undue weight to his offense conduct and erred by considering the same factors that it did at sentencing. We disagree. First, we ordinarily leave the weight to be accorded to any given sentencing factor to the \u201csound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>See United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). Here, the district court stated that it considered the pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and then explained that Mr. Brewer\u2019s sentence should not be reduced given the severity of his criminal conduct. <em>See </em>D.E. 991, 991-1 (sealed). Given the gun violence associated with Mr. Brewer\u2019s drug activity and his use of a minor to carry out drug transactions, we do not find the district court\u2019s evaluation to be an abuse of discretion. Second, it was not error for the district court to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when deciding Mr. Brewer\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Under the two-step <em>Bravo </em>analysis, the district court is explicitly required to consider those factors when making its decision. <em>See id. </em>at 781 (\u201cThe next step is for the court to decide whether, in its discretion, it will elect to impose the newly calculated sentence under the amended guidelines or retain the original sentence. This decision should be made in light of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">Mr. Brewer also argues that the district court ignored his post-conviction rehabilitation conduct in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Although we have held that the court <em>may </em>consider defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct, we have never held that it must. <em>See Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1256; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n.1(B). Thus, even if the district court chose to not consider Mr. Brewer\u2019s post-conviction conduct, it was not an abuse of discretion to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">Mr. Brewer finally contends that the district court erred by failing to allow him an opportunity to contest the offense conduct upon which it relied in denying his motion. But he concedes that the district court did not rely on any new information in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>cordingly, Mr. Brewer is not entitled to re-litigate the facts relied on at his original sentencing. <em>See United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1245 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cBecause a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is not a <em>de novo </em>re-sentencing, courts need not permit re-litigation of any information available at the original sentencing.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">The district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Brewer\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
