In 2006, Grier pleaded guilty, without the benefit of a written plea agreement, to distribution of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C) (Count One); possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (Count Two); and distribution of five grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B) (Count Three). Count Three carried a statutory mandatory minimum penalty of five years\u2019 imprisonment. Count Two also carried a five-year minimum prison sentence, to run consecutively to any other sentence imposed. The district court sentenced Grier to a total of 130 months\u2019 imprisonment as follows: as to Counts One and Three, 70 months\u2019 imprisonment each, to run concurrently with one another; and as to Count Two, 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, to run consecutively to the sentence imposed for Counts One and Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-14\">In 2008, Grier filed a motion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court reduced, by 10 months, Grier\u2019s sentence as to Counts One and Three, which resulted in 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory minimum for Count Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-15\">The district court denied Grier\u2019s second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 750 and the FSA, and it is the denial of that motion from which Grier now appeals. On appeal, Gri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>er argues that (1) the FSA, in conjunction with Amendment 750, should be applied retroactively to reduce his sentence, and (2) his original sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission (his previous sentence reduction notwithstanding).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the Sentencing Guidelines and the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Liberse, </em>688 F.3d 1198, 1200 n. 1 (11th Cir.2012). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment that was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statement, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, provides that \u201c[a] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment ... is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if ... [the] amendment ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). The commentary to the 2011 version of the Guidelines defines \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d as the \u201crange that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n.1 (A)). The commentary further provides that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction is not authorized and not consistent with \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) where \u201cthe amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines amended the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2D1.1(c) to reduce offense levels in crack cocaine cases. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750. It was made retroactive by Amendment 759, effective November 1, 2011. <em>See id., </em>Amend. 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">We recently held that the FSA may not be used to reduce a sentence pursuant to a \u00a7 3582 motion because it was a congressional statutory change and not a guidelines amendment issued by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012). Further, interpreting the general savings clause, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, we also stated that the FSA has not been made retroactively applicable to sentences imposed before its 2010 enactment. <em>Id.; see also Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2326, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012) (holding that the FSA\u2019s reduced statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums apply to defendants who committed crack cocaine offenses before August 3, 2010, but were sentenced after the date the FSA went into effect).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">In <em>Hippolyte, </em>we also recently held that the district court properly denied the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion where the defendant was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence for a pre-FSA offense involving cocaine base. <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 540-42 (11th Cir.2013), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. June 12, 2013) (No. 12-10828), \u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 181, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -, 2013 WL 3063110. Noting that the FSA did not apply retroactively, we explained that the defendant\u2019s guideline range was the statutory minimum at the time of his sentencing, and thus Amendment 750 did not lower his guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 541-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-15\">We conclude from the record that the district court properly denied Grier\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction. Grier\u2019s argument that the FSA authorizes the district court to reduce his sentence is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Berry, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>where we explained that the FSA is not an amendment to the Guidelines authorized by the Sentencing Commission, and thus, it cannot serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction in Grier\u2019s case. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. Moreover, Amendment 750 would not lower Grier\u2019s applicable guideline range because (1) Grier\u2019s sentence as to Count Three was already reduced to the pre-FSA statutory minimum; and (2) the FSA does not apply retroactively to defendants such as Grier who were sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)); <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Grier\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
