First, Cooper argues that the district court plainly erred by not affording him an opportunity for allocution at sentencing. The government concedes this error. Second, Cooper contends that the district court improperly characterized his 2006 Washington state third-degree rape conviction as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, leading to an incorrect base offense level of 20 under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree with the district court that Washington\u2019s third-degree rape statute is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the sentencing guidelines, but we nonetheless vacate the sentence and remand to provide Cooper an opportunity for allocution.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">When a party fails to object to a district court\u2019s ruling, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>661 F.3d 568, 583 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether Cooper\u2019s prior conviction is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Cortes-Salazar, </em>682 F.3d 953, 954 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure require that the district court \u201caddress the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate [his] sentence.\u201d Fed.R.CrimP. 32(i)(4)(A)(ii). During the sentencing hearing, the district court failed to provide Cooper an opportunity for allocution, but Cooper failed to object at the time the sentence was imposed. On appeal, the government concedes the district court plainly erred. [Appellee Br. at 6-7.] Accordingly, based on the government\u2019s confession of error, Cooper\u2019s sentence must be vacated and this case remanded to the district court to provide Cooper an opportunity for allocution.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-15\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-16\">Under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), the base offense level for a violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1) is 20 if the defendant has a prior felony conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined in \u00a7 4B 1.2(a). Section 4B 1.2(a) in turn defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-17\">any offense under federal or state law punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-18\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-19\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-20\"><em>Id. </em>Application Note 1 of the Commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2 further defines crimes of violence as including \u201cforcible sex offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.2, cmt. n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>Third-degree rape under the statutory provision for which Cooper was convicted occurs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-4\">when, under circumstances not constituting rape in the first or second degrees, such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person, not married to the perpetrator ... [w]here the victim <em>did not consent </em>as defined in [Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7] 9A.44.010(7) [ (1999) ] <em>to sexual intercourse </em>with the perpetrator and <em>such lack of consent was clearly expressed </em>by the victim\u2019s words or conduct[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 9A.44.060(l)(a) (1999) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court relied upon the residual clause of \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2) and found that this provision of Washington\u2019s third-degree rape statute<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> constitutes a crime of violence because the crime was \u201cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">To fall within the residual clause, the commission of \u00a7 9A.44.060(l)(a) must both ordinarily pose a serious potential risk of physical injury, and that injury must be similar in kind and degree to the risk posed by the generic forms of burglary of a dwelling, arson, extortion, or the use of explosives. <em>See Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 141-42, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 1584, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008) (Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) context); <em>United States v. Owens, </em>672 F.3d 966, 968 (11th Cir.2012) (same).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c[W]e consider the offense as defined by the law, rather than considering the facts of the specific violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1350 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">On appeal, the government contends that it is clear from the face of \u00a7 9A.44.060(1)(a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that Cooper\u2019s third-degree rape conviction constitutes a crime of violence because commission of the offense requires that the victim unambiguously refuse consent to sexual intercourse. This, the government contends, could \u201cend in confrontation leading to violence,\u201d <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 2273, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011) (describing the risk of danger in the burglary context), because the perpetrator must overcome the victim\u2019s resistance to commit the crime. Such a risk is similar in kind and degree as burglary, the government argues, and therefore, \u00a7 9A.44.060(1)(a) is a crime of violence within the meaning of the residual clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">As a preliminary matter, we note that commission of this offense poses a serious risk of physical injury. In the context of statutory rape, that is, crimes where the victim may factually \u2014 though not legally\u2014 consent to sexual intercourse, we have found that such crimes pose a serious risk of physical injury. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>608 F.3d 1222, 1230 (11th Cir.2010) (holding that commission of rape under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>Florida\u2019s statutory rape law poses risk of serious physical injury); <em>United States v. Ivory, </em>475 F.3d 1232, 1236-37 (11th Cir.2007), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Owens, </em>672 F.3d 966, 971 (11th Cir.2012) (finding that commission of rape under Alabama\u2019s statutory rape law poses risk of serious physical injury). It follows, then, that engaging in sexual intercourse with another person who has clearly expressed that he or she does <em>not </em>consent to the act poses a serious risk of physical injury as well. <em>Cf. United States v. Riley, </em>183 F.3d 1155, 1158-59 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that even where no coercion or force is used to commit the crime of attempted simple rape, the offense presented serious potential risk of injury because \u201cthe nature of this offense creates an atmosphere that fosters the potential for physical confrontation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">We next turn to the question of whether this risk is similar in kind and degree to the risk posed by the commission of burglary of a dwelling. Where, as here, the state need not prove intent or knowledge, <em>see State v. Elmore, </em>54 Wash.App. 54, 771 P.2d 1192, 1193 (1989), <em>Begay </em>instructs that we ask whether the conduct at issue in the statutory offense is \u201cpurposeful, violent[,] and aggressive,\u201d like the enumerated crimes of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). 553 U.S. at 144-45, 128 S.Ct. at 1586. The <em>Begay </em>Court distinguished between the enumerated crimes in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) \u2014 burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives \u2014 and crimes that impose strict liability and criminalize conduct \u201cto which the offender need not have had any criminal intent at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 128 S.Ct. at 1586-87. Based on this holding, we have held that while statutory rape poses a risk of serious injury, the crime is not a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B 1.2 or a violent felony under the ACCA because the crime is a strict liability offense. <em>Owens, </em>672 F.3d at 972; <em>Harris, </em>608 F.3d at 1232-33. Therefore, commission of the offense does not typically involve purposeful, violent, or aggressive conduct. Indeed, an unknowing perpetrator may be liable though the victim has factually consented to the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">But the Washington statute is different; it criminalizes sexual intercourse with a victim who has clearly refused consent to the act \u2014 a significantly more purposeful and potentially aggressive crime than statutory rape. And while Washington\u2019s third-degree rape statute, unlike its first and second degree statutes, <em>see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 9A.44.040(1), 9A.44.050(1)(a), does not require proof of force used to overcome the victim\u2019s resistance, there remains the serious potential risk that the victim\u2019s lack of consent escalates the encounter into a violent or aggressive one.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">Therefore, we hold that \u00a7 9A.44.060(l)(a) is a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2), and thus, the district court correctly determined Cooper\u2019s base offense level was 20 under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">Accordingly, based on the government\u2019s confession of error, we vacate Cooper\u2019s sentence and remand with direction to re-sentence after providing Cooper an opportunity for allocution. However, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that Cooper\u2019s base offense level is 20 under \u00a7 2K2.1 (a)(4)(A) because he previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>committed a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-13\">. Cooper also argues that the sentence-appeal waiver contained in his plea agreement is not valid because the district court did not specifically discuss the sentence-appeal waiver at the plea hearing. However, we need not reach this issue because, on appeal, the government does not attempt to enforce its agreement with Cooper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b888-8\">. \u201cConsent,\u201d in turn, \u201cmeans that at the time of the act of sexual intercourse or sexual contact!,] there are actual words or conduct indicating freely given agreement to have sexual intercourse or sexual contact.\u201d \u00a7 9A.44.010(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b888-9\">. Under \u00a7 9A.44.060(1)(b), a person also commits third-degree rape \"[w]here there is a threat of substantial unlawful harm to property rights of the victim.\u201d Subsection (b) is not at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b888-15\">. We have repeatedly recognized that the definition of \"violent felony\u201d under the ACCA is virtually identical to the definition of \"crime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2; thus, our holdings in ACCA cases apply equally to \u00a7 4B1.2 cases. <em>See, e.g., Archer, </em>531 F.3d at 1352.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b888-16\">. In light of <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), the government has abandoned its argument that the specific facts of Cooper's offense demonstrate he committed a crime of violence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b889-7\">. Because we conclude that a conviction under \u00a7 9A.44.060(l)(a) constitutes a crime of violence within the meaning of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)\u2019s residual clause, we need not reach the government\u2019s alternative argument that the crime is a \"forcible sexual offense\u201d within the meaning of Application Note 1 of Commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
