Lugo does not argue that his 100 month sentence is substantively unreasonable, but argues only that the district court committed procedural error and incorrectly calculated the applicable guidelines range by imposing a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c). <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-23\">Whether a defendant was a leader or organizer under \u00a7 3B1.1 is a factual determination that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 204 (5th Cir.2005). Given the record evidence that Lugo paid his cousin to act as a scout for Lugo\u2019s criminal activities, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred. <em>See id.; United States v. Turner, </em>319 F.3d 716, 725 (5th Cir.2003) (\u201cWhen the evidence demonstrates that a defendant directed another in his drug trafficking activities ... sentence enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1(c) is appropriate.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
