Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Burns pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B)(iii). He was found responsible for 24.18 grams of crack cocaine. Due to his criminal history, the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) deemed Burns a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a) and calculated a guideline range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. At sentencing, the district court concluded that the PSI correctly classified Burns as a career offender and sentenced him to 235 months in prison. On appeal, Burns argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the district court calculated his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 <em>before </em>considering his status as a career offender, signifying that his sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d the crack cocaine Guidelines. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the Sentencing Guidelines and the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Liberse, </em>688 F.3d 1198, 1200 n. 1 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-18\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment that was based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>er, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statement provides that \u201c[a] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment ... is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if ... [the] amendment ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). The commentary to the Guidelines defines \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d as \u201cthe guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)). The commentary further provides that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction is not authorized and not consistent with \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) where \u201cthe amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines amended the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) to reduce offense levels in crack cocaine cases. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750. It was made retroactive by Amendment 759, effective November 1, 2011. <em>See id., </em>Amend. 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), we addressed whether Amendment 706, effective November 1, 2007, and which similarly reduced the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, authorized reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for defendants who had been convicted of crack cocaine offenses, but had been sentenced under the career offender guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 1325. We explained that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only authorizes reductions to sentences that were \u201cbased on\u201d sentencing ranges that have been subsequently lowered. <em>Id. </em>at 1327. Since Amendment 706 did not lower the career offender offense levels, we concluded that it did not lower the sentencing range upon which a career offender\u2019s sentence had been based. <em>Id. </em>We also explained that the commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 \u201c[made] clear\u201d that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction was not authorized where an amendment lowered a defendant\u2019s base offense level for the offense of conviction but not the career offender sentencing range under which the defendant was sentenced. Id. at 1327-28; see also U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">In <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), the Supreme Court held, in a plurality opinion, that a defendant sentenced under a plea agreement recommending a specific sentence or sentencing range pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C) could, in certain circumstances, still qualify for a reduced sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if the sentence or sentencing range in the plea agreement was \u201cbased on\u201d the amended guideline range. <em>See Freeman, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2690. However, we have made clear that <em>Freeman </em>did not overrule <em>Moore, </em>and that it is inapplicable to a defendant sentenced as a career offender. <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1320-21 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)). In <em>Lawson, </em>we explained that <em>Freeman </em>did not address the situation in which defendants were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1. 686 F.3d at 1321. Therefore, a defendant who was convicted of a crack cocaine offense but sentenced as a career offender was still not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction because his guideline range was not lowered by Amendment 750. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">We recently held that the FSA may not be used to reduce a sentence pursuant to a \u00a7 3582 motion because it was a congres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>sional statutory change and not a guidelines amendment issued by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012). Further, interpreting the general savings clause, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, we also said that the FSA has not been made retroactively applicable to sentences imposed before its 2010 enactment. <em>Id.; see also Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2326, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012) (holding that the FSA\u2019s reduced statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums apply to defendants who committed crack cocaine offenses before August 3, 2010, but were sentenced after the date the FSA went into effect).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">In <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>we also recently held that the district court properly denied the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion where the defendant was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence for a pre-FSA offense involving cocaine base. 712 F.3d 535, 540-42 (11th Cir.2013), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. June 12, 2013) (No. 12-10828). Noting that the FSA did not apply retroactively, we explained that the defendant\u2019s guideline range was the statutory minimum at the time of his sentencing, and thus Amendment 750 did not lower his guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 541-42. Additionally, we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that <em>Berry </em>was distinguishable because that case involved a career offender as opposed to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 542. We reasoned that such distinctions \u201clack[ed] substance\u201d because career offender designations \u201c \u2018act[ ] like statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1078 (11th Cir.2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Here, the district court properly denied Burns\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction. Burns\u2019s argument that <em>Freeman </em>has undermined <em>Moore </em>is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Lawson, </em>and his attempts to distinguish <em>Lawson </em>are unavailing. Specifically, Burns does not address our explanation in <em>Lawson </em>that <em>Freeman </em>was not directly on point \u2014 indeed, neither the plurality opinion in <em>Freeman </em>nor Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence addressed the circumstances of a defendant, like Burns, who was assigned a base offense level under one guideline section but was ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range based on the career offender provision. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1320-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">Similarly, Burns\u2019s argument that the FSA authorizes the district court to reduce his sentence is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Berry, </em>where we explained that the FSA is not an amendment to the Guidelines by the Sentencing Commission, and thus, it cannot serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction in Burns\u2019s case. <em>See </em>701 F.3d at 377. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
