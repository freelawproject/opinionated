Cook previously pled guilty to conspiring to distribute and possess 50 or more grams of a substance containing crack cocaine and 500 or more grams of a substance containing a defectible amount of crack cocaine. Although his pre-sentence report designated him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, Cook\u2019s applicable guideline range was 360 months to life imprisonment based on drug quantity under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. The district court sentenced Cook to life imprisonment, the statutory mandatory minimum for his offense under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), based on two prior offenses. The district court subsequently reduced Cook\u2019s sentence below the mandatory minimum under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b), for substantial assistance. The district court presiding over Cook\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion found Cook ineligible for relief because he had been sentenced as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">On appeal, Cook argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction of sentence. He contends that the court erroneously based its ruling on an inaccurate determination that his sentence was controlled by the Guidelines for career offender, rather than drug quantity. Cook emphasizes that the relevant issue is whether the district court correctly denied \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief based on his career offender status, not whether his mandatory minimum of life imprisonment rendered him ineligible for such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusion that a defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, made retroactively applicable on November 1, 2011, by Amendment 759, revised the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Reason for Amendment; <em>id. </em>Amend. 759. In 2010, the Fair Sentencing Act (\u201cFSA\u201d) raised the drug quantity thresholds of crack cocaine required to trigger the mandatory minimum imprisonment terms. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Reason for Amendment. To account for the statutory changes in crack cocaine sentencing, the Sentencing Commission implemented Amendment 750 to revise the drug quantity table to lower the base offense levels for crack cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Reason for Amendment; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">Under \u00a7 3582, district courts are permitted to modify a term of imprisonment when a defendant is sentenced pursuant to a sentencing range that has since been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, a reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), even when the retroactive amendment applies to the defendant, if the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) <em>&amp; </em>comment. (n.1(A)); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008). Such situations include those in which the retroactive amendment would result in a lower base offense level if the defendant was not subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence. <em>Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1206; <em>see United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1340-41 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that a sentence based on a mandatory minimum was unaffected by Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines). Even if the defendant is sentenced below the statutory mandatory minimum, due to the government filing a substantial assistance motion, the district court\u2019s downward departure does not constitute a waiver of the applicability of the mandatory minimum; thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>the sentence remains based upon the mandatory minimum for purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1340-41; <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1077-78 (11th Cir.2010) (holding that \u201cthe operative provision in determining [the defendants\u2019] applicable sentencing range is the statutory minimum, ... not the crack cocaine Guideline,\u201d and that the defendants were \u201cstill subject to the mandatory minimum, upon which their substantial assistance departures \u2014 and thus them ultimate sentences \u2014 were based.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">In this case, regardless of which Guideline applied, we conclude that Cook\u2019s original sentence was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment; thus, he was not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief, despite his subsequent sentence reduction for substantial assistance. <em>See Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1206; <em>Mills, </em>613 F.3d at 1077-78. Although the district court denied Cook\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on the ground that he was sentenced as a career offender, we \u201cmay affirm for any reason supported by the record, even if not relied upon by the district court,\u201d <em>United States v. Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d 971, 975 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 288, 184 L.Ed.2d 169 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Cook\u2019s original sentence was governed by a statutory mandatory minimum, Amendment 705 to the Sentencing Guidelines did not operate to reduce his sentencing range. Accordingly, Cook is not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
