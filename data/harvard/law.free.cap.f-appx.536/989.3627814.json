The district court, in a well-reasoned and thorough opinion, denied summary judgment as to the officers\u2019 affirmative defenses of qualified immunity and official immunity. The district court also found that Sampson had presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of matei\u2019ial fact as to his claims of false imprisonment and abuse in being arrested. Finally, the district court held that there was sufficient evidence to support Sampson\u2019s battery claim against Officer Pettis, but not against Officer Godwin, whom the undisputed evidence showed did not touch Sampson. Sampson does not appeal the grant of summary judgment to Officer Godwin on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">We have reviewed the record in this case and the district court\u2019s thoughtful opinion. Finding no reversible error, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">AFFIRMED and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
