Caulfield argues that the district court abused its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration because the denial of the sentence reduction was based on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. Caulfield asserts that he earned his GED, worked in camp maintenance, and paid his special assessment fee. In addition, he notes that he has strong family support and a spotless disciplinary record since 2007. Caulfield also notes that his positive behavior earned him the lowest custody level status in the Bureau of Prisons. Finally, he contends that the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, such as his history and characteristics and the nature and circumstances of the offense, weigh in favor of a sentence reduction. Based on the record, Caulfield argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">A district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and its decision to deny a motion for reconsideration are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>128 F.3d 885, 892 (5th Cir.1997). In determining whether to reduce a sentence, the district court first determines whether a sentence modification is authorized and to what extent. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). If the court determines that a sentence modification is authorized it must then consider the applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors to decide whether a reduction \u201cis warranted in whole or in part under the particular circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2692.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The district court correctly determined that Caulfield was eligible for a reduction, but it was under no obligation to reduce his sentence. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673 (5th Cir.2009). When the district court ruled on the motion for reconsideration, it had Caulfield\u2019s arguments in support of a reduction before it. Thus, this court can assume that the district court considered those arguments and any relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors prior to denying the motion for reconsideration. <em>See id. </em>at 672-73 (rejecting the defendant\u2019s contention that the district court erred by failing to credit his post-sentencing record of rehabilitation to further reduce his sentence, where the district court had the defendant\u2019s arguments before it). The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration. <em>See O\u2019Keefe, </em>128 F.3d at 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-23\">.
