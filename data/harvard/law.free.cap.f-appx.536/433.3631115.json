For the reasons provided herein, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-24\">Appellant is a self-described \u201cstreet preacher.\u201d On the afternoon of Saturday, July 30, 2011, Appellant located himself in front of the El Dorado casino in Shreveport, on Clyde Fant Memorial Parkway near the intersection with Milam Street. Using a bullhorn, Appellant repeated slogans such as \u201cyou can\u2019t spell casino without sin\u201d to passers-by and casino patrons. He carried a sign conveying a comparable message.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-25\">Defendants-Appellees (\u201cAppellees\u201d)\u2014 two casino security guards, a Shreveport police officer, and his supervisor \u2014 ordered Appellant to relocate by one block, so as to distance himself from the casino. Appel-lees erroneously stated that Appellant was on private land. Appellant, who recorded video of this entire encounter, voluntarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>left at this point.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Thereafter, Appellant emailed Shreveport\u2019s City Engineer, who clarified on Monday, August 1, 2011 (the next business day) that the precise location where Appellant had stood on July 30 was indeed public land. Appellant also emailed other City officials, inquiring whether he would need a permit for his street preaching activities, even if on public land. A City official replied that an official response would be forthcoming, but none ever was provided. In the interim, Appellant concedes that he continued to street-preach on Shreveport public lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Appellant initiated the instant litigation on July 25, 2012. He first moved for a preliminary injunction on August 14, 2012. The district court denied that motion on September 20, 2012. Appellant filed an amended complaint on September 24, 2012, as well as a second motion for preliminary injunction. These are the live complaint and motion for purposes of this appeal. The district court denied the second motion for preliminary injunction on December 4, 2012. Appellant timely filed this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The heart of Appellant\u2019s prayer for relief is a challenge, under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, to those Shreveport municipal ordinances that would restrict his street preaching activities. The crux of Appellant\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction is that, without a response from the City to the permitting questions Appellant posed in his emails, he is effectively estopped from engaging in street preaching activities on Shreveport public lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">\u201cOur standard of review for a district court\u2019s granting of a preliminary injunction is whether the issuance of the injunction, in the light of the applicable standard, constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Affiliated Prof'l Home Health Care Agency v. Shalala, </em>164 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn performing that review, findings of fact that support the district court\u2019s decision are examined for clear error, whereas conclusions of law are reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>at 284-85 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">As the district court explained in its September 20 and December 4, 2012 opinions, this Circuit employs a four-part test \u2014 which the applicant bears the burden of satisfying \u2014 for entitlement to a preliminary injunction: (i) \u201ca substantial likelihood that [the applicant] will prevail on the merits\u201d; (ii) \u201ca substantial threat that [the applicant] will suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted\u201d; (iii) that the applicant\u2019s \u201cthreatened injury outweighs the threatened harm to the party whom he seeks to enjoin\u201d; and (iv) that \u201cgranting the preliminary injunction will not disserve the public interest.\u201d <em>Bluefield Water Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. City of Starkville, Miss., </em>577 F.3d 250, 252-53 (5th Cir.2009). \u201c[A] preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy which should not be granted unless the party seeking it has clearly carried the burden of persuasion on all four requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">In its December 4, 2012 opinion, the district court held that Appellant cannot satisfy either of the first two prongs of this test. Because we affirm on the basis that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Appellant cannot satisfy the second prong, we need not address whether he could satisfy the first prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u201c[A] preliminary injunction will not be issued simply to prevent the possibility of some remote future injury.\u201d <em>United States v. Emerson, </em>270 F.3d 203, 262 (5th Cir.2001) (citation, footnote, and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThere must be a <em>likelihood </em>that irreparable harm will occur. Speculative injury is not sufficient; there must be more than an unfounded fear on the part of the applicant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(same) (emphasis in original). Thus, \u201c[a] presently existing actual threat must be shown.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(same) (emphasis omitted). That said, \u201cthe injury need not have been inflicted when [the] application is made or be certain to occur; a strong threat of irreparable injury before trial is an adequate basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(same).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Here, on September 19, 2012, the City filed a sworn affidavit stating that Appellant may proceed with his street preaching without a permit so long as he does not engage in \u201cstreet performances,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 42-347 of the City\u2019s municipal ordinances, or exceed the volume amplification threshold specified in \u00a7 58-30(20). In the event Appellant does engage in \u201cstreet performances,\u201d he simply must obtain a permit by following the procedures specified in \u00a7 42-349, and comply with \u00a7 42-348\u2019s restrictions on performances that encroach upon private lands, including its prohibition on amplification devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">In light of the City\u2019s affidavit, and Appellant\u2019s concession that he has continued street preaching during the pendency of this litigation, we conclude that there is not \u201ca <em>likelihood </em>that irreparable harm will occur.\u201d Rather than erect a \u201cpresently existing actual threat,\u201d the City has provided Appellant with his requested guidance as to complying with its municipal ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Appellant\u2019s constitutional challenge to the municipal ordinances applicable to his street preaching proceeds before the district court. At present, we take no position on the merits of that challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s December 4, 2012 denial of Appellant\u2019s second motion for preliminary injunction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-8\">. We have reviewed this video, which is part of the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
