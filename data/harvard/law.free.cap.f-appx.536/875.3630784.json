At the time of sentencing, state charges were pending against Preciado-Rojas in Cobb County, Georgia, for burglary, armed robbery, false imprisonment, kidnapping, and conspiracy, and Preciado-Rojas had been transferred to federal custody under a writ of habeas corpus <em>ad prosequendum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">On appeal, Preciado-Rojas first contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, particularly his life history and the mitigating circumstances of his re-entry offense. Moreover, he asserts that the district court at sentencing sustained his objection to the pre-sentence investigation report\u2019s factual account of his pending Cobb County charges and ruled that it would not consider that information, but then mentioned those facts in justifying the sentence it imposed. Second, Preciado-Rojas argues that the district court erred by denying his request to order that his federal sentence run concurrently with a potential future state sentence on the Cobb County charges. Pre-ciado-Rojas argues that, because he was in federal court on a writ of habeas corpus <em>ad prosequendum, </em>his federal sentence will necessarily run consecutively to any state sentence absent an order that the federal sentence run concurrently and that this is unreasonable given the same \u00a7 3553(a) factors that he claims make his 62-month sentence unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">After review of the record on appeal and after consideration of the parties\u2019 appellate briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-12\">We review the reasonableness of sentences under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence must be both procedurally and substantively reasonable, <em>id., </em>though only the latter is at issue in this appeal. We examine whether or not the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe may set aside a sentence only if we determine, after giving a full measure of deference to the sentencing judge, that the sentence imposed truly is unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1191 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-13\">The district court is required to impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), namely the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, any perti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>nent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">Although in choosing a sentence the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court is not required to address each factor separately or to state that a particular factor is not applicable. <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1182 (11th Cir.2006). Rather, an acknowl-edgement that the district court has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors generally will suffice. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, the weight given to each \u00a7 3553(a) factor is \u201ca matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">\u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010) (citing <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006)). We reverse only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008)). Although we do not automatically presume a sentence falling within the guideline range to be reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). That a sentence imposed is well below the statutory maximum penalty also indicates that the sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">Preciado-Rojas has not shown that his within-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable. The district court imposed upon Preciado-Rojas a sentence of 62 months, which is in the lower half of the advisory guideline range of 57 to 71 months and well below the statutory maximum penalty of 20 years. The district court explained that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and specifically noted the serious nature of Preciado-Rojas\u2019s past crimes of \u201cinvading the sanctuary of people\u2019s homes,\u201d and the need for him and others to be deterred from illegally reentering the country.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court considered Preciado-Rojas\u2019s argument that he should receive a lighter sentence because of his impoverished upbringing in Colombia and the circumstances that led him to flee his home country, and did not act unreasonably in rejecting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">Preciado-Rojas\u2019s claim that the district court erred in considering his pending state arrests is also without merit. Because he did not raise this objection below, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cFor this Court to correct plain error: (1) there must be error; (2) the error must be plain; and (3) the error must affect substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>68 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">Preciado-Rojas points to two instances during the sentencing hearing where the district court referred to the pending state charges against Preciado-Rojas as being similar to his prior criminal conduct. However, Preciado-Rojas points to nothing in the record indicating that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>trict court relied on these pending charges in crafting its sentence. Indeed, the record reflects that the district court did not rely on the charges in its sentencing decision. The district court sustained Precia-do-Rojas\u2019s objection to the presentence investigation report in regard to the pending state charges and explicitly stated that it would not consider the arrests in its sentencing determination. The charges were not considered in calculating the guideline range for his sentence. Furthermore, when defense counsel began to argue that Preciado-Rojas would succeed against the pending charges, the district court corrected counsel and explained that it had been considering only his past convictions in discussing the serious nature of his criminal conduct. We see no error, let alone plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Preciado-Rojas has not shown plain error, nor has he shown that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">The Supreme Court has held that a district court \u201chas authority to order that the federal sentence be consecutive to an anticipated state sentence that has not yet been imposed.\u201d <em>Setser v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 1463, 1466, 1473, 182 L.Ed.2d 455 (2012); <em>see also United States v. Ballard, </em>6 F.3d 1502, 1507-10 (11th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Andrews, </em>330 F.3d 1305, 1307 (11th Cir.2003). We review the reasonableness of such determinations under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Andrews, </em>330 F.3d at 1307 (applying abuse of discretion standard). The district court\u2019s discretion is \u201ctempered\u201d by the requirement that it consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Ballard, </em>6 F.3d at 1505.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584, addresses the \u201cconcurrent-vs.-consecutive decision\u201d faced by a district court but does not address the situation raised here, where a \u201cstate sentence is not imposed at the same time as the federal sentence, and the defendant was not already subject to that state sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Setser, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1467. The Sentencing Guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Commission also address when concurrent or consecutive sentences should be imposed, but similarly do not address the instant situation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have stated, however, that \u201c[t]he statute and the analogous Sentencing Guidelines evince a preference for consecutive sentences when imprisonment terms are imposed at different times.\u201d <em>Ballard, </em>6 F.3d at 1506.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-13\">The district court did not act unreasonably when it denied Preciado-Ro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>jas\u2019s request to order that his federal sentence run concurrently with any possible sentence for the pending state charges. As discussed above, the district court stated in imposing its sentence that it had considered all factors under \u00a7 3558(a). The district court further noted that the federal and state crimes were \u201centirely different crimes, and for two types of different conduct.\u201d The district court then declined to affirmatively order that the federal sentence be served concurrently to a sentence \u201cthat might not ever exist.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In doing so, the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">Preciado-Rojas has not shown that the district court\u2019s sentencing decisions were substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-6\">.
