Rosas-Villarreal argues that the district court plainly erred by presuming that his guidelines sentencing range was reasonable and by relying upon this presumption to deny his request for a sentence below the guidelines range based on cultural assimilation.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-21\">We consider Rosas-Villarreal\u2019s claim under the plain error standard because it was not presented to the district court. <em>See United States v. King, </em>541 F.3d 1143, 1144 (5th Cir.2008). To meet this standard, Rosas-Villarreal must show an error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Even if this showing is made, we will exercise our discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affeet[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-22\">The Supreme Court has explained that \u201cthe sentencing court does not enjoy the benefit of a legal presumption that the Guidelines sentence should apply.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Rather, a district court must impose \u201ca sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The guidelines range serves as a \u201cstarting point\u201d and \u201cinitial benchmark\u201d prior to consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and a sentencing court cannot require exceptional circumstances to be present to justify imposing a sentence that is outside of the guidelines range. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-23\">In this case, even assuming arguendo that the district court\u2019s language indicates an erroneous application of this standard, we do not find plain error. The district court twice referred to the guidelines range as \u201cadvisory.\u201d In denying Rosas-Villarreal\u2019s argument for a cultural assimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>lation-based downward variance, the district court cited the defendant\u2019s \u201cextensive criminal history\u201d; the fact that he was \u201cat one point ... given legal status\u201d in the United States before he \u201clost that all on [his] own\u201d; and his fluency in Spanish and English increasing his ability to obtain employment in Mexico. The district court\u2019s conclusion that a cultural assimilation variance was not \u201cjustified or warranted in this case\u201d was, on plain error review, based on a sufficiently individualized and fact-specific assessment, see <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586, and Rosas-Villarreal has not shown a reasonable probability that he would have received a lesser sentence in the absence of any presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 648-49 (5th Cir.2010). The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
