The district court departed upwards pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 from the guidelines range of 77 to 96 months of imprisonment and imposed 120 months of imprisonment to run consecutively to any state sentence. Ramirez contends that the sentence imposed by the district court is an abuse of discretion and is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-21\">The district court\u2019s decision to depart and the extent of its departure are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cA sentencing court does not abuse its discretion in deciding to upwardly depart when its reasons for doing so (1) advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2); (2) are authorized by ... \u00a7 3553(b); and (3) are justified by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Saldana, </em>427 F.3d 298, 310 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-22\">The district court departed upwards based on its conclusion that the sentence produced by the guidelines range did not account for the extent and nature of Ramirez\u2019s criminal history. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1). Accounting for the extent and nature of Ramirez\u2019s criminal history advances the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), particularly affording adequate deterrence and protecting the public, and are justified by the facts of the case. <em>See Saldana, </em>427 F.3d at 310; \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), (C). Ramirez had over 15 convictions spanning nearly 20 years. Six of the prior convictions were for burglary and the most recent was for murder. Ramirez had 27 criminal history points, 14 points more than needed for a criminal history category of VI. <em>See </em>Ch. 5, Pt. A (Sentencing Table). The district court also cited Ramirez\u2019s inability to accept fault for his conduct. While it is unclear from the record exactly what the district court was referring to, the district court expressly acknowledged that Ramirez had accepted responsibility in the instant case. Ramirez has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by deciding to depart upwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Given the nature and extent of Ramirez\u2019s criminal history and the deference owed to the district court\u2019s sentencing decision, the extent of the departure, 24 months, was not unreasonable. <em>See Saldana, </em>427 F.3d at 312. Further, we have upheld upward departures of the same extent and greater magnitudes. <em>See United States v. Newsom, </em>508 F.3d 731, 735 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The consecutive sentence was authorized by statute and the Guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a); \u00a7 5G1.3(c). The district court was aware of the likelihood that Ramirez would spend the rest of his life in prison if a consecutive sentence was imposed. The district court was \u201cin a superi- or position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
