He asserts that the district court clearly erred in finding that he was an organizer or a leader in the offense and imposing a four-level increase in his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-21\">Whether a defendant is an organizer or leader under \u00a7 3B1.1(a) is a factual determination that this court reviews for clear error. <em>United States v. Cabrera, </em>288 F.3d 163, 173 (5th Cir.2002). The district court\u2019s finding was supported by the evidence presented at trial and the information in the presentence report, which established that Wilson personally recruited at least five participants, he directed them to Chase Bank, and he received a greater share of the profits than the recruits when the scheme succeeded. Wilson\u2019s participation and recruitment of accomplices indicates that he was an organizer of the offense within the meaning of \u00a7 3B1.1(a). <em>See United States v. Curtis, </em>635 F.3d 704, 720 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>274 F.3d 230, 247 (5th Cir.2001). Because the district court\u2019s finding that Wilson was an organizer of the offense is plausible in view of the record as a whole, the district court did not clearly err in imposing a four-level increase in his offense level under \u00a7 3B1.1(a). <em>See United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b488-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
