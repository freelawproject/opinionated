The district court dismissed the Reads\u2019 action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the <em>Feres </em>doctrine, which jurisdictionally bars actions brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act for military service-related injuries to military servicemembers. <em>Feres v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950). The Reads argue that <em>Feres </em>was wrongly decided because, <em>inter alia, </em>it conflicts with the plain language of the Federal Tort Claims Act, and that the <em>Feres </em>doctrine is unconstitutional. Accordingly, the Reads ask us not to follow <em>Feres </em>and to reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Reads\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-16\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b495-17\">While on active duty, Colton Read underwent laparoscopic gallbladder surgery to restore his condition such that he would be ready for deployment to Afghanistan. The surgery was performed by two Air Force surgeons at David Grant Medical Center and resulted in an injury to Colton Read\u2019s descending abdominal aorta. This injury was unsuccessfully repaired, and restricted the blood supply to Colton Read\u2019s legs. Related complications eventually required that both of Colton Read\u2019s legs be amputated. In March 2012, after extensive medical and rehabilitative therapy, Colton Read was classified as permanently disabled and relieved from active duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-18\">Colton Read and his wife, Jessica Read, (the \u201cReads\u201d), filed suit against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d) in federal court, each seeking damages for Colton\u2019s surgery-related injuries and disability. The United States filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the <em>Feres </em>doctrine. Acknowledging that it was bound by <em>Feres </em>and our precedent, the district court held that the Reads\u2019 claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>were barred under the <em>Feres </em>doctrine because (1) Colton Read\u2019s surgery was \u201cincidental to military service\u201d \u2014 since Colton Read was on active duty status when the surgery was performed, his surgery was intended to return him to military service, and his injury occurred at a military installation site \u2014 and (2) his receipt of medical care in a military facility by active duty military members was \u201cactivity incident to service.\u201d Accordingly, the district court granted the motion to dismiss and entered final judgment for the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The Reads timely appealed. On appeal, the Reads make no attempt to distinguish their case from those encompassed by the <em>Feres </em>doctrine. Rather, they ask us to disregard the doctrine and reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal, arguing that <em>Feres </em>was wrongly decided, that the <em>Feres </em>doctrine conflicts with the plain language of the FTCA, and that the doctrine is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">As a \u201cstrict stare decisis court,\u201d we \u201care in no position to challenge the statutory construction utilized by the Supreme Court in <em>[Feres </em>],\u201d nor may we disregard or overrule Supreme Court precedent. <em>Ballew v. Cont\u2019l Airlines, Inc., </em>668 F.3d 777, 782 (5th Cir.2012) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe Supreme Court has sole authority to overrule its own decisions, meaning that [we] must follow the Supreme Court\u2019s directly controlling precedent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the sole question before us is whether the district court properly dismissed the Reads\u2019 case pursuant to the <em>Feres </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">We review a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo, </em>resolving all disputed facts in favor of the nonmovant. <em>See United States v. Renda Marine, Inc., </em>667 F.3d 651, 655 (5th Cir.2012); <em>see also Hayes v. United States, </em>44 F.3d 377, 378 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201c[W]hether the district court properly applied <em>Feres </em>... to preclude Hayes\u2019s claim is a question of law which we review <em>de novo.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">The FTCA allows the United States to be sued in federal court for the negligent or wrongful acts of its employees. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). It is a limited waiver of the sovereign immunity of the United States and has been strictly construed in favor of the United States. <em>See Vernell v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>819 F.2d 108, 111 (5th Cir.1987). The Supreme Court has set forth an exception to the FTCA waiver of immunity called the <em>\u201cFeres </em>doctrine,\u201d which holds that the government is not liable under the FTCA for injuries to ser-vicemembers in the military whose alleged injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service. <em>Feres, </em>340 U.S. at 146, 71 S.Ct. 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">Irrespective of criticism of the <em>Feres </em>doctrine, the Supreme Court since <em>Feres </em>has clearly held that the government remains immune from suits by servicemem-bers for injuries arising out of or suffered in the course of activity incident to service. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>481 U.S. 681, 692, 107 S.Ct. 2063, 95 L.Ed.2d 648 (1987). Consistent with this rule, we have held that the <em>Feres </em>doctrine bars actions brought under the FTCA for injuries sustained by a servicemember on active duty from surgery performed by military doctors. <em>See Hayes, </em>44 F.3d at 378-79 (\u201cMedical malpractice by a physician employed by the military, in a military hospital, and in the course of treatment of a person in active military service has been clearly held to fall within \u2018the course of activity incident to service.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). The Reads have conceded that Colton Read\u2019s injuries arose out of activity incident to his military service. Thus, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>reasons articulated by the district court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we find that Colton Bead\u2019s injuries were \u201cincident to service\u201d and not actionable under the FTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b495-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b497-16\">. In summary, the district court found that it is \"undisputed that Airman Read was on active duty status at the time of his injury,\u201d and \"also undisputed that he was injured at a military installation.\u201d Further, the district court found that Airman Read was ill, and that gallbladder surgery was necessary to restore him to military readiness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
