He challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his 37-month prison sentence, which was at the bottom of the advisory guidelines range. Because he raised no objections to his sentence in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). A sentence is procedurally unreasonable where a district court improperly calculates the guidelines range, selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We presume that a within-guidelines sentence, like Villegas\u2019s, is reasonable, <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006), though a defendant can rebut the presumption if he shows that the sentence gave significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor or represented a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors, <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>712 F.3d 209, 214 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-21\">Villegas argues that the court imposed a procedurally unreasonable sentence by basing it on clearly erroneous factual findings regarding his family\u2019s reliance on government assistance and his failure to pay child support. Based on the presentence report and an extended colloquy with Ville-gas, the court did not err in finding that Villegas only paid child support when \u201che [felt] like it,\u201d the Government supported the family, and Villegas acted irresponsibly with regard to his financial obligations to his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-22\">Next, Villegas contends that the court improperly increased his offense level based on his prior Texas conviction for evading arrest in a vehicle. As Villegas concedes, his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Harrimon, </em>568 F.3d 531, 532-33, 536 (5th Cir.2009), where we held that this offense is a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) because \u201cfleeing by vehicle poses a serious risk of injury to others.\u201d Contrary to Villegas\u2019s suggestion that <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>L.Ed.2d 60 (2011), implicitly overruled <em>Harrimon, </em>the <em>Sykes </em>Court validated our holding in <em>Harrimon </em>by holding that a conviction under Indiana\u2019s felony vehicle flight law constituted a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>See Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2277.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Because the district court did not elaborate on the reasons why it rejected each of Villegas\u2019s arguments that his criminal history score was overstated, Villegas contends, the court did not adequately explain its sentence. Villegas concedes, however, that he cannot show that a more thorough discussion by the district court would have resulted in a lower sentence and thus cannot establish plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">As for substantive reasonableness, Ville-gas first asserts that the district court improperly gave significant weight to his family\u2019s finances and his prior conviction for evading arrest. The court\u2019s mention of Villegas\u2019s family\u2019s economic situation was in the context of its observation that Ville-gas did not financially support his children. Villegas\u2019s failure to do so was properly considered when the court evaluated his history and characteristics. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Moreover, the district court appropriately took into account his prior conviction for evading arrest in determining his offense level. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A); <em>Harrimon, </em>568 F.3d at 532-33, 536. The offense was also properly included in his criminal history score. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Villegas also argues that the sentence was too severe in light of his prior shorter sentences. However, nothing required the district court to impose a below-guidelines sentence merely because Villegas received the benefit of more lenient sentences in the past. <em>Cf. United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 328-29 (5th Cir.2004) (upholding an upward sentencing departure in part on the basis that the defendant had not been deterred by prior lenient sentences).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Finally, Villegas has not shown that the district court committed a clear error in judgment in balancing the sentencing factors. <em>See Jenkins, </em>712 F.3d at 214. At most, his argument that the court gave too much weight to some factors amounts to a disagreement with the balance that the district court struck, but we will not reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. McElwee, </em>646 F.3d 328, 344 (5th Cir.2011). The district court understood the facts of the case and twice explained that it had accounted for the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Villegas\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the propriety of the sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
