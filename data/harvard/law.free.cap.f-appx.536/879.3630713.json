We previously vacated Sanders\u2019s original sentence and remanded for resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Sanders, </em>461 Fed.Appx. 854 (11th Cir.2012), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 387, 184 L.Ed.2d 230 (2012). At his resentencing, Sanders was classified as a career offender under United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 4B1.1 based upon two prior felony convictions committed when he was seventeen years old: (1) resisting a law enforcement officer with violence on March 1, 2003, a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 and (2) felony fleeing or attempting to elude on July 12, 2003, a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3). Sanders concedes that these prior convictions are qualifying predicate offenses under this Court\u2019s precedent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nonetheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>Sanders argues he was improperly sentenced as a career offender for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">First, he argues that his two previous convictions were incorrectly counted as predicate offenses for his career offender status because they were youthful convictions. Second, he contends that the residual clause found in both the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) sentencing enhancement and the career offender sentencing enhancement is unconstitutionally vague. The government counters that Sanders\u2019s prior offenses were adult convictions for the purposes of the career offender enhancement because Sanders was charged as an adult and, under Florida law, his youthful offender sentence is actually an adult sanction. The government also responds that this Court rejected Sanders\u2019s vagueness argument in <em>United States v. Gandy, </em>710 F.3d 1234 (11th Cir.2013). After careful consideration, we affirm Sanders\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">Sanders stresses that \u00a7 4B1.2 defines a \u201cprior felony conviction\u201d for purposes of the sentencing enhancement as \u201ca prior <em>adult </em>federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n.1) (Nov. 2012) (emphasis added). Recognizing that \u201c[a] conviction for an offense committed prior to age eighteen is an adult conviction if it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted,\u201d <em>id., </em>Sanders argues that his prior convictions were not adult offenses under Florida law because they were classified as youthful offender convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Norris, </em>452 F.3d 1275, 1280 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cTo determine whether a defendant was convicted as an adult, we look to the nature of the proceedings, the sentences received, and the actual time served.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilks, </em>464 F.3d 1240, 1242 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted). Thus, even when a defendant is convicted as a youthful offender, the crime counts as a predicate offense when the defendant \u201cwas otherwise treated as an adult criminal, and he was sentenced to term of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1243. Sanders was treated as an adult criminal because he was certified to the adult court system before being convicted of both offenses. Although he was initially sentenced to thirty-six months of probation, he violated the terms of his probation, and was then sentenced to over fourteen months in Florida state prison.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, we conclude that Sanders\u2019s two predicate offenses were adult convictions for purposes of the sentencing enhancement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">As noted, Sanders concedes that this Court has recognized that his two prior convictions are predicate offenses for career offender status. He argues instead that the residual clause found in the ACCA should be void for vagueness. He similarly argues that the residual clause in the career offender guideline enhancement should be void for vagueness because \u201cthere is no predictable, consistent, or fair definition that can be applied to the residual clause.\u201d Sanders asks that we remand for resentencing without the career offender enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">We reject this argument.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As we explained in <em>Gandy, </em>the residual clause \u201cis not so indefinite as to prevent an ordinary person from understanding what conduct it prohibits.\u201d 710 F.3d at 1239 (quotation marks omitted). Although the residual clause<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is \u201cat times difficult for courts to implement,\u201d it nevertheless \u201cconstitutes an intelligible principle that provides guidance that allows a person to conform his or her conduct to the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and alteration omitted). Because we have concluded that the residual clause is not unconstitutionally vague, Sanders\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-11\">. Sanders was originally sentenced to 100-months imprisonment, after the district court concluded that he was not a career offender. Following the government's appeal, this Court concluded that one of Sanders's previous crimes, resisting a law enforcement officer with violence, counted as a predicate offense for the career offender enhancement, so we vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing. <em>Sanders, </em>461 Fed.Appx. at 855-56. The district court then sentenced Sanders as a career offender, but granted the government's motion for a sentence reduction based on Sanders\u2019s substantial assistance. As a result, Sanders received the same 100-month term of imprisonment at his resentenc-ing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b904-20\">. <em>See United States v. Nix, </em>628 F.3d 1341, 1342 (11th Cir.2010) (holding that resisting an officer with violence, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01, and fleeing and eluding at high speed, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3) are violent felonies under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA)); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>586 F.3d 1283, 1284-85 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that fleeing and eluding at high speed, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3), is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the career offender enhancement, \u00a7 4B1.1). \"Considering whether a crime is a violent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>felony under the ACCA is similar to considering whether a conviction qualifies as a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) because the definitions for both terms are virtually identical.\" <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>609 F.3d 1250, 1253 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b905-9\">. Although Sanders\u2019s original sentence did not include a term of imprisonment, we consider his initial sentence together with \"any term of imprisonment imposed upon [probation] revocation\u201d in calculating his sentence for purposes of the sentencing enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 (\"In the case of a prior revocation of probation ... add the original term of imprisonment to any term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation.\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n.3) (\"The provisions of \u00a7 4A 1.2 ... are applicable to ... \u00a7 4B1.2.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b905-13\">. Sanders contends that this Court erred in three precedential decisions, <em>Wilks, </em>464 F.3d 1240; <em>United States v. Spears, </em>443 F.3d 1358 (11th Cir.2006); and <em>United States v. Pinion, </em>4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>F.3d 941 (11th Cir.1993), all of which concluded that youthful offender convictions under state law may be used as predicate offenses. Specifically, Sanders notes that one of the several authorities that we relied upon in <em>Pinion </em>is a case from the First Circuit, which is no longer good law in the First Circuit. From this, Sanders argues that our holdings in <em>Pinion, Wilks, </em>and <em>Spears </em>are \"mistaken[].'' This argument is unavailing as <em>Pinion, Wilks, </em>and <em>Spears </em>remain binding precedent in this Circuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b906-7\">. \"[T]he district court's decision to classify a defendant as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.1 is a question of law that we ... review <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). The government notes that Sanders raises the vagueness argument for the first time on appeal, implicitly suggesting that we should review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Maurice, </em>69 F.3d 1553, 1556 (11th Cir.1995) (When \u201ca party fails to make a specific objection at the sentencing hearing after being given an opportunity to do so by the district court,\u201d we review for plain error). Because we conclude that Sanders\u2019s argument fails under the more stringent <em>de novo </em>standard, we need not consider this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b906-22\">.
