The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) determined his guideline imprisonment range to be 18 to 24 months. However, the probation officer recommended a sentence of 48 months\u2019 imprisonment on the bases that (1) the offense involved eight guns, six of which were hidden in the wall behind a bookcase; and (2) Douglas had three prior convictions: a 1988 grand larceny conviction, a 1994 sexual offense in the third degree conviction, and a child molestation conviction, for which he was not imprisoned and he did not count in his criminal history score. The probation officer also noted that each of the sexual offenses involved Douglas\u2019s underage daughters. The district court sentenced Douglas to 56 months\u2019 imprisonment based on the nature and circumstances of his offense, the need for adequate deterrence, and the need to protect the public from Douglas.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">On appeal, Douglas argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the sentencing factors. He contends that his prior felonies are substantively unrelated to the instant offense and asserts that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing beyond his possession of the guns. He additionally argues that his pri- or felonies are too remote in time to be related to the instant offense and emphasizes that he did not have any intervening convictions. Thus, he submits that the district court erred by overemphasizing his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cWe may set aside a sentence only if we determine, after giving a full measure of deference to the sentencing judge, that the sentence imposed truly is unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1191 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">The district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">If the district court determines that a sentence outside the applicable guideline range is appropriate, it must consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>extent of the deviation and provide sufficient justification for the degree of the variance. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008). Likewise, although sentences outside the guidelines are not presumed to be unreasonable, \u201cwe may take the extent of any variance into our calculus.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). However, we \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">\u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010). In determining a reasonable sentence, the district court may consider facts that have already been taken into account in calculating the defendant\u2019s guideline range. <em>Williams, </em>526 F.3d at 1324. The district court is free to consider any information relevant to a defendant\u2019s background, character, and conduct in imposing an upward variance. <em>Tome, </em>611 F.3d at 1379.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">We reverse only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. A sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum penalty is an indicator of a reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the district court adequately discussed the sentencing factors and determined that they required an above-the-guidelines sentence. Douglas\u2019s offense of unlawfully possessing eight guns and concealing six of them was very serious. Additionally, his history of sexually abusing his daughters demonstrated that he was a threat to his family and society. Thus, the district court appropriately concluded that Douglas\u2019s sentence needed to provide adequate deterrence and protect the public from him; therefore, the sentence was substantively reasonable. <em>See Tome, </em>611 F.3d at 1379; <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Additionally, Douglas\u2019s sentence was well below the 10-year statutory maximum sentence, which is an indicator of the reasonableness of his sentence. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Douglas\u2019s sentence as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
