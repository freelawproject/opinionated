No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372. On appeal, Harris asserts that he is entitled to a sentence reduction, notwithstanding his career offender status, because the district court sentenced him \u201cbased on\u201d the crack cocaine guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e), which was amended by Amendment 750. Moreover, Harris claims that Congress intended the FSA to apply retroactively, and that the text, history, and purpose of the statute, as characterized by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), support the FSA\u2019s retroactive ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>plication to reduce his sentence. After a thorough review of the briefs and the record, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Harris\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Harris pleaded guilty, with a written plea agreement, to one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base in excess of 50 grams, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii). Harris and the government stipulated that he would be held accountable for more than 50 grams but less than 100 grams of cocaine base. Prior to sentencing, a probation officer completed a presentence investigation report (PSI), which calculated a base offense level of 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The PSI added two levels because Harris caused reckless endangerment during flight. In addition, because he satisfied the provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4131.1(a), Harris was classified as a career offender and his offense level increased to 37. After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Harris\u2019s total offense level was 34 and he was assigned a criminal history category of VI. Based on a total offense level of 34 and a criminal history of VI, Harris\u2019s guideline range was 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. The offense carried a mandatory minimum term of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment and a maximum term of life imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">On February 27, 2003, the district court adopted the PSI and sentencing guideline applications without change, and sentenced Harris to 262 months in prison. On July 18, 2006, the district court granted the government\u2019s Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 35 motion for a sentence reduction<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and lowered Harris\u2019s sentence to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">On March 6, 2008, Harris filed a pro se \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence. The district court denied the motion, concluding that Harris was sentenced according to the career offender provision of \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) and was therefore ineligible for a sentence reduction; the court subsequently denied Harris\u2019s motion for reconsideration. We summarily affirmed the denial of Harris\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, citing to our recent decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008). On February 3, 2012, Harris, proceeding pro se, filed the instant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, later supplemented by appointed counsel. The district court denied both motions. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the sentence of \u201ca defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). However, the grounds upon which a district court may reduce a sentence are limited: (1) \u201c[t]he Sentencing Commission must have amended the Sentencing Guidelines, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o)\u201d; (2) the \u201cguidelines amendment must have lowered the defendant\u2019s sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>teneing range\u201d; and (3) the amendment \u201cmust also be one that is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c).\u201d <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam). \u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330; see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Amendment 750, which became effective on November 1, 2011, lowered the base offense levels for particular crack cocaine quantities in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 748, 750. The amendment did not, however, make any changes to \u00a7 4B1.1, the career offender provision. <em>See id; see also Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">In the instant case, the district court correctly denied Harris\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Amendment 750 did \u201cnot alter the sentencing range upon which his ... sentence was based.\u201d <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Although Harris was initially assigned a base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1, his total offense level and guideline range were based on his status as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, which resulted in the automatic assignment of an offense level of 37 and criminal history category of VI, as well as the corresponding guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Moreover, we are bound by our prior precedent, and have held that neither the plurality nor concurring opinions in <em>Freeman </em>have any applicability to cases where a defendant was assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but ultimately sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321; <em>see also United States v. Kaley, </em>579 F.3d 1246, 1255 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that we \u201cmay disregard the holding of a prior opinion only where that holding is overruled by the Court sitting en banc or by the Supreme Court\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). In <em>Lawson, </em>we held that <em>Freeman </em>did not abrogate our prior holding in <em>Moore </em>\u2014 that defendants sentenced as career offenders, pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1, were not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reductions where their guideline ranges were unaffected by a retroactive amendment. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1320-21. Thus, the district court properly determined that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) did not authorize a reduction in Harris\u2019s sentence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">Next, regarding Harris\u2019s argument that he is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction based on the FSA, we conclude that he is not entitled to relief, as demonstrated by our recent decisions in <em>Berry </em>and <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (2013), <em>cert. filed, </em>134 S.Ct. 181, 82 U.S.L.W. 3183 (U.S. June 12, 2013) (No. 12-10828). First, the FSA is not an amendment to the Guidelines by the Sen tencing Commission and thus, it cannot serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction in Harris\u2019s case. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. In any event, even assuming that Harris could raise his FSA claim in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, his claim fails because he was sentenced in 2003, before the August 3, 2010 effective date of the FSA; therefore, Harris cannot benefit from the FSA\u2019s lower statutory mandatory minimum provisions. <em>See Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d at 542. Moreover, contrary to Harris\u2019s assertion, <em>Dorsey </em>did not suggest that the FSA\u2019s new statutory penalties should apply retroactively to defendants who were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>See Hippolyte, </em>712 <em>F.3d </em>at 542; <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377-78 (providing that <em>\u201cDorsey </em>did not suggest that the FSA\u2019s new mandatory m\u00ednimums should apply to defendants, like Berry, who were sentenced long before the FSA\u2019s effective date\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-7\">. The PSI calculated Bell\u2019s sentence using the 2002 Sentencing Guidelines. That version of the Sentencing Guidelines listed Harris's base offense level in \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b884-13\">.
