[a] drug trafficking crime\u201d within the meaning of 18 U. S.

S. 223 (1993), raised the converse of today\u2019s question, and held that \u201ca criminal who trades his firearm for drugs \u2018uses\u2019 it during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense within the meaning of \u00a7 924(c)(1).\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 241. We rested primarily on the \u201cordinary or natural meaning\u201d of the verb in context, <em>id., </em>at 228, and understood its common range as going beyond employment as a weapon: \u201cit is both reasonable and normal to say that petitioner \u2018used\u2019 his MAC-10 in his drug trafficking offense by trading it for cocaine,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Two years later, the issue in <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>United States, </em>516 U. S. 137 (1995), was whether possessing a firearm kept near the scene of drug trafficking is \u201cuse\u201d under \u00a7 924(c)(1). We looked again to \u201cordinary or natural\u201d meaning, <em>id., </em>at 145, and decided that mere possession does not amount to \u201cuse\u201d: \u201c\u00a7 924(c)(1) requires evidence sufficient to show an <em>active employment </em>of the firearm by the defendant, a use that makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>the firearm an operative factor in relation to the predicate offense,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 143.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">This third case on the reach of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) began to take shape when petitioner, Michael A. Watson, told a Government informant that he wanted to acquire a gun. On the matter of price, the informant quoted no dollar figure but suggested that Watson could pay in narcotics. Next, Watson met with the informant and an undercover law enforcement agent posing as a firearms dealer, to whom he gave 24 doses of oxycodone hydrocholoride (commonly, OxyContin) for a .50-caliber semiautomatic pistol. When law enforcement officers arrested Watson, they found the pistol in his car, and a later search of his house turned up a cache of prescription medicines, guns, and ammunition. Watson said he got the pistol \u201cto protect his other firearms and drugs.\u201d App. C to Pet. for Cert. 11a.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">A federal grand jury indicted him for distributing a Schedule II controlled substance and for \u201cusing\u201d the pistol during and in relation to that crime, in violation of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Watson pleaded guilty across the board, reserving the right to challenge the factual basis for a \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) conviction and the added consecutive sentence of 60 months for using the gun. The Court of Appeals affirmed, 191 Fed. Appx. 326 (CA5 2006) <em>(per curiam), </em>on Circuit precedent foreclosing any argument that Watson had not \u201cused\u201d a firearm, see <em>id., </em>at 327 (citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ulloa, </em>94 F. 3d 949 (CA5 1996), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Zuniga, </em>18 F. 3d 1254 (CA5 1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Circuits on whether a person \u201cuses\u201d a firearm within the meaning of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) when he trades narcotics to obtain a gun.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 549 U. S. 1251 (2007). We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The Government\u2019s position that Watson \u201cused\u201d the pistol under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) by receiving it for narcotics lacks authority in either precedent or regular English. To begin with, neither <em>Smith </em>nor <em>Bailey </em>implicitly decides this case. While <em>Smith </em>held that firearms may be \u201cused\u201d in a barter transaction, even with no violent employment, see 508 U. S., at 241, the case addressed only the trader who swaps his gun for drugs, not the trading partner who ends up with the gun. <em>Bailey, </em>too, is unhelpful, with its rule that a gun must be made use of actively to satisfy \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), as \u201can operative factor in relation to the predicate offense.\u201d 516 U. S., at 148. The question here is whether it makes sense to say that Watson employed the gun at all; <em>Bailey </em>does not answer it.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>With no statutory definition or definitive clue, the meaning of the verb \u201cuses\u201d has to turn on the language as we normally speak it, see, <em>e. g., Lopez </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>549 U. S. 47, 53 (2006); <em>Asgrow Seed Co. </em>v. <em>Winterboer, </em>513 U. S. 179, 187 (1995); <em>FDIC </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>510 U. S. 471, 476 (1994); there is no other source of a reasonable inference about what Congress understood when writing or what its words will bring to the mind of a careful reader. So, in <em>Smith </em>we looked for \u201ceveryday meaning,\u201d 508 U. S., at 228, revealed in phraseology that strikes the ear as \u201cboth reasonable and normal,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 230. See also <em>Bailey, supra, </em>at 145. This appeal to the ordinary leaves the Government without much of a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The Government may say that a person \u201cuses\u201d a firearm simply by receiving it in a barter transaction, but no one else would. A boy who trades an apple to get a granola bar is sensibly said to use the apple, but one would never guess which way this commerce actually flowed from hearing that the boy used the granola. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>246 F. 3d 728, 731 (CADC 2001) (\u201c[W]hen a person pays a cashier a dollar for a cup of coffee in the courthouse cafeteria, the customer has not used the coffee. He has only used the dollar bill\u201d). So, when Watson handed over the drugs for the pistol, the informant or the agent<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cused\u201d the pistol to get the drugs, just as <em>Smith </em>held, but regular speech would not say that Watson himself used the pistol in the trade. \u201cA seller does not \u2018use\u2019 a buyer\u2019s consideration,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Westmoreland, </em>122 F. 3d 431, 436 (CA7 1997), and the Government\u2019s contrary position recalls another case; <em>Lopez, supra, </em>at 56, rejected the Government\u2019s interpretation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(c)(2) because \u201cwe do not normally speak or write the Government\u2019s way.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The Government would trump ordinary English with two arguments. First, it relies on <em>Smith </em>for the pertinence of a neighboring provision, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(d)(1), which authorizes seizure and forfeiture of firearms \u201cintended to be used in\u201d certain criminal offenses listed in \u00a7 924(d)(3). Some of those offenses involve receipt of a firearm,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> from which the Government infers that \u201cuse\u201d under \u00a7 924(d) necessarily includes receipt of a gun even in a barter transaction. <em>Smith </em>is cited for the proposition that the term must be given the same meaning in both subsections, and the Government urges us to import \u201cuse\u201d as \u201creceipt in barter\u201d into \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">We agree with the Government that \u00a7 924(d) calls for attention; the reference to intended use in a receipt crime carries some suggestion that receipt can be \u201cuse\u201d (more of a hint, say, than speaking of intended \u201cuse\u201d in a crime defined as exchange). But the suggestion is a tepid one and falls short of supporting what is really an attempt to draw a conclusion too specific from a premise too general.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The <em>Smith </em>majority rested principally on ordinary speech in reasoning that \u00a7 924(c)(1) extends beyond use as a weapon and includes use as an item of barter, see 508 U. S., at 228-230, and the <em>Smith </em>opinion looks to \u00a7 924(d) only for its light on that conclusion. It notes that the \u201cintended to be used\u201d clause of \u00a7 924(d)(1) refers to offenses where \u201cthe firearm is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>not </em>used as a weapon but instead as an item of barter or commerce,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 234, with the implication that Congress intended \u201cuse\u201d to reach commercial transactions, not just gun violence, in \u00a7 924(d) generally, see <em>id., </em>at 234-235. It was this breadth of treatment that led the <em>Smith </em>majority to say that, \u201c[ujnless we are to hold that using a firearm has a different meaning in \u00a7 924(c)(1) than it does in \u00a7 924(d) \u2014 and clearly we should not \u2014 we must reject petitioner\u2019s narrow interpretation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 235 (citation omitted); see also <em>Bailey, supra, </em>at 146 (\u201c[Ujsing a firearm should not have a different meaning in \u00a7 924(c)(1) than it does in \u00a7 924(d)\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The Government overreads <em>Smith. </em>While the neighboring provision indicates that a firearm is \u201cused\u201d nonoffensively, and supports the conclusion that a gun can be \u201cused\u201d in barter, beyond that point its illumination fails. This is so because the utility of \u00a7 924(d)(1) is limited by its generality and its passive voice; it tells us a gun can be \u201cused\u201d in a receipt crime, but not whether both parties to a transfer use the gun, or only one, or which one. The nearby subsection (c)(1)(A), however, requires just such a specific identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">It provides that a person who uses a gun in the circumstances described commits a crime, whose perpetrator must be clearly identifiable in advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The agnosticism on the part of \u00a7 924(d)(1) about who does the using is entirely consistent with common speech\u2019s understanding that the first possessor is the one who \u201cuses\u201d the gun in the trade, and there is thus no cause to admonish us to adhere to the paradigm of a statute \u201cas a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme, ... in which the operative words have a consistent meaning throughout,\u201d <em>.Gustafson </em>v. <em>Alloyd Co., </em>513 U. S. 561, 569 (1995), or to invoke the \u201cstandard principle of statutory construction . . . that identical words and phrases within the same statute should normally be given the same meaning,\u201d <em>Powerex Corp. </em>v. <em>Reliant Energy Services, Inc., </em>551 U. S. 224, 232 (2007). Subsections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>(d)(1) and (c)(1)(A) as we read them are not at odds over the verb \u201cuse\u201d; the point is merely that in the two subsections the common verb speaks to different issues in different voices and at different levels of specificity. The provisions do distinct jobs, but we do not make them guilty of employing the common verb inconsistently.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The second effort to trump regular English is the claim that failing to treat receipt in trade as \u201cuse\u201d would create unacceptable asymmetry with <em>Smith. </em>At bottom, this atextual policy critique says it would be strange to penalize one side of a gun-for-drugs exchange but not the other: \u201c[t]he danger to society is created not only by the person who brings the firearm to the drug transaction, but also by the drug dealer who takes the weapon in exchange for his drugs during the transaction,\u201d Brief for United States 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The position assumes that <em>Smith </em>must be respected, and we join the Government at least on this starting point. A difference of opinion within the Court (as in Smith) does not keep the door open for another try at statutory construction, where <em>stare decisis </em>has \u201cspecial force [since] the legislative power is implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we have done.\u201d <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>McLean Credit Union, </em>491 U. S. 164, 172-173 (1989). What is more, in 14 years Congress has taken no step to modify <em>Smith\u2019s </em>holding, and this long congressional acquiescence \u201chas enhanced even the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>usual precedential force\u201d we accord to our interpretations of statutes, <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>544 U. S. 13, 23 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The problem, then, is not with the sturdiness of <em>Smith </em>but with the limited malleability of the language <em>Smith </em>construed, and policy-driven symmetry cannot turn \u201creceipt-in-trade\u201d into \u201cuse.\u201d Whatever the tension between the prior result and the outcome here, law depends on respect for language and would be served better by statutory amendment (if Congress sees asymmetry) than by racking statutory language to cover a policy it fails to reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The argument is a peculiar one, in fact, given the Government\u2019s take on the current state of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). It was amended after <em>Bailey </em>and now prohibits not only using a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, but also possessing one \u201cin furtherance of\u201d such a crime. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A); see n. 3, <em>supra. </em>The Government is confident that \u201ca drug dealer who takes a firearm in exchange for his drugs generally will be subject to prosecution\u201d under this new possession prong. Brief for United States 27; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 41 (Watson\u2019s case \u201ccould have been charged as possession\u201d); cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>324 F. 3d 77, 83, n. 2 (CA2 2003) (\u201cFor defendants charged under \u00a7 924(c) after [the <em>post-Bailey] </em>amendment, trading drugs for a gun will probably result in . . . possession [in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime]\u201d). This view may or may not prevail, and we do not speak to it today, but it does leave the appeal to symmetry underwhelming in a contest with the English language, on the Government\u2019s very terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Given ordinary meaning and the conventions of English, we hold that a person does not \u201cuse\u201d a firearm under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) when he receives it in trade for drugs. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-11\"> Formerly 18 U.

See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>39 F. 3d 1262 (1994).

Distinguishing, as the Court does, between trading a gun for drugs and trading drugs for a gun, for purposes of the 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) enhancement, makes scant sense to me. I join the Court\u2019s judgment, however, because I am persuaded that the Court took a wrong turn in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 508 U. S. 223 (1993), when it held that trading a gun for drugs fits within \u00a7924(c)(l)\u2019s compass as \u201cus[e]\u201d of a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to any ... drug trafficking crime.\u201d For reasons well stated by Justice Scalia in his dissenting opinion in <em>Smith, </em>508 U. S., at 241, I would read the word \u201cuse\u201d in \u00a7 924(c)(1) to mean use as a weapon, not use in a bartering transaction. Accordingly, I would overrule <em>Smith, </em>and thereby render our precedent both coherent and consistent with normal usage. Cf. <em>Henslee </em>v. <em>Union Planters Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>335 U. S. 595, 600 (1949) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) (\u201cWisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late.\u201d).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
