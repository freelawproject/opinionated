S. C. \u00a7 78j(b), and SEC Rule 10b-5, 17 CFR \u00a7240.10b-5 (2007). In this suit investors alleged losses after purchasing common stock. They sought to impose liability on entities who, acting both as customers and suppliers, agreed to arrangements that allowed the investors\u2019 company to mislead its auditor and issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>a misleading financial statement affecting the stock price. We conclude the implied right of action does not reach the customer/supplier companies because the investors did not rely upon their statements or representations. We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">This class-action suit by investors was filed against Charter Communications, Inc., in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware, was the lead plaintiff and is petitioner here.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Charter issued the financial statements and the securities in question. It was a named defendant along with some of its executives and Arthur Andersen LLP, Charter\u2019s independent auditor during the period in question. We are concerned, though, with two other defendants, respondents here. Respondents are Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., and Motorola, Inc. They were suppliers, and later customers, of Charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">For purposes of this proceeding, we take these facts, alleged by petitioner, to be true. Charter, a cable operator, engaged in a variety of fraudulent practices so its quarterly reports would meet Wall Street expectations for cable subscriber growth and operating cashflow. The fraud included misclassification of its customer base; delayed reporting of terminated customers; improper capitalization of costs that should have been shown as expenses; and manipulation of the company\u2019s billing cutoff dates to inflate reported revenues. In late 2000, Charter executives realized that, despite these efforts, the company would miss projected operating cashflow numbers by $15 to $20 million. To help meet the shortfall, Charter decided to alter its existing arrangements with respondents, Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola. Peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>tioner\u2019s theory as to whether Arthur Andersen was altogether misled or, on the other hand, knew the structure of the contract arrangements and was complicit to some degree, is not clear at this stage of the case. The point, however, is neither controlling nor significant for our present disposition, and in our decision we assume it was misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Respondents supplied Charter with the digital cable converter (set-top) boxes that Charter furnished to its customers. Charter arranged to overpay respondents $20 for each set-top box it purchased until the end of the year, with the understanding that respondents would return the overpayment by purchasing advertising from Charter. The transactions, it is alleged, had no economic substance; but, because Charter would then record the advertising purchases as revenue and capitalize its purchase of the set top boxes, in violation of generally accepted accounting principles, the transactions would enable Charter to fool its auditor into approving a financial statement showing it met projected revenue and operating cashflow numbers. Respondents agreed to the arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">So that Arthur Andersen would not discover the link between Charter\u2019s increased payments for the boxes and the advertising purchases, the companies drafted documents to make it appear the transactions were unrelated and conducted in the ordinary course of business. Following a request from Charter, Scientific-Atlanta sent documents to Charter stating \u2014 falsely\u2014that it had increased production costs. It raised the price for set-top boxes for the rest of 2000 by $20 per box. As for Motorola, in a written contract Charter agreed to purchase from Motorola a specific number of set-top boxes and pay liquidated damages of $20 for each unit it did not take. The contract was made with the expectation Charter would fail to purchase all the units and pay Motorola the liquidated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">To return the additional money from the set top box sales, Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola signed contracts with Char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>ter to purchase advertising time for a price higher than fair value. The new set-top box agreements were backdated to make it appear that they were negotiated a month before the advertising agreements. The backdating was important to convey the impression that the negotiations were unconnected, a point Arthur Andersen considered necessary for separate treatment of the transactions. Charter recorded the advertising payments to inflate revenue and operating cash-flow by approximately $17 million. The inflated number was shown on financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and reported to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Respondents had no role in preparing or disseminating Charter\u2019s financial statements. And their own financial statements booked the transactions as a wash, under generally accepted accounting principles. It is alleged respondents knew or were in reckless disregard of Charter\u2019s intention to use the transactions to inflate its revenues and knew the resulting financial statements issued by Charter would be relied upon by research analysts and investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Petitioner filed a securities fraud class action on behalf of purchasers of Charter stock alleging that, by participating in the transactions, respondents violated \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The District Court granted respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. <em>In re Charter Communications, Inc., Securities Litigation, </em>443 F. 3d 987 (2006). In its view the allegations did not show that respondents made misstatements relied upon by the public or that they violated a duty to disclose; and on this premise it found no violation of \u00a7 10(b) by respondents. <em>Id., </em>at 992. At most, the court observed, respondents had aided and abetted Charter\u2019s misstatement of its financial results; but, it noted, there is no private right of action for aiding and abetting a \u00a7 10(b) violation. See <em>Central Bank of Denver, N. A. </em>v. <em>First Interstate Bank of Den</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>ver, N. A., </em>511 U. S. 164,191 (1994). The court also affirmed the District Court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to amend the complaint, as the revised pleading would not change the court\u2019s conclusion on the merits. 443 F. 3d, at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Decisions of the Courts of Appeals are in conflict respecting when, if ever, an injured investor may rely upon \u00a7 10(b) to recover from a party that neither makes a public misstatement nor violates a duty to disclose but does participate in a scheme to violate \u00a7 10(b). Compare <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>AOL Time Warner Inc., </em>452 F. 3d 1040 (CA9 2006), with <em>Regents of Univ. of Cal. </em>v. <em>Credit Suisse First Boston (USA), Inc., </em>482 F. 3d 372 (CA5 2007).

S. 642, 651 (1997). Though the text of the Securities Exchange Act does not provide for a private cause of action for \u00a7 10(b) violations, the Court has found a right of action implied in the words of the statute and its implementing regulation. <em>Superintendent of Ins. of N. Y. </em>v. <em>Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>404 U. S. 6, 13, n. 9 (1971). In a typical \u00a7 10(b) private action a plaintiff must prove (1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation. See <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Broudo, </em>544 U. S. 336, 341-342 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">In <em>Central Bank, </em>the Court determined that \u00a7 10(b) liability did not extend to aiders and abettors. The Court found the scope of \u00a7 10(b) to be delimited by the text, which makes no mention of aiding and abetting liability. 511 U. S., at 177. The Court doubted the implied \u00a7 10(b) action should extend to aiders and abettors when none of the express causes of action in the securities Acts included that liability. <em>Id., </em>at 180. It added the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">\u201cWere we to allow the aiding and abetting action proposed in this case, the defendant could be liable without any showing that the plaintiff relied upon the aider and abettor\u2019s statements or actions. See also <em>Chiarella </em>[v. <em>United States, </em>445 U. S. 222, 228 (1980)]. ' Allowing plaintiffs to circumvent the reliance requirement would disregard the careful limits on 10b-5 recovery mandated by our earlier cases.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>The decision in <em>Central Bank </em>led to calls for Congress to create an express cause of action for aiding and abetting within the Securities Exchange Act. Then-SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, testifying before the Senate Securities Subcommittee, cited <em>Central Bank </em>and recommended that aiding and abetting liability in private claims be established. S. Hearing No. 103-759, pp. 13-14 (1994). Congress did not follow this course. Instead, in \u00a7 104 of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), 109 Stat. 757, it directed prosecution of aiders and abettors by the SEC. 15 U.S. C. \u00a7 78t(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The \u00a7 10(b) implied private right of action does not extend to aiders and abettors. The conduct of a secondary actor must satisfy each of the elements or preconditions for liability; and we consider whether the allegations here are sufficient to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The Court of Appeals concluded petitioner had not alleged that respondents engaged in a deceptive act within the reach of the \u00a7 10(b) private right of action, noting that only misstatements, omissions by one who has a duty to disclose, and manipulative trading practices (where \u201cmanipulative\u201d is a term of art, see, <em>e. g., Santa Fe Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>430 U. S. 462, 476-477 (1977)) are deceptive within the meaning of the Rule. 443 F. 3d, at 992. If this conclusion were read to suggest there must be a specific oral or written statement before there could be liability under \u00a7 10(b) or Rule 10b-5, it would be erroneous. Conduct itself can be deceptive, as respondents concede. In this case, moreover, respondents\u2019 course of conduct included both oral and written statements, such as the backdated contracts agreed to by Charter and respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">A different interpretation of the holding from the Court of Appeals opinion is that the court was stating only that any deceptive statement or act respondents made was not actionable because it did not have the requisite proximate relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>to the investors\u2019 harm. That conclusion is consistent with our own determination that respondents\u2019 acts or statements were not relied upon by the investors and that, as a result, liability cannot be imposed upon respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Reliance by the plaintiff upon the defendant\u2019s deceptive acts is an essential element of the \u00a7 10(b) private cause of action. It ensures that, for liability to arise, the \u201crequisite causal connection between a defendant\u2019s misrepresentation and a plaintiff\u2019s injury\u201d exists as a predicate for liability. <em>Basic Inc. </em>v. <em>Levinson, </em>485 U. S. 224, 243 (1988); see also <em>Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah </em>v. <em>United States, </em>406 U. S. 128, 154 (1972) (requiring \u201ccausation in fact\u201d). We have found a rebuttable presumption of reliance in two different circumstances. First, if there is an omission of a material fact by one with a duty to disclose, the investor to whom the duty was owed need not provide specific proof of reliance. <em>Id., </em>at 153-154. Second, under the fraud-on-the-market doctrine, reliance is presumed when the statements at issue become public. The public information is reflected in the market price of the security. Then it can be assumed that an investor who buys or sells stock at the market price relies upon the statement. <em>Basic, supra, </em>at 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Neither presumption applies here. Respondents had no duty to disclose; and their deceptive acts were not communicated to the public. No member of the investing public had knowledge, either actual or presumed, of respondents\u2019 deceptive acts during the relevant times. Petitioner, as a result, cannot show reliance upon any of respondents\u2019 actions except in an indirect chain that we find too remote for liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Invoking what some courts call \u201cscheme liability,\u201d see, <em>e. g., In re Enron Corp. Securities, Derivative, &amp; \u201cERISA\u201d Litigation, </em>439 F. Supp. 2d 692, 723 (SD Tex. 2006), peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>tioner nonetheless seeks to impose liability on respondents even absent a public statement. In our view this approach does not answer the objection that petitioner did not in fact rely upon respondents\u2019 own deceptive conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Liability is appropriate, petitioner contends, because respondents engaged in conduct with the purpose and effect of creating a false appearance of material fact to further a scheme to misrepresent Charter\u2019s revenue. The argument is that the financial statement Charter released to the public was a natural and expected consequence of respondents\u2019 deceptive acts; had respondents not assisted Charter, Charter\u2019s auditor would not have been fooled, and the financial statement would have been a more accurate reflection of Charter\u2019s financial condition. That causal link is sufficient, petitioner argues, to apply <em>Basic\u2019s </em>presumption of reliance to respondents\u2019 acts. See, <em>e. g., Simpson, </em>452 F. 3d, at 1051-1052; <em>In re Parmalat Securities Litigation, </em>376 F. Supp. 2d 472, 509 (SDNY 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In effect petitioner contends that in an efficient market investors rely not only upon the public statements relating to a security but also upon the transactions those statements reflect. Were this concept of reliance to be adopted, the implied cause of action would reach the whole marketplace in which the issuing company does business; and there is no authority for this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">As stated above, reliance is tied to causation, leading to the inquiry whether respondents\u2019 acts were immediate or remote to the injury. In considering petitioner\u2019s arguments, we note \u00a7 10(b) provides that the deceptive act must be \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any security.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78j(b). Though this phrase in part defines the statute\u2019s coverage rather than causation (and so we do not evaluate the \u201cin connection with\u201d requirement of \u00a7 10(b) in this case), the emphasis on a purchase or sale of securities does provide some insight into the deceptive acts that concerned the enacting Congress. See Black, Securities Commentary:</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>The Second Circuit\u2019s Approach to the Tn Connection With\u2019 Requirement of Rule 10b-5, 53 Brooklyn L. Rev. 539, 541 (1987) (\u201c[WJhile the \u2018in connection with\u2019 and causation requirements are analytically distinct, they are related to each other, and discussion of the first requirement may merge with discussion of the second\u201d). In all events we conclude respondents\u2019 deceptive acts, which were not disclosed to the investing public, are too remote to satisfy the requirement of reliance. It was Charter, not respondents, that misled its auditor and filed fraudulent financial statements; nothing respondents did made it necessary or inevitable for Charter to record the transactions as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Petitioner invokes the private cause of action under \u00a7 10(b) and seeks to apply it beyond the securities markets \u2014 the realm of financing business \u2014 to purchase and supply contracts \u2014 the realm of ordinary business operations. The latter realm is governed, for the most part, by state law. It is true that if business operations are used, as alleged here, to affect securities markets, the SEC enforcement power may reach the culpable actors. It is true as well that a dynamic, free economy presupposes a high degree of integrity in all of its parts, an integrity that must be underwritten by rules enforceable in fair, independent, accessible courts. Were the implied cause of action to be extended to the practices described here, however, there would be a risk that the federal power would be used to invite litigation beyond the immediate sphere of securities litigation and in areas already governed by functioning and effective state-law guarantees. Our precedents counsel against this extension. See <em>Marine Bank </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>455 U. S. 551, 556 (1982) (\u201cCongress, in enacting the securities laws, did not intend to provide a broad federal remedy for all fraud\u201d); <em>Santa Fe, </em>430 U. S., at 479-480 (\u201cThere may well be a need for uniform federal fiduciary standards .... But those standards should not be supplied by judicial extension of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 to \u2018cover the corporate universe\u2019\u201d (quoting Cary, Federalism <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>and Corporate Law: Reflections Upon Delaware, 83 Yale L. J. 663, 700 (1974))). Though \u00a7 10(b) is \u201cnot \u2018limited to preserving the integrity of the securities markets,\u2019 \u201d <em>Bankers Life, </em>404 U. S., at 12, it does not reach all commercial transactions that are fraudulent and affect the price of a security in some attenuated way.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">These considerations answer as well the argument that if this were a common-law action for fraud there could be a finding of reliance. Even if the assumption is correct, it is not controlling. Section 10(b) does not incorporate common-law fraud into federal law. See, <em>e. g., SEC </em>v. <em>Zandford, </em>535 U. S. 813, 820 (2002) (\u201c[Section 10(b)] must not be construed so broadly as to convert every common-law fraud that happens to involve securities into a violation\u201d); <em>Central Bank, </em>511 U. S., at 184 (\u201cEven assuming ... a deeply rooted background of aiding and abetting tort liability, it does not follow that Congress intended to apply that kind of liability to the private causes of action in the securities Acts\u201d); see also <em>Dura, </em>544 U. S., at 341. Just as \u00a7 10(b) \u201cis surely badly strained when construed to provide a cause of action ... to the world at large,\u201d <em>Blue Chip Stamps </em>v. <em>Manor Drug Stores, </em>421 U. S. 723, 733, n. 5 (1975), it should not be interpreted to provide a private cause of action against the entire marketplace in which the issuing company operates.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Petitioner\u2019s theory, moreover, would put an unsupportable interpretation on Congress\u2019 specific response to <em>Central Bank </em>in \u00a7104 of the PSLRA. Congress amended the securities laws to provide for limited coverage of aiders and abettors. Aiding and abetting liability is authorized in actions brought by the SEC but not by private parties. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78t(e). Petitioner\u2019s view of primary liability makes any aider and abettor liable under \u00a7 10(b) if he or she committed a deceptive act in the process of providing assistance. Reply Brief for Petitioner 6, n. 2; Tr. of Oral Arg. 24. Were we to adopt this construction of \u00a7 10(b), it would revive in substance the implied cause , of action against all aiders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>and abettors except those who committed no deceptive act in the process of facilitating the fraud; and we would undermine Congress\u2019 determination that this class of defendants should be pursued by the SEC and not by private litigants. See <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Sandoval, </em>532 U. S. 275, 290 (2001) (\u201cThe express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that Congress intended to preclude others\u201d); <em>FDA </em>v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>529 U. S. 120, 143 (2000) (\u201cAt the time a statute is enacted, it may have a range of plausible meanings. Over time, however, subsequent acts can shape or focus those meanings\u201d); see also <em>Seatrain Shipbuilding Corp. </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., </em>444 U. S. 572, 596 (1980) (\u201c[W]hile the views of subsequent Congresses cannot override the unmistakable intent of the enacting one, such views are entitled to significant weight, and particularly so when the precise intent of the enacting Congress is obscure\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">This is not a case in which Congress has enacted a regulatory statute and then has accepted, over a long period of time, broad judicial authority to define substantive standards of conduct and liability. Cf. <em>Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>PSKS, Inc., </em>551 U. S. 877, 899 (2007). And in accord with the nature of the cause of action at issue here, we give weight to Congress\u2019 amendment to the Act restoring aiding and abetting liability in certain cases but not others. The amendment, in our view, supports the conclusion that there is no liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The practical consequences of an expansion, which the Court has considered appropriate to examine in circumstances like these, see <em>Virginia Bankshares, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sandberg, </em>501 U. S. 1083, 1104-1105 (1991); <em>Blue Chip, </em>421 U. S., at 737, provide a further reason to reject petitioner\u2019s approach. In <em>Blue Chip, </em>the Court noted that extensive discovery and the potential for uncertainty and disruption in a lawsuit allow, plaintiffs with weak claims to extort settlements from innocent companies. <em>Id., </em>at 740-741. Adoption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>of petitioner\u2019s approach would expose a new class of defendants to these risks. As noted in <em>Central Bank, </em>contracting parties might find it necessary to protect against these threats, raising the costs of doing business. See 511 U. S., at 189. Overseas firms with no other exposure to our securities laws could be deterred from doing business here. See Brief for Organization for International Investment et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>17-20. This, in turn, may raise the cost of being a publicly traded company under our law and shift securities offerings away from domestic capital markets. Brief for NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc., et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>12-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The history of the \u00a7 10(b) private right and the careful approach the Court has taken before proceeding without congressional direction provide further reasons to find no liability here. The \u00a7 10(b) private cause of action is a judicial construct that Congress did not enact in the text of the relevant statutes. See <em>Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow </em>v. <em>Gilbertson, </em>501 U. S. 350, 358-359 (1991); <em>Blue Chip, supra, </em>at 729. Though the rule once may have been otherwise, see <em>J. I. Case Co. </em>v. <em>Borak, </em>377 U. S. 426, 432-433 (1964), it is settled that there is an implied cause of action only if the underlying statute can be interpreted to disclose the intent to create one, see, <em>e. g., Alexander, supra, </em>at 286-287; <em>Virginia Bankshares, supra, </em>at 1102; <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Redington, </em>442 U. S. 560, 575 (1979). This is for good reason. In the absence of congressional intent the Judiciary\u2019s recognition of an implied private right of action</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">\u201cnecessarily extends its authority to embrace a dispute Congress has not assigned it to resolve. This runs contrary to the established principle that \u2018[t]he jurisdiction of the federal courts is carefully guarded against expansion by judicial interpretation . . . ,\u2019 <em>American Fire &amp; Cas[ualty] Co. </em>v. <em>Finn, </em>341 U. S. 6, 17 (1951), and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>flicts with the authority of Congress under Art. III to set the limits of federal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>University of Chicago, </em>441 U. S. 677, 746-747 (1979) (Powell, J., dissenting) (citations and footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The determination of who can seek a remedy has significant consequences for the reach of federal power. See <em>Wilder </em>v. <em>Virginia Hospital Assn., </em>496 U. S. 498, 509, n. 9 (1990) (requirement of congressional intent \u201creflects a concern, grounded in separation of powers, that Congress rather than the courts controls the availability of remedies for violations of statutes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Concerns with the judicial creation of a private cause of action caution against its expansion. The decision to extend the cause of action is for Congress, not for us. Though it remains the law, the \u00a7 10(b) private right should not be extended beyond its present boundaries. See <em>Virginia Bank-shares, supra, </em>at 1102 (\u201c[T]he breadth of the [private right of action] once recognized should not, as a general matter, grow beyond the scope congressionally intended\u201d); see also <em>Central Bank, supra, </em>at 173 (determining that the scope of conduct prohibited is limited by the text of \u00a7 10(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">This restraint is appropriate in light of the PSLRA, which imposed heightened pleading requirements and a loss causation requirement upon \u201cany private action\u201d arising from the Securities Exchange Act. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78u-4(b). It is clear these requirements touch upon the implied right of action, which is now a prominent feature of federal securities regulation. See <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. </em>v. <em>Dabit, </em>547 U. S. 71, 81-82 (2006); <em>Dura, </em>544 U. S., at 345-346; see also S. Rep. No. 104-98, pp. 4-5 (1995) (recognizing the \u00a7 10(b) implied cause of action, and indicating the PSLRA was intended to have \u201cCongress . . . reassert its authority in this area\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 26 (indicating the pleading standards covered \u00a7 10(b) actions). Congress thus ratified the implied right of action after the Court moved away from a broad willingness to imply private rights of action. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number><em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>v. <em>Curran, </em>456 U. S. 353, 381-382, and n. 66 (1982); cf. <em>Borak, supra, </em>at 433. It is appropriate for us to assume that when \u00a7 78u-4 was enacted, Congress accepted the \u00a7 10(b) private cause of action as then defined but chose to extend it no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Secondary actors are subject to criminal penalties, see, <em>e. g., </em>15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78ff, and civil enforcement by the SEC, see, <em>e. g., </em>\u00a7 78t(e). The enforcement power is not toothless. Since September 30, 2002, SEC enforcement actions have collected over $10 billion in disgorgement and penalties, much of it for distribution to injured investors. See SEC, 2007 Performance and Accountability Report, p. 26, http:// www.sec.gov/about/secpar2007.shtml (as visited Jan. 2, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). And in this case both parties agree that criminal penalties are a strong deterrent. See Brief for Respondents 48; Reply Brief for Petitioner 17. In addition some state securities laws permit state authorities to seek fines and restitution from aiders and abettors. See, <em>e. g., </em>Del. Code Ann., Tit. 6, \u00a7 7325 (2005). All secondary actors, furthermore, are not necessarily immune from private suit. The securities statutes provide an express private right of action against accountants and underwriters in certain circumstances, see 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 77k, and the implied right of action in \u00a7 10(b) continues to cover secondary actors who commit primary violations, <em>Central Bank, </em>511 U. S., at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Here respondents were acting in concert with Charter in the ordinary course as suppliers and, as matters then evolved in the not so ordinary course, as customers. Unconventional as the arrangement was, it took place in the marketplace for goods and services, not in the investment sphere. Charter was free to do as it chose in preparing its books, conferring with its auditor, and preparing and then issuing its financial statements. In these circumstances the investors cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>said to have relied upon any of respondents\u2019 deceptive acts in the decision to purchase or sell securities; and as the requisite reliance cannot be shown, respondents have no liability to petitioner under the implied right of action. This conclusion is consistent with the narrow dimensions we must give to a right of action Congress did not authorize when it first enacted the statute and did not expand when it revisited the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b425-7\">Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration or decision of this ease.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b425-8\">Justice Stevens,</author>\n<p id=\"AeG\">with whom Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Charter Communications, Inc., inflated its revenues by $17 million in order to cover up a $15 to $20 million expected cashflow shortfall. It could not have done so absent the knowingly fraudulent actions of Seientific-Atlanta, Inc., and Motorola, Inc. Investors relied on Charter\u2019s revenue statements in deciding whether to invest in Charter and in doing so relied on respondents\u2019 fraud, which was itself a \u201cdeceptive device\u201d prohibited by \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78j(b). This is enough to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 10(b) and enough to distinguish this case from <em>Central Bank of Denver, N. A. </em>v. <em>First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., </em>511 U. S. 164 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">The Court seems to assume that respondents\u2019 alleged conduct could subject them to liability in an enforcement proceeding initiated by the Government, <em>ante, </em>at 166, but nevertheless concludes that they are not subject to liability in a private action brought by injured investors because they are, at most, guilty of aiding and abetting a violation of \u00a7 10(b), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>rather than an actual violation of the statute. While that conclusion results in an affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Appeals, it rests on a rejection of that court\u2019s reasoning. Furthermore, while the Court frequently refers to petitioner\u2019s attempt to \u201cexpand\u201d the implied cause of action<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 a conclusion that begs the question of the contours of that cause of action \u2014 it is today\u2019s decision that results in a significant departure from <em>Central Bank.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The Court\u2019s conclusion that no violation of \u00a7 10(b) giving rise to a private right of action has been alleged in this case rests on two faulty premises: (1) the Court\u2019s overly broad reading of <em>Central Bank, </em>and (2) the view that reliance requires a kind of super-causation \u2014 a view contrary to both the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) position in a recent Ninth Circuit case<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and our holding in <em>Basic Inc. </em>v. <em>Levinson, </em>485 U. S. 224 (1988). These two points merit separate discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The Court of Appeals incorrectly based its decision on the view that \u201c[a] device or contrivance is not \u2018deceptive,\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 10(b), absent some misstatement or a failure to disclose by one who has a duty to disclose.\u201d <em>In re Charter Communications, Inc., Securities Litigation, </em>443 F. 3d 987, 992 (CA8 2006). The Court correctly explains why the statute covers nonverbal-as well as verbal deceptive conduct. <em>Ante, </em>at 158. The allegations in this case \u2014 that respondents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>produced documents falsely claiming costs had risen and signed contracts they knew to be backdated in order to disguise the connection between the increase in costs and the purchase of advertising \u2014 plainly describe \u201cdeceptive devices\u201d under any standard reading of the phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">What the Court fails to recognize is that this case is critically different from <em>Central Bank </em>because the bank in that ease did not engage in any deceptive act and, therefore, did not <em>itself </em>violate \u00a7 10(b). The Court sweeps aside any distinction, remarking that holding respondents liable would \u201crevive in substance the implied cause of action against all aiders and abettors except those who committed no deceptive act in the process of facilitating the fraud.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 162-163. But the fact that Central Bank engaged in no deceptive conduct whatsoever \u2014 in other words, that it was at most an aider and abettor \u2014 sharply distinguishes <em>Central Bank </em>from cases that do involve allegations of such conduct. 511 U. S., at 167 (stating that the question presented was \u201cwhether private civil liability under \u00a7 10(b) extends as well to those who do not engage in the manipulative or deceptive practice, but who aid and abet the violation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The Central Bank of Denver was the indenture trustee for bonds issued by a public authority and secured by liens on property in Colorado Springs. After default, purchasers of $2.1 million of those bonds sued the underwriters, alleging violations of \u00a7 10(b); they also named Central Bank as a defendant, contending that the bank\u2019s delay in reviewing a suspicious appraisal of the value of the security made it liable as an aider and abettor. <em>Id., </em>at 167-168. The facts of this case would parallel those of <em>Central Bank </em>if respondents had, for example, merely delayed sending invoices for set-top boxes to Charter. Conversely, the facts in <em>Central Bank </em>would mirror those in the case before us today if the bank had knowingly purchased real estate in wash transactions at above-market prices in order to facilitate the appraiser\u2019s overvaluation of the security. <em>Central Bank, </em>thus, poses no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>obstacle to petitioner\u2019s argument that it has alleged a cause of action under \u00a7 10(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The Court\u2019s next faulty premise is that petitioner is required to allege that Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola made it \u201cnecessary or inevitable for Charter to record the transactions as it did,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 161, in order to demonstrate reliance. Because the Court of Appeals did not base its holding on reliance grounds, see 443 F. 3d, at 992, the fairest course to petitioner would be for the majority to remand to the Court of Appeals to determine whether petitioner properly alleged reliance, under a correct view of what \u00a7 10(b) covers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the Court chooses to rest its holding on an absence of reliance, a response is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">In <em>Basic Inc., </em>485 U. S., at 243, we stated that \u201c[rjeliance provides the requisite causal connection between a defendant\u2019s misrepresentation and a plaintiff\u2019s injury.\u201d The Court\u2019s view of the causation required to demonstrate reliance is unwarranted and without precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">In <em>Basic Inc., </em>we held that the \u201cfraud-on-the-market\u201d theory provides adequate support for a presumption in private securities actions that shareholders (or former shareholders) in publicly traded companies rely on public material misstatements that affect the price of the company\u2019s stock. <em>Id., </em>at 248. The holding in <em>Basic </em>is surely a sufficient response to the argument that a complaint alleging that deceptive acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>which had a material effect on the price of a listed stock should be dismissed because the plaintiffs were not subjectively aware of the deception at the time of the securities\u2019 purchase or sale. This Court has not held that investors must be aware of the specific deceptive act which violates \u00a7 10b to demonstrate reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The Court is right that a fraud-on-the-market presumption coupled with its view on causation would not support petitioner\u2019s view of reliance. The fraud-on-the-market presumption helps investors who cannot demonstrate that they, <em>themselves, </em>relied on fraud that reached the market. But that presumption says nothing about causation from the other side: what an individual or corporation must do in order to have \u201ccaused\u201d the misleading information that reached the market. The Court thus has it backwards when it first addresses the fraud-on-the-market presumption, rather than the causation required. See <em>ante, </em>at 159. The argument is not that the fraud-on-the-market presumption is enough standing alone, but that a correct view of causation coupled with the presumption would allow petitioner to plead reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Lower courts have correctly stated that the causation necessary to demonstrate reliance is not a difficult hurdle to clear in a private right of action under \u00a7 10(b). Reliance is often equated with \u201c\u2018transaction causation.\u2019\u201d <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Broudo, </em>544 U. S. 336, 341, 342 (2005). Transaction causation, in turn, is often defined as requiring an allegation that but for the deceptive act, the plaintiff would not have entered into the securities transaction. See, <em>e. g., Lentell </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., </em>396 F. 3d 161, 172 (CA2 2005); <em>Binder </em>v. <em>Gillespie, </em>184 F. 3d 1059, 1065-1066 (CA9 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Even if but-for causation, standing alone, is too weak to establish reliance, petitioner has also alleged that respondents proximately caused Charter\u2019s misstatement of income; petitioner has alleged that respondents knew their deceptive</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>acts would be the basis for statements that would influence the market price of Charter stock on which shareholders would rely. Second Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 8, 98, 100, 109, App. 19a, 55a-56a, 59a. Thus, respondents\u2019 acts had the foreseeable effect of causing petitioner to engage in the relevant securities transactions. The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 533, pp. 72-73 (1977), provides that \u201c[t]he maker of a fraudulent misrepresentation is subject to liability ... if the misrepresentation, although not made directly to the other, is made to a third person and the maker intends or has reason to expect that its terms will be repeated or its substance communicated to the other.\u201d The sham transactions described in the complaint in this case had the same effect on Charter\u2019s profit and loss statement as a false entry directly on its books that included $17 million of gross revenues that had not been received. And respondents are alleged to have known that the outcome of their fraudulent transactions would be communicated to investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The Court\u2019s view of reliance is unduly stringent and unmoored from authority. The Court first says that if petitioner\u2019s concept of reliance is adopted the implied cause of action \u201cwould reach the whole marketplace in which the issuing company does business.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 160. The answer to that objection is, of course, that liability only attaches when the company doing business with the issuing company has <em>itself </em>violated \u00a7 10(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court next relies on what it views as a strict division between the \u201crealm of financing business\u201d and the \u201cordinary business operations.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 161. But petitioner\u2019s position does not merge the two: A corporation engaging in a business transaction with a partner who transmits false information to the market is only liable where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>corporation <em>itself </em>violates \u00a7 10(b). Such a rule does not invade the province of \u201cordinary\u201d business transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The majority states that \u201c[sjection 10(b) does not incorporate common-law fraud into federal law,\u201d citing <em>SEC </em>v. <em>Zandford, </em>535 U. S. 813 (2002). <em>Ante, </em>at 162. Of course, not every common-law fraud action that happens to touch upon securities is an action under \u00a7 10(b), but the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Zandford </em>did not purport to jettison all reference to common-law fraud doctrines from \u00a7 10(b) cases. In fact, our prior cases explained that to the extent that \u201cthe antifraud provisions of the securities laws are not coextensive with common-law doctrines of fraud,\u201d it is because common-law fraud doctrines might be too restrictive. <em>Herman &amp; MacLean </em>v. <em>Huddleston, </em>459 U. S. 375, 388-389 (1983). \u201cIndeed, an important purpose of the federal securities statutes was to rectify perceived deficiencies in the available common-law protections by establishing higher standards of conduct in the securities industry.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 389. I, thus, see no reason to abandon common-law approaches to causation in \u00a7 10(b) cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Finally, the Court relies on the course of action Congress adopted after our decision in <em>Central Bank </em>to argue that siding with petitioner on reliance would run contrary to congressional intent. Senate hearings on <em>Central Bank </em>were held within one month of our decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Less than one year later, Senators Dodd and Domenici introduced S. 240, which became the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), 109 Stat. 737.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Congress stopped short of undoing <em>Central Bank </em>entirely, instead adopting a compromise which restored the authority of the SEC to enforce aiding and abetting liability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A private right of action based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>aiding and abetting violations of \u00a7 10(b) was not, however, included in the PSLRA,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> despite support from Senator Dodd and members of the Senate Subcommittee on Securities.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This compromise surely provides no support for extending <em>Central Bank </em>in order to immunize an undefined class of actual violators of \u00a7 10(b) from liability in private litigation. Indeed, as Members of Congress \u2014 including those who rejected restoring a private cause of action against aiders and abettors \u2014 made clear, private litigation under \u00a7 10(b) continues to play a vital role in protecting the integrity of our securities markets.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That Congress chose not to restore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>the aiding and abetting liability removed by <em>Central Bank </em>does not mean that Congress wanted to exempt from liability the broader <em>range </em>of conduct that today\u2019s opinion excludes.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The Court is concerned that such liability would deter overseas firms from doing business in the United States or \u201cshift securities offerings away from domestic capital markets.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 164. But liability for those who violate \u00a7 10(b) \u201cwill not harm American competitiveness; in fact, investor faith in the safety and integrity of our markets <em>is </em>their strength. The fact that our markets are the safest in the world has helped make them the strongest in the world.\u201d Brief for Former SEC Commissioners as <em>Amici Curiae </em>9.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Accordingly, while I recognize that the <em>Central Bank </em>opinion provides a precedent for judicial policymaking decisions in this area of the law, I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s continuing campaign to render the private cause of action under \u00a7 10(b) toothless. I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">While I would reverse for the reasons stated above, I must also comment on the importance of the private cause of action that Congress implicitly authorized when it enacted the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A theme that underlies the Court\u2019s analysis is its mistaken hostility toward the \u00a7 10(b) private cause of action.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Ante, </em>at 164-165. The Court\u2019s current view of implied causes of action is that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>are merely a \u201crelic\u201d of our prior \u201cheady days.\u201d <em>Correctional Services Corp. </em>v. <em>Malesko, </em>534 U. S. 61, 75 (2001) (SCALIA, J., concurring). Those \u201cheady days\u201d persisted for 200 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">During the first two centuries of this Nation\u2019s history much of our law was developed by judges in the common-law tradition. A basic principle animating our jurisprudence was enshrined in state constitution provisions guaranteeing, in substance, that \u201cevery wrong shall have a remedy.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Fashioning appropriate remedies for the violation of rules of law designed to protect a class of citizens was the routine business of judges. See <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>1 Cranch 137, 166 (1803). While it is true that in the early days state law was the source of most of those rules, throughout our history \u2014 until 1975 \u2014 the same practice prevailed in federal courts with regard to federal statutes that left questions of remedy open for judges to answer. In <em>Texas &amp; Pacific R. Co. </em>v. <em>Rigsby, </em>241 U. S. 33, 39 (1916), this Court stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">\u201cA disregard of the command of the statute is a wrongful act, and where it results in damage to one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted, the right to recover the damages from the party in default is implied, according to a doctrine of the common law expressed in 1 Com. Dig., <em>tit. </em>Action upon Statute (F), in these words: \u2018So, in every case, where a statute enacts, or prohibits a thing for the benefit of a person, he shall have a remedy upon the same statute for the thing enacted for his advantage, or for the recompense of a wrong done to him contrary to the said law.\u2019 <em>(Per </em>Holt, C. J., <em>Anon., </em>6 Mod. 26, 27.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Judge Friendly succinctly described the <em>post-Rigsby, </em>pre1975 practice in his opinion in <em>Leist </em>v. <em>Simplot, </em>638 F. 2d 283, 298-299 (CA2 1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\">\u201cFollowing <em>Rigsby </em>the Supreme Court recognized implied causes of action on numerous occasions, see, e. g., <em>Wyandotte Transportation Co. v. United States, </em>389 U. S. 191 . . . (1967) (sustaining implied cause of action by United States for damages under Rivers and Harbors Act for removing negligently sunk vessel despite express remedies of <em>in rem </em>action and criminal penalties); <em>United States v. Republic Steel Corp., </em>362 U. S. 482 . . . (1960) (sustaining implied cause of action by United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>States for an injunction under the Rivers and Harbors Act); <em>Tunstall v. Locomotive Firemen &amp; Enginemen, </em>323 U. S. 210 . . . (1944) (sustaining implied cause of action by union member against union for discrimination among members despite existence of Board of Mediation); <em>Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., </em>396 U. S. 229 ... (1969) (sustaining implied private cause of action under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1982); <em>Allen v. State Board of Elections, </em>393 U. S. 544 ... (1969) (sustaining implied private cause of action under \u00a75 of the Voting Rights Act despite the existence of a complex regulatory scheme and explicit rights of action in the Attorney General); and, of course, the aforementioned decisions under the securities laws. As the Supreme Court itself has recognized, the period of the 1960\u2019s and early 1970\u2019s was one in which the \u2018Court had consistently found implied remedies.\u2019 <em>Cannon v. University of Chicaqo, </em>441 U. S. 677, 698 .. . (1979).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">In a law-changing opinion written by Justice Brennan in 1975, the Court decided to modify its approach to private causes of action. <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>422 U. S. 66 (constraining courts to use a strict four-factor test to determine whether Congress intended a private cause of action). A few years later, in <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>University of Chicago, </em>441 U. S. 677 (1979), we adhered to the strict approach mandated by <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Ash </em>in 1975, but made it clear that \u201cour evaluation of congressional action in 1972 must take into account its contemporary legal context.\u201d 441 U. S., at 698-699. That context persuaded the majority that Congress had intended the courts to authorize a private remedy for members of the protected class.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Until <em>Central Bank, </em>the federal courts continued to enforce a broad implied cause of action for the violation of statutes enacted in 1933 and 1934 for the protection of investors. As Judge Friendly explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>\u201cDuring the late 1940\u2019s, the 1950\u2019s, the 1960\u2019s and the early 1970\u2019s there was widespread, indeed almost general, recognition of implied causes of action for damages under many provisions of the Securities Exchange Act, including not only the antifraud provisions, \u00a7\u00a710 and 15(c)(1), see <em>Kardon v. National Gypsum Co., </em>69 F. Supp. 512, 513-14 (E.D.Pa.1946); <em>Fischman v. Raytheon Mfg. Co., </em>188 F. 2d 783, 787 (2 Cir. 1951) (Frank, <em>J.); Fratt v. Robinson, </em>203 F. 2d 627, 631-33 (9 Cir. 1953), but many others. These included the provision, \u00a7 6(a)(1), requiring securities exchanges to enforce compliance with the Act and any rule or regulation made thereunder, see <em>Baird v. Franklin, </em>141 F. 2d 238, 239, 240, 244-45 (2 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>323 U. S. 737 ... (1944), and provisions governing the solicitation of proxies, see <em>J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, </em>377 U. S. 426, 431-35 . . . (1964). . . . Writing in 1961, Professor Loss remarked with respect to violations of the antifraud provisions that with one exception \u2018not a single judge has expressed himself to the contrary.\u2019 3 Securities Regulation 1763-64. See also Bromberg &amp; Lowenfels, [Securities Fraud &amp; Commodities Fraud] \u00a7 2.2 (462) [(1979)] (describing 1946-1974 as the \u2018expansion era\u2019 in implied causes of action under the securities laws). When damage actions for violation of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 reached the Supreme Court, the existence of an implied cause of action was not deemed worthy of extended discussion. <em>Superintendent of Insurance v. Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>404 U. S. 6 ... (1971).\u201d <em>Leist, </em>638 F. 2d, at 296-297 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In light of the history of court-created remedies and specifically the history of implied causes of action under \u00a7 10(b), the Court is simply wrong when it states that Congress did not impliedly authorize this private cause of action \u201cwhen it first enacted the statute.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 167. Courts near in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>time to the enactment of the securities laws recognized that the principle in <em>Rigsby </em>applied to the securities laws.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Congress enacted \u00a7 10(b) with the understanding that federal courts respected the principle that every wrong would have a remedy. Today\u2019s decision simply cuts back further on Congress\u2019 intended remedy.
