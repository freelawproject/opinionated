Logan pleaded guilty in a United States District Court to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Logan\u2019s record as a recidivist, which included three relevant state convictions, led the District Court to impose a 15-year prison term, the minimum sentence mandated by the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). For ACCA sentence-enhancement purposes, a prior conviction may be disregarded if the conviction \u201chas been expunged, or set aside,\u201d or the offender \u201chas been pardoned or has had civil rights restored.\u201d \u00a7921(a)(20) (2000 ed.). None of Logan\u2019s prior convictions have been expunged or set aside. Nor has he been pardoned for any past crime. And, bearing importantly on the instant petition, the three state-court convictions that triggered Logan\u2019s ACCA-enhanced sentence occasioned no loss of civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Challenging his enhanced sentence, Logan presents this question: Does the \u201ccivil rights restored\u201d exemption contained in \u00a7 921(a)(20) encompass, and therefore remove from ACCA\u2019s reach, state-court convictions that at no time deprived the offender of civil rights? We hold that the \u00a7921(a)(20) exemption provision does not cover the case of an offender who retained civil rights at all times, and whose legal status, postconviction, remained in all respects unaltered by any state dispensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Section 921(a)(20) sets out postconviction events\u2014 expungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of civil rights \u2014 that extend to an offender a measure of forgiveness, relieving him from some or all of the consequences of his conviction. Congress might have broadened the \u00a7 921(a)(20) exemption provision to cover convictions attended by no loss of civil rights. The national lawmakers, however, did not do so. Section 921(a)(20)\u2019s failure to exempt convictions that do not revoke civil rights produces anomalies. But so does the extension of the \u00a7 921(a)(20) exemption that Logan advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>We are not equipped to say what statutory alteration, if any, Congress would have made had its attention trained on offenders who retained civil rights; nor can we recast \u00a7 921(a)(20) in Congress\u2019 stead.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Federal law generally prohibits the possession of a firearm by a person convicted of \u201ca crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Ordinarily, the maximum felon-in-possession sentence is ten years. See \u00a7 924(a)(2). If the offender\u2019s prior criminal record includes at least three convictions for \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d or \u201cserious drug offense[s],\u201d however, the maximum sentence increases to life, and ACCA mandates a minimum term of 15 years. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Congress defined the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d to include specified crimes \u201cpunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (2000 ed.). An offense classified by a State as a misdemeanor, however, may qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for ACCA-enhancement purposes (or as a predicate for a felon-in-possession conviction under \u00a7 922(g)) only if the offense is punishable by more than two years in prison. \u00a7 921(a)(20)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">In <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>New Banner Institute, Inc., </em>460 U. S. 103 (1983), we held that a State\u2019s expungement of a conviction did not nullify the conviction for purposes of the firearms disabilities Congress placed in \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and (h)(1). In so ruling, we noted that our decision would ensure greater uniformity in federal sentences. See <em>id., </em>at 119-120. Provisions for expungement \u201cvar[ied] widely from State to State,\u201d we observed, <em>id., </em>at 120, and yielded \u201cnothing less than a national patchwork,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">In the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act (FOPA), 100 Stat. 449, Congress amended \u00a7921(a)(20) in response to <em>Dickerson\u2019s </em>holding that, for purposes of federal firearms disabilities, state law did not determine the present impact of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>prior conviction. The amended provision excludes from qualification as a \u201ccrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d (or a misdemeanor under state law punishable by more than two years in prison):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">\u201cAny conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored ... unless such pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 921(a)(20).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">While \u00a7 921(a)(20) does not define the term \u201ccivil rights,\u201d courts have held, and petitioner agrees, that the civil rights relevant under the above-quoted provision are the rights to vote, hold office, and serve on a jury. See Brief for Petitioner 13, n. 10; cf. <em>Caron </em>v. <em>United States, </em>524 U. S. 308, 316 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">On May 31, 2005, police officers responded to a domestic disturbance complaint made by Logan\u2019s girlfriend, Asenath Wilson. App. 9, 12. Wilson told the officers, among other things, that she had seen Logan with a gun and that he usually kept it in the car. <em>Id., </em>at 9. Logan, who was with Wil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>son when the police arrived, consented to a search of his car. <em>Id., </em>at 11. In a hidden compartment behind the glove box, the officers found a 9-millimeter handgun. <em>Id., </em>at 9-10, 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Logan pleaded guilty to the federal offense of possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony. <em>Id., </em>at 12. (In 1991, he had been convicted in an Illinois court of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. <em>Id., </em>at 9-10, 12.) The United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin sentenced Logan to imprisonment for 15 years, the mandatory minimum under ACCA. In imposing that enhanced sentence, the District Court took account of Logan\u2019s three Wisconsin misdemeanor battery convictions, each punishable by a maximum sentence of three years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id., </em>at 16-18.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Both in the District Court and on appeal, Logan argued that his Wisconsin misdemeanor convictions did not qualify as ACCA predicate offenses because they caused no loss of his civil rights. Rights retained, he urged, are functionally equivalent to rights revoked but later restored. If the exemption contained in \u00a7921(a)(20) covered the three state-court misdemeanor convictions, Logan\u2019s maximum sentence, in lieu of the 15-year mandatory minimum under ACCA, would have been ten years, see \u00a7 924(a)(2), and the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>States Sentencing Guidelines would have indicated a sentence range of 37 to 46 months, see Brief for Petitioner 5. The District Court rejected Logan\u2019s argument, holding that the \u00a7 921(a)(20) exemption provision \u201capplies only to defendants whose civil rights were both lost and restored pursuant to state statutes.\u201d App. in No. 05-CR-088-S-01 (WD Wis.), p. 11. Accordingly, the court sentenced Logan to imprisonment for 15 years. <em>Id., </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed, concluding that \u201can offender whose civil rights have been neither diminished nor returned is not a person who \u2018has had civil rights restored.\u2019\u201d 453 F. 3d 804, 805 (2006). Logan\u2019s argument for treating retained rights the same way as restored rights, the appeals court observed, \u201cgo[es] in the teeth of [\u00a7 921(a)(20)\u2019s] text.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">We granted certiorari, 549 U. S. 1204 (2007), to resolve a split among the Circuits as to whether \u00a7 921(a)(20)\u2019s exception for \u201ccivil rights restored\u201d should be interpreted to include civil rights retained at all times. Compare 453 F. 3d, at 809 (case below) (\u201ccivil rights restored\u201d does not include civil rights never revoked), and <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>United States, </em>60 F. 3d 1005 (CA2 1995) (same), with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Indelicato, </em>97 F. 3d 627, 631 (CA1 1996) (\u201ccivil rights restored\u201d includes civil rights never lost).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Logan pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of \u00a7 922(g)(l), and received a mandatory minimum 15-year sentence because he had at least three prior convictions for \u201cviolent felon[ies].\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V). He acknowledges his convictions in Wisconsin'for three battery offenses that facially qualify as violent felonies under \u00a7 921(a)(20)(B) (2000 ed.). See Brief for Petitioner 4-5. Thus the sole matter in dispute is whether Logan fits within the exemption from an ACCA-enhanced sentence for convictions \u201cexpunged, or set aside\u201d or offend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>ers who \u201cha[ve] been pardoned or ha[ve] had civil rights restored.\u201d \u00a7921(a)(20). None of Logan\u2019s battery convictions have been expunged, set aside, or pardoned. See 458 F. 3d, at 809. Under Wisconsin law, felons lose but can regain their civil rights and can gain the removal of firearms disabilities. See Wis. Stat. \u00a76.03(l)(b) (Supp. 2006); Wis. Const., Art. XIII, \u00a7 3(2); Wis. Stat. \u00a7 756.02 (2001); \u00a7 973.176(1) (2007). Persons convicted of misdemeanors, however, even if they are repeat offenders, generally retain their civil rights and are not subject to firearms disabilities..</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">With this background in view, we turn to the proper interpretation of the \u00a7 921(a)(20) exemption from ACCA-enhanced sentencing for offenders who have had their \u201ccivil rights restored.\u201d Logan\u2019s misdemeanor convictions, we reiterate, did not result in any loss of the rights to vote, hold public office, or serve on juries. Should he nonetheless be ranked with offenders whose rights were terminated but later restored? The ordinary meaning of the word \u201crestored\u201d affords Logan no aid. In line with dictionary definitions,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals stated: \u201cThe word \u2018restore\u2019 means to give back something that had been taken away.\u201d 453 F. 3d, at 805. Accord <em>McGrath, </em>60 F. 3d, at 1007 (\u201cThe \u2018restoration\u2019 of a thing never lost or diminished is a definitional impossibility.\u201d); cf. <em>Indelicato, </em>97 F. 3d, at 629 (\u201cClearly the ordinary reading of the word \u2018restored\u2019 supports the government.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The context in which the word \u201crestored\u201d appears in \u00a7 921(a)(20) counsels adherence to the word\u2019s ordinary meaning. Words in a list are generally known by the company they keep. <em>E. g., Dole </em>v. <em>Steelworkers, </em>494 U. S. 26, 36 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>(1990); <em>Beecham </em>v. <em>United States, </em>511 U. S. 368, 371 (1994). In \u00a7 921(a)(20), the words \u201ccivil rights restored\u201d appear in the company of the words \u201cexpunged,\u201d \u201cset aside,\u201d and \u201cpardoned.\u201d Each term describes a measure by which the government relieves an offender of some or all of the consequences of his conviction. In contrast, a defendant who retains rights is simply left alone. He receives no status-altering dispensation, no token of forgiveness from the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Opposing a plain-meaning approach to the language Congress enacted, Logan relies dominantly on the harsh results a literal reading could yield: Unless retention of rights is treated as legally equivalent to restoration of rights, less serious offenders will be subject to ACCA\u2019s enhanced penalties while more serious offenders in the same State, who have had civil rights restored, may escape heightened punishment. <em>E. g., </em>Reply Brief 8 (\u201c[individuals who have committed more serious crimes than Petitioner may nonetheless have their rights restored, whereas misdemeanants who never lost their rights must suffer enhanced sentencing.\u201d). Logan urges that this result \u2014 treating those who never lost their civil rights more harshly than those who lost, then regained, those rights \u2014 is not merely anomalous; it rises to the level of the absurd, particularly in States where restoration of civil rights is automatic and occurs immediately upon release from prison. See <em>Caron, </em>524 U. S., at 313 (automatic restoration of rights qualifies for \u00a7 921(a)(20)\u2019s exemption).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Logan\u2019s argument, we note, overlooks \u00a7 921(a)(20)\u2019s \u201cunless\u201d clause. Under that provision, an offender gains no exemption from ACCA\u2019s application through an expungement, set-aside, pardon, or restoration of civil rights if the dispensation \u201cexpressly provides that the [offender] may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\u201d Many States that restore felons\u2019 civil rights (or accord another measure of forgiveness) nonetheless impose or retain firearms disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>See Brief for United States 30 (citing, <em>inter alia, </em>La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14:95.1(C) (West Supp. 2007), under which felons\u2019 firearms disabilities are lifted only after ten years and only if no further felony convictions intervene).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We further note that Wisconsin has addressed, and prospectively eliminated, the anomaly Logan asserts he encountered: Wisconsin no longer punishes misdemeanors by more than two years of imprisonment, and thus no longer has any misdemeanors that qualify as ACCA predicates. See <em>supra, </em>at 29, n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">One can demur to Logan\u2019s argument that a literal reading of \u00a7 921(a)(20) could produce anomalous results, for the resolution he proposes \u2014 reading into the exemption convictions under which civil rights are retained \u2014 would correct one potential anomaly while creating others. See <em>McGrath, </em>60 F. 3d, at 1009. Under Logan\u2019s proposed construction, the most dangerous recidivists in a State that does not revoke any offender\u2019s civil rights could fall within \u00a7 921(a)(20)\u2019s exemption. For example, Maine does not deprive any offenders of their civil rights. See Lodging for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>(NACDL Lodging), App. 1, pp. 23-24. As Logan would have us read \u00a7921(a)(20), all Maine crimes, including first-degree murder, would be treated as crimes for which \u201ccivil rights [have been] restored,\u201d while less serious crimes committed elsewhere would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">In <em>McGrath, </em>the Second Circuit incisively identified Congress\u2019 response to <em>Dickerson, </em>see <em>supra, </em>at 27-28, as the cause of the multiple anomalies \u00a7 921(a)(20) may produce:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>\u201c[Congress\u2019] decision to have restoration triggered by events governed by state law insured anomalous results. The several states have considerably different laws governing pardon, expungement, and forfeiture and restoration of civil rights. Furthermore, states have drastically different policies as to when and under what circumstances such discretionary acts of grace should be extended. . . . [Anomalies generated by \u00a7 921(a)(20)] are the inevitable consequence of making access to the exemption depend on the differing laws and policies of the several states.\u201d 60 F. 3d, at 1009.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Accord 453 F. 3d, at 807 (\u201cWhen Congress replaced <em>Dicker-so[nJ </em>... it ensured that similarly situated people would be treated differently \u2014 for states vary widely in which if any civil rights a convict loses and whether these rights are restored.\u201d). See also M. Love, Relief from the Collateral Consequences of a Criminal Conviction: A State-by-State Resource Guide (2006), updated online at http://www.sentencingproject.org/PublicationDetails.aspx? PublieationID=486 (as visited Nov. 27, 2007, and in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (surveying state practices).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Were we to accept Logan\u2019s argument, it bears emphasis, we would undercut \u00a7 921(a)(20)(B), which places within ACCA\u2019s reach state misdemeanor convictions punishable by more than two years\u2019 imprisonment. Because state-law misdemeanors generally entail no revocation of civil rights,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Logan\u2019s proposed reading of the word \u201crestored\u201d to include \u201cretained\u201d would yield this curiosity: An offender would fall within ACCA\u2019s reach if his three prior offenses carried potential prison terms of over two years, but that same of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>fender would be released from ACCA\u2019s grip by virtue of his retention of civil rights. We are disinclined to say that what Congress imposed with one hand (exposure to ACCA) it withdrew with the other (exemption from ACCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">We may assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that when Congress revised \u00a7 921(a)(20) in 1986, see <em>supra, </em>at 27-28, it labored under the misapprehension that all offenders \u2014 misdemeanants as well as felons \u2014 forfeit civil rights, at least temporarily. Even indulging the further assumption that courts may repair such a congressional oversight or mistake,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we could hardly divine the revision the Legislature would favor. Perhaps Congress would choose to exempt offenders who never lost their civil rights. See <em>McGrath, </em>60 F. 3d, at 1009. But it is also plausible that Congress would remove the exemption for civil rights restoration as insufficiently indicative of official forgiveness. Or, Congress might elect to include restorations of civil rights along with expungements, set-asides, and pardons only if the restoration was nonautomatic, <em>i. e., </em>granted on a case-by-case basis. Homing in on the disparities resulting from diverse state legislation, see <em>supra, </em>at 33-34 and this page, Congress might even revise \u00a7 921(a)(20) to provide, in accord with <em>Dickerson, </em>that federal rather than state law defines a conviction for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 922 and 924. See 453 F. 3d, at 806-807.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In all events, a measure adopted ten years after \u00a7 921(a)(20) was given its current shape cautions against any assumption that Congress did not mean to deny that exemption to offenders who retained their civil rights. In 1996, Congress enacted \u00a7 922(g)(9), which outlaws possession of a firearm by anyone \u201cwho has been convicted ... of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\u201d See Pub. L. 104-208, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Tit. VI, \u00a7658, 110 Stat. 3009-371 to 3009-372. Tailored to \u00a7 922(g)(9), Congress adopted a definitional provision, corresponding to \u00a7 921(a)(20), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">\u201cA person shall not be considered to have been convicted of [a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence] if the conviction has been expunged or set aside, or is an offense for which the person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored <em>(if the law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil rights under such an offense) </em>unless the pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Section 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) tracks \u00a7921(a)(20) in specifying expungement, set-aside, pardon, or restoration of rights as dispensations that can cancel lingering effects of a conviction. But the emphasized parenthetical qualification shows that the words \u201ccivil rights restored\u201d do not cover a person whose civil rights were never taken away. See 453 F. 3d, at 808. Section 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) casts considerable doubt on Logan\u2019s hypothesis that, had Congress adverted to the issue when it drafted \u00a7 921(a)(20), it would have placed in the same category persons who regained civil rights and persons who retained civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Congress\u2019 enactment of \u00a7 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) is also relevant to Logan\u2019s absurdity argument. See <em>supra, </em>at 32. Statutory terms, we have held, may be interpreted against their literal meaning where the words \u201ccould not conceivably have been intended to apply\u201d to the case at hand. <em>Cabell </em>v. <em>Markham, </em>148 F. 2d 737, 739 (CA2) (L. Hand, J.), aff\u2019d, 326 U. S. 404 (1945); see <em>Green </em>v. <em>Bock Laundry Machine Co., </em>490 U. S. 504, 511 (1989) (Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a)(1) <em>\u201ccan\u2019t mean </em>what it says\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). In this case, it can hardly be maintained that Congress could not have meant what it said. Congress explic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>itly distinguished between \u201crestored\u201d and \u201cretained\u201d in \u00a7 921(a)(33)(B)(ii). It is more than \u201cconceivable\u201d that the Legislature, albeit an earlier one, see <em>supra, </em>at 27-28, meant to do the same in \u00a7 921(a)(20).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In sum, Congress framed \u00a7 921(a)(20) to serve two purposes. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-29. It sought to qualify as ACCA predicate offenses violent crimes that a State classifies as misdemeanors yet punishes by a substantial term of imprisonment, <em>i. e., </em>more than two years. See \u00a7 921(a)(20)(B). Congress also sought to defer to a State\u2019s dispensation relieving an offender from disabling effects of a conviction. See <em>supra, </em>at 27-28. Had Congress included a retention-of-rights exemption, however, the very misdemeanors it meant to cover would escape ACCA\u2019s reach. See <em>supra, </em>at 34-35. Logan complains of an anomalous result. Yet the solution he proposes would also produce anomalies. See <em>supra,, </em>at 33. Having no warrant to stray from \u00a7 921(a)(20)\u2019s text, we hold that the words \u201ccivil rights restored\u201d do not cover the case of an offender who lost no civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-9\">FOPA, 100 Stat. 449, included a \u201csafety valve\u201d provision under which persons subject to federal firearms disabilities, including persons whose civil rights have not been restored, may apply to the Attorney General for relief from the disabilities. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 925(c) (2000 ed., Supp. V).

See Wis. Stat. \u00a7940.19(1) (2005); \u00a7 939.51(3). Logan was exposed to a three-year maximum term for each offense, however, because he was convicted as a \u201crepeater\u201d or \u201chabitual\u201d criminal. See App. 16-17; Wis.

See 2001 Wis. Act 109, \u00a7562 (Jan. 2002 special session) (amending Wis. Stat. \u00a7 939.62).
