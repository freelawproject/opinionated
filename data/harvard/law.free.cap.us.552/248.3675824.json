Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>473 U. S. 134 (1985), we held that a participant in a disability plan that paid a fixed level of b\u00e9nefits could not bring suit under \u00a7 502(a)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 891, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 1132(a)(2), to recover consequential damages arising from delay in the processing of her claim. In this case we consider whether that statutory provision authorizes a participant in a defined contribution pension plan to sue a fiduciary whose alleged misconduct impaired the value of plan assets in the participant\u2019s individual account.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Relying on our decision in <em>Russell, </em>the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that \u00a7 502(a)(2) \u201cprovides remedies only for entire plans, not for individuals. . . . Recovery under this subsection must \u2018inure[ ] to the benefit of the plan <em>as a whole,\u2019 </em>not to particular persons with rights under the plan.\u201d 450 F. 3d 570, 572-573 (2006) (quoting <em>Russell, </em>473 U. S., at 140). While language in our <em>Russell </em>opinion is consistent with that conclusion, the rationale for <em>Russell\u2019s </em>holding supports the opposite result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Petitioner filed this action in 2004 against his former employer, DeWolff, Boberg &amp; Associates, Inc. (DeWolff), and the ERISA-regulated 401(k) retirement savings plan administered by DeWolff (Plan). The Plan permits participants to direct the investment of their contributions in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>with specified procedures and requirements. Petitioner alleged that in 2001 and 2002 he directed DeWolff to make certain changes to the investments in his individual account, but DeWolff never carried out these directions. Petitioner claimed that this omission \u201cdepleted\u201d his interest in the Plan by approximately $150,000, and amounted to a breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA. The complaint sought \u201c \u2018make-whole\u2019 or other equitable relief as allowed by [\u00a7 502(a)(3)],\u201d as well as \u201csuch other and further relief as the court deems just and proper.\u201d Civil Action No. 2:04-1747-18 (D. S. C.), p. 4, 2 Record, Doc. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Respondents filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the complaint was essentially a claim for monetary relief that is not recoverable under \u00a7 502(a)(3). Petitioner countered that he \u201cd[id] not wish for the court to award him any money, but . . . simply want[ed] the plan to properly reflect that which would be his interest in the plan, but for the breach of fiduciary duty.\u201d Reply to Defendants Motion to Dismiss, p. 7, 3 <em>id., </em>Doc. 17. The District Court concluded, however, that since respondents did not possess any disputed funds that rightly belonged to petitioner, he was seeking damages rather than equitable relief available under \u00a7 502(a)(3). Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that respondents had breached a fiduciary duty, the District Court nonetheless granted their motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">On appeal petitioner argued that he had a cognizable claim for relief under \u00a7\u00a7 502(a)(2) and 502(a)(3) of ERISA. The Court of Appeals stated that petitioner had raised his \u00a7 502(a)(2) argument for the first time on appeal, but nevertheless rejected it on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Section 502(a)(2) provides for suits to enforce the liability-creating provisions of \u00a7 409, concerning breaches of fiduciary duties that harm plans.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals cited lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>guage from our opinion in <em>Russell </em>suggesting that these provisions \u201cprotect the entire plan, rather than the rights of an individual beneficiary.\u201d 473 U. S., at 142. It then characterized the remedy sought by petitioner as \u201cpersonal\u201d because he \u201cdesires recovery to be paid into his plan account, an instrument that exists specifically for his benefit,\u201d and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-4\">\u201cWe are therefore skeptical that plaintiff\u2019s individual remedial interest can serve as a legitimate proxy for the plan in its entirety, as [\u00a7 502(a)(2)] requires. To be sure, the recovery plaintiff seeks could be seen as accruing to the plan in the narrow sense that it would be paid into plaintiff\u2019s personal plan <em>account, </em>which is part of the plan. But such a view finds no license in the statutory text, and threatens to undermine the careful limitations Congress has placed on the scope of ERISA relief.\u201d 450 F. 3d, at 574.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The Court of Appeals also rejected petitioner\u2019s argument that the make-whole relief he sought was \u201cequitable\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 502(a)(3). Although our grant of certiorari, 551 U. S. 1130 (2007), encompassed the \u00a7 502(a)(3) issue, we do not address it because we conclude that the Court of Appeals misread \u00a7 502(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">As the case comes to us we must assume that respondents breached fiduciary obligations defined in \u00a7 409(a), and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>those breaches had an adverse impact on the value of the Plan assets in petitioner\u2019s individual account. Whether petitioner can prove those allegations and whether respondents may have valid defenses to the claim are matters not before us.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the record does not reveal the relative size of petitioner\u2019s account, the legal issue under \u00a7 502(a)(2) is the same whether his account includes 1% or 99% of the total assets in the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">As we explained in <em>Russell, </em>and in more detail in our later opinion in <em>Varity Corp. </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>516 U. S. 489, 508-512 (1996), \u00a7 502(a) of ERISA identifies six types of civil actions that may be brought by various parties. The second, which is at issue in this case, authorizes the Secretary of Labor as well as plan participants, beneficiaries, and fiduciaries, to bring actions on behalf of a plan to recover for violations of the obligations defined in \u00a7 409(a). The principal statutory duties imposed on fiduciaries by that section \u201crelate to the proper management, administration, and investment of fund assets,\u201d with an eye toward ensuring that \u201cthe benefits authorized by the plan\u201d are ultimately paid to participants and beneficiaries. <em>Russell, </em>473 U. S., at 142; see also <em>Varity, </em>516 U. S., at 511-512 (noting that \u00a7409\u2019s fiduciary obligations \u201cre-latte] to the plan\u2019s financial integrity\u201d and \u201creflee[t] a special congressional concern about plan asset management\u201d). The misconduct alleged by petitioner in this case falls squarely within that category.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>The misconduct alleged in <em>Russell, </em>by contrast, fell outside this category. The plaintiff in <em>Russell </em>received all of the benefits to which she was contractually entitled, but sought consequential damages arising from a delay in the processing of her claim. 473 U. S., at 136-137. In holding that \u00a7 502(a)(2) does not provide a remedy for this type of injury, we stressed that the text of \u00a7 409(a) characterizes the relevant fiduciary relationship as one \u201cwith respect to a plan,\u201d and repeatedly identifies the \u201cplan\u201d as the victim of any fiduciary breach and the recipient of any relief. See <em>id., </em>at 140. The legislative history likewise revealed that \u201cthe crucible of congressional concern was misuse and mismanagement of plan assets by plan administrators.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 141, n. 8. Finally, our review of ERISA as a whole confirmed that \u00a7\u00a7 502(a)(2) and 409 protect \u201cthe financial integrity of the plan,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 142, n. 9, whereas other provisions specifically address claims for benefits, see <em>id., </em>at 143-144 (discussing \u00a7\u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) and 503). We therefore concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-4\">\u201cA fair contextual reading of the statute makes it abundantly clear that its draftsmen were primarily concerned with the possible misuse of plan assets, and with remedies that would protect the entire plan, rather than with the rights of an individual beneficiary.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 142.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><em>Russell\u2019s </em>emphasis on protecting the \u201centire plan\u201d from fiduciary misconduct reflects the former landscape of employee benefit plans. That landscape has changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Defined contribution plans dominate the retirement plan scene today.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In contrast, when ERISA was enacted, and when <em>Russell </em>was decided, \u201cthe [defined benefit] plan was the norm of American pension practice.\u201d J. Langbein, S. Stabile, &amp; B. Wolk, Pension and Employee Benefit Law 58 (4th ed. 2006); see also Zelinsky, The Defined Contribution Paradigm, 114 Yale L. J. 451, 471 (2004) (discussing the \u201csignificant reversal of historic patterns under which the traditional defined benefit plan was the dominant paradigm for the provision of retirement income\u201d). Unlike the defined contribution plan in this case, the disability plan at issue in <em>Russell </em>did not have individual accounts; it paid a fixed benefit based on a percentage of the employee\u2019s salary. See <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>722 F. 2d 482, 486 (CA9 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The \u201centire plan\u201d language in <em>Russell </em>speaks to the impact of \u00a7409 on plans that pay defined benefits. Misconduct by the administrators of a defined benefit plan will not affect an individual\u2019s entitlement to a defined benefit unless it creates or enhances the risk of default by the entire plan. It was that default risk that prompted Congress to require defined benefit plans (but not defined contribution plans) to satisfy complex minimum funding requirements, and to make premium payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for plan termination insurance. See Zelinsky, 114 Yale L. J., at 475-478.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">For defined contribution plans, however, fiduciary misconduct need not threaten the solvency of the entire plan to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>reduce benefits below the amount that participants would otherwise receive. Whether a fiduciary breach diminishes plan assets payable to all participants and beneficiaries, or only to persons tied to particular individual accounts, it creates the kind of harms that concerned the draftsmen of \u00a7409. Consequently, our references to the \u201centire plan\u201d in <em>Russell, </em>which accurately reflect the operation of \u00a7 409 in the defined benefit context, are beside the point in the defined contribution context.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Other sections of ERISA confirm that the \u201centire plan\u201d language from <em>Russell, </em>which appears nowhere in \u00a7409 or \u00a7 502(a)(2), does not apply to defined contribution plans. Most significant is \u00a7 404(c), which exempts fiduciaries from liability for losses caused by participants\u2019 exercise of control over assets in their individual accounts. See also 29 CFR \u00a72550.404c-l (2007). This provision would serve no real purpose if, as respondents argue, fiduciaries never had any liability for losses in an individual account.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We therefore hold that although \u00a7 502(a)(2) does not provide a remedy for individual injuries distinct from plan injuries, that provision does authorize recovery for fiduciary breaches that impair the value of plan assets in a participant\u2019s individual account. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Chief Justice Roberts,</judges>\n<p id=\"Arb\">with whom Justice Kennedy joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">In the decision below, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the loss to LaRue\u2019s individual plan account did not permit him to \u201cserve as a legitimate proxy for the plan in its entirety,\u201d thus barring him from relief under \u00a7 502(a)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(2). 450 F. 3d 570, 574 (2006). The Court today rejects that reasoning. See <em>ante, </em>at 252, 255-256. I agree with the Court that the Fourth Circuit\u2019s analysis was flawed, and join the Court\u2019s opinion to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The Court, however, goes on to conclude that \u00a7 502(a)(2) does authorize recovery in cases such as the present one. See <em>ante, </em>at 255-256. It is not at all clear that this is true. LaRue\u2019s right to direct the investment of his contributions was a right granted and governed by the plan. See <em>ante, </em>at 250-251. In this action, he seeks the benefits that would otherwise be due him if, as alleged, the plan carried out his investment instruction. LaRue\u2019s claim, therefore, is a claim for benefits that turns on the application and interpretation of the plan terms, specifically those governing investment options and how to exercise them.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">It is at least arguable that a claim of this nature properly lies only under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA. That provision allows a plan participant or beneficiary \u201cto recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). It is difficult to imagine a more accurate description of LaRue\u2019s claim. And in fact claimants have filed suit under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) alleging similar benefit denials in violation of plan terms. See, <em>e.g., Hess </em>v. <em>Reg-Ellen Machine Tool Corp., </em>423 F. 3d 653, 657 (CA7 2005) (allegation made under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) that a plan administrator wrong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>fully denied instruction to move retirement funds from employer\u2019s stock to a diversified investment account).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">If LaRue may bring his claim under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), it is not clear that he may do so under \u00a7 502(a)(2) as well. Section 502(a)(2) provides for \u201cappropriate\u201d relief. Construing the same term in a parallel ERISA provision, we have held that relief is not \u201cappropriate\u201d under \u00a7 502(a)(3) if another provision, such as \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), offers an adequate remedy. See <em>Varity Corp. </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>516 U. S. 489, 515 (1996). Applying the same rationale to an interpretation of \u201cappropriate\u201d in \u00a7 502(a)(2) would accord with our usual preference for construing the \u201csame terms [to] have the same meaning in different sections of the same statute,\u201d <em>Barnhill </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>503 U. S. 393, 406 (1992), and with the view that ERISA in particular is a \u201c\u2018comprehensive and reticulated statute\u2019\u201d with \u201ccarefully integrated civil enforcement provisions,\u201d <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>473 U. S. 134, 146 (1985) (quoting <em>Nachman Corp. </em>v. <em>Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, </em>446 U. S. 359, 361 (1980)). In a variety of contexts, some Courts of Appeals have accordingly prevented plaintiffs from recasting what are in essence plan-derived benefit claims that should be brought under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) as claims for fiduciary breaches under \u00a7 502(a)(2). See, <em>e. g., Coyne &amp; Delany Co. </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Va., Inc., </em>102 F. 3d 712, 714 (CA4 1996). Other Courts of Appeals have disagreed with this approach. See, <em>e. g., Graden </em>v. <em>Conexant Systems Inc., </em>496 F. 3d 291, 301 (CA3 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The significance of the distinction between a \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) claim and one under \u00a7 502(a)(2) is not merely a matter of picking the right provision to cite in the complaint. Allowing a \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) action to be recast as one under \u00a7 502(a)(2) might permit plaintiffs to circumvent safeguards for plan administrators that have developed under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B). Among these safeguards is the requirement, recognized by almost all the Courts of Appeals, see <em>Fallick </em>v. <em>Nationwide </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>Mut. Ins. Co., </em>162 F. 3d 410, 418, n. 4 (CA6 1998) (citing cases), that a participant exhaust the administrative remedies mandated by ERISA \u00a7 503, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 1133, before filing suit under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Equally significant, this Court has held that ERISA plans may grant administrators and fiduci\u00e1ries discretion in determining benefit eligibility and the meaning of plan terms, decisions that courts may review only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Bruch, </em>489 U. S. 101, 115 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">These safeguards encourage employers and others to undertake the voluntary step of providing medical and retirement benefits to plan participants, see <em>Aetna Health Inc. </em>v. <em>Davila, </em>542 U. S. 200, 215 (2004), and have no doubt engendered substantial reliance interests on the part of plans and fiduciaries. Allowing what is really a claim for benefits under a plan to be brought as a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under \u00a7 502(a)(2), rather than as a claim for benefits due \u201cunder the terms of the plan,\u201d \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), may result in circumventing such plan terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">I do not mean to suggest that these are settled questions. They are not. Nor are we in a position to answer them. LaRue did not rely on \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) as a source of relief, and the courts below had no occasion to address the argument, raised by an <em>amicus </em>in this Court, that the availability of relief under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) precludes LaRue\u2019s fiduciary breach claim. See Brief for ERISA Industry Committee as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>13-30. I simply highlight the fact that the Court\u2019s determination that the present claim may be brought under \u00a7 502(a)(2) is reached without considering whether the possible availability of relief under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) alters that conclusion. See, <em>e. g., United Parcel Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>451 U. S. 56, 60, n. 2 (1981) (noting general reluctance to consider arguments raised only by an <em>amicus </em>and not consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>ered by the courts below). In matters of statutory interpretation, where principles of <em>stare decisis </em>have their greatest effect, it is important that we not seem to decide more than we do. I see nothing in today\u2019s opinion precluding the lower courts on remand, if they determine that the argument is properly before them, from considering the contention that LaRue\u2019s claim may proceed only under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B). In any event, other courts in other cases remain free to consider what we have not \u2014 what effect the availability of relief under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) may have on a plan participant\u2019s ability to proceed under \u00a7 502(a)(2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\"> As its names imply, a \u201cdefined contribution plan\u201d or \u201cindividual account plan\u201d promises the participant the value of an individual account at retirement, which is largely a function of the amounts contributed to that account and the investment performance of those contributions. A \u201cdefined benefit plan,\u201d by contrast, generally promises the participant a fixed level of retirement income, which is typically based on the employee\u2019s years of service and compensation.

Under the common law of trusts, which informs our interpretation of ERISA\u2019s fiduciary duties, see <em>Varity, </em>516 U.

While his withdrawal of funds from the Plan may have relevance to the proceedings on remand, we denied their motion because the case is not moot. A plan \u201cparticipant,\u201d as defined by \u00a7 3(7) of ERISA, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 1002(7), may include a former employee with a color-able claim for benefits.

S. C. \u00a7 1132(a)(2), but it is ERISA\u2019s text and not \u201cthe kind of harms that concerned [ERISA\u2019s] draftsmen\u201d that compels my decision. <em>Ante, </em>at 256. In <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>473 U. S. 134 (1985), the Court held that \u00a7409 of ERISA, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 1109, read together with \u00a7 502(a)(2), authorizes recovery only by \u201cthe plan as an entity,\u201d 473 U. S., at 140, and does not permit individuals to bring suit when they do not seek relief on behalf of the plan, <em>id., </em>at 139-144. The majority accepts <em>Russell\u2019s </em>fundamental holding, but reins in the Court\u2019s further suggestion in <em>Russell </em>that suits under \u00a7 502(a)(2) are meant to \u201cprotect the entire plan,\u201d rather than \u201cthe rights of an individual beneficiary.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 253-254 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>Russell, supra, </em>at 142. The majority states that emphasizing the \u201centire plan\u201d was a sensible application of \u00a7\u00a7409 and 502(a)(2) in the historical context of defined benefit plans, but that the subsequent proliferation of defined contribution plans has rendered <em>Russell\u2019s </em>dictum inapplicable to most modern cases. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>Ante, </em>at 255-256. In concluding that a loss suffered by a participant\u2019s defined contribution plan account because of a fiduciary breach \u201ccreates the kind of harms that concerned the draftsmen of \u00a7409,\u201d the majority holds that \u00a7 502(a)(2) authorizes recovery for plan participants such as petitioner. <em>Ante, </em>at 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Although I agree with the majority\u2019s holding, I write separately because my reading of \u00a7\u00a7409 and 502(a)(2) is not contingent on trends in the pension plan market. Nor does it depend on the ostensible \u201cconcerns\u201d of ERISA\u2019s drafters. Rather, my conclusion that petitioner has stated a cognizable claim flows from the unambiguous text of \u00a7\u00a7409 and 502(a)(2) as applied to defined contribution plans. Section 502(a)(2) states that \u201c[a] civil action may be brought\u201d by a plan \u201cparticipant, beneficiary or fiduciary,\u201d or by the Secretary of Labor, to obtain \u201cappropriate relief\u201d under \u00a7409. 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 1132(a)(2). Section 409(a) provides that \u201c[a]ny person who is a fiduciary with respect to a <em>plan </em>. . . shall be personally liable to make good to such <em>plan </em>any losses to the <em>plan </em>resulting from each [fiduciary] breach, and to restore to such <em>plan </em>any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through use of assets of the <em>plan </em>by the fiduciary ....\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 1109(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The plain text of \u00a7 409(a), which uses the term \u201cplan\u201d five times, leaves no doubt that \u00a7 502(a)(2) authorizes recovery only for the plan. Likewise, Congress\u2019 repeated use of the word \u201cany\u201d in \u00a7 409(a) clarifies that the key factor is whether the alleged losses can be said to be losses \u201cto the plan,\u201d not whether they are otherwise of a particular nature or kind. See, <em>e. g., Ali </em>v. <em>Federal Bureau of Prisons, ante, </em>at 219 (noting that the natural reading of \u201cany\u201d is \u201cone or some indiscriminately of whatever kind\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). On their face, \u00a7\u00a7 409(a) and 502(a)(2) permit recovery of <em>all </em>plan losses caused by a fiduciary breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>The question presented here, then, is whether the losses to petitioner\u2019s individual 401(k) account resulting from respondents\u2019 alleged breach of their fiduciary duties were losses \u201cto the plan.\u201d In my view they were, because the assets allocated to petitioner\u2019s individual account were plan assets. ERISA requires the assets of a defined contribution plan (including \u201cgains and losses\u201d and legal recoveries) to be allocated for bookkeeping purposes to individual accounts within the plan for the beneficial interest of the participants, whose benefits in turn depend on the allocated amounts. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 1002(34) (defining a \u201cdefined contribution plan\u201d as a \u201cplan which provides for an individual account for each participant and for benefits based solely upon the amount contributed to the participant\u2019s account, and any income, expenses, gains and losses, and any forfeitures of accounts of other participants which may be allocated to such participant\u2019s account\u201d). Thus, when a defined contribution plan sustains losses, those losses are reflected in the balances in the plan accounts of the affected participants, and a recovery of those losses would be allocated to one or more individual accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The allocation of a plan\u2019s assets to individual accounts for bookkeeping purposes does not change the fact that all the assets in the plan remain plan assets. A defined contribution plan is not merely a collection of unrelated accounts. Rather, ERISA requires a plan\u2019s combined assets to be held in trust and legally owned by the plan trustees. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 1103(a) (providing that \u201call assets of an employee benefit plan shall be held in trust by one or more trustees\u201d). In short, the assets of a defined contribution plan under ERISA constitute, at the very least, the sum of all the assets allocated for bookkeeping purposes to the participants\u2019 individual accounts. Because a defined contribution plan is essentially the sum of its parts, losses attributable to the account of an individual participant are necessarily \u201closses to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the plan\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 409(a). Accordingly, when a participant sustains losses to his individual account as a result of a fiduciary breach, the plan\u2019s aggregate assets are likewise diminished by the same amount, and \u00a7 502(a)(2) permits that participant to recover such losses on behalf of the plan.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Of course, a participant suing to recover benefits on behalf of the plan is not entitled to monetary relief payable directly to him; rather, any recovery must be paid to the plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
