S. C. \u00a7 1 <em>et seq., </em>provides for expedited judicial review to confirm, vacate, or modify arbitration awards. \u00a7\u00a7 9-11 (2006 ed.).<footnotemark>\u2020\u2020</footnotemark> The question here is whether statutory grounds for prompt vacatur and modification may be supplemented by contract. We hold that the statutory grounds are exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"A4k\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">This case began as a lease dispute between landlord, petitioner Hall Street Associates, L. L. C., and tenant, respondent Mattel, Inc. The property was used for many years as a manufacturing site, and the leases provided that the tenant would indemnify the landlord for any costs resulting from the failure of the tenant or its predecessor lessees to follow environmental laws while using the premises. App. 88-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Tests of the property\u2019s well water in 1998 showed high levels of trichloroethylene (TCE), the apparent residue of manufacturing discharges by Mattel\u2019s predecessors between 1951 and 1980. After the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) discovered even more pollutants, Mattel stopped drawing from the well and, along with one of its predecessors, signed a consent order with the DEQ providing for cleanup of the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">After Mattel gave notice of intent to terminate the lease in 2001, Hall Street filed this suit, contesting Mattel\u2019s right to vacate on the date it gave, and claiming that the lease obliged Mattel to indemnify Hall Street for costs of cleaning up the TCE, among other things. Following a bench trial before the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, Mattel won on the termination issue, and after an unsuccessful try at mediating the indemnification claim, the parties proposed to submit to arbitration. The District Court was amenable, and the parties drew up an arbitration agreement, which the court approved and entered as an order. One paragraph of the agreement provided that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Arbitration took place, and the arbitrator decided for Mattel. In particular, he held that no indemnification was due, because the lease obligation to follow all applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws did not require compliance with the testing requirements of the Oregon Drinking Water Quality Act (Oregon Act); that Act the arbitrator characterized as dealing with human health as distinct from environmental contamination.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>\u201c[t]he United States District Court for the District of Oregon may enter judgment upon any award, either by confirming the award or by vacating, modifying or correcting the award. The Court shall vacate, modify or correct any award: (i) where the arbitrator\u2019s findings of facts are not supported by substantial evidence, or (ii) where the arbitrator\u2019s conclusions of law are erroneous.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Hall Street then filed a District Court Motion for Order Vacating, Modifying And/Or Correcting Arbitration Accord, App. 4, on the ground that failing to treat the Oregon Act as an applicable environmental law under the terms of the lease was legal error. The District Court agreed, vacated the award, and remanded for further consideration by the arbitrator. The court expressly invoked the standard of review chosen by the parties in the arbitration agreement, which included review for legal error, and cited <em>LaPine Technology Corp. </em>v. <em>Kyocera Corp., </em>130 F. 3d 884, 889 (CA9 1997), for the proposition that the FAA leaves the parties \u201cfree ... to draft a contract that sets rules for arbitration and dictates an alternative standard of review.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">On remand, the arbitrator followed the District Court\u2019s ruling that the Oregon Act was an applicable environmental law and amended the decision to favor Hall Street. This time, each party sought modification, and again the District Court applied the parties\u2019 stipulated standard of review for legal error, correcting the arbitrator\u2019s calculation of interest but otherwise upholding the award. Each party then appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where Mattel switched horses and contended that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s recent en banc action overruling <em>LaPine </em>in <em>Kyocera Corp. </em>v. <em>Prudential-Bache Trade Servs., Inc., </em>341 F. 3d 987, 1000 (2003), left the arbitration agreement\u2019s provision for judicial review of legal error unenforceable. Hall Street countered that <em>Kyocera </em>(the later one) was distinguishable, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>that the agreement\u2019s judicial review provision was not sever-able from the submission to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The Ninth Circuit reversed in favor of Mattel in holding that, \u201c[u]nder <em>Kyocera </em>the terms of the arbitration agreement controlling the mode of judicial review are unenforceable and severable.\u201d 113 Fed. Appx. 272, 272-273 (2004). The Circuit instructed the District Court on remand to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-6\">\u201creturn to the application to confirm the original arbitration award (not the subsequent award revised after reversal), and ... confirm that award, unless ... the award should be vacated on the grounds allowable under 9 U. S. C. \u00a7 10, or modified or corrected under the grounds allowable under 9 U. S. C. \u00a7 11.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 273.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">After the District Court again held for Hall Street and the Ninth Circuit again reversed,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we granted certiorari to decide whether the grounds for vacatur and modification provided by \u00a7\u00a710 and 11 of the FA A are exclusive. 550 U. S. 968 (2007). We agree with the Ninth Circuit that they are, but vacate and remand for consideration of independent issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Congress enacted the FAA to replace judicial indisposition to arbitration with a \u201cnational policy favoring [it] and placing] arbitration agreements on equal footing with all other contracts.\u201d <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cardegna, </em>546 U. S. 440, 443 (2006). As for jurisdiction over controversies touching arbitration, the Act does nothing, being \u201csomething of an anomaly in the field of federal-court jurisdiction\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>in bestowing no federal jurisdiction but rather requiring an independent jurisdictional basis. <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U. S. 1, 25, n. 32 (1983); see, <em>e. g., </em>9 U. S. C. \u00a7 4 (providing for action by a federal district court \u201cwhich, save for such [arbitration] agreement, would have jurisdiction under title 28\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But in cases falling within a court\u2019s jurisdiction, the Act makes contracts to arbitrate \u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable,\u201d so long as their subject involves \u201ccommerce.\u201d \u00a72. And this is so whether an agreement has a broad reach or goes just to one dispute, and whether enforcement be sought in state court or federal. See <em>ibid.; Southland Corp. </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>465 U. S. 1, 15-16 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The Act also supplies mechanisms for enforcing arbitration awards: a judicial decree confirming an award, an order vacating it, or an order modifying or correcting it. \u00a7\u00a7 9-11. An application for any of these orders will get streamlined treatment as a motion, obviating the separate contract action that would usually be necessary to enforce or tinker with an arbitral award in court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u00a7 6. Under the terms of \u00a79, a court \u201cmust\u201d confirm an arbitration award \u201cunless\u201d it is vacated, modified, or corrected \u201cas prescribed\u201d in \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11. Section 10 lists grounds for vacating an award, while \u00a7 11 names those for modifying or correcting one.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The Courts of Appeals have split over the exclusiveness of these statutory grounds when parties take the FAA shortcut to confirm, vacate, or modify an award, with some saying the recitations are exclusive, and others regarding them as mere threshold provisions open to expansion by agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-5\">\u201c(1) where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-6\">\u201c(2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-7\">\u201c(3) where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-8\">\u201c(4) where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>As mentioned already, when this litigation started, the Ninth Circuit was on the threshold side of the split, see <em>LaPine, </em>130 F. 3d, at 889, from which it later departed en banc in favor of the exclusivity view, see <em>Kyocera, </em>341 F. 3d, at 1000, which it followed in this case, see 113 Fed. Appx., at 273. We now hold that \u00a7\u00a710 and 11 respectively provide the FAA\u2019s exclusive grounds for expedited vacatur and modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Hall Street makes two main efforts to show that the grounds set out for vacating or modifying an award are not exclusive, taking the position, first, that expandable judicial review authority has been accepted as the law since <em>Wilko </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>346 U. S. 427 (1953). This, however, was not what <em>Wilko </em>decided, which was that \u00a7 14 of the Securities Act of 1933 voided any agreement to arbitrate claims of violations of that Act, see <em>id., </em>at 437-438, a holding since overruled by <em>Rodriguez de Quijas </em>v. <em>Shearson/American Express, Inc., </em>490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989). Although it is true that the Court\u2019s discussion includes some language arguably favoring Hall Street\u2019s position, arguable is as far as it goes.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The <em>Wilko </em>Court was explaining that arbitration would undercut the Securities Act\u2019s buyer protections when it remarked (citing FA A \u00a7 10) that \u201c[p]ower to vacate an [arbitration] award is limited,\u201d 346 U. S., at 436, and went on to say that \u201cthe interpretations of the law by the arbitrators in contrast to manifest disregard [of the law] are not subject, in the federal courts, to judicial review for error in interpretation,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 436-437. Hall Street reads this statement as recognizing \u201cmanifest disregard of the law\u201d as a further ground for vacatur on top of those listed in \u00a7 10, and some Circuits have read it the same way. See, <em>e. g., McCarthy </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number><em>Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., </em>463 F. 3d 87, 91 (CA1 2006); <em>Hoeft </em>v. <em>MVL Group, Inc., </em>343 F. 3d 57, 64 (CA2 2003); <em>Prestige Ford </em>v. <em>Ford Dealer Computer Servs., Inc., </em>324 F. 3d 391, 395-396 (CA5 2003); <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Prudential Securities, Inc., </em>141 F. 3d 1007, 1017 (CA11 1998). Hall Street sees this supposed addition to \u00a7 10 as the camel\u2019s nose: if judges can add grounds to vacate (or modify), so can contracting parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">But this is too much for <em>Wilko </em>to bear. Quite apart from its leap from a supposed judicial expansion by interpretation to a private expansion by contract, Hall Street overlooks the fact that the statement it relies on expressly rejects just what Hall Street asks for here, general review for an arbitrator\u2019s legal errors. Then there is the vagueness of Wilko\u2019s phrasing. Maybe the term \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d was meant to name a new ground for review, but maybe it merely referred to the \u00a710 grounds collectively, rather than adding</p>\n<p id=\"A6e\">to them. See, <em>e.g., Mitsubishi Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>473 U. S. 614, 656 (1985) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\u201cArbitration awards are only reviewable for manifest disregard of the law, 9 U. Si C. \u00a7\u00a7 10, 207\u201d); <em>I/S Stavborg </em>v. <em>National Metal Converters, Inc., </em>500 F. 2d 424, 431 (CA2 1974). Or, as some courts have thought, \u201cmani-</p>\n<p id=\"AXh\">fest disregard\u201d may have been shorthand for \u00a7 10(a)(3) or \u00a7 10(a)(4), the paragraphs authorizing vacatur when the arbitrators were \u201cguilty of misconduct\u201d or \u201cexceeded their powers.\u201d See, <em>e. g., Kyocera, supra, </em>at 997. We, when speaking as a Court, have merely taken the <em>Wilko </em>language as we found it, without embellishment, see <em>First Options of Chicago, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>514 U. S. 938, 942 (1995), and now that its meaning is implicated, we see no reason to accord it the significance that Hall Street urges.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Second, Hall Street says that the agreement to review for legal error ought to prevail simply because arbitration is a creature of contract, and the FAA is \u201cmotivated, first and foremost, by a congressional desire to enforce agreements into which parties ha[ve] entered.\u201d <em>Dean Witter Reynolds </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number><em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Byrd, </em>470 U. S. 213, 220 (1985). But, again, we think the argument comes up short. Hall Street is certainly right that the FAA lets parties tailor some, even many, features of arbitration by contract, including the way arbitrators are chosen, what their qualifications should be, which issues are arbitrable, along with procedure and choice of substantive law. But to rest this case on the general policy of treating arbitration agreements as enforceable as such would be to beg the question, which is whether the FAA has textual features at odds with enforcing a contract to expand judicial review following the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">To that particular question we think the answer is yes, that the text compels a reading of the \u00a7\u00a710 and 11 categories as exclusive. To begin with, even if we assumed \u00a7\u00a710 and 11 could be supplemented to some extent, it would stretch basic interpretive principles to expand the stated grounds to the point of evidentiary and legal review generally. Sections 10 and 11, after all, address egregious departures from the parties\u2019 agreed-upon arbitration: \u201ccorruption,\u201d \u201cfraud,\u201d \u201cevident partiality,\u201d \u201cmisconduct,\u201d \u201cmisbehavior,\u201d \u201cexceed[ing]... powers,\u201d \u201cevident material miscalculation,\u201d \u201cevident material mistake,\u201d \u201caward[s] upon a matter not submitted\u201d; the only ground with any softer focus is \u201cimperfections],\u201d and a court may correct those only if they go to \u201c[a] matter of form not affecting the merits.\u201d Given this emphasis on extreme arbitral conduct, the old rule of <em>ejusdem generis </em>has an implicit lesson to teach here. Under that rule, when a statute sets out a series of specific items ending with a general term, that general term is confined to covering subjects comparable to the specifics it follows. Since a general term included in the text is normally so limited, then surely a statute with no textual hook for expansion cannot authorize contracting parties to supplement review for specific instances of outrageous conduct with review for just any legal error. \u201cFraud\u201d and a mistake of law are not cut from the same cloth.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>That aside, expanding the detailed categories would rub too much against the grain of the \u00a7 9 language, where provision for judicial confirmation carries no hint of flexibility. On application for an order confirming the arbitration award, the court \u201cmust grant\u201d the order \u201cunless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in sections 10 and 11 of this title.\u201d There is nothing malleable about \u201cmust grant,\u201d which unequivocally tells courts to grant confirmation in all cases, except when one of the \u201cprescribed\u201d exceptions applies. This does not sound remotely like a provision meant to tell a court what to do just in case the parties say nothing else.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">In fact, anyone who thinks Congress might have understood \u00a7 9 as a default provision should turn back to \u00a7 5 for an example of what Congress thought a default provision would look like:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>\u201c[i]f in the agreement provision be made for a method of naming or appointing an arbitrator . . . such method shall be followed; but if no method be provided therein, or if a method be provided and any party thereto shall fail to avail himself of such method, . . . then upon the application of either party to the controversy the court shall designate and appoint an arbitrator . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">\u201c[I]f no method be provided\u201d is a far cry from \u201cmust grant... unless\u201d in \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Instead of fighting the text, it makes more sense to see the three provisions, \u00a7\u00a79-11, as substantiating a national policy favoring arbitration with just the limited review needed to maintain arbitration\u2019s essential virtue of resolving disputes straightaway. Any other reading opens the door to the full-bore legal and evidentiary appeals that can \u201crende[r] informal arbitration merely a prelude to a more cumbersome and time-consuming judicial review process,\u201d <em>Kyocera, </em>341 F. 3d, at 998; cf. <em>Ethyl Cory. </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers of America, </em>768 F. 2d 180,184 (CA7 1985), and bring arbitration theory to grief in postarbitration process.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Nor is <em>Dean Witter, </em>470 U. S. 213, to the contrary, as Hall Street claims it to be. <em>Dean Witter </em>held that state-law claims subject to an agreement to arbitrate could not be remitted to a district court considering a related, nonarbitrable federal claim; the state-law claims were to go to arbitration immediately. <em>Id., </em>at 217. Despite the opinion\u2019s language \u201creject[ing] the suggestion that the overriding goal of the [FAA] was to promote the expeditious resolution of claims,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 219, the holding mandated immediate enforcement of an arbitration agreement; the Court was merely trying to explain that the inefficiency and difficulty of conducting simultaneous arbitration and federal-court litigation was not a good enough reason to defer the arbitration, see <em>id., </em>at 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">When all these arguments based on prior legal authority are done with, Hall Street and Mattel remain at odds over what happens next. Hall Street and its <em>amici </em>say parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>will flee from arbitration if expanded review is not open to them. See, <em>e. g., </em>Brief for Petitioner 39; Brief for New England Legal Foundation et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>15. One of Mattel\u2019s <em>amici </em>foresees flight from the courts if it is. See Brief for United States Council for International Business as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>29-30. We do not know who, if anyone, is right, and so cannot say whether the exclusivity reading of the statute is more of a threat to the popularity of arbitrators or to that of courts. But whatever the consequences of our holding, the statutory text gives us no business to expand the statutory grounds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">In holding that \u00a7\u00a710 and 11 provide exclusive regimes for the review provided by the statute, we do not purport to say that they exclude more searching review based on authority outside the statute as well. The FAA is not the only way into court for parties wanting review of arbitration awards: they may contemplate enforcement under state statutory or common law, for example, where judicial review of different scope is arguable. But here we speak only to the scope of the expeditious judicial review under \u00a7\u00a7 9, 10, and 11, deciding nothing about other possible avenues for judicial enforcement of arbitration awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Although one such avenue is now claimed to be revealed in the procedural history of this case, no claim to it was presented when the case arrived on our doorstep, and no reason then appeared to us for treating this as anything but an FAA case. There was never any question about meeting the FAA \u00a7 2 requirement that the leases from which the dispute arose be contracts \u201cinvolving commerce.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a7 2; see <em>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. </em>v. <em>Dobson, </em>513 U. S. 265, 277 (1995) (\u00a7 2 \u201cexercisefsf Congress\u2019 commerce power to the full\u201d). Nor is there any doubt now that the parties at least had the FAA in mind at the outset; the arbitration agreement even incorporates FAA \u00a7 7, empowering arbitrators to compel attendance of witnesses. App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">While it is true that the agreement does not expressly invoke FAA \u00a7 9, \u00a7 10, or \u00a7 11, and none of the various motions to vacate or modify the award expressly said that the parties were relying on the FAA, the District Court apparently thought it was applying the FAA when it alluded to the Act in quoting <em>LaPine, </em>130 F. 3d, at 889, for the then-unexceptional proposition that \u201c \u2018[ffederal courts can expand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>their review of an arbitration award beyond the FAA\u2019s grounds, when . . . the parties have so agreed.\u2019\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a. And the Ninth Circuit, for its part, seemed to take it as a given that the District Court\u2019s direct and prompt examination of the award depended on the FAA; it found the expanded-review provision unenforceable under <em>Kyocera </em>and remanded for confirmation of the original award \u201cunless the district court determines that the award should be vacated on the grounds allowable under 9 U. S. C. \u00a7 10, or modified or corrected under the grounds allowable under 9 U. S. C. \u00a7 11.\u201d 113 Fed. Appx., at 273. In the petition for certiorari and the principal briefing before us, the parties acted on the same premise. See, <em>e. g., </em>Pet. for Cert. 27 (\u201cThis Court should accept review to resolve this important issue of statutory construction under the FAA\u201d); Brief for Petitioner 16 (\u201cBecause arbitration provisions providing for judicial review of arbitration awards for legal error are consistent with the goals and policies of the FAA and employ a standard of review which district courts regularly apply in a variety of contexts, those provisions are entitled to enforcement under the FAA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">One unusual feature, however, prompted some of us to question whether the case should be approached another way. The arbitration agreement was entered into in the course of district-court litigation, was submitted to the District Court as a request to deviate from the standard sequence of trial procedure, and was adopted by the District Court as an order.

See, <em>e. g., </em>Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-12.

We express no opinion on these matters beyond leaving them open for Hall Street to press on remand. If the Court of Appeals finds they are open, the court may consider whether the District Court\u2019s authority to manage litigation independently warranted that court\u2019s order on the mode of resolving the indemnification issues remaining in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Although we agree with the Ninth Circuit that the FAA confines its expedited judicial review to the grounds listed in 9 U.

It is a peculiar argument, converting agreement as a necessary condition for judicial enforcement into a sufficient condition for a court to bar enforcement. And the text is otherwise problematical for Hall Street: \u00a7 9 says that if the parties have agreed to judicial enforcement, the court \u201cmust grant\u201d confirmation unless grounds for vacatur or modification exist under \u00a7 10 or \u00a7 11. The sentence nowhere predicates the court\u2019s judicial action on the parties\u2019 having agreed to specific standards; if anything, it suggests that, so long as the parties contemplated judicial enforcement, the court must undertake such enforcement under the statutory criteria. In any case, the arbitration agreement here did not specifically predicate entry of judgment on adherence to its judicial review standard. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 15a. To the extent Hall Street argues otherwise, it contests not the meaning of the PAA but the Ninth Circuit\u2019s severability analysis, upon which it did not seek certiorari.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b847-5\"> The history of the FAA is consistent with our conclusion. The text of the FAA was based upon that of New York\u2019s arbitration statute. See S. Rep. No. 536, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1924) (\u201cThe bill. . . follows the lines of the New York arbitration law enacted in 1920 . . . \u201d). The New York Arbitration Law incorporated pre-existing provisions of the New York Code of Civil Procedure. See 1920 N. Y. Laws p. 806. Section 2373 of the code said that, upon application by a party for a confirmation order, \u201cthe court must grant such an order, unless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected, as prescribed by the next two sections.\u201d 2 N. Y. Ann. Code Civ. Proe. (Stover 6th ed. 1902) (hereinafter Stover). The subsequent sections gave grounds for vacatur and modification or correction virtually identical to the 9 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11 grounds. See 2 Stover \u00a7\u00a7 2374, 2375.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">In a brief submitted to the House and Senate Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary, Julius Henry Cohen, one of the primary drafters of both the 1920 New York Act and the proposed FAA, said, \u201cThe grounds for vacating, modifying, or correcting an award are limited. If the award [meets a condition of \u00a7 10], then and then only the award may be vacated. ... If there was [an error under \u00a7 11], then and then only it may be modified or corrected____\u201d Arbitration of Interstate Commercial Disputes, Joint Hearings before the Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary on S. 1005 and H. R. 646, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 34 (1924).

R. Rep. No. 96, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">In a contemporaneous campaign for the promulgation of a uniform state arbitration law, Cohen contrasted the New York Act with the Illinois Arbitration and Awards Act of 1917, which required an arbitrator, at the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>quest of either party, to submit any question of law arising during arbitration to judicial determination.

Prior to Congress\u2019 enactment of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act) in 1925, the answer to that question would surely have been \u201cYes.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Today, however, the Court holds that the FAA does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>merely authorize the vacation or enforcement of awards on specified grounds, but also forbids enforcement of perfectly reasonable judicial review provisions in arbitration agreements fairly negotiated by the parties and approved by the district court. Because this result conflicts with the primary purpose of the FAA and ignores the historical context in which the Act was passed, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Prior to the passage of the FAA, American courts were generally hostile to arbitration. They refused, with rare exceptions, to order specific enforcement of executory agreements to arbitrate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 2 of the FAA responded to this hostility by making written arbitration agreements \u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a7 2. This section, which is the centerpiece of the FAA, reflects Congress\u2019 main goal in passing the legislation: \u201cto abrogate the general common-law rule against specific enforcement of arbitration agreements,\u201d <em>Southland Corp. </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>465 U. S. 1, 18 (1984) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), and to \u201censurfe] that private arbitration agreements are enforced according to their terms,\u201d <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., </em>489 U. S. 468, 478 (1989). Given this settled understanding of the core purpose of the FAA, the interests favoring enforceability of parties\u2019 arbitration agreements are stronger today than before the FAA was enacted. As such, there is more \u2014 and certainly not less \u2014 reason to give effect to parties\u2019 fairly negotiated decisions to provide for judicial review of arbitration awards for errors of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Petitioner filed this rather complex action in an Oregon state court. Based on the diverse citizenship of the parties, respondent removed the case to federal court. More than three years later, and after some issues had been resolved, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>the parties sought and obtained the District Court\u2019s approval of their agreement to arbitrate the remaining issues subject to <em>de novo </em>judicial review. They neither requested, nor suggested that the FAA authorized, any \u201cexpedited\u201d disposition of their case. Because the arbitrator made a rather glaring error of law, the judge refused to affirm his award until after that error was corrected. The Ninth Circuit reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">This Court now agrees with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s (most recent) interpretation of the FAA as setting forth the exclusive grounds for modification or vacation of an arbitration award under the statute. As I read the Court\u2019s opinion, it identifies two possible reasons for reaching this result: (1) a supposed <em>quid pro quo </em>bargain between Congress and litigants that conditions expedited federal enforcement of arbitration awards on acceptance of a statutory limit on the scope of judicial review of such awards; and (2) an assumption that Congress intended to include the words \u201cand no other\u201d in the grounds specified in \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11 for the vacatur and modification of awards. Neither reason is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">While \u00a7 9 of the FAA imposes a 1-year limit on the time in which any party to an arbitration may apply for confirmation of an award, the statute does not require that the application be given expedited treatment. Of course, the premise of the entire statute is an assumption that the arbitration process may be more expeditious and less costly than ordinary litigation, but that is a reason for interpreting the statute liberally to favor the parties\u2019 use of arbitration. An unnecessary refusal to enforce a perfectly reasonable category of arbitration agreements defeats the primary purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">That purpose also provides a sufficient response to the Court\u2019s reliance on statutory text. It is true that a wooden application of \u201cthe old rule of <em>ejusdem generis,\u201d ante, </em>at 586, might support an inference that the categories listed in \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11 are exclusive, but the literal text does not compel that reading \u2014 a reading that is flatly inconsistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>overriding interest in effectuating the clearly expressed intent of the contracting parties. A listing of grounds that must always be available to contracting parties simply does not speak to the question whether they may agree to additional grounds for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Moreover, in light of the historical context and the broader purpose of the FAA, \u00a7\u00a710 and 11 are best understood as a shield meant to protect parties from hostile courts, not a sword with which to cut down parties\u2019 \u201cvalid, irrevocable and enforceable\u201d agreements to arbitrate their disputes subject to judicial review for errors of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Even if I thought the narrow issue presented in this case were as debatable as the conflict among the courts of appeals suggests, I would rely on a presumption of overriding importance to resolve the debate and rule in favor of petitioner\u2019s position that the FAA permits the statutory grounds for vacatur and modification of an award to be supplemented by contract. A decision <em>\u201cnot to regulate\u201d </em>the terms of an agreement that does not even arguably offend any public policy whatsoever \u201cis adequately justified by a presumption in favor of freedom.\u201d <em>FCC </em>v. <em>Beach Communications, Inc., </em>508 U. S. 307, 320 (1993) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Accordingly, while I agree that the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be set aside, and that there may be additional avenues available for judicial enforcement of parties\u2019 fairly negotiated review provisions, see, <em>ante, </em>at 590-592, I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>FAA, and would direct the Court of Appeals to affirm the judgment of the District Court enforcing the arbitrator\u2019s final award.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-9\"> See <em>Kleine </em>v. <em>Catara, </em>14 F.

Although agreements to arbitrate were not specifically enforceable, courts did award nominal damages for the breach of such contracts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b853-8\"> In the years before the passage of the FAA, arbitration awards were subject to thorough and broad judicial review. See Cohen &amp; Dayton, The New Federal Arbitration Law, 12 Va. L. Rev. 265, 270-271 (1926); Cullinan, Contracting for an Expanded Scope of Judicial Review in Arbitration Agreements, 51 Vand. L. Rev. 395, 409 (1998). In \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11 of the FAA, Congress significantly limited the grounds for judicial vacatur or modification of such awards in order to protect arbitration awards from hostile and meddlesome courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b854-4\">Justice Breyer,</author>\n<p id=\"AMV\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The question presented in this case is whether \u201cthe Federal Arbitration Act . . . <em>precludes </em>a federal court from enforcing\u201d an arbitration agreement that gives the court the power to set aside an arbitration award that embodies an arbitrator\u2019s mistake about the law. Pet. for Cert. i. Like the majority and Justice Stevens, and primarily for the reasons they set forth, I believe that the Act does not <em>preclude </em>enforcement of such an agreement. See ante, at 590 (opinion of the Court) (The Act \u201cis not the only way into court for parties wanting review of arbitration awards\u201d); <em>ante, </em>at 595 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (The Act is a \u201cshield meant to protect parties from hostile courts, not a sword with which to cut down parties\u2019 'valid, irrevocable and enforceable\u2019 agreements to arbitrate their disputes subject to judicial review for errors of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">. At the same time, I see no need to send the case back for further judicial decisionmaking. The agreement here was entered into with the consent of the parties and the approval of the District Court. Aside from the Federal Arbitration Act itself, 9 U. S. C. \u00a7 1 <em>et seq., </em>respondent below pointed to no statute, rule, or other relevant public policy that the agreement might violate. The Court has now rejected its argument that the agreement violates the Act, and I would simply remand the case with instructions that the Court of Appeals affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment enforcing the arbitrator\u2019s final award.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
