S. C. \u00a7 2680, which carves out certain exceptions to the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign immunity for torts committed by federal employees. Section 2680(c) provides that the waiver of sovereign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>immunity does not apply to claims arising from the detention of property by \u201cany officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.\u201d Petitioner contends that this clause applies only to law enforcement officers enforcing customs or excise laws, and thus does not affect the waiver of sovereign immunity for his property claim against officers of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). We conclude that the broad phrase \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d covers all law enforcement officers. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals upholding the dismissal of petitioner\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Petitioner Abdus-Shahid M. S. Ali was a federal prisoner at the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia, from 2001 to 2003. In December 2003, petitioner was scheduled to be transferred to the United States Penitentiary Big Sandy (USP Big Sandy) in Inez, Kentucky. Before being transferred, he left two duffle bags containing his personal property in the Atlanta prison\u2019s Receiving and Discharge Unit to be inventoried, packaged, and shipped to USP Big Sandy. Petitioner was transferred, and his bags arrived some days later. Upon inspecting his property, he noticed that several items were missing. The staff at USP Big Sandy\u2019s Receiving and Discharge Unit told him that he had been given everything that was sent, and that if things were missing he could file a claim. Many of the purportedly missing items were of religious and nostalgic significance, including two copies of the Qur\u2019an, a prayer rug, and religious magazines. Petitioner estimated that the items were worth $177.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Petitioner filed an administrative tort claim. In denying relief, the agency noted that, by his signature on the receipt form, petitioner had certified the accuracy of the inventory listed thereon and had thereby relinquished any future claims relating to missing or damaged property. Petitioner then filed a complaint alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>violations of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 2671 <em>et seq. </em>The BOP maintained that petitioner\u2019s claim was barred by the exception in \u00a7 2680(c) for property claims against law enforcement officers. The District Court agreed and dismissed petitioner\u2019s FTCA claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Petitioner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the District Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 2680(c). 204 Fed. Appx. 778, 779-780 (2006) <em>(per curiam). </em>In rejecting petitioner\u2019s arguments, the Court of Appeals relied on this Court\u2019s broad interpretation of \u00a72680(c)\u2019s \u201cdetention\u201d clause in <em>Kosak </em>v. <em>United States, </em>465 U. S. 848, 854-859 (1984), on decisions by other Courts of Appeals, and on its own decision in <em>Schlaebitz </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of Justice, </em>924 F. 2d 193, 195 (1991) <em>(per curiam) </em>(holding that United States Marshals, who were allegedly negligent in releasing a parolee\u2019s luggage to a third party, were \u201claw enforcement officers\u201d under \u00a7 2680(c)). See 204 Fed. Appx., at 779-780.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">We granted certiorari, 550 U. S. 968 (2007), to resolve the disagreement among the Courts of Appeals as to the scope of \u00a7 2680(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">In the FTCA, Congress waived the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity for claims arising out of torts committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>by federal employees. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1). As relevant here, the FTCA authorizes \u201cclaims against the United States, for money damages ... for injury or loss of property . . . caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The FTCA exempts from this waiver certain categories of claims. See \u00a7\u00a7 2680(a)-(n). Relevant here is the exception in subsection (c), which provides that \u00a7 1346(b) shall not apply to \u201c[a]ny claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods, merchandise, or other property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.\u201d \u00a7 2680(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">This case turns on whether the BOP officers who allegedly lost petitioner\u2019s property qualify as \u201cother law enforcement officer[s]\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2680(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioner argues that they do not because \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d includes only law enforcement officers acting in a customs or excise capacity. Noting that Congress referenced customs and excise activities in both the language at issue and the preceding clause in \u00a7 2680(c), petitioner argues that the entire subsection is focused on preserving the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity only as to officers enforcing those laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Petitioner's argument is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s language.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The phrase <em>\u201cany </em>other law enforcement officer\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>suggests a broad meaning. <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). We have previously noted that \u201c[r]ead naturally, the word \u2018any\u2019 has an expansive meaning, that is, \u2018one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.\u2019\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>520 U. S. 1, 5 (1997) (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 97 (1976)). In <em>Gonzales, </em>we considered a provision that imposed an additional sentence for firearms used in federal drug trafficking crimes and provided that such additional sentence shall not be concurrent with \u201c \u2018any other term of imprisonment.\u2019\u201d 520 U. S., at 4 (quoting 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (1994 ed.); emphasis deleted). Notwithstanding the subsection\u2019s initial reference to federal drug trafficking crimes, we held that the expansive word \u201cany\u201d and the absence of restrictive language left \u201cno basis in the text for limiting\u201d the phrase \u201cany other term of imprisonment\u201d to federal sentences. 520 U. S., at 5. Similarly, in <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>PPG Industries, Inc., </em>446 U. S. 578 (1980), the Court considered the phrase \u201cany other final action\u201d in amendments to the Clean Air Act. The Court explained that the amendments expanded a list of Environmental Protection Agency Administrator actions by adding two categories of actions: actions under a specifically enumerated statutory provision, and \u201cany other final action\u201d under the Clean Air Act. <em>Id., </em>at 584 (emphasis deleted). Focusing on Congress\u2019 choice of the word \u201cany,\u201d the Court \u201cdiscern[ed] no uncertainty in the meaning of the phrase, \u2018any other final action,\u2019 \u201d and emphasized that the statute\u2019s \u201cexpansive language offer[ed] no indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>cation whatever that Congress intended\u201d to limit the phrase to final actions similar to those in the specifically enumerated sections. <em>Id., </em>at 588-589.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">We think the reasoning of <em>Gonzales </em>and <em>Harrison </em>applies equally to the expansive language Congress employed in 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2680(c). Congress\u2019 use of \u201cany\u201d to modify \u201cother law enforcement officer\u201d is most naturally read to mean law enforcement officers of whatever kind.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The word \u201cany\u201d is repeated four times in the relevant portion of \u00a7 2680(c), and two of those instances appear in the particular phrase at issue: <em>\u201cany </em>officer of customs or excise or <em>any </em>other law enforcement officer.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Congress inserted the word \u201cany\u201d immediately before \u201cother law enforcement officer,\u201d leaving no doubt that it modifies that phrase. To be sure, the text\u2019s references to \u201ctax or customs duty\u201d and \u201cofficer[s] of customs or excise\u201d indicate that Congress intended to preserve immunity for claims arising from an officer\u2019s enforcement of tax and customs laws. The text also indicates, however, that Congress intended to preserve immunity for claims arising from the detention of property, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>there is no indication that Congress intended immunity for those claims to turn on the type of law being enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Petitioner would require Congress to clarify its intent to cover all law enforcement officers by. adding phrases such as \u201cperforming any official law enforcement function,\u201d or \u201cwithout limitation.\u201d But Congress could not have chosen a more all-encompassing phrase than \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d to express that intent. We have no reason to demand that Congress write less economically and more repetitiously.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Recent amendments to \u00a7 2680(c) support the conclusion that \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d is not limited to officers acting in a customs or excise capacity. In the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000, Congress added subsections (c)(l)-(c)(4) to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680. \u00a73(a), 114 Stat. 211. As amended, \u00a7 2680(c) provides that the \u00a7 1346(b) waiver of sovereign immunity, notwithstanding the exception at issue in this case, applies to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">\u201c[A]ny claim based on injury or loss of goods, merchandise, or other property, while in the possession of any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer, if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">\u201c(1) the property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture under any provision of Federal law providing for the forfeiture of property other than as a sentence imposed upon conviction of a criminal offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">\u201c(2) the interest of the claimant was not forfeited;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">\u201c(3) the interest of the claimant was not remitted or mitigated (if the property was subject to forfeiture); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">\u201c(4) the claimant was not convicted of a crime for which the interest of the claimant in the property was subject to forfeiture under a Federal criminal forfeiture law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">The amendment does not govern petitioner\u2019s claim because his property was not \u201cseized for the purpose of forfeiture,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>as required by paragraph (1). Nonetheless, the amendment is relevant because our construction of \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d must, to the extent possible, ensure that the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent. See <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., </em>519 U. S. 337, 340 (1997) (citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., </em>489 U. S. 235, 240 (1989)). The amendment canceled the exception - and thus restored the waiver of sovereign immunity - for certain seizures of property based on <em>any </em>federal forfeiture law. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2680(c)(1) (excepting property claims if \u201cthe property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture under <em>any provision of Federal law </em>providing for the forfeiture of property\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Under petitioner\u2019s interpretation, only law enforcement officers enforcing customs or excise laws were immune under the prior version of \u00a7 2680(c). Thus, on petitioner\u2019s reading, the amendment\u2019s only effect was to restore the waiver for cases in which customs or excise officers, or officers acting in such a capacity, enforce forfeiture laws. This strikes us as an implausible interpretation of the statute. If that were Congress\u2019 intent, it is not apparent why Congress would have restored the waiver with respect to the enforcement of <em>all </em>civil forfeiture laws instead of simply those related to customs or excise. Petitioner\u2019s interpretation makes sense only if we assume that Congress went out of its way to restore the waiver for cases in which customs or excise officers, or officers acting in such a capacity, enforce forfeiture laws unrelated to customs or excise. But petitioner fails to demonstrate that customs or excise officers, or officers acting in such a capacity, ever enforce civil forfeiture laws unrelated to customs or excise, much less that they do so with such frequency that Congress is likely to have singled them out in the amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It seems far more likely that Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>restored the waiver for officers enforcing <em>any </em>civil forfeiture law because, in its view, <em>all </em>such officers were covered by the exception to the waiver prior to the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Against this textual and structural evidence that \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d does in fact mean any other law enforcement officer, petitioner invokes numerous canons of statutory construction. He relies primarily on <em>ejusdem generis, </em>or the principle that \u201cwhen a general term follows a specific one, the general term should be understood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration.\u201d <em>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co. </em>v. <em>Train Dispatchers, </em>499 U. S. 117, 129 (1991). In petitioner\u2019s view, \u201cany officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer\u201d should be read as a three-item list, and the final, catchall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>phrase \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d should be limited to officers of the same nature as the preceding specific phrases.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Petitioner likens his case to two recent cases in which we found the canon useful. In <em>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. </em>v. <em>Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, 537 </em>U. S. 371, 375 (2003), we considered the clause \u201cexecution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process\u201d in 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 407(a). Applying <em>ejusdem generis, </em>we concluded that \u201cother legal process\u201d was limited to legal processes of the same nature as the specific items listed. 537 U. S., at 384-385. The department\u2019s scheme for serving as a representative payee of the benefits due to children under its care, while a \u201clegal process,\u201d did not share the common attribute of the listed items, viz., \u201cutilization of some judicial or quasi-judicial mechanism ... by which control over property passes from one person to another in order to discharge\u201d a debt.. <em>Id., </em>at 385. Similarly, in <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Postal Service, </em>546 U. S. 481 (2006), the Court considered whether an exception to the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity for claims arising out of the \u201c \u2018loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter\u2019 \u201d barred a claim that mail negligently left on the petitioner\u2019s porch caused her to slip and fall. <em>Id., </em>at 485 (quoting 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2680(b)). Noting that \u201closs\u201d and \u201cmiscarriage\u201d both addressed \u201cfailings in the postal obligation to deliver mail in a timely manner to the right address,\u201d 546 U. S., at 487, the Court concluded that \u201cnegligent transmission\u201d must be similarly limited, <em>id., </em>at 486-489, and rejected the Government\u2019s argument that the exception applied to \u201call torts committed in the course of mail delivery,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Petitioner asserts that \u00a7 2680(c), like the clauses at issue in <em>Keffeler </em>and <em>Dolan, </em>\u201c\u2018presents a textbook <em>ejusdem generis </em>scenario.\u2019\u201d Brief for Petitioner 15 (quoting <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>United States, </em>441 F. 3d 220, 224 (CA4 2006)). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>The structure of the phrase \u201cany officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer\u201d does not lend itself to application of the canon. The phrase is disjunctive, with one specific and one general category, not \u2014 like the clauses at issue in <em>Keffeler </em>and <em>Dolan </em>\u2014 a list of specific items separated by commas and followed by a general or collective term. The absence of a list of specific items undercuts the inference embodied in <em>ejusdem generis </em>that Congress remained focused on the common attribute when it used the catchall phrase. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Aguilar, </em>515 U. S. 593, 615 (1995) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (rejecting the canon\u2019s applicability to an omnibus clause that was \u201cone of... several distinct and independent prohibitions\u201d rather than \u201ca general or collective term following a list of specific items to which a particular statutory command is applicable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Moreover, it is not apparent what common attribute connects the specific items in \u00a7 2680(c). Were we to use the canon to limit the meaning of \u201cany other law enforcement officer,\u201d we would be required to determine the relevant limiting characteristic of \u201cofficer of customs or excise.\u201d In <em>Jarecki </em>v. <em>G. D. Searle &amp; Co., </em>367 U. S. 303 (1961), for example, the Court invoked <em>noscitur a sociis </em>in limiting the scope of the term \u201c'discovery\u2019\u201d to the common characteristic it shared with '\"exploration\u201d\u2019 and '\"prospecting.\u201d\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 307. The Court noted that all three words in conjunction \u201cdescribe[d] income-producing activity in the oil and gas and mining industries.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, by contrast, no relevant common attribute immediately appears from the phrase \u201cofficer of customs or excise.\u201d Petitioner suggests that the common attribute is that both types of officers are charged with enforcing the customs and excise laws. But we see no reason why that should be the relevant characteristic as opposed to, for example, that officers of that type are commonly involved in the activities enumerated in the statute: the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>sessment and collection of taxes and customs duties and the detention of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Petitioner\u2019s appeals to other interpretive principles are also unconvincing. Petitioner contends that his reading is supported by the canon <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>according to which \u201c \u2018a word is known by the company it keeps.\u2019 \u201d <em>S. D. Warren Co. </em>v. <em>Maine Bd. of Environmental </em>Protection, 547 U. S. 370, 378 (2006). But the cases petitioner cites in support of applying <em>noscitur a sociis </em>involved statutes with stronger contextual cues. See <em>Gutierrez </em>v. <em>Ada, </em>528 U. S. 250, 254-258 (2000) (applying the canon to narrow the relevant phrase, \u201cany election,\u201d where it was closely surrounded by six specific references to gubernatorial elections); <em>Jarecki, supra, </em>at 306-309 (applying the canon to narrow the term \u201cdiscoveries\u201d to discoveries of mineral resources where it was contained in a list of three words, all of which applied to the oil, gas, and mining industries and could not conceivably all apply to any other industry). Here, although customs and excise \u00e1re mentioned twice in \u00a7 2680(c), nothing in the overall statutory context suggests that customs and excise officers were the exclusive focus of the provision. The emphasis in subsection (c) on customs and excise is not inconsistent with the conclusion that \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d sweeps as broadly as its language suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Similarly, the rule against superfluities lends petitioner sparse support. The construction we adopt today does not necessarily render \u201cany officer of customs or excise\u201d superfluous; Congress may have simply intended to remove any doubt that officers of customs or excise were included in \u201claw enforcement officer[s].\u201d See <em>Fort Stewart Schools </em>v. <em>FLRA, </em>495 U. S. 641, 646 (1990) (noting that \u201ctechnically unnecessary\u201d examples may have been \u201cinserted out of an abundance of caution\u201d). Moreover, petitioner\u2019s construction threatens to render \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d superfluous because it is not clear when, if ever, \u201cother law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>officer[s]\u201d act in a customs or excise capacity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In any event, we do not woodenly apply limiting principles every time Congress includes a specific example along with a general phrase. See <em>Harrison, </em>446 U. S., at 589, n. 6 (rejecting an argument that <em>ejusdem generis </em>must apply when a broad interpretation of the clause could render the specific enumerations unnecessary).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In the end, we are unpersuaded by petitioner\u2019s attempt to create ambiguity where the statute\u2019s text and structure suggest none. Had Congress intended to limit \u00a72680(c)\u2019s reach as petitioner contends, it easily could have written \u201cany other law enforcement officer <em>acting in a customs or excise capacity.\u201d </em>Instead, it used the unmodified, all-encompassing phrase \u201cany other law enforcement officer.\u201d Nothing in the statutory context requires a narrowing construction \u2014 indeed, as we have explained, the statute is most consistent and coherent when \u201cany other law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>officer\u201d is read to mean what it literally says. See <em>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co., </em>499 U. S., at 129 (noting that interpretive canons must yield \u201cwhen the whole context dictates a different conclusion\u201d). It bears emphasis, moreover, that \u00a7 2680(c), far from maintaining sovereign immunity for the entire universe of claims against law enforcement officers, does so only for claims \u201carising in respect of\u201d the \u201cdetention\u201d of property. We are not at liberty to rewrite the statute to reflect a meaning we deem more desirable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Instead, we must give effect to the text Congress enacted: Section 2680(c) forecloses lawsuits against the United States for the unlawful detention of property by \u201cany,\u201d not just \u201csome,\u201d law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\"> The Eleventh Circuit joined five other Courts of Appeals in construing \u00a7 2680(c) to encompass all law enforcement officers.

For example, we have construed an \u201cany\u201d phrase narrowly when it included a term of art that compelled that result. See <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>532 U.

We also have construed such phrases narrowly when another term in the provision made sense only under a narrow reading, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alvarez-Sanchez, </em>511 U.

None of the circumstances that motivated our decisions in these cases is present here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b480-5\"> Justice Kennedy\u2019s dissent (hereinafter the dissent) argues that, during border searches, customs and excise officers \u201croutinely\u201d enforce civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>forfeiture laws unrelated to customs or excise. <em>Post, </em>at 239-240. But the examples the dissent provides do not support that assertion. The dissent maintains that a customs officer who seizes material defined as contraband under 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 80302 <em>et seq. </em>is one such example. <em>Post, </em>at 240. But a customs officer\u2019s authority to effect a forfeiture of such contraband derives from a specific customs law. See 19 U. S. C. \u00a7 1595a(c)(l)(C). Similarly, the dissent suggests that a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent \u201cassisting a customs official\u201d in a border search who seizes drug-related contraband under 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 881 is acting in a \u201ctraditional revenue capacity.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 240. But that argument is based on the assumption that an officer who assists in conducting a border search acts in a customs capacity even if he is not a customs officer and is not enforcing a customs law. That assumption, far from self-evident, only underscores the difficulty that would attend any attempt to define the contours of the implied limitation on \u00a7 2680(c)\u2019s reach proposed by petitioner and embraced by the dissent. \u201cActing in a customs or excise capacity\u201d is not a self-defining concept, and not having included such a limitation in the statute\u2019s language, Congress of course did not provide a definition. Finally, the dissent points out that a customs or excise officer might effect a forfeiture of currency or monetary instruments under 31 U. S. C. \u00a7 5317(c). <em>Post, </em>at 240. But \u00a7 5317(e) is hardly a civil forfeiture law unrelated to customs or excise. See \u00a7 5317(c)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (authorizing forfeiture of property involved in a violation of, <em>inter alia, </em>\u00a7 5316 (2000 ed.), which sets forth reporting requirements for exporting and importing monetary instruments).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b485-6\"> As an example of \u201cother law enforcement officer[s]\u201d acting in an excise or customs capacity, petitioner cites <em>Formula One Motors, Ltd. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>777 F. 2d 822, 823-824 (CA2 1985) (holding that the seizure of a vehicle still in transit from overseas by DEA agents who searched it for drugs was \u201csufficiently akin to the functions carried out by Customs officials to place the agents\u2019 conduct within the scope of section 2680(c)\u201d). But it is not clear that the agents in that case were acting in an excise or customs capacity rather than in their ordinary capacity as law enforcement agents. It seems to us that DEA agents searching a car for drugs are acting in their capacity as officers charged with enforcing the Nation\u2019s drug laws, not the customs or excise laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Similarly, the dissent notes that 14 U. S. C. \u00a7 89(a) authorizes Coast Guard officers to enforce customs laws. <em>Post, </em>at 233. But the very next subsection of \u00a789 provides that Coast Guard officers effectively <em>are </em>customs officers when they enforce customs laws. See \u00a7 89(b)(1) (providing that Coast Guard officers \u201cinsofar as they are engaged, pursuant to the authority contained in this section, in enforcing any law of the United States shall... be deemed to be acting as agents of the particular executive department . . . charged with the administration of the particular law\u201d).

The respect is not enhanced, however, by decisions that foreclose consideration of the text within the whole context of the statute as a guide to determining a legislature\u2019s intent. To prevent textual analysis from becoming so rarefied that it departs from how a legislator most likely understood the words when he or she voted for the law, courts use certain interpretative rules to consider text within the statutory design. These canons do not demand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>wooden reliance and are not by themselves dispositive, but they do function as helpful guides in construing ambiguous statutory provisions. Two of these accepted rules are <em>ejusdem generis </em>and <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>which together instruct that words in a series should be interpreted in relation to one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Today the Court holds, if my understanding of its opinion is correct, that there is only one possible way to read the statute. Placing implicit reliance upon a comma at the beginning of a clause, the Court says that the two maxims noted, and indeed other helpful and recognized principles of statutory analysis, are not useful as interpretative aids in this case because the clause cannot be understood by what went before. In my respectful submission the Court\u2019s approach is incorrect as a general rule and as applied to the statute now before us. Both the analytic framework and the specific interpretation the Court now employs become binding on the federal courts, which will confront other cases in which a series of words operate in a clause similar to the one we consider today. So this case is troubling not only for the result the Court reaches but also for the analysis it employs. My disagreements with the Court lead to this dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA or Act) allows those who allege injury from governmental actions over a vast sphere to seek damages for tortious conduct. The enacting Congress enumerated 13 exceptions to the Act\u2019s broad waiver of sovereign immunity, all of which shield the Government from suit in specific instances. These exceptions must be given careful consideration in order to prevent interference with the governmental operations described. As noted in <em>Kosak </em>v. <em>United States, </em>465 U. S. 848, 853, n. 9 (1984), however, \u201cunduly generous interpretations of the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>ceptions run the risk of defeating the central purpose of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">As the Court states, at issue here is the extent of the exception for suits arising from the detention of goods in defined circumstances. The relevant provision excepts from the general waiver</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">\u201cclaim[s] arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods, merchandise, or other property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2680(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Both on first reading and upon further, close consideration, the plain words of the statute indicate that the exception is concerned only with customs and taxes. The provision begins with a clause dealing exclusively with customs and tax duties. And the provision as a whole contains four express references to customs and tax, making revenue duties and customs and excise officers its most salient features. Cf. <em>Gutierrez </em>v. <em>Ada, </em>528 U. S. 250, 254-255 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">This is not to suggest that the Court\u2019s reading is wholly impermissible or without some grammatical support. After all, detention of goods is not stated until the outset of the second clause and at the end of the same clause the words \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d appear; so it can be argued that the first and second clauses of the provision are so separate that all detentions by all law enforcement officers in whatever capacity they might act are covered. Still, this ought not be the preferred reading; for between the beginning of the second clause and its closing reference to \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d appears another reference to \u201cofficer[s] of customs or excise,\u201d this time in the context of property detention. This is quite sufficient, in my view, to continue the limited scope of the exception. At the very least, the Court errs by adopting a rule which simply bars all consideration of the canons of <em>ejusdem generis </em>and <em>nosci</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number><em>tur a sociis. </em>And when those canons are consulted, together with other common principles of interpretation, the case for limiting the exception to customs and tax more than overcomes the position maintained by the Government and adopted by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The <em>ejusdem generis </em>canon provides that, where a seemingly broad clause constitutes a residual phrase, it must be controlled by, and defined with reference to, the \u201cenumerated categories . . . which are recited just before it,\u201d so that the clause encompasses only objects similar in nature. <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>532 U. S. 105, 115 (2001). The words \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d immediately follow the statute\u2019s reference to \u201cofficer[s] of customs or excise,\u201d as well as the first clause\u2019s reference to the assessment of tax and customs duties. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2680(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The Court counters that \u00a7 2680(c) \u201cis disjunctive, with one specific and one general category,\u201d rendering <em>ejusdem generis </em>inapplicable. <em>Ante, </em>at 225. The canon\u2019s applicability, however, is not limited to those statutes that include a laundry list of items. See, <em>e. g., Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co. </em>v. <em>Train Dispatchers, </em>499 U. S. 117, 129 (1991) (\u201c[WJhen a general term follows a specific one, the general term should be understood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration\u201d). In addition, <em>ejusdem generis </em>is often invoked in conjunction with the interpretative canon <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>which provides that words are to be \u201c \u2018known by their companions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. </em>v. <em>Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, </em>537 U. S. 371, 384 (2003) (quoting <em>Gutierrez, supra, </em>at 255). The general rule is that the \u201cmeaning of a word, and, consequently, the intention of the legislature,\u201d should be \u201cascertained by reference to the context, and by considering whether the word in question and the surrounding words are, in fact, <em>ejusdem generis, </em>and referable to the same subject-matter.\u201d <em>Neal </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>95 U. S. 704, 709 (1878) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>A proper reading of \u00a7 2680(c) thus attributes to the last phrase (\u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d) the discrete characteristic shared by the preceding phrases (\u201cofficer[s] of customs or excise\u201d and \u201cassessment or collection of any tax or customs duty\u201d). See also <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, </em>542 U. S. 55, 62-63 (2004) (applying <em>ejusdem generis </em>to conclude that \u201c\u2018failure to act\u2019\u201d means \u201cfailure to take an <em>agency action\u201d </em>(emphasis in original)); <em>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs., supra, </em>at 384-385 (holding that the phrase \u201cother legal process\u201d in 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 407(a) refers only to the utilization of a judicial or quasi-judicial mechanism, the common attribute shared by the phrase and the statutory enumeration preceding it). Had Congress intended otherwise, in all likelihood it would have drafted the section to apply to \u201cany law enforcement officer, including officers of customs and excise,\u201d rather than tacking \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d on the end of the enumerated categories as it did here.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The common attribute of officers of customs and excise and other law enforcement officers is the performance of functions most often assigned to revenue officers, including, <em>inter alia, </em>the enforcement of the United States\u2019 revenue laws and the conduct of border searches. Although officers of customs and officers of excise are in most instances the only full-time staff charged with this duty, officers of other federal agencies and general law enforcement officers often will be called upon to act in the traditional capacity of a revenue officer. For example, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) or Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents frequently assist customs officials in the execution of border searches. See, <em>e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Gurr, </em>471 F. 3d 144, 147-149 (CADC 2006) (FBI involved in search of financial documents at border); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Boumelhem, </em>339 F. 3d 414, 424 (CA6 2003) (\u201cFBI had been cooperating with Customs as a part of a joint task force\u201d); <em>Formula One Motors, Ltd. </em>v. <em>United States, 777 </em>F. 2d 822, 824 (CA2 1985) (DEA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>agents were performing functions traditionally carried out by customs officials where they seized and searched an automobile that had been shipped from abroad and was still in its shipping container). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Schoor, </em>597 F. 2d 1303,1305-1306 (CA9 1979) (upholding constitutionality of cooperation among federal agencies in border searches). Similarly, 14 U. S. C. \u00a7 89(a) grants the Coast Guard plenary authority to stop and board American vessels to inspect for obvious customs violations. See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Gil-Carmona, </em>497 F. 3d 52 (CA1 2007) (Coast Guard assisted an Immigration and Customs Enforcement patrol aircraft in interdicting a vessel off the coast of Puerto Rico). To the extent they detain goods whose possession violates customs laws, the Coast Guard officers \u2014 while not \u201cofficer[s] of customs or excise,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2680(c) \u2014 are without doubt engaging in the enforcement of the United States\u2019 revenue laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The same is true in the tax context. Under 26 U. S. C. \u00a76321, a delinquent taxpayer\u2019s property is subject to forfeiture, see <em>Glass City Bank </em>v. <em>United States, </em>326 U. S. 265 (1945), and may be seized by any federal agent assisting the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in executing the forfeiture, cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>$515,060.42 in United States Currency, </em>152 F. 3d 491, 495 (CA6 1998) (IRS and FBI jointly seized currency). Thus, the final phrase \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d has work to do and makes considerable sense when the statute is limited in this way.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The Court reaches its contrary conclusion by concentrating on the word \u201cany\u201d before the phrase \u201cother law enforcement officer.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2680(c). It takes this single last phrase to extend the statute so that it covers all detentions of property by any law enforcement officer in whatever capacity he or she acts. There are fundamental problems with this approach, in addition to the ones already mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>First, the Court\u2019s analysis cannot be squared with the longstanding recognition that a single word must not be read in isolation but instead defined by reference to its statutory context. See <em>King </em>v. <em>St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, </em>502 U. S. 215, 221 (1991) (\u201c[T]he meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context\u201d); <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Postal Service, </em>546 U. S. 481, 486 (2006) (\u201cA word in a statute may or may not extend to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities. Interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text, considering the purpose and context of the statute, and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis\u201d). This is true even of facially broad modifiers. The word \u201cany\u201d can mean \u201cdifferent things depending upon the setting,\u201d <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Missouri Municipal League, </em>541 U. S. 125, 132 (2004); see also <em>Small </em>v. <em>United States, </em>544 U. S. 385, 388 (2005) (citing cases), and must be limited in its application \u201cto those objects to which the legisl\u00e1ture intended to apply them,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>3 Wheat. 610, 631 (1818).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In <em>Gutierrez, </em>528 U. S., at 254-255, for example, we held that the phrase \u201cin any election\u201d in the Organic Act of Guam, 48 U. S. C. \u00a7 1422, does not refer broadly to all elections but only to the election of Guam\u2019s Governor and Lieutenant Governor. The Court explained that the reference to \u201cany election\u201d is preceded by two references to gubernatorial elections and followed by four more references. In the context of such \u201crelentless repetition,\u201d the Court concluded that the phrase must be \u201cknown by [its] companions.\u201d 528 U. S., at 255. Likewise, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alvarez-Sanchez, </em>511 U. S. 350, 357 (1994), the Court addressed a phrase similar to the statutory provision we interpret today. The Court noted that the respondent erred in \u201cplacing dispositive weight on the broad statutory reference to \u2018any\u2019 law enforcement officer or agency without considering the rest of the statute,\u201d and consulted instead \u201c \u2018the context in which [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>phrase] is used.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 357, 358 (quoting <em>Deal </em>v. <em>United States, </em>508 U. S. 129,132 (1993); alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">As already mentioned, the context of \u00a7 2680(c) suggests that, in accordance with these precedents, the statutory provision should be interpreted narrowly to apply only to customs and revenue duties. Its first clause deals exclusively with customs and tax duties and, between the first and second clauses, it refers two more times to customs and tax. See <em>Gutierrez, supra, </em>at 254-255; <em>A-Mark, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Secret Serv. Dept. of Treasury, </em>593 F. 2d 849, 851 (CA9 1978) (Tang, J., concurring) (\u201cThe clauses both dwell exclusively on customs and taxes, except for the final reference to other law-enforcement officers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Further, \u00a7 2680(c) provides that there will be immunity only where there has been a \u201cdetention\u201d of goods, merchandise, or property. \u201c[Detention\u201d is defined by legal and nonlegal dictionaries alike as a \u201ccompulsory,\u201d \u201cforced,\u201d or \u201cpunitive\u201d containment. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 459 (7th ed. 1999) (compulsory); American Heritage Dictionary 494 (4th ed. 2000) (forced or punitive). The issue whether petitioner\u2019s property was \u201cdetained\u201d within the meaning of the statute was not raised in this case; and so the Court leaves for another day the exception\u2019s applicability to these facts. See <em>ante, </em>at 218, n. 2. It is important, however, to bear in mind that, in the context of detention of goods by customs and tax agents, it will be the rare case when property is voluntarily turned over, rather than forcibly appropriated; indeed, customs and tax agents are in the regular business of seizing and forfeiting property, as are law enforcement agents acting in the capacity of revenue enforcement.

Customs and Border Protection (CBP)], in fiscal year 2006, CBP officers ... seized more than 644,000 pounds of illegal drugs, intercepted nearly 1.7 million prohibited agricultural items, and seized over $155 million in illegal commercial merchandise, such as counterfeit footwear and handbags\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In other contexts, however, the word \u201cdetention\u201d may or may not accurately describe the nature of the Government action. A prisoner\u2019s voluntary decision to deliver property for transfer to another facility, for example, bears a greater similarity to a \u201cbailment\u201d \u2014 the delivery of personal property after being held by the prison in trust, see American Heritage Dictionary, <em>supra, </em>at 134 \u2014 than to a \u201cdetention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Not a single federal statute mentions the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in the context of property detention. On the other hand, the majority of the nine federal statutes other than \u00a7 2680(c) containing a reference to the detention of goods, merchandise, or other property are specific to customs and excise. Compare 19 U. S. C. \u00a7 1499(a) (authorizing customs agents to examine and detain imported merchandise); \u00a71595a(c)(3) (authorizing customs officials to detain merchandise introduced contrary to law); 26 U. S. C. \u00a7 5311 (authorizing internal revenue officers to detain containers containing distilled spirits, wines, or beer where there is reason to believe applicable taxes have not been paid); 50 U. S. C. App. \u00a7 2411(a)(2)(A) (authorizing customs officials to seize and detain goods at ports of entry in the enforcement of war and national defense); 22 U. S. C. \u00a7 464 (authorizing customs agents to detain armed vessels and any property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>found thereon), with 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 981(e) (\u201c . .. The Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Postal Service, as the case may be, shall ensure the equitable transfer pursuant to paragraph (2) of any forfeited property to the appropriate State or local law enforcement agency .... The United States shall not be liable in any action arising out of the seizure, detention, and transfer of seized property to State or local officials\u201d); 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 524(c)(1) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (appropriating a special fund for the purpose of property detention under any law enforced or administered by the Department of Justice); 31 U. S. C. \u00a7 9703(a)(1)(A) (establishing a Department of Treasury Forfeiture Fund to pay the expenses of property detention); 16 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1540(e)(3), 3375(b) (authorizing the detention of goods and packages for inspection where there is reason to believe there has been a violation of laws governing fish, wildlife, and plants).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">This would seem to indicate that Congress contemplated that the statutory provision considered here would apply only in those narrow circumstances where the officer is in the regular business of forfeiting property, namely, revenue enforcement. At the very least, it demonstrates that \u201cdetention\u201d will be a difficult concept to apply case by case under the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute \u2014 a problem alleviated by limiting the statute to customs and tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Second, the Court\u2019s construction of the phrase \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d runs contrary to \u201c \u2018our duty \u201cto give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\u201d\u2019\u201d <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001) (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Menasche, </em>348 U. S. 528, 538-539 (1955)). The Court\u2019s reading renders \u201cofficer[s] of customs or excise\u201d mere surplusage, as there would have been no need for Congress to have specified that officers of customs and officers of excise were immune if they indeed were subsumed within the allegedly all-encompassing \u201cany\u201d officer clause. See <em>Circuit City Stores, </em>532 U. S., at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Third, though the final reference to \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d does result in some ambiguity, the legislative history, by virtue of its exclusive reference to customs and excise, confirms that Congress did not shift its attention from the context of revenue enforcement when it used these words at the end of the statute. See, <em>e. g., </em>S. Rep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 33 (1946) (in discussing 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2680(c) referring only to \u201cthe detention of goods by customs officers\u201d); A. Holtzoff, Report on Proposed Federal Tort Claims Bill 16 (1931) (noting that the property-detention exception was added to the legislation to \u201cinclude immunity from liability in respect of loss in connection with the detention of goods or merchandise by any officer of customs or excise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Indeed, the Court\u2019s construction reads the exception to defeat the central purpose of the statute, an interpretative danger the Court has warned against in explicit terms. See <em>Kosak, </em>465 U. S., at 854, n. 9 (the Court must identify only \u201c \u2018those circumstances which are within the words and reason of the exception\u2019 \u2014 no less and no more\u201d (quoting <em>Dalehite </em>v. <em>United States, </em>346 U. S. 15, 31 (1953))). It is difficult to conceive that the FTCA, which was enacted by Congress to make the tort liability of the United States \u201cthe same as that of a private person under like circumstaneefs],\u201d S. Rep. No. 1400, at 32, would allow any officer under any circumstance to detain property without being accountable under the Act to those injured by his or her tortious conduct. If Congress wanted to say that all law enforcement officers may detain property without liability in tort, including when they perform general law enforcement tasks, it would have done so in more express terms; one would expect at least a reference to law enforcement officers outside the customs or excise context either in the text of the statute or in the legislative history. In the absence of that reference, the Court ought not presume that the liberties of the person who owns the property would be so lightly dismissed and disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The 2000 amendments do not require a contrary conclusion. The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 (CAFRA), as applicable here, limits the operation of \u00a72680(c)\u2019s exception. See \u00a7 3(a), 114 Stat. 211. The limitation <em>(i. e., </em>the exception to the exception) applies where there has been an injury or loss of goods and \u201cthe property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture under any provision of Federal law.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2680(c)(1). In my view the amendment establishes that officers of customs and excise, and law enforcement officials performing functions traditionally reserved for revenue officers, shall be liable in tort for damage to the property when the owner\u2019s interest in the goods in the end is not forfeited (and when other conditions apply). And this is so regardless of whether the officer acted under the revenue laws of the United States or, alternatively, another civil or criminal forfeiture provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The majority\u2019s reading of CAFRA for a contrary proposition is premised on the assumption that there is no circumstance in which a customs or excise officer, or an officer acting in such a capacity, would \u201cenforce [civil] forfeiture laws unrelated to customs or excise.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 222. But customs and tax officials, along with law enforcement officers performing customs and tax duties, routinely do just that. See, <em>e. g., </em>Customs and Border Protection, Seizures and Penalties Links, http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/toolbox/legal/ authority_enforce/seizures_penalties.xml (CBP has \u201cfull authority to ... seize merchandise for violation of CBP laws or those of other federal agencies that are enforced by CBP\u201d). Indeed, the customs laws expressly contemplate forfeitures and seizures of property under nonrevenue provisions. See, <em>e. g., </em>19 U. S. C. \u00a7 1600 (\u201cThe procedures [governing seizures of property] set forth in [\u00a7\u00a7 1602-1619] shall apply to seizures of any property effected by customs officers under any law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>enforced or administered by the Customs Service unless such law specifies different procedures\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">By way of example, a customs or excise official might effect a civil forfeiture of currency or monetary instruments under the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U. S. C. \u00a7 5317(c) (2000 ed., Supp. V); or of counterfeit instruments, illegal music recordings, or firearms under the Contraband Act, 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 80302 <em>et seq. </em>(2000 ed. and Supp. IV). Similarly, a DEA agent assisting a customs official in a border search (and thus acting in a customs capacity) might effect a civil forfeiture of vehicles or goods associated with the drug trade under federal drug laws. See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 881 (2000 ed. and Supp. V); see also, <em>e. g., Formula One Motors, </em>777 F. 2d, at 822-823. Though acting pursuant to a civil forfeiture law that is not specific to customs and taxes, the DEA agent would be covered by \u00a7 2680(c)\u2019s exception to the exception because he or she would be acting in a traditional revenue capacity - that of conducting a routine search of persons and effects of persons crossing an international boundary.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The Court counters that the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U. S. C. \u00a7 5317(c), is not \u201cunrelated to customs or excise\u201d because it cross-references a requirement for exporting and importing monetary instruments, \u00a7 5316. See <em>ante, </em>at 223, n. 5. But \u00a7 5316, despite being \u201c[r]elated\u201d to customs duties, is part of the federal Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, see \u00a7 5311 <em>et seq. </em>(2000 ed. and Supp. IV), not the United States\u2019 customs laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The Court also notes that customs agents have the authority to seize contraband under the customs laws, particularly 19 U. S. C. \u00a7 1595a(c)(l). I do not dispute that customs agents often act under customs laws when seizing property. My point, which goes unrefuted by the Court, is that it was reasonable for Congress to have specified that customs and excise officers would be covered by the exception to the exception even when acting pursuant to federal laws more generally. For instance, \u00a7 1595a(c)(l) applies only where \u201c[m]er-</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>chandise... is introduced... into the United States contrary to law,\u201d which appears to target the importation of property subject to duty or entry restrictions. Title 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2680(c), by contrast, was amended in 2000 to encompass not only the detention of \u201cgoods or merchandise\u201d but the detention of all \u201cproperty.\u201d \u00a7 3(a), 114 Stat. 211. In circumstances not involving imported \u201cmerchandise,\u201d then, the customs official would be acting pursuant to law enforcement authority derived not from the customs laws but, <em>inter alia, </em>the Contraband and Bank Secrecy Acts. The same is true of noncustoms officers acting in a customs capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">At the very least this renders the Court\u2019s reliance on the views of a subsequent Congress suspect. We have said \u201csubsequent acts can shape or focus\u201d the meaning of a statute. <em>FDA </em>v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>529 U. S. 120, 143 (2000). There is no indication, however, that by adding a forfeiture exception to the exception, Congress intended to broaden the scope of the original immunity. Cf. <em>SEC </em>v. <em>Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., </em>375 U. S. 180, 199-200 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Though the Court does not much rely on the point, perhaps it has concerns respecting suits like the one now before us. Petitioner sues for lost property valued at about $177. Law enforcement officers in the federal prison system must take inventory of the property they store, and with just under 200,000 persons in the federal prison population, see Federal Bureau of Prisons, Weekly Population Report, online at http://www.bop.gov/news/weekly_report.jsp (reporting 199,342 federal inmates as of January 7, 2008), the burden on the Government to account for missing items of little value could be a substantial one.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">There are sound reasons, though, for rejecting this concern in interpreting the statute. To begin with, as already discussed, if it were a congressional objective to give a comprehensive exception to all officers who detain property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Congress most likely would have written a specific provision to address the point, quite apart from the special concerns it had with customs and revenue. The exception as the Court now interprets it extends not only to trivial detentions, not only to prison officials, not only to those in custody, but to all detentions of property of whatever value held by all law enforcement officials, a reading that simply does not comport with the plain text and context of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Second, as the Court observed when interpreting another exception that raised the concern of numerous frivolous claims, liability for negligent transmission \u201cis a risk shared by any business [involved in management of detention facilities],\u201d including the Government. <em>Dolan, </em>546 U. S., at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Third, there are already in place administrative procedures that must be exhausted before the suit is allowed, diminishing the number of frivolous suits that would be heard in federal court. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (\u201cNo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted\u201d). Under 28 CFR \u00a7 543.31(a) (2007), the \u201cowner of the damaged or lost property\u201d first must file an FTCA claim with the BOP regional office; the BOP, in turn, is authorized by statute to settle administrative claims for not more than $1,000, see 31 U. S. C. \u00a7 3723(a), which likely encompasses most claims brought by federal prisoners. Only if the prisoner is \u201cdissatisfied with the final agency action\u201d may he or she file suit in an \u201cappropriate U. S. District Court.\u201d 28 CFR \u00a7 543.32(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">If Congress had intended to give sweeping immunity to all federal law enforcement officials from liability for the detention of property, it would not have dropped this phrase onto the end of the statutory clause so as to appear there as something of an afterthought. The seizure of property by an of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>fleer raises serious concerns for the liberty of our people and the Act should not be read to permit appropriation of property without a remedy in tort by language so obscure and indirect.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">For these reasons, in my view, the judgment of the Court of Appeals ought to be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b501-6\">Justice Breyer,</author>\n<p id=\"A1v\">with whom Justice Stevens joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">I agree with Justice Kennedy that context makes clear that Congress intended the phrase \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d to apply only to officers carrying out customs or excise duties. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2680(c). But I write separately to emphasize, as Justice Kennedy\u2019s dissent itself makes clear, that the relevant context-extends well beyond Latin canons and other such purely textual devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">As with many questions of statutory interpretation, the issue here is not the <em>meaning </em>of the words. The dictionary meaning of each word is well known. Rather, the issue is the statute\u2019s <em>scope. </em>What boundaries did Congress intend to set? To what circumstances did Congress intend the phrase, as used in <em>this </em>statutory provision, to apply? The majority answers this question by referring to an amendment that creates an exception for certain forfeitures and by emphasizing the statutory word \u201cany.\u201d As to the amendment, I find Justice Kennedy\u2019s counterargument convincing. See <em>ante, </em>at 239-241 (dissenting opinion). And, in my view, the word \u201cany\u201d provides no help whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The word \u201cany\u201d is of no help because all speakers (including writers and legislators) who use general words such as \u201call,\u201d \u201cany,\u201d \u201cnever,\u201d and \u201cnone\u201d normally rely upon context to indicate the limits of time and place within which they intend those words to do their linguistic work. And with the possible exception of the assertion of a universal truth, say, by a mathematician, scientist, philosopher, or theologian, such limits almost always exist.' When I call out to my wife, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u201cThere isn\u2019t any butter,\u201d I do not mean, \u201cThere isn\u2019t any butter in town.\u201d The context makes clear to her that I am talking about the contents of our refrigerator. That is to say, it is context, not a dictionary, that sets the boundaries of time, place, and circumstance within which words such as \u201cany\u201d will apply. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>3 Wheat. 610, 631 (1818) (Marshall, C. J.) (\u201c[G]eneral words,\u201d such as the word \u201c \u2018any\u2019,\u201d must \u201cbe limited\u201d in their application \u201cto those objects to which the legislature intended to apply them\u201d); <em>Small </em>v. <em>United States, </em>544 U. S. 385, 388 (2005) (\u201cThe word \u2018any\u2019 considered alone cannot answer\u201d the question \u201cwhether the statutory reference \u2018convicted in <em>any </em>court\u2019 includes a conviction entered in a <em>foreign </em>court\u201d); <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Missouri Municipal League, </em>541 U. S. 125, 132 (2004) (\u201c \u2018[A]ny\u2019 \u201d means \u201cdifferent things depending upon the setting\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alvarez-Sanchez, </em>511 U. S. 350, 357 (1994) (\u201c[Respondent errs in placing dispositive weight on the broad statutory reference to \u2018any\u2019 law enforcement officer or agency without considering the rest of the statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AIs\">Context, of course, includes the words immediately surrounding the phrase in question. And canons such as <em>ejusdem generis </em>and <em>noscitur a sociis </em>offer help in evaluating the significance of those surrounding words. Yet that help is limited. That is because other contextual features can show that Congress intended a phrase to apply more broadly than the immediately surrounding words by themselves suggest. See <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>532 U. S. 105, 138-140 (2001) (Souter, J., dissenting) (finding \u201cgood reasons\u201d not to apply <em>ejusdem generis </em>because the statute\u2019s history and purposes make clear that the words \u201cany other class of workers\u201d in the phrase \u201cseamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers\u201d refer, not just to other transportation workers, but to workers of all kinds including retail store clerks). It is because canons of construction are not \u201cconclusive\u201d and \u201care often countered ... by some maxim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>pointing in a different direction.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 115 (majority opinion). And it is because these particular canons simply crystallize what English speakers already know, namely, that lists often (but not always) group together items with similar characteristics. That is why we cannot, without comic effect, yoke radically different nouns to a single verb, <em>e. g., </em>\u201cHe caught three salmon, two trout, and a cold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In this case, not only the immediately surrounding words but also every other contextual feature supports Justice Kennedy\u2019s conclusion. The textual context includes the location of the phrase within a provision that otherwise exclusively concerns customs and revenue duties. And the nontextual context includes several features that, taken together, indicate that Congress intended a narrow tort-liability exception related to customs and excise.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">First, drafting history shows that the relevant portion of the bill that became the Federal Tort Claims Act concerned only customs and excise. Initially, the relevant provision of the bill exempted only claims \u201carising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty.\u201d See, <em>e.g., </em>S. 4377, 71st Cong., 2d Sess., 4 (1930). In 1931, a Special Assistant to the Attorney General, Alexander Holtzoff, wrote additional draft language, namely, \u201cor the detention of any goods or merchandise by any officer of customs or excise or <em>any other law enforcement officer.\u201d </em>Bill Draft, p. 2, reprinted in Report on Proposed Federal Tort Claims Bill p. 2 (1931) (emphasis added). Holtzoff, in a report to a congressional agency, said that the expanded language sought \u201cto include immunity from liability in respect of loss in connection with the detention of goods or merchandise by any officer of customs or excise.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 16. Holtzoff explained that the language was suggested by a similar British bill that mentioned only customs and excise officials. <em>Ibid, </em>(referring to the bill proposed in the Crown Proceedings Committee Report \u00a7 ll(5)(c), pp. 17-18 (Apr. 1927) (Cmd. 2842) (\u201cNo proceedings shall lie under this section ... for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>or in respect of the loss of or any deterioration or damage occasioned to, or any delay in the release of, any goods or merchandise by reason of anything done or omitted to be done by any officer of customs and excise acting as such\u201d)); see <em>Kosak </em>v. <em>United States, </em>465 U. S. 848, 857, n. 13 (1984) (While \u201cthe ideas expressed [in Holtzoff\u2019s report] should not be given great weight in determining the intent of the Legislature,\u201d at least in some circumstances, \u201cit seems to us senseless to ignore entirely the views of [the provision\u2019s] draftsman\u201d). And Members of Congress repeatedly referred to the exception as encompassing claims involving customs and excise functions. See, <em>e. g., </em>H. R. Rep. No. 2428, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 5 (1940); S. Rep. No. 1196, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 7 (1942); H. R. Rep. No. 2245, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 10 (1942); H. R. Rep. No. 1287, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 6 (1945); S. Rep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 33 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Second, insofar as Congress sought, through the Act\u2019s exceptions, to preclude tort suits against the Government where \u201cadequate remedies were already available,\u201d <em>Kosak, supra, </em>at 858; see S. Rep. No. 1400, at 33; H. R. Rep. No. 1287, at 6 (setting forth that purpose), a limited exception makes sense; a broad exception does not. Other statutes already provided recovery for plaintiffs harmed by federal officers enforcing customs and tax laws but not for plaintiffs harmed by all other federal officers enforcing most other laws. See <em>Bazuaye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>83 F. 3d 482, 485-486 (CADC 1996) (detailing history).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Third, the practical difference between a limited and a broad interpretation is considerable, magnifying the importance of the congressional silence to which Justice Kennedy points, see <em>ante, </em>at 238. A limited interpretation of the phrase \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d would likely encompass only those law enforcement officers working, say, at borders and helping to enforce customs and excise laws. The majority instead interprets this provision to include the tens of thousands of officers performing unrelated tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>The Justice Department estimates that there are more than 100,000 law enforcement officers, not including members of the armed services. See, <em>e. g., </em>Dept, of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, B. Reaves, Federal Law Enforcement Officers, 2004, p. 1 (July 2006). And although the law\u2019s history contains much that indicates the provision\u2019s scope is limited to customs and excise, it contains <em>nothing at all </em>suggesting an intent to apply the provision more broadly, indeed, to multiply the number of officers to whom it applies by what is likely one or more orders of magnitude. It is thus not the Latin canons, <em>ejusdem generis </em>and <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>that shed light on the application of the statutory phrase but Justice Scalia\u2019s more pertinent and easily remembered English-language observation that Congress \u201cdoes not . . . hide elephants in mouseholes.\u201d <em>Whitman </em>v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc., </em>531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001).</p>\n<judges id=\"b505-5\">For these reasons, I dissent and I join Justice Kennedy\u2019s dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
