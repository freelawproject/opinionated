Siebert\u2019s conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and the certificate of judgment issued on May 22,1990. This Court denied certiorari on November 5, 1990. <em>Siebert </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>498 U. S. 963. On August 25,1992, Siebert filed a petition for postconviction relief in Alabama state court. The state courts denied the petition as untimely, however, because it was filed approximately three months after the expiration of the then-applicable 2-year statute of limitations, Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (2000-2001), which began to run from the date the certificate of judgment issued.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The Alabama Supreme Court denied certiorari on September 15,2000. Siebert did not seek review in this Court. On September 14,2001, Siebert filed a petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254, in the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) established a 1-year statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas petition. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The limitations period is tolled, however, while \u201ca properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Because Siebert\u2019s direct appeal became final before AEDPA became effective, the 1-year limitations period began to run from April 24, 1996, AEDPA\u2019s effective date. See <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Saffold, </em>536 U. S. 214, 217 (2002). Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>absent tolling, Siebert\u2019s federal habeas petition would be untimely by over four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The District Court dismissed Siebert\u2019s habeas petition as untimely, reasoning that an application for state postconviction relief is not \u201cproperly filed\u201d if it was rejected by the state court on statute-of-limitations grounds. The Court of Appeals reversed, however, holding that Siebert\u2019s state post-conviction petition was \u201cproperly filed\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(d)(2), because the state time bar was not jurisdictional and the Alabama courts therefore had discretion in enforcing it. See <em>Siebert </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>334 F. 3d 1018, 1030 (CA11 2003) <em>(per curiam). </em>The Court of Appeals accordingly remanded to the District Court to consider the merits of Siebert\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">While Siebert\u2019s habeas petition was pending on remand in the District Court, we decided <em>Pace </em>v. <em>DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U. S. 408 (2005). In <em>Pace, </em>we held that a state postconviction petition rejected by the state court as untimely is not \u201cproperly filed\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(d)(2). <em>Id., </em>at 414, 417. Relying on <em>Pace, </em>the District Court again found that Siebert\u2019s state postconviction petition was not \u201cproperly filed,\u201d and dismissed his federal habeas petition as untimely. The Court of Appeals, however, reversed and remanded. In a one-paragraph opinion, the court distinguished <em>Pace </em>on the ground that Rule 32.2(c), unlike the statute of limitations at issue in <em>Pace, </em>\u201coperated] as an affirmative defense.\u201d 480 F. 3d 1089,1090 (CA112007). Thus, the court found its prior holding \u2014 that Siebert\u2019s state postconviction petition was \u201cproperly filed\u201d because the state court rejected it on a non-jurisdictional ground \u2014 stood as the law of the case. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 carveout of time limits that operate as affirmative defenses is inconsistent with our holding in <em>Pace. </em>Although the Pennsylvania statute of limitations at issue in <em>Pace </em>happens to have been a jurisdictional time bar under state law, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>556 Pa. 1, 5-6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>726 A. 2d 374,376 (1999), the jurisdictional nature of the time limit was not the basis for our decision. Rather, we built upon a distinction that we had earlier articulated in <em>Artuz </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>531 U. S. 4 (2000), between postconviction petitions rejected on the basis of \u201c\u2018filing\u2019 conditions,\u201d which are not \u201cproperly filed\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(2), and those rejected on the basis of \u201cprocedural bars [that] go to the ability to obtain relief,\u201d which are. <em>Pace, supra, </em>at 417 (citing <em>Artuz, supra, </em>at 10-11). We found that statutes of limitations are \u201cfiling\u201d conditions because they \u201cgo to the very initiation of a petition and a court\u2019s ability to consider that petition.\u201d <em>Pace, </em>544 U. S., at 417. Thus, we held \u201cthat time limits, <em>no matter their form, </em>are \u2018filing\u2019 conditions,\u201d and that a state post-conviction petition is therefore not \u201cproperly filed\u201d if it was rejected by the state court as untimely. <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In short, our holding in <em>Pace </em>turned not on the nature of the particular time limit relied upon by the state court, but rather on the fact that time limits generally establish \u201cconditions to filing\u201d a petition for . state postconviction relief. Whether a time limit is jurisdictional, an affirmative defense, or something in between, it is a \u201ccondition to filing,\u201d <em>Artuz, supra, </em>at 9 \u2014 it places a limit on how long a prisoner can wait before filing a postconviction petition. The fact that Alabama\u2019s Rule 32.2(c) is an affirmative defense that can be waived (or is subject to equitable tolling) renders it no less a \u201cfiling\u201d requirement than a jurisdictional time bar would be; it only makes it a less stringent one. Indeed, in <em>Pace </em>we cited the very statute at issue in this case as an example of such a \u201cfiling\u201d requirement. See 544 U. S., at 417, n. 7 (citing Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (2004-2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Excluding from <em>Pace\u2019s </em>scope those time limits that operate as affirmative defenses would leave a gaping hole in what we plainly meant to be a general rule, as statutes of limitations are often affirmative defenses. See, <em>e.g., </em>Fed. Rule Civ. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Proc. 8(c); <em>Kirkland </em>v. <em>State, </em>143 Idaho 544, 546, 149 P. 3d 819, 821 (2006) (\u201cThe statute of limitations for petitions for post-conviction relief is not jurisdictional. It \u2018is an affirmative defense that may be waived if it is not pleaded by the defendant\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Cole </em>v. <em>State, </em>135 Idaho 107, 110, 15 P. 3d 820, 823 (2000); citation omitted)); <em>People </em>v. <em>Boclair, </em>202 Ill. 2d 89, 101, 789 N. E. 2d 734, 742 (2002) (holding that time bar for filing postconviction petition is \u201can affirmative defense and can be raised, waived, or forfeited, by the State\u201d). What is more, whether a time limit is jurisdictional or an affirmative defense is often a disputed question, as the interpretive history of Rule 32.2(c) itself illustrates, see <em>Ex parte Ward, </em>46 So. 3d 888, 894 (2007) (noting confusion in the Alabama lower courts over whether Rule 32.2(c) is jurisdictional). Under the Court of Appeals\u2019 approach, federal habeas courts would have to delve into the intricacies of state procedural law in deciding whether a postconviction petition rejected by the state courts as untimely was nonetheless \u201cproperly filed\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Our decision in <em>Pace </em>precludes such an approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">We therefore reiterate now what we held in <em>Pace: </em>\u201cWhen a postconviction petition is untimely under state law, That [is] the end of the matter\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2).\u201d 544 U. S., at 414 (quoting <em>Carey, </em>536 U. S., at 226; alteration in original). Because Siebert\u2019s petition for state postconviction relief was rejected as untimely by the Alabama courts, it was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Accordingly, he was not entitled to tolling of AEDPA\u2019s 1-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\">At the time Siebert\u2019s petition was before the Alabama courts, Rule 32.2(c) provided that \u201cthe court shall not entertain any petition,\u201d with certain exceptions not applicable here, \u201cunless the petition is filed . . . within two (2) years after the issuance of the certificate of judgment by the Court of Criminal Appeals.\u201d The Rule has since been amended to provide for a 1-year limitations period, but is otherwise unchanged. See Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (2007-2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Justice Stevens,</author>\n<p id=\"Aak\">with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">There is an obvious distinction between time limits that go to the very initiation of a petition, and time limits that create an affirmative defense that can be waived. Compare the majority and dissenting opinions in <em>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>457 F. 3d 1345 (CA Fed. 2006), cert. granted, 550 U. S. 968 (2007). The time limit under consideration in <em>Pace </em>v. <em>DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U. S. 408 (2005), was of the former kind \u2014 as the Court\u2019s opinion expressly noted. See <em>id., </em>at 417 (discussing \u201ctime limits, which go to the very initiation of a petition and a court\u2019s ability to consider that petition\u201d). The time limit at issue in this case is of the latter, distinguishable kind \u2014 as the Court of Appeals correctly stated. 480 F. 3d 1089, 1090 (CA11 2007) (holding that <em>Pace </em>did not address statutory tolling for \u201ca statute of limitations that operated as an affirmative defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">It is true that there is language in the majority opinion in <em>Pace </em>that is broad enough to cover both kinds of limitations provisions, but only the former (those that do not operate as affirmative defenses) can even arguably provide a reasonable basis for concluding that an untimely petition has not been \u201cproperly filed\u201d within the meaning of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b266-7\">1 continue to believe, as stated in my dissent in <em>Pace, </em>544 U. S., at 427, that state timeliness bars that operate like procedural bars (for example, those that require the courts to consider enumerated exceptions) should not determine whether a state posteonviction petition is \u201cproperly filed\u201d under AEDPA. Even accepting <em>Pace, </em>however, this case is distinguishable and should not be summarily reversed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
