This requirement of \u201crelating the tax status of corporate distributions to earnings and profits is responsive to a felt need for protecting returns of capital from tax.\u201d 4 Bittker &amp; Lokken \u00b6 92.1.1, at 92-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">In this criminal tax proceeding, petitioner Michael Boulware was charged with several counts of tax evasion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>filing a false income tax return, stemming from his diversion of funds from Hawaiian Isles Enterprises (HIE), a closely held corporation of which he was the president, founder, and controlling (though not sole) shareholder. At trial,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the United States sought to establish that Boulware had received taxable income by \u201csystematically diverting] funds from HIE in order to support a lavish lifestyle.\u201d 384 F. 3d 794, 799 (CA9 2004). The Government\u2019s evidence showed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">\u201c[Boulware] gave millions of dollars of HIE money to his girlfriend . . . and millions of dollars to his wife . . . without reporting any of this money on his personal income tax returns. . . . [H]e siphoned off this money primarily by writing checks to employees and friends and having them return the cash to him, by diverting payments by HIE customers, by submitting fraudulent invoices to HIE, and by laundering HIE money through companies in the Kingdom of Tonga and Hong Kong.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">In defense, Boulware sought to introduce evidence that HIE had no retained or current earnings and profits in the relevant taxable years, with the consequence (he argued) that he in effect received distributions of property that must have been returns of capital, up to his basis in his stock. See \u00a7 301(c)(2). Because the return of capital was nontaxable, the argument went, the Government could not establish the tax deficiency required to convict him.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The Government moved <em>in limine </em>to bar evidence in support of Boulware\u2019s return-of-capital theory, on the grounds of \u201cirrelevance] in [this] criminal tax case,\u201d App. 20. The Government relied on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>545 F. 2d 1204 (1976), in which that court held that in a criminal tax evasion case, a diversion of funds may be deemed a return of capital only after \u201csome demonstration on the part of the taxpayer and/or the corporation that such [a distribution was] intended to be such a return,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 1215. Boulware, the Government argued, had offered to make no such demonstration. App. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The District Court granted the Government\u2019s motion, and when Boulware sought \u201cto present evidence of [HIE\u2019s] alleged over-reporting of income, and an offer of proof relating to the issue of. . . dividends,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 135, the District Court denied his request. The court said that \u201c[n]ot only would much of [his proffered] evidence be excludable as expert legal opinion, it is plainly insufficient under the Miller case,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 138, and accordingly declined to instruct the jury on Boulware\u2019s return-of-capital theory. The jury rejected his alternative defenses (that the diverted funds were nontaxable corporate advances or loans, or that he used the moneys for corporate purposes), and found him guilty on nine counts, four of tax evasion and five of filing a false return.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The Ninth Circuit affirmed. 470 F. 3d 931 (2006). It acknowledged that \u201cimposing an intent requirement creates a disconnect between civil and criminal liability,\u201d but thought that under <em>Miller, </em>\u201cthe characterization of diverted corporate funds for civil tax purposes does not dictate their characterization for purposes of a criminal tax evasion charge.\u201d 470 F. 3d, at 934. The court held the test in a criminal case to be \u201cwhether the defendant has willfully attempted to evade the payment or assessment of a tax.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Because Boulware \u201c\u2018presented no concrete proof that the amounts were considered, intended, or recorded on the corporate rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>ords as a return of capital at the time they were made,\u2019 \u201d id., at 935 (quoting <em>Miller, supra, </em>at 1215), the Ninth Circuit held that Boulware\u2019s proffer was \u201cproperly rejected ... as inadequate,\u201d 470 F. 3d, at 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Judge Thomas concurred because the panel was bound by <em>Miller, </em>but noted that <em>\u201cMiller </em>\u2014 and now the majority opinion \u2014 hold that a defendant may be criminally sanctioned <em>for </em>tax evasion without owing a penny in taxes to the government.\u201d 470 F. 3d, at 938. That, he said, not only \u201cindicate[s] a logical fallacy, but is in flat contradiction with the tax evasion statute\u2019s requirement ... of a tax deficiency.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">We granted certiorari, 551 U. S. 1191 (2007), to resolve a split among the Courts of Appeals over the application of \u00a7\u00a7 301 and 316(a) to informally transferred or diverted corporate funds in criminal tax proceedings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We now vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The colorful behavior described in the allegations requires a reminder that tax classifications like \u201cdividend\u201d and \u201creturn of capital\u201d turn on \u201cthe objective economic realities of a transaction rather than ... the particular form the parties employed,\u201d <em>Frank Lyon Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>435 U.

S. 63, 69 (1937), or as effective a means of returning a shareholder\u2019s capital, see <em>ibid. </em>Accordingly, \u201c[a] distribution to a shareholder in his capacity as such . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>is subject to \u00a7301 even though it is not declared in formal fashion.\u201d B. Bittker &amp; J. Eustice, Federal Income Taxation of Corporations and Shareholders \u00b6 8.05[1], pp. 8-36 to 8-37 (6th ed. 1999) (hereinafter Bittker &amp; Eustice); see also Gardner, The Tax Consequences of Shareholder Diversions in Close Corporations, 21 Tax L. Rev. 223, 239 (1966) (hereinafter Gardner) (\u201cSections 316 and 301 do not require any formal path to be taken by a corporation in order for those provisions to apply\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">There is no reason to doubt that economic substance remains the right touchstone for characterizing funds received when a shareholder diverts them before they can be recorded on the corporation\u2019s books. While they \u201cnever even pass through the corporation\u2019s hands,\u201d Bittker <em>&amp; </em>Eustice \u00b6 8.05[9], at 8-51, even diverted funds may be seen as dividends or capital distributions for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7301 and 316(a), see <em>Truesdell </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>89 T. C. 1280 (1987) (treating diverted funds as \u201cconstructive\u201d distributions in civil tax proceedings). The point, again, is that \u201ctaxation is not so much concerned with the refinements of title as it is with actual command over the property taxed \u2014 the actual benefit for which the tax is paid.\u201d <em>Corliss </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>281 U. S. 376, 378 (1930); see also <em>Griffiths </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>308 U. S. 355, 358 (1939).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\"><em>Miller\u2019s </em>view that a criminal defendant may not treat a distribution as a return of capital without evidence of a eor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>responding contemporaneous intent sits uncomfortably not only with the tax law\u2019s economic realism, but with the particular wording of \u00a7\u00a7 301 and 316(a), as well. As those sections are written, the tax consequences of a \u201cdistribution by a corporation with respect to its stock\u201d depend, not on anyone\u2019s purpose to return capital or to get it back, but on facts wholly independent of intent: whether the corporation had earnings and profits, and the amount of the taxpayer\u2019s basis for his stock. Cf. <em>Truesdell </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Action on Decision 1988-25, 1988 WL 570761 (Sept. 12, 1988) (recommendation regarding acquiescence), IRS Non Docketed Service Advice Review, 1989 WL 1172952 (Mar. 15,1989) (reply to request for reconsideration) (\u201c[Ijntent is irrelevant. . . . [E]very distribution made with respect to a shareholder\u2019s stock is taxable as ordinary income, capital gain, or not at all pursuant to section 301(c) dependent upon the corporation\u2019s earnings and profits and the shareholder\u2019s stock basis. The determination is computational and not dependent upon intent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">When the <em>Miller </em>court went the other way, needless to say, it could claim no textual hook for the contemporaneous intent requirement, but argued for it as the way to avoid two supposed anomalies. First, the court thought that applying \u00a7\u00a7301 and 316(a) in criminal cases unnecessarily emphasizes the exact amount of deficiency while \u201ccompletely ignoring] one essential element of the crime charged: the willful intent to evade taxes . . . .\u201d 545 F. 2d, at 1214. But there is an analytical mistake here. Willfulness is an element of the crimes charged because the substantive provisions defining tax evasion and filing a false return expressly require it, see \u00a7 7201 (\u201c[a]ny person who willfully attempts . . . \u201d); \u00a7 7206(1) (\u201c[w]illfully makes and subscribes . . . \u201d). The element of willfulness is addressed at trial by requiring the Government to prove it. Nothing in \u00a7\u00a7 301 and 316(a) as written (that is, without an intent requirement) relieves the Government of this burden of proving willfulness or impedes it from doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>so if evidence of willfulness is there. Those two sections as written simply address a different element of criminal evasion, the existence of a tax deficiency, and both deficiency and willfulness can be addressed straightforwardly (in jury instructions or bench findings) without tacking an intent requirement onto the rule distinguishing dividends from capital returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Second, the <em>Miller </em>court worried that if a defendant could claim capital treatment without showing a corresponding and contemporaneous intent,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">\u201c[a] taxpayer who diverted funds from his close corporation when it was in the midst of a financial difficulty and had no earnings and profits would be immune from punishment (to the extent of his basis in the stock) for failure to report such sums as income; while that very same taxpayer would be convicted if the corporation had experienced a successful year and had earnings and profits.\u201d 545 F. 2d, at 1214.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">\u201cSuch a result,\u201d said the court, \u201cwould constitute an extreme example of form over substance.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Circuit thus assumed that a taxpayer like Boulware could be convicted of evasion with no showing of deficiency from an unreported dividend or capital gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">But the acquittal that the author of <em>Miller </em>called form trumping substance would in fact result from the Government\u2019s failure to prove an element of the crime. There is no criminal tax evasion without a tax deficiency, see <em>supra, </em>at 424,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and there is no deficiency owing to a distribution (re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>ceived with respect to a corporation\u2019s stock) if a corporation has no earnings and profits and the value distributed does not exceed the taxpayer-shareholder\u2019s basis for his stock. Thus the fact that a shareholder distributee of a successful corporation may have different tax liability from a shareholder of a corporation without earnings and profits merely follows from the way \u00a7\u00a7301 and 316(a) are written (to distinguish dividend from capital return), and from the requirement of tax deficiency for a \u00a7 7201 crime. Without the deficiency there is nothing but some act expressing the will to evade, and, under \u00a7 7201, acting on \u201cbad intentions, alone, [is] not punishable,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>D\u2019Agostino, </em>145 F. 3d 69, 73 (CA2 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">It is neither here nor there whether the. <em>Miller </em>court was justified in thinking it would improve things to convict more of the evasively inclined by dropping the deficiency requirement and finding some other device to exempt returns of capital.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even if there were compelling reasons to extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>\u00a7 7201 to cases in which no taxes are owed, it bears repeating that \u201c[t]he spirit of the doctrine which denies to the federal judiciary power to create crimes forthrightly admonishes that we should not enlarge the reach of enacted crimes by constituting them from anything less than the incriminating components contemplated by the words used in the statute,\u201d <em>Morissette </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952) (opinion for the Court by Jackson, J.) (footnote omitted). If \u00a7301, \u00a7 316(a), or \u00a7 7201 could stand amending, Congress will have to do the rewriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Not only is <em>Miller </em>devoid of the support claimed for it, but it suffers the demerit of some anomalies of its own. First and most obviously, \u00a7\u00a7 301 and 316 are odd stalks for grafting a contemporaneous intent requirement, given the fact that the correct application of their rules will often become known only at the end of the corporation\u2019s tax year, regardless of the shareholder\u2019s or corporation\u2019s understanding months earlier when a particular distribution may have been made. Section 316(a)(2) conditions treating a distribution as a constructive dividend by reference to earnings and profits, and earnings and profits are to be \u201ccomputed as of the close of the taxable year . . . without regard to the amount of the earnings and profits at the time the distribution was made.\u201d A corporation may make a deliberate distribution to a shareholder, with everyone expecting a profitable year and considering the distribution to be a dividend, only to have the shareholder end up liable for no tax if the company closes out its tax year in the red (so long as the shareholder\u2019s basis covers the distribution); when such facts are clear at the time the reporting forms and returns are filed,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the shareholder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>does not violate \u00a7 7201 by paying no tax on the moneys received, intent being beside the point. And since intent to make a distribution a taxable one cannot control, it would be odd to condition nontaxable return-of-capital treatment on contemporaneous intent, when the statute says nothing about intent at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The intent interpretation is strange for another reason, too (a reason in some tension with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s assumption that an unreported distribution without contemporaneous intent to return capital will support a conviction for evasion). The text of \u00a7 301(a) ostensibly provides for all variations of tax treatment of distributions received with respect to a corporation\u2019s stock unless a separate provision of the Code requires otherwise. Yet <em>Miller </em>effectively converts the section into one of merely partial coverage, with the result of leaving one class of distributions in a tax status limbo in criminal cases. That is, while \u00a7 301(a) expressly provides that distributions made by a corporation to a shareholder with respect to its stock \u201cshall be treated in the manner provided in [\u00a7 301(c)],\u201d under <em>Miller, </em>a distribution from a corporation without earnings and profits would fail to be a return of capital for lack of contemporaneous intent to treat it that way; but to the extent that distribution did not exceed the taxpayer\u2019s basis for the stock (and thus become a capital gain), \u00a7 301(a) would leave the distribution unaccounted for.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">It is no answer to say that \u00a7 61(a) of the Code would step in where \u00a7 301(a) has been pushed out. Although \u00a7 61(a) defines gross income, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided,\u201d as \u201call income from whatever source derived,\u201d the plain text of \u00a7 301(a) does provide otherwise for distributions made with respect to stock. So using \u00a7 61(a) as a stopgap would only sanction yet another eccentricity: \u00a7 301(a) would be held not to cover what its text says it \u201cshall\u201d (the class of distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>tions made with respect to stock for which no other more specific provision is made), while \u00a7 61(a) would need to be applied to what by its terms it should not be (a receipt of funds for which tax treatment is \u201cotherwise provided\u201d in \u00a7 301(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The implausibility of a statutory reading that either creates a tax limbo or forces resort to an atextual stopgap is all the clearer from the Ninth Circuit\u2019s discussion in this case of its own understanding of the consequences of Miller\u2019s rule: the court openly acknowledged that \u201cimposing an intent requirement creates a disconnect between civil and criminal liability,\u201d 470 F. 3d, at 934. In construing distribution rules that draw no distinction in terms of criminal or civil consequences, the disparity of treatment assumed by the Court of Appeals counts heavily against its contemporaneous intent construction (quite apart from the Circuit\u2019s understanding that its interpretation entails criminal liability for evasion without any showing of a tax deficiency).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\"><em>Miller </em>erred in requiring a contemporaneous intent to treat the receipt of corporate funds as a return of capital, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals here, relying on <em>Miller, </em>is likewise erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The Government has raised nothing that calls for affirmance in the face of the Court of Appeals\u2019s reliance on <em>Miller. </em>The United States does not defend differential treatment of criminal and civil cases, see Brief for United States 24, and it thus stops short of fully defending the Ninth Circuit\u2019s treatment. The Government\u2019s argument, instead, is that we should affirm under the rule that before any distribution may be treated as a return of capital (or, by a parity of reasoning, a dividend), it must first be distributed to the shareholder \u201cwith respect to . . . stock.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 19 (internal quotation marks omitted). The taxpayer\u2019s intent, the Government says, may be relevant to this limiting condition, and Boul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>ware never expressly claimed any such intent.

The facts in this case have yet to be raked over with the stock ownership condition in mind, since <em>Miller </em>seems to have pretermitted a full consideration of the defensive proffer, and if consideration is to be given to that condition now, the canvas of evidence and Boulware\u2019s proffer should be made by a court familiar with the whole evidentiary record.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">As a more specific version of its \u201cwith respect to ... stock\u201d position, the Government says that the diversions of corporate funds to Boulware were in fact unlawful, see Brief for United States 34-37; see also n. 5, <em>supra, </em>and it argues that \u00a7\u00a7301 and 316(a) are inapplicable to illegal transfers, see Brief for United States 34\u201437; see also <em>D\u2019Agostino, </em>145 F. 3d, at 73 (\u201c[T]he 'no earnings and profits, no income\u2019 rule would not necessarily apply in a case of <em>unlawful </em>diversion, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>as embezzlement, theft, a violation of corporate law, or an attempt to defraud third party creditors\u201d (emphasis in original)); see also n. 8, <em>supra. </em>The Government goes so far as to claim that \u201c[t]he only rational basis for the jury\u2019s judgment was a conclusion that [Boulware] unlawfully diverted the funds.\u201d Brief for United States 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">But we decline to take up the question whether an unlawful diversion may ever be deemed a \u201cdistribution . . . with respect to [a corporation\u2019s] stock,\u201d a question which was not considered by the Ninth Circuit. We do, however, reject the Government\u2019s current characterization of the jury verdict in Boulware\u2019s case. True, the jurors were not moved by Boulware\u2019s suggestion that the diversions were corporate advances or loans, or that he was using the funds for corporate purposes. But the jury was not asked, and cannot be said to have answered, whether Boulware breached any fiduciary duty as a controlling shareholder, unlawfully diverted corporate funds to defraud his wife, or embezzled HIE\u2019s funds outright.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Sections 301 and 316(a) govern the tax consequences of constructive distributions made by a corporation to a shareholder with respect to its stock. A defendant in a criminal tax case does not need to show a contemporaneous intent to treat diversions as returns of capital before relying on those sections to demonstrate no taxes are owed. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the ease is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-9\">A related provision, 26 U.

In that earlier trial, Boulware was also convicted of conspiracy to make false statements to a federally insured financial institution, in violation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 371. The Ninth Circuit affirmed Boulware\u2019s conspiracy conviction that first time around, however, so the present trial did not include a conspiracy charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b686-7\"> Judge Thomas went on to say that the Government would prevail even without <em>Miller\u2019s </em>rule because, in his view, Boulware\u2019s diversions were \u201cunlawful,\u201d and the return-of-eapital rules would not apply to diversions made for unlawful purposes. See 470 F. 3d, at 938-939.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b686-11\"> As noted, the Ninth Circuit holds that \u00a7\u00a7301 and 316(a) are not to be consulted in a criminal tax evasion case until the defendant produces evidence of an intent to treat diverted funds as a return of capital at the time it was made. See 470 F. 3d 931 (2006) (case below). By contrast, the Second Circuit allows a criminal defendant to invoke \u00a7\u00a7301 and 316(a) without evidence of a contemporaneous intent to treat such moneys as returns of capital. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bok, </em>156 F. 3d 157, 162 (1998) (\u201c[I]n return of capital eases, a taxpayer\u2019s intent is not determinative in defining the taxpayer\u2019s conduct\u201d). Meanwhile, the Third, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits arguably have taken the position that \u00a7\u00a7 301 and 316(a) are altogether inapplicable in criminal tax eases involving informal distributions. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>875 F. 2d 846,850-852 (CA11 1989); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>330 F. 2d 30, 38 (CA3 1964); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>226 F. 2d 331, 334-335 (CA6 1955); but see Brief for Petitioner 16 (\u201c[T]hese cases can be read to address the allocation of the burden of proof on the return of capital issue, rather than the applicable substantive principles\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b687-7\"> We have also recognized that \u201c[t]he legal right of a taxpayer to decrease the amount of what otherwise would be his taxes, or altogether avoid them, by means which the law permits, cannot be doubted.\u201d <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Helvering, </em>293 U.

The rule is a two-way street: \u201cwhile a taxpayer is free to organize his affairs as he chooses, nevertheless, once having done so, he must accept the tax consequences of his choice, whether contemplated or not,... and may not enjoy the benefit of some other route he might have chosen to follow but did not,\u201d <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>National Alfalfa Dehydrating &amp; Milling Co., </em>417 U.
