In the <em>Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. </em>v. <em>U. </em>S.), 2004 I. C. J. 12 (Judgment of Mar. 31) <em>(Avena), </em>that tribunal considered a claim brought by Mexico against the United States. The ICJ held that, based on violations of the Vienna Convention, 51 named Mexican nation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>als were entitled to review and reconsideration of their state-court convictions and sentences in the United States. This was so regardless of any forfeiture of the right to raise Vienna Convention claims because of a failure to comply with generally applicable state rules governing challenges to criminal convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">In <em>Sanchez-Llamas </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>548 U. S. 331 (2006) \u2014 issued after <em>Avena </em>but involving individuals who were not named in the <em>Avena </em>judgment \u2014 we held that, contrary to the ICJ's determination, the Vienna Convention did not preclude the application of state default rules. After the <em>Avena </em>decision, President George W. Bush determined, through a Memorandum for the Attorney General (Feb. 28, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert. 187a (Memorandum or President\u2019s Memorandum), that the United States would \u201cdischarge its international obligations\u201d under <em>Avena </em>\u201cby having State courts give effect to the decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Petitioner Jos\u00e9 Ernesto Medellin, who had been convicted and sentenced in Texas state court for murder, is one of the 51 Mexican nationals named in the <em>Avena </em>decision. Relying on the ICJ\u2019s decision and the President's Memorandum, Medellin filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in state court. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed Medellin\u2019s application as an abuse of the writ under state law, given Medellin\u2019s failure to raise his Vienna Convention claim in a timely manner under state law. We granted certiorari to decide two questions. <em>First, </em>is the ICJ\u2019s judgment in <em>Avena </em>directly enforceable as domestic law in a state court in the United States? <em>Second, </em>does the President\u2019s Memorandum independently require the States to provide review and reconsideration of the claims of the 51 Mexican nationals named in <em>Avena </em>without regard to state procedural default rules? We conclude that neither <em>Avena </em>nor the President\u2019s Memorandum constitutes directly enforceable federal law that pre-empts state limitations on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>filing of successive habeas petitions. We therefore affirm the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">In 1969, the United States, upon the advice and consent of the Senate, ratified the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention or Convention), Apr. 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U. S. T. 77, T. I. A. S. No. 6820, and the Optional Protocol Concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes to the Vienna Convention (Optional Protocol or Protocol), Apr. 24,1963, [1970] 21 U. S. T. 325, T. I. A. S. No. 6820. The preamble to the Convention provides that its purpose is to \u201ccontribute to the development of friendly relations among nations.\u201d 21 U. S. T., at 79; <em>Sanchez-Llamas, supra, </em>at 337. Toward that end, Article 36 of the Convention was drafted to \u201cfacilitat[e] the exercise of consular functions.\u201d Art. 36(1), 21 U. S. T., at 100. It provides that if a person detained by a foreign country \u201cso requests, the competent authorities of the receiving State shall, without delay, inform the consular post of the sending State\u201d of such detention, and \u201cinform the [detainee] of his righ[t]\u201d to request assistance from the consul of his own state. Art. 36(l)(b), <em>id., </em>at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">The Optional Protocol provides a venue for the resolution of disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the Vienna Convention. Art. I, 21 U. S. T., at 326. Under the Protocol, such disputes \u201cshall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice\u201d and \u201cmay accordingly be brought before the [ICJ]... by any party to the dispute being a Party to the present Protocol.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">The IC J is \u201cthe principal judicial organ of the United Nations.\u201d United Nations Charter, Art. 92, 59 Stat. 1051, T. S. No. 993 (1945). It was established in 1945 pursuant to the United Nations Charter. The ICJ Statute \u2014 annexed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>U. N. Charter \u2014 provides the organizational framework and governing procedures for cases brought before the ICJ. Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ Statute), 59 Stat. 1055, T. S. No. 993 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Under Article 94(1) of the U. N. Charter, \u201c[e]ach Member of the United Nations undertakes to comply with the decision of the [ICJ] in any case to which it is a party.\u201d 59 Stat. 1051. The ICJ\u2019s jurisdiction in any particular case, however, is dependent upon the consent of the parties. See Art. 36, <em>id., </em>at 1060. The ICJ Statute delineates two ways in which a nation may consent to ICJ jurisdiction: It may consent generally to jurisdiction on any question arising under a treaty or general international law, Art. 36(2), <em>ibid., </em>or it may consent specifically to jurisdiction over a particular category of cases or disputes pursuant to a separate treaty, Art. 36(1), <em>ibid. </em>The United States originally consented to the general jurisdiction of the ICJ when it filed a declaration recognizing compulsory jurisdiction under Art. 36(2) in 1946. The United States withdrew from general ICJ jurisdiction in 1985. See U. S. Dept, of State Letter and Statement Concerning Termination of Acceptance of ICJ Compulsory Jurisdiction (Oct. 7, 1985), reprinted in 24 I. L. M. 1742 (1985). By ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention, the United States consented to the specific jurisdiction of the ICJ with respect to claims arising out of the Vienna Convention. On March 7, 2005, subsequent to the ICJ\u2019s judgment in <em>Avena, </em>the United States gave notice of withdrawal from the Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention. Letter from Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State, to Kofi A. Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Petitioner Jos\u00e9 Ernesto Medellin, a Mexican national, has lived in the United States since preschool. A member of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>\u201cBlack and Whites\u201d gang, Medellin was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in Texas for the gang rape and brutal murders of two Houston teenagers.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">On June 24,1993,14-year-old Jennifer Ertman and 16-year-old Elizabeth Pena were walking home when they encountered Medellin and several fellow gang members. Medellin attempted to engage Elizabeth in conversation. When she tried to run, petitioner threw her to the ground. Jennifer was grabbed by other gang members when she, in response to her friend\u2019s cries, ran back to help. The gang members raped both girls for over an hour. Then, to prevent their victims from identifying them, Medellin and his fellow gang members murdered the girls and discarded their bodies in a wooded area. Medellin was personally responsible for strangling at least one of the girls with her own shoelace.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Medellin was arrested at approximately 4 a.m. on June 29, 1993. A few hours later, between 5:54 and 7:23 a.m., Medellin was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings; he then signed a written waiver and gave a detailed written confession. App. to Brief for Respondent 32-36. Local law enforcement officers did not, however, inform Medellin of his Vienna Convention right to notify the Mexican consulate of his detention. Brief for Petitioner 6-7. Medellin was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death; his conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. <em>Medell\u00ecn </em>v. <em>State, </em>No. 71,997 (Tex. Crim. App., May 16, 1997), App. to Brief for Respondent 2-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Medellin first raised his Vienna Convention claim in his first application for state postconviction relief. The state trial court held that the claim was procedurally defaulted because Medellin had failed to raise it at trial or on direct review. The trial court also rejected the Vienna Convention claim on the merits, finding that Medellin had \u201cfail[ed] to show that any non-notification of the Mexican authorities im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>pacted on the validity of his conviction or punishment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 62.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. <em>Id., </em>at 64-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Medellin then filed a habeas petition in Federal District Court. The District Court denied relief, holding that Medellin\u2019s Vienna Convention claim was procedurally defaulted and that Medellin had failed to show prejudice arising from the Vienna Convention violation. See <em>Medellin </em>v. <em>Cockrell, </em>Civ. Action No. H-01-4078 (SD Tex., June 26, 2003), App. to Brief for Respondent 66, 86-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">While Medellin\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability was pending in the Fifth Circuit, the ICJ issued its decision in <em>Avena. </em>The ICJ held that the United States had violated Article 36(l)(b) of the Vienna Convention by failing to inform the 51 named Mexican nationals, including Medellin, of their Vienna Convention rights. 2004 I. C. J., at 53-55. In the ICJ\u2019s determination, the United States was obligated \u201cto provide, by means of its own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>[affected] Mexican nationals.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 72, \u00b6 153(9). The ICJ indicated that such review was required without regard to state procedural default rules. <em>Id., </em>at 56-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The Fifth Circuit denied a certificate of appealability. <em>Medell\u00edn </em>v. <em>Dretke, </em>371 F. 3d 270, 281 (2004). The court concluded that the Vienna Convention did not confer individually enforceable rights. <em>Id., </em>at 280. The court further ruled that it was in any event bound by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Breard </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>523 U. S. 371, 375 (1998) <em>(per curiam), </em>which held that Vienna Convention claims are subject to procedural default rules, rather than by the ICJ\u2019s contrary decision in <em>Avena. </em>371 F. 3d, at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">This Court granted certiorari. <em>Medell\u00edn </em>v. <em>Dretke, </em>544 U. S. 660, 661 (2005) <em>(per curiam) (Medell\u00edn I). </em>Before we heard oral argument, however, President George W. Bush issued his Memorandum for the United States Attorney General, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">\u201cI have determined, pursuant to the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, that the United States will discharge its international obligations under the decision of the International Court of Justice in <em>[Avena], </em>by having State courts give effect to the decision in accordance with general principles of comity in cases filed by the 51 Mexican nationals addressed in that decision.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 187a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Medellin, relying on the President\u2019s Memorandum and the ICJ\u2019s decision in <em>Avena, </em>filed a second application for habeas relief in state court. <em>Ex parte Medell\u00edn, </em>223 S. W. 3d 315, 322-323 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). Because the state-court proceedings might have provided Medellin with the review and reconsideration he requested, and because his claim for federal relief might otherwise have been barred, we dismissed his petition for certiorari as improvidently granted. <em>Medell\u00edn I, supra, </em>at 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals subsequently dismissed Medellin\u2019s second state habeas application as an abuse of the writ. 223 S. W. 3d, at 352. In the court\u2019s view, neither the <em>Avena </em>decision nor the President\u2019s Memorandum was \u201cbinding federal law\u201d that could displace the State\u2019s limitations on the filing of successive habeas applications. 223 S. W. 3d, at 352. We again granted certiorari. 550 U. S. 917 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Medellin first contends that the ICJ\u2019s judgment in <em>Avena </em>constitutes a \u201cbinding\u201d obligation on the state and federal courts of the United States. He argues that \u201cby virtue of the Supremacy Clause, the treaties requiring compliance with the <em>Avena </em>judgment are <em>already </em>the \u2018Law of the Land\u2019 by which all state and federal courts in this country are \u2018bound.\u2019\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 1. Accordingly, Medellin argues, <em>Avena </em>is a binding federal rule of decision that pre-empts contrary state limitations on successive habeas petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">No one disputes that the <em>Avena </em>decision \u2014 a decision that flows from the treaties through which the United States submitted to IC J jurisdiction with respect to Vienna Convention disputes \u2014 constitutes an <em>international </em>law obligation on the part of the United States. But not all international law obligations automatically constitute binding federal law enforceable in United States courts. The question we confront here is whether the <em>Avena </em>judgment has automatic <em>domestic </em>legal effect such that the judgment of its own force applies in state and federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">This Court has long recognized the distinction between treaties that automatically have effect as domestic law, and those that \u2014 while they constitute international law commitments \u2014 do not by. themselves function as binding federal law. The distinction was well explained by Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s opinion in <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Neilson, </em>2 Pet. 253, 315 (1829), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>overruled on other grounds, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perckeman, </em>7 Pet. 51 (1833), which held that a treaty is \u201cequivalent to an act of the legislature,\u201d and hence self-executing, when it \u201coperates of itself without the aid of any legislative provision.\u201d <em>Foster, supra, </em>at 314. When, in contrast, \u201c[treaty] stipulations are not self-executing they can only be enforced pursuant to legislation to carry them into effect.\u201d <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>124 U. S. 190, 194 (1888). In sum, while treaties \u201cmay comprise international commitments . . . they are not domestic law unless Congress has either enacted implementing statutes or the treaty itself conveys an intention that it be \u2018self-executing\u2019 and is ratified on these terms.\u201d <em>Igart\u00faa-De La Rosa </em>v. <em>United States, </em>417 F. 3d 145, 150 (CA1 2005) (en banc) (Boudin, C. J.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">A treaty is, of course, \u201cprimarily a compact between independent nations.\u201d <em>Head Money Cases, </em>112 U. S. 580, 598 (1884). It ordinarily \u201cdepends for the enforcement of its provisions on the interest and the honor of the governments which are parties to it.\u201d Ibid.; see also The Federalist No. 33, p. 207 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (comparing laws that individuals are \u201cbound to observe\u201d as \u201cthe <em>supreme law </em>of the land\u201d with \u201ca mere treaty, dependent on the good faith of the parties\u201d). \u201cIf these [interests] fail, its infraction becomes the subject of international negotiations and reclamations .... It is obvious that with all this the judicial courts have nothing to do and can give no redress.\u201d <em>Head Money Cases, supra, </em>at 598. Only \u201c[i]f the treaty contains stipulations which are self-executing, that is, require no legislation to make them operative, [will] they have the force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>and effect of a legislative enactment.\u201d <em>Whitney, supra, </em>at 194.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Medellin and his <em>amici </em>nonetheless contend that the Optional Protocol, U. N. Charter, and ICJ Statute supply the \u201crelevant obligation\u201d to give the <em>Avena </em>judgment binding effect in the domestic courts of the United States. Reply Brief for Petitioner 5-6.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because none of these treaty sources creates binding federal law in the absence of implementing legislation, and because it is uncontested that no such legislation exists, we conclude that the <em>Avena </em>judgment is not automatically binding domestic law.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">The interpretation of a treaty, like the interpretation of a statute, begins with its text. <em>Air France </em>v. <em>Saks, </em>470 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>U. S. 392, 396-397 (1985). Because a treaty ratified by the United States is \u201can agreement among sovereign powers,\u201d we have also considered as \u201caids to its interpretation\u201d the negotiation and drafting history of the treaty as well as \u201cthe postratification understanding\u201d of signatory nations. <em>Zicherman </em>v. <em>Korean Air Lines Co., </em>516 U. S. 217, 226 (1996); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stuart, </em>489 U. S. 353, 365-366 (1989); <em>Choctaw Nation </em>v. <em>United States, </em>318 U. S. 423, 431-432 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">As a signatory to the Optional Protocol, the United States agreed to submit disputes arising out of the Vienna Convention to the ICJ. The Protocol provides: \u201cDisputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the [Vienna] Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.\u201d Art. I, 21 U. S. T., at 326. Of course, submitting to jurisdiction and agreeing to be bound are two different things. A party could, for example, agree to compulsory nonbinding arbitration. Such an agreement would require the party to appear before the arbitral tribunal without obligating the party to treat the tribunal\u2019s decision as binding. See, <em>e. g., </em>North American Free Trade Agreement, U. S.-Can.-Mex., Art. 2018(1), Dec. 17, 1992, 32 I. L. M. 605, 697 (1993) (\u201cOn receipt of the final report of [the arbitral panel requested by a Party to the agreement], the disputing Parties shall agree on the resolution of the dispute, which normally shall conform with the determinations and recommendations of the panel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The most natural reading of the Optional Protocol is as a bare grant of jurisdiction. It provides only that \u201c[disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the [Vienna] Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice\u201d and \u201cmay accordingly be brought before the [ICJ] ... by any party to the dispute being a Party to the present Protocol.\u201d Art. I, 21 U. S. T., at 326. The Protocol says nothing about the effect of an ICJ decision and does not itself commit signatories to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>comply with an ICJ judgment. The Protocol is similarly silent as to any enforcement mechanism.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The obligation on the part of signatory nations to comply with ICJ judgments derives not from the Optional Protocol, but rather from Article 94 of the U. N. Charter \u2014 the provision that specifically addresses the effect of ICJ decisions. Article 94(1) provides that \u201c[e]ach Member of the United Nations <em>undertakes to comply </em>with the decision of the [ICJ] in any case to which it is a party.\u201d 59 Stat. 1051 (emphasis added). The Executive Branch contends that the phrase \u201cundertakes to comply\u201d is not \u201can acknowledgement that an ICJ decision will have immediate legal effect in the courts of U. N. members,\u201d but rather \u201ca <em>commitment </em>on the part of U. N. members to <em>take future </em>action through their political branches to comply with an ICJ decision.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>in <em>Medell\u00edn I, </em>O. T. 2004, No. 04-5928, p. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">We agree with this construction of Article 94. The Article is not a directive to domestic courts. It does not provide that the United States \u201cshall\u201d or \u201cmust\u201d comply with an ICJ decision, nor indicate that the Senate that ratified the U. N. Charter intended to vest ICJ decisions with immediate legal effect in domestic courts. Instead, \u201c[t]he words of Article 94 ... call upon governments to take certain action.\u201d <em>Committee of United States Citizens Living in Nicaragua </em>v. <em>Reagan, </em>859 F. 2d 929, 938 (CADC 1988) (quoting <em>Diggs </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>555 F. 2d 848, 851 (CADC 1976); internal quotation marks omitted).

In other words, the U. N.

N. Charter\u2019s provision of an express diplomatic\u2014 that is, nonjudicial \u2014 remedy is itself evidence that ICJ judgments were not meant to be enforceable in domestic courts. See <em>Sanchez-Llamas, </em>548 U. S., at 347. And even this \u201cquintessentially <em>international </em>remed[y],\u201d <em>id., </em>at 355, is not absolute. First, the Security Council must \u201cdee[m] necessary\u201d the issuance of a recommendation or measure to effectuate the judgment. Art. 94(2), 59 Stat. 1051. Second, as the President and Senate were undoubtedly aware in subscribing to the U. N. Charter and Optional Protocol, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>United States retained the unqualified right to exercise its veto of any Security Council resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">This was the understanding of the Executive Branch when the President agreed to the U. N. Charter and the declaration accepting general compulsory ICJ jurisdiction. See, <em>e. g., </em>The Charter of the United Nations for the Maintenance of International Peace and Security: Hearings before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 124-125 (1945) (\u201c[I]f a state fails to perform its obligations under a judgment of the [ICJ], the other party may have recourse to the Security Council\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 286 (statement of Leo Pasvolsky, Special Assistant to the Secretary of State for International Organizations and Security Affairs) (\u201c[W]hen the Court has rendered a judgment and one of the parties refuses to accept it, then the dispute becomes political rather than legal. It is as a political dispute that the matter is referred to the Security Council\u201d); A Resolution Proposing Acceptance of Compulsory Jurisdiction of International Court of Justice: Hearings on S. Res. 196 before the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 142 (1946) (statement of Charles Fahy, State Dept. Legal Adviser) (while parties that accept ICJ jurisdiction have \u201ca moral obligation\u201d to comply with ICJ decisions, Article 94(2) provides the exclusive means of enforcement).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">If ICJ judgments were instead regarded as automatically enforceable domestic law, they would be immediately and directly binding on state and federal courts pursuant to the Supremacy Clause. Mexico or the ICJ would have no need to proceed to the Security Council to enforce the judgment in this case. Noncompliance with an ICJ judgment through exercise of the Security Council veto \u2014 always regarded as an option by the Executive and ratifying Senate during and after consideration of the U. N. Charter, Optional Protocol, and ICJ Statute \u2014 would no longer be a viable alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>There would be nothing to veto. In light of the U. N. Charter\u2019s remedial scheme, there is no reason to believe that the President and Senate signed up for such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">In sum, Medellin\u2019s view that ICJ decisions are automatically enforceable as domestic law is fatally undermined by the enforcement structure established by Article 94. His construction would eliminate the option of noncompliance contemplated by Article 94(2), undermining the ability of the political branches to determine whether and how to comply with an ICJ judgment. Those sensitive foreign policy decisions would instead be transferred to state and federal courts charged with applying an ICJ judgment directly as domestic law. And those courts would not be empowered to decide whether to comply with the judgment \u2014 again, always regarded as an option by the political branches \u2014 any more than courts may consider whether to comply with any other species of domestic law. This result would be particularly anomalous in light of the principle that \u201c[t]he conduct of the foreign relations of our Government is committed by the Constitution to the Executive and Legislative \u2014 \u2018the political\u2019 \u2014 Departments.\u201d <em>Oetjen </em>v. <em>Central Leather Co., </em>246 U. S. 297, 302 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The ICJ Statute, incorporated into the U. N. Charter, provides further evidence that the ICJ\u2019s judgment in <em>Avena </em>does not automatically constitute federal law judicially enforceable in United States courts. Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062. To begin with, the ICJ\u2019s \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d is said to be to \u201carbitrate particular disputes between national governments.\u201d <em>Sanchez-Llamas, supra, </em>at 355 (citing 59 Stat. 1055). Accordingly, the ICJ can hear disputes only between nations, not individuals. Art. 34(1), <em>id., </em>at 1059 (\u201cOnly states <em>[i. e., </em>countries] may be parties in cases before the [ICJ]\u201d). More important, Article 59 of the statute provides that \u201c[t]he decision of the [ICJ] has <em>no binding force </em>except between the parties and in respect of that particular case.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>Id., </em>at 1062 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The dissent does not explain how Medellin, an individual, can be a party to the ICJ proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Medellin argues that because the <em>Avena </em>case involves him, it is clear that he \u2014 and the 50 other Mexican nationals named in the <em>Avena </em>decision \u2014 should be regarded as parties to the <em>Avena </em>judgment. Brief for Petitioner 21-22. But cases before the ICJ are often precipitated by disputes involving particular persons or entities, disputes that a nation elects to take up as its own. See, <em>e. g., Case Concerning the Barcelona Traction, Light &amp; Power Co. (Belg. </em>v. <em>Spain), </em>1970 I. C. J. 3 (Judgment of Feb. 5) (claim brought by Belgium <em>on </em>behalf of Belgian nationals and shareholders); <em>Case Concerning the Protection of French Nationals and Protected Persons in Egypt (Fr. v.

K. </em>v. <em>Iran), </em>1952 I. C. J. 93, 112 (Judgment of July 22) (claim brought by the United Kingdom on behalf of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company). That has never been understood to alter the express and established rules that only nation-states may be parties before the ICJ, Art. 34, 59 Stat. 1059, and \u2014 contrary to the position of the dissent, <em>post, </em>at 559 \u2014 that ICJ judgments are binding only between those parties, Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>It is, moreover, well settled that the United States\u2019 interpretation of a treaty \u201cis entitled to great weight.\u201d <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Avagliano, </em>457 U.

The Executive Branch has unfailingly adhered to its view that the relevant treaties do not create domestically enforceable federal law. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>4, 27-29.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The pertinent international agreements, therefore, do not provide for implementation of ICJ judgments through direct enforcement in domestic courts, and \u201cwhere a treaty does not provide a particular remedy, either expressly or implicitly, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>is not for the federal courts to impose one on the States through lawmaking of their own.\u201d <em>Sanchez-Llamas, </em>548 U. S., at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The dissent faults our analysis because it \u201clooks for the wrong thing (explicit textual expression about self-execution) using the wrong standard (clarity) in the wrong place (the treaty language).\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 562. Given our obligation to interpret treaty provisions to determine whether they are self-executing, we have to confess that we do think it rather important to look to the treaty language to see what it has to say about the issue. That is after all what the Senate looks to in deciding whether to approve the treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The interpretive approach employed by the Court today\u2014 resorting to the text \u2014 is hardly novel. In two early cases involving an 1819 land-grant treaty between Spain and the United States, Chief Justice Marshall found the language of the treaty dispositive. In <em>Foster, </em>after distinguishing between self-executing treaties (those \u201cequivalent to an act of the legislature\u201d) and non-self-executing treaties (those \u201cthe legislature must execute\u201d), Chief Justice Marshall held that the 1819 treaty was non-self-executing. 2 Pet., at 314. Four years later, the Supreme Court considered another claim under the same treaty, but concluded that the treaty was self-executing. See <em>Percheman, </em>7 Pet., at 87. The reason was not because the treaty was sometimes self-executing and sometimes not, but because \u201cthe language of\u201d the Spanish translation (brought to the Court's attention for the first time) indicated the parties' intent to ratify and confirm the land grant \u201cby force of the instrument itself.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">As against this time-honored textual approach, the dissent proposes a multifactor, judgment-by-judgment analysis that would \u201cjettiso[n] relative predictability for the open-ended rough-and-tumble of factors.\u201d <em>Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. </em>v. <em>Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co., </em>513 U. S. 527, 547 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The dissent\u2019s novel approach to deciding which (or, more accurately, when) treaties give rise to directly enforceable federal law is arrestingly indeterminate. Treaty language is barely probative. <em>Post, </em>at 549 (\u201c[T]he absence or presence of language in a treaty about a provision\u2019s self-execution proves nothing at all\u201d). Determining whether treaties themselves create federal law is sometimes committed to the political branches and sometimes to the judiciary. <em>Post, </em>at 549-550. Of those committed to the judiciary, the courts pick and choose which shall be binding United States law\u2014 trumping not only state but other federal law as well \u2014 and which shall not. <em>Post, </em>at 550-562. They do this on the basis of a multifactor, \u201ccontext-specific\u201d inquiry. <em>Post, </em>at 549. Even then, the same treaty sometimes gives rise to United States law and sometimes does not, again depending on an ad hoc judicial assessment. <em>Post, </em>at 550-562.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Our Framers established a careful set of procedures that must be followed before federal law can be created under the Constitution \u2014 vesting that decision in the political branches, subject to checks and balances. U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 7. They also recognized that treaties could create federal law, but again through the political branches, with the President making the treaty and the Senate approving it. Art. II, \u00a7 2. The dissent\u2019s understanding of the treaty route, depending on an ad hoc judgment of the judiciary without looking to the treaty language \u2014 the very language negotiated by the President and approved by the Senate \u2014 cannot readily be ascribed to those same Framers.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The dissent\u2019s approach risks the United States\u2019 involvement in international agreements. It is hard to believe that the United States would enter into treaties that are sometimes enforceable and sometimes not. Such a treaty would be the equivalent of writing a blank check to the judiciary. Senators could never be quite sure what the treaties on which they were voting meant. Only a judge could say for sure and only at some future date. This uncertainty could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>hobble the United States\u2019 efforts to negotiate and sign international agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">In this case, the dissent \u2014 for a grab bag of no less than seven reasons \u2014 would tell us that this <em>particular </em>ICJ judgment is federal law. <em>Post, </em>at 549-562. That is no sort of guidance. Nor is it any answer to say that the federal courts will diligently police international agreements and enforce the decisions of international tribunals only when they <em>should be </em>enforced. <em>Ibid. </em>The point of a non-self-executing treaty is that it \u201caddresses itself to the political, <em>not </em>the judicial department; and the legislature must execute the contract before it can become a rule for the Court.\u201d <em>Foster, supra, </em>at 314 (emphasis added); <em>Whitney, </em>124 U. S., at 195. See also <em>Foster, supra, </em>at 307 (\u201cThe judiciary is not that department <em>of </em>the government, to which the assertion of its interests against foreign powers is confided\u201d). The dissent\u2019s contrary approach would assign to the courts \u2014 not the political branches \u2014 the primary role in deciding when and how international agreements will be enforced. To read a treaty so that it sometimes has the effect of domestic law and sometimes does not is tantamount to vesting with the judiciary the power not only to interpret but also to create the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Our conclusion that <em>Avena </em>does not by itself constitute binding federal law is confirmed by the \u201cpostratification understanding\u201d of signatory nations. See <em>Zicherman, </em>516 U. S., at 226. There are currently 47 nations that are parties to the Optional Protocol and 171 nations that are parties to the Vienna Convention. Yet neither Medellin nor his <em>amici </em>have identified a single nation that treats ICJ judgments as binding in domestic courts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In determining that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Vienna Convention did not require certain relief in United States courts in <em>Sanchez-Llamas, </em>we found it pertinent that the requested relief would not be available under the treaty in any other signatory country. See 548 U. S., at 343-344, and n. 3. So too here the lack of any basis for supposing that any other country would treat ICJ judgments as directly enforceable as a matter of its domestic law strongly suggests that the treaty should not be so viewed in our courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Our conclusion is further supported by general principles of interpretation. To begin with, we reiterated in <em>Sanchez-Llamas </em>what we held in <em>Breard, </em>that \u201c \u2018absent a clear and express statement to the contrary, the procedural rules of the forum State govern the implementation of the treaty in that State.\u2019 \u201d 548 U. S., at 351 (quoting <em>Breard, </em>523 U. S., at 375). Given that ICJ judgments may interfere with state procedural rules, one would expect the ratifying parties to the relevant treaties to have clearly stated their intent to give those judgments domestic effect, if they had so intended. Here there is no statement in the Optional Protocol, the U. N. Charter, or the ICJ Statute that supports the notion that ICJ judgments displace state procedural rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Moreover, the consequences of Medellin\u2019s argument give pause. An ICJ judgment, the argument goes, is not only binding domestic law but is also unassailable. As a result, neither Texas nor this Court may look behind a judgment and quarrel with its reasoning or result. (We already know, from <em>Sanchez-Llamas, </em>that this Court disagrees with both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>the reasoning and result in <em>Avena.) </em>Medellin\u2019s interpretation would allow ICJ judgments to override otherwise binding state law; there is nothing in his logic that would exempt contrary federal law from the same fate. See, <em>e. g., Cook </em>v. <em>United States, </em>288 U. S. 102, 119 (1933) (later-in-time self-executing treaty supersedes a federal statute if there is a conflict). And there is nothing to prevent the ICJ from ordering state courts to annul criminal convictions and sentences, for any reason deemed sufficient by the ICJ. Indeed, that is precisely the relief Mexico requested. <em>Avena, </em>2004 I. C.J., at 58-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Even the dissent flinches at reading the relevant treaties to give rise to self-executing ICJ judgments in all cases. It admits that \u201cCongress is unlikely to authorize automatic judicial enforceability of <em>all </em>ICJ judgments, for that could include some politically sensitive judgments and others better suited for enforcement by other branches.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 560. Our point precisely. But the lesson to draw from that insight is hardly that the judiciary should decide which judgments are politically sensitive and which are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">In short, and as we observed in <em>Sanchez-Llamas, </em>\u201c[n]othing in the structure or purpose of the ICJ suggests that its interpretations were intended to be conclusive on our courts.\u201d 548 U. S., at 354. Given that holding, it is difficult to see how that same structure and purpose can establish, as Medellin argues, that <em>judgments </em>of the ICJ nonetheless were intended to be conclusive on our courts. A judgment is binding only if there is a rule of law that makes it so. And the question whether ICJ judgments can bind domestic courts depends upon the same analysis undertaken in <em>Sanchez-Llamas </em>and set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Our prior decisions identified by the dissent as holding a number of treaties to be self-executing, see <em>post, </em>at 545-546, and Appendix A, stand only for the unremarkable proposition that some international agreements are self-executing and others are not. It is well settled that the \u201c[ijnterpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>tion of [a treaty]... must, of course, begin with the language of the Treaty itself.\u201d <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc., </em>457 U. S., at 180. As a result, we have held treaties to be self-executing when the textual provisions indicate that the President and Senate intended for the agreement to have domestic effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">Medellin and the dissent cite <em>Comegys </em>v. <em>Vasse, </em>1 Pet. 193 (1828), for the proposition that the judgments of international tribunals are automatically binding on domestic courts. See <em>post, </em>at 546; Reply Brief for Petitioner 2; Brief for Petitioner 19-20. That case, of course, involved a different treaty than the ones at issue here; it stands only for the modest principle that the terms of a treaty control the outcome of a case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We do not suggest that treaties can never afford binding domestic effect to international tribunal judgments \u2014 only that the U. N. Charter, the Optional Protocol, and the ICJ Statute do not do so. And whether the treaties underlying a judgment are self-executing so that the judgment is directly enforceable as domestic law in our courts is, of course, a matter for this Court to decide. See <em>Sanchez-Llamas, supra, </em>at 353-354.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Our holding does not call into question the ordinary enforcement of foreign judgments or international arbitral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>agreements. Indeed, we agree with Medellin that, as a general matter, \u201can agreement to abide by the result\u201d of an international adjudication \u2014 or what he really means, an agreement to give the result of such adjudication domestic legal effect \u2014 can be a treaty obligation like any other, so long as the agreement is consistent with the Constitution. See Brief for Petitioner 20. The point is that the particular treaty obligations on which Medellin relies do not of their own force create domestic law.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The dissent worries that our decision casts doubt on some 70-odd treaties under which the United States has agreed to submit disputes to the ICJ according to \u201croughly similar\u201d provisions. See post, at 540-541, 552-553. Again, under our established precedent, some treaties are self-executing and some are not, depending on the treaty. That the judgment of an international tribunal might not automatically become domestic law hardly means the underlying treaty is \u201cuseless.\u201d See post, at 553; cf. post, at 548 (describing the British system in which treaties \u201cvirtually always requir[e] parliamentary legislation\u201d). Such judgments would still constitute international obligations, the proper subject of political and diplomatic negotiations. See <em>Head Money Cases, </em>112 U. S., at 598. And Congress could elect to give them wholesale effect (rather than the judgment-by-judgment approach hypothesized by the dissent, <em>post, </em>at 560) through implementing legislation, as it regularly has. See, <em>e. g., </em>Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, \u00a7 2242, 112 Stat. 2681-822, note following 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1231 (directing the \u201cappropriate agencies\u201d to \u201cprescribe regulations to implement the obligations of the United States under Article 3\u201d of the Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment); see also <em>infra, </em>at 521-522 (listing examples of legislation implementing international obligations).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Further, that an ICJ judgment may not be automatically enforceable in domestic courts does not mean the particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>underlying treaty is not. Indeed, we have held that a number of the \u201cFriendship, Commerce, and Navigation\u201d Treaties cited by the dissent, see Appendix B, <em>post, </em>are self-executing \u2014 based on \u201cthe language of the[se] Treaties].\u201d See <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc., supra, </em>at 180, 189-190. In <em>Kolovrat </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>366 U. S. 187, 191, 196 (1961), for example, the Court found that Yugoslavian claimants denied inheritance under Oregon law were entitled to inherit personal property pursuant to an 1881 Treaty of Friendship, Navigation, and Commerce between the United States and Serbia. See also <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>331 U. S. 503, 507-511, 517-518 (1947) (finding that the right to inherit real property granted German aliens under the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Consular Rights with Germany prevailed over California law). Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, see <em>post, </em>at 547, neither our approach nor our cases require that a treaty provide for self-execution in so many talismanic words; that is a caricature of the Court\u2019s opinion. Our cases simply require courts to decide whether a treaty\u2019s terms reflect a determination by the President who negotiated it and the Senate that confirmed it that the treaty has domestic effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In addition, Congress is up to the task of implementing non-self-executing treaties, even those involving complex commercial disputes. Cf. <em>post, </em>at 560 (Breyer, J., dissenting). The judgments of a number of international tribunals enjoy a different status because of implementing legislation enacted by Congress. See, <em>e. g., </em>22 U. S. C. \u00a7 1650a(a) (\u201cAn award of an arbitral tribunal rendered pursuant to chapter IV of the [Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes] shall create a right arising under a treaty of the United States. The pecuniary obligations imposed by such an award shall be enforced and shall be given the same full faith and credit as if the award were a final judgment of a court of general jurisdiction of one of the several States\u201d); 9 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-208 (\u201cThe [U. N.] Convention on the Recogni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>tion and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of June 10,1958, shall be enforced in United States courts in accordance with this chapter,\u201d \u00a7201). Such language demonstrates that Congress knows how to accord domestic effect to international obligations when it desires such a result.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Further, Medellin frames his argument as though giving the <em>Avena </em>judgment binding effect in domestic courts simply conforms to the proposition that domestic courts generally give effect to foreign judgments. But Medellin does not ask us to enforce a foreign-court judgment settling a typical commercial or property dispute. See, <em>e. g., Hilton </em>v. <em>Guyot, </em>159 U. S. 113 (1895); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arredondo, </em>6 Pet. 691 (1832); see also Uniform Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act \u00a7 1(2), 13 U. L. A., pt. 2, p. 44 (2002) (\u201c \u2018[FJoreign judgment\u2019 means any judgment of a foreign state granting or denying recovery of a sum of money\u201d). Rather, Medellin argues that the <em>Avena </em>judgment has the effect of enjoining the operation of state law. What is more, on Medellin\u2019s view, the judgment would force the State to take action to \u201creview and reconside[r]\u201d his case. The general rule, however, is that judgments of foreign courts awarding injunctive relief, even as to private parties, let alone sovereign States, \u201care not generally entitled to enforcement.\u201d See 1 Restatement \u00a7 481, Comment <em>b, </em>at 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">In sum, while the ICJ\u2019s judgment in <em>Avena </em>creates an international law obligation on the part of the United States, it does not of its own force constitute binding federal law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>that pre-empts state restrictions on the filing of successive habeas petitions. As we noted in <em>Sanchez-Llamas, </em>a contrary conclusion would be extraordinary, given that basic rights guaranteed by our own Constitution do not have the effect of displacing state procedural rules. See 548 U. S., at 360. Nothing in the text, background, negotiating and drafting history, or practice among signatory nations suggests that the President or Senate intended the improbable result of giving the judgments of an international tribunal a higher status than that enjoyed by \u201cmany of our most fundamental constitutional protections.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Medellin next argues that the ICJ\u2019s judgment in <em>Avena </em>is binding on state courts by virtue of the President\u2019s February 28, 2005 Memorandum. The United States contends that while the <em>Avena </em>judgment does not of its own force require domestic courts to set aside ordinary rules of procedural default, that judgment became the law of the land with precisely that effect pursuant to the President\u2019s Memorandum and his power \u201cto establish binding rules of decision that preempt contrary state law.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>5. Accordingly, we must decide whether the President\u2019s declaration alters our conclusion that the <em>Avena </em>judgment is not a rule of domestic law binding in state and federal courts.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">The United States maintains that the President\u2019s constitutional role \u201cuniquely qualifies\u201d him to resolve the sensitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>foreign policy decisions that bear on compliance with an IC J decision and \u201cto do so expeditiously.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>11, 12. We do not question these propositions. See, <em>e. g., First Nat. City Bank </em>v. <em>Banco Nacional de Cuba, </em>406 U. S. 759, 767 (1972) (plurality opinion) (The President has \u201cthe lead role ... in foreign policy\u201d); <em>American Ins. Assn. </em>v. <em>Garamendi, </em>539 U.

S. 579, 610-611 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring))). In this case, the President seeks to vindicate United States interests in ensuring the reciprocal observance of the Vienna Convention, protecting relations with foreign governments, and demonstrating commitment to the role of international law. These interests are plainly compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Such considerations, however, do not allow us to set aside first principles. The President\u2019s authority to act, as with the exercise of any governmental power, \u201cmust stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.\u201d <em>Youngstown, supra, </em>at 585; <em>Dames &amp; Moore </em>v. <em>Regan, </em>453 U. S. 654, 668 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Justice Jackson\u2019s familiar tripartite scheme provides the accepted framework for evaluating executive action in this area. First, \u201c[wjhen the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate.\u201d <em>Youngstown, </em>343 U. S., at 635 (concurring opinion). Second, \u201c[w]hen the President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 637. In this circumstance, Presidential authority can derive support from \u201ccongressional inertia, indifference or quiescence.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Finally, \u201c[wjhen the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb,\u201d and the Court can sustain his actions \u201conly by disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 637-638.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The United States marshals two principal arguments in favor of the President\u2019s authority \u201cto establish binding rules of decision that preempt contrary state law.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>5. The Solicitor General first argues that the relevant treaties give the President the authority to implement the <em>Avena </em>judgment and that Congress has acquiesced in the exercise of such authority. The United States also relies upon an \u201cindependent\u201d international dispute-resolution power wholly apart from the asserted authority based on the pertinent treaties. Medellin adds the additional argument that the President\u2019s Memorandum is a valid exercise of his power to take care that the laws be- faithfully executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">The United States maintains that the President\u2019s Memorandum is authorized by the Optional Protocol and the U. N. Charter. Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>9. That is, because the relevant treaties \u201ccreate an obligation to comply with <em>Avena,\u201d </em>they <em>\u201cimplicitly </em>give the President authority to implement that treaty-based obligation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 11 (emphasis added). As a result, the President\u2019s Memorandum is well grounded in the first category of the <em>Youngstown </em>framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">We disagree. The President has an array of political and diplomatic means available to enforce international obligations, but unilaterally converting a non-self-executing treaty into a self-executing one is not among them. The responsibility for transforming an international obligation arising from a non-self-executing treaty into domestic law falls to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Congress. <em>Foster, </em>2 Pet., at 315; <em>Whitney, </em>124 U. S., at 194; <em>Igart\u00faa-De La Rosa, </em>417 F. 3d, at 150. As this Court has explained, when treaty stipulations are \u201cnot self-executing they can only be enforced pursuant to legislation to carry them into effect.\u201d <em>Whitney, supra, </em>at 194. Moreover, \u201c[u]ntil such act shall be passed, the Court is not at liberty to disregard the existing laws on the subject.\u201d <em>Foster, supra, </em>at 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The requirement that Congress, rather than the President, implement a non-self-executing treaty derives from the text of the Constitution, which divides the treaty-making power between the President and the Senate. The Constitution vests the President with the authority to \u201cmake\u201d a treaty. Art. II, \u00a7 2. If the Executive determines that a treaty should have domestic effect of its own force, that determination may be implemented in \u201cmak[ing]\u201d the treaty, by ensuring that it contains language plainly providing for domestic enforceability. If the treaty is to be self-executing in this respect, the Senate must consent to the treaty by the requisite two-thirds vote, <em>ibid., </em>consistent with all other constitutional restraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Once a treaty is ratified without provisions clearly according it domestic effect, however, whether the treaty will ever have such effect is governed by the fundamental constitutional principle that \u201c\u2018[t]he power to make the necessary laws is in Congress; the power to execute in the President.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hamdan </em>v. <em>Rumsfeld, </em>548 U. S. 557, 591 (2006) (quoting <em>Ex parte Milligan, </em>4 Wall. 2, 139 (1866) (opinion of Chase, C. J.)); see U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 1 (\u201cAll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States\u201d). As already noted, the terms of a non-self-executing treaty can become domestic law only in the same way as any other law \u2014 through passage of legislation by both Houses of Congress, combined with either the President\u2019s signature or a congressional override of a Presidential veto. See Art. I, \u00a7 7. Indeed, \u201cthe President\u2019s power to see that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker.\u201d <em>Youngstown, </em>343 U. S., at 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">A non-self-executing treaty, by definition, is one that was ratified with the understanding that it is not to have domestic effect of its own force. That understanding precludes the assertion that Congress has implicitly authorized the President \u2014 acting on his own \u2014 to achieve precisely the same result. We therefore conclude, given the absence of congressional legislation, that the non-self-executing treaties at issue here did not \u201cexpress[ly] or implied[ly]\u201d vest the President with the unilateral authority to make them self-executing. See <em>id., </em>at 635 (Jackson, J., concurring). Accordingly, the President\u2019s Memorandum does not fall within the first category of the <em>Youngstown </em>framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Indeed, the preceding discussion should make clear that the non-self-executing character of the relevant treaties not only refutes the notion that the ratifying parties vested the President with the authority to unilaterally make treaty obligations binding on domestic courts, but also implicitly prohibits him from doing so. When the President asserts the power to \u201cenforce\u201d a non-self-executing treaty by unilaterally creating domestic law, he acts in conflict with the implicit understanding of the ratifying Senate. His assertion of authority, insofar as it is based on the pertinent non-self-executing treaties, is therefore within Justice Jackson\u2019s third category, not the first or even the second. See <em>id., </em>at 637-638.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Each of the two means described above for giving domestic effect to an international treaty obligation under the Constitution \u2014 for making law \u2014 requires joint action by the Executive and Legislative Branches: The Senate can ratify a self-executing treaty \u201cma[de]\u201d by the Executive, or, if the ratified treaty is not self-executing, Congress can enact implementing legislation approved by the President. It should not be surprising that our Constitution does not contemplate vesting such power in the Executive alone. As Madison ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>plained in The Federalist No. 47, under our constitutional system of checks and balances, \u201c[t]he magistrate in whom the whole executive power resides cannot of himself make a law.\u201d J. Cooke ed., p. 326 (1961). That would, however, seem an apt description of the asserted executive authority unilaterally to give the effect of domestic law to obligations under a non-self-executing treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The United States nonetheless maintains that the President\u2019s Memorandum should be given effect as domestic law because \u201cthis case involves a valid Presidential action in the context of Congressional 'acquiescence.\u2019\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>11, n. 2. Under the <em>Youngstown </em>tripartite framework, congressional acquiescence is pertinent when the President\u2019s action falls within the second category \u2014 that is, when he \u201cacts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority.\u201d 343 U. S., at 637 (Jackson, J., concurring). Here, however, as we have explained, the President\u2019s effort to accord domestic effect to the <em>Avena </em>judgment does not meet that prerequisite.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">In any event, even if we were persuaded that congressional acquiescence could support the President\u2019s asserted authority to create domestic law pursuant to a non-self-executing treaty, such acquiescence does not exist here. The United States first locates congressional acquiescence in Congress\u2019s failure to act following the President\u2019s resolution of prior ICJ controversies. A review of the Executive\u2019s actions in those prior cases, however, cannot support the claim that Congress acquiesced in this particular exercise of Presidential authority, for none of them remotely involved transforming an international obligation into domestic law and thereby displacing state law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>The United States also directs us to the President\u2019s \u201crelated\u201d statutory responsibilities and to his \u201cestablished role\u201d in litigating foreign policy concerns as support for the President\u2019s asserted authority to give the ICJ\u2019s decision in <em>Avena </em>the force of domestic law. Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>16-19. Congress has indeed authorized the President to represent the United States before the United Nations, the ICJ, and the Security Council, 22 U. S. C. \u00a7 287, but the authority of the President to represent the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>States before such bodies speaks to the President\u2019s <em>international </em>responsibilities, not any unilateral authority to create domestic law. The authority expressly conferred by Congress in the international realm cannot be said to \u201cinvite\u201d the Presidential action at issue here. See <em>Youngstown, supra, </em>at 637 (Jackson, J, concurring). At bottom, none of the sources of authority identified by the United States supports the President\u2019s claim that Congress has acquiesced in his asserted power to establish on his own federal law or to override state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">None of this is to say, however, that the combination of a non-self-executing treaty and the lack of implementing legislation precludes the President from acting to comply with an international treaty obligation. It is only to say that the Executive cannot unilaterally execute a non-self-executing treaty by giving it domestic effect. That is, the non-self-executing character of a treaty constrains the President\u2019s ability to comply with treaty commitments by unilaterally making the treaty binding on domestic courts. The President may comply with the treaty\u2019s obligations by some other means, so long as they are consistent with the Constitution. But he may not rely upon a non-self-executing treaty to \u201cestablish binding rules of decision that preempt contrary state law.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>5.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">We thus turn to the United States\u2019 claim that \u2014 independent of the United States\u2019 treaty obligations \u2014 the Memorandum is a valid exercise of the President\u2019s foreign affairs authority to resolve claims disputes with foreign nations. <em>Id., </em>at 12-16. The United States relies on a series of cases in which this Court has upheld the authority of the President to settle foreign claims pursuant to an executive agreement. See <em>Garamendi, </em>539 U. S., at 415; <em>Dames &amp; Moore, </em>453 U. S., at 679-680; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pink, </em>315 U. S. 203, 229 (1942); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>Belmont, </em>301 U. S. 324, 330 (1937). In these cases this Court has explained that, if pervasive enough, a history of congressional acquiescence can be treated as a \u201cgloss on \u2018Executive Power\u2019 vested in the President by \u00a7 1 of Art. II.\u201d <em>Dames &amp; Moore, supra, </em>at 686 (some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">This argument is of a different nature than the one rejected above. Rather than relying on the United States\u2019 treaty obligations, the President relies on an independent source of authority in ordering Texas to put aside its procedural bar to successive habeas petitions. Nevertheless, we find that our claims-settlement cases do not support the authority that the President asserts in this case. .</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The claims-settlement cases involve a narrow set of circumstances: the making of executive agreements to settle civil claims between American citizens and foreign governments or foreign nationals. See, <em>e. g., Belmont, supra, </em>at 327. They are based on the view that \u201ca systematic, unbroken, executive practice, long pursued to the knowledge of the Congress and never before questioned,\u201d can \u201craise a presumption that the [action] had been [taken] in pursuance of its consent.\u201d <em>Dames &amp; Moore, supra, </em>at 686 (internal quotation marks omitted). As this Court explained in Garamendi:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-7\">\u201cMaking executive agreements to settle claims of American nationals against foreign governments is a particularly longstanding practice .... Given the fact that the practice goes back over 200 years, and has received congressional acquiescence throughout its history, the conclusion that the President\u2019s control of foreign relations includes the settlement of claims is indisputable.\u201d 539 U. S., at 415 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Even still, the limitations on this source of executive power are clearly set forth and the Court has been careful to note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>that \u201c[p]ast practice does not, by itself, create power.\u201d <em>Dames &amp; Moore, supra, </em>at 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The President\u2019s Memorandum is not supported by a \u201cparticularly longstanding practice\u201d of congressional acquiescence, see <em>Garamendi, supra, </em>at 415, but rather is what the United States itself has described as \u201cunprecedented action,\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>in <em>Sanchez-Llamas, </em>O. T. 2005, Nos. 05-51 and 04-10566, pp. 29-30. Indeed, the Government has not identified a single instance in which the President has attempted (or Congress has acquiesced in) a Presidential directive issued to state courts, much less one that reaches deep into the heart of the State\u2019s police powers and compels state courts to reopen final criminal judgments and set aside neutrally applicable state laws. Cf. <em>Brecht </em>v. <em>Abrahamson, </em>507 U. S. 619, 635 (1993) (\u201cStates possess primary authority for defining and enforcing the criminal law\u201d (quoting <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Isaac, </em>456 U. S. 107, 128 (1982); internal quotation marks omitted)). The Executive\u2019s narrow and strictly limited authority to settle international claims disputes pursuant to an executive agreement cannot stretch so far as to support the current Presidential Memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Medellin argues that the President\u2019s Memorandum is a valid exercise of his \u201c[T]ake Care\u201d power.

II, \u00a7 3. We think this a wise concession. This authority allows the President to execute the laws, not make them.

Here, Medellin confessed within three hours of his arrest\u2014 before there could be a violation of his Vienna Convention right to consulate notification. App. to Brief for Respondent 32-36. In a second state habeas application, Medellin sought to expand his claim of prejudice by contending that the State\u2019s noncompliance with the Vienna Convention deprived him of assistance in developing mitigation evidence during the capital phase of his trial. This argument, however, was likely waived: Medellin had the assistance of consulate counsel during the preparation of his <em>first </em>application for state postconviction relief, yet failed to raise this argument at that time. See Application for Writ of Habeas Corpus in <em>Ex parte Medellin, </em>No. 675430-A (Tex. Crim. App., Mar. 26, 1998), pp. 25-31. In light of our disposition of this case, we need not consider whether Medellin was prejudiced in any way by the violation of his Vienna Convention rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b763-6\"> The label \u201cself-executing\u201d has on occasion been used to convey different meanings. What we mean by \u201cself-executing\u201d is that the treaty has automatic domestic effect as federal law upon ratification. Conversely, a \u201cnon-self-exeeuting\u201d treaty does not by itself give rise to domestically enforceable federal law. Whether such a treaty has domestic effect depends upon implementing legislation passed by Congress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\"> Even when treaties are self-executing in the sense that they create federal law, the background presumption is that \u201c[international agreements, even those directly benefiting private persons, generally do not create private rights or provide for a private cause of action in domestic courts.\u201d 2 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7907, Comment <em>a, </em>p. 395 (1986) (hereinafter Restatement).

It is not clear whether that principle would apply when the question is the binding force of ICJ judgments themselves, rather than the substantive scope of a treaty the ICJ must interpret in resolving disputes. Cf. <em>Phillips Petroleum Co. </em>v. <em>Shutts, </em>472 U.

In any event, nothing suggests that the ICJ views its judgments as automatically enforceable in the domestic courts of signatory nations.

See Reply Brief for Petitioner 4, 5, and n. 2. In each case, this Court first interpreted the treaty prior to finding it domestically enforceable. See, <em>e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Rauseher, </em>119 U.

We agree. The questions here are the far more limited ones of whether he may unilaterally create federal law by giving effect to the judgment of this international tribunal pursuant to this non-self-executing treaty, and, if not, whether he may rely on other authority under the Constitution to support the action taken in this particular case. Those are the only questions we decide.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b786-7\"> Rather, in the <em>Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua </em>(Nicar. v. <em>U.

J. 14 (Judgment of June 27), the President determined that the United States would <em>not </em>comply with the ICJ\u2019s conclusion that the United States owed reparations to Nicaragua. In the <em>Case Concerning Delimitation of the Maritime </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number><em>Boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area (Can. </em>v. <em>U.

The <em>Case Concerning Rights of Nationals of the United States of America in Morocco (Fr. </em>v. <em>U. S.), </em>1952 I. C. J. 176 (Judgment of Aug. 27), concerned the legal status of United States citizens living in Morocco; it was not enforced in United States courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">The final two cases arose under the Vienna Convention. In the <em>LaGrand Case (F. R. G. </em>v. <em>U. S.), </em>2001 1. C. J. 466 (Judgment of June 27), the ICJ ordered the review and reconsideration of convictions and sentences of German nationals denied consular notification. In response, the State Department sent letters to the States \u201cencouraging\u201d them to consider the Vienna Convention in the clemency process. Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>20-21. Such encouragement did not give the ICJ judgment direct effect as domestic law; thus, it cannot serve as precedent for doing so in which Congress might be said to have acquiesced. In the <em>Case Concerning the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations {Para. </em>v. <em>U. S.), </em>1998 I. C. J. 248 (Judgment of Apr. 9), the ICJ issued a provisional order, directing the United States to <em>\u201ctake all measures at its disposal </em>to ensure that [Breard] is not executed pending the final decision in [the ICJ\u2019s] proceedings.\u201d <em>Breard, </em>523 U.

In response, the Secretary of State sent a letter to the Governor of Virginia requesting that he stay Breard\u2019s execution. <em>Id., </em>at 378. When Paraguay sought a stay of execution from this Court, the United States argued that it had taken every measure at its disposal: because \u201cour federal system imposes limits on the federal government\u2019s ability to interfere with the criminal justice systems of the States,\u201d those measures included \u201conly persuasion,\u201d not \u201clegal compulsion.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae, </em>O.

This of course is precedent contrary to the proposition asserted by the Solicitor General in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Justice Stevens,</author>\n<p id=\"Abk\">concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">There is a great deal of wisdom in Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent. I agree that the text and history of the Supremacy Clause, as well as this Court\u2019s treaty-related cases, do not support a presumption against self-execution. See <em>post, </em>at 541-546. I also endorse the proposition that the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, Apr. 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U. S. T. 77, T. I. A. S. No. 6820, \u201cis itself self-executing and judicially enforceable.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 555. Moreover, I think this case presents a closer question than the Court\u2019s opinion allows. In the end, however, I am persuaded that the relevant treaties do not authorize this Court to enforce the judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in <em>Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. </em>v. <em>U S.), </em>2004 I. C. J. 12 (Judgment of Mar. 31) <em>(Avena).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The source of the United States\u2019 obligation to comply with judgments of the ICJ is found in Article 94(1) of the United Nations Charter, which was ratified in 1945. Article 94(1) provides that \u201c[e]ach Member of the United Nations <em>undertakes to comply </em>with the decision of the [ICJ] in any case to which it is a party.\u201d 59 Stat. 1051, T. S. No. 993 (emphasis added). In my view, the words \u201cundertakes to comply\u201d\u2014 while not the model of either a self-executing or a non-self-executing commitment \u2014 are most naturally read as a promise to take additional steps to enforce ICJ judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Unlike the text of some other treaties, the terms of the United Nations Charter do not necessarily incorporate international judgments into domestic law. Cf., <em>e. g., </em>United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Annex VI, Art. 39, Dec. 10,1982, S. Treaty Doc. No. 103-39, 1833 U. N. T. S. 570 (\u201c[Decisions of the [Seabed Disputes] Chamber shall be enforceable in the territories of the States Parties in the same manner as judgments or orders of the highest court of the State Party in whose territory the enforcement is sought\u201d). Moreover, Congress has passed implementing legislation to ensure the enforcement of other international judgments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>even when the operative treaty provisions use far more mandatory language than \u201cundertakes to comply.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">On the other hand Article 94(1) does not contain the kind of unambiguous language foreclosing self-execution that is found in other treaties. The obligation to undertake to comply with IC J decisions is more consistent with self-execution than, for example, an obligation to enact legislation. Cf., <em>e. g., </em>International Plant Protection Convention, Art. I, Dec. 6, 1951, [1972] 23 U. S. T. 2770, T. I. A. S. No. 7465 (\u201c[T]he contracting Governments undertake to adopt the legislative, technical and administrative measures specified in this Convention\u201d). Furthermore, whereas the Senate has issued declarations of non-self-execution when ratifying some treaties, it did not do so with respect to the United Nations Charter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Absent a presumption one way or the other, the best reading of the words \u201cundertakes to comply\u201d is, in my judgment, one that contemplates future action by the political branches. I agree with the dissenters that \u201cCongress is unlikely to authorize automatic judicial enforceability of <em>all </em>ICJ judgments, for that could include some politically sensitive judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>ments and others better suited for enforcement by other branches.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 560. But this concern counsels in favor of reading any ambiguity in Article 94(1) as leaving the choice of whether to comply with ICJ judgments, and in what manner, \u201cto the political, not the judicial department.\u201d <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Neilson, </em>2 Pet. 253, 314 (1829).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The additional treaty provisions cited by the dissent do not suggest otherwise. In an annex to the United Nations Charter, the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ Statute) states that a decision of the ICJ \u201chas no binding force except between the parties and in respect of that particular case.\u201d Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062. Because I read that provision as confining, not expanding, the effect of ICJ judgments, it does not make the undertaking to comply with such judgments any more enforceable than the terms of Article 94(1) itself. That the judgment is \u201cbinding\u201d as a matter of international law says nothing about its domestic legal effect. Nor in my opinion does the reference to \u201ccompulsory jurisdiction\u201d in the Optional Protocol Concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes to the Vienna Convention, Art. I, Apr. 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U. S. T. 325, T. I. A. S. No. 6820, shed any light on the matter. This provision merely secures the consent of signatory nations to the specific jurisdiction of the ICJ with respect to claims arising out of the Vienna Convention. See ICJ Statute, Art. 36(1), 59 Stat. 1060 (\u201cThe jurisdiction of the Court comprises ... all matters specially provided for ... in treaties and conventions in force\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Even though the ICJ\u2019s judgment in <em>Avena </em>is not \u201cthe supreme Law of the Land,\u201d U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2, no one disputes that it constitutes an international law obligation on the part of the United States, <em>ante, </em>at 504. By issuing a memorandum declaring that state courts should give effect to the judgment in <em>Avena, </em>the President made a commendable attempt to induce the States to discharge the Nation\u2019s obligation. I agree with the Texas judges and the majority of this Court that the President\u2019s memorandum is not binding law. Nonetheless, the fact that the President cannot legislate unilaterally does not absolve the United States from its promise to take action necessary to comply with the ICJ\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Under the express terms of the Supremacy Clause, the United States\u2019 obligation to \u201cundertak[e] to comply\u201d with the ICJ\u2019s decision falls on each of the States as well as the Federal Government. One consequence of our form of government is that sometimes States must shoulder the primary responsibility for protecting the honor and integrity of the Nation. Texas\u2019 duty in this respect is all the greater since it was Texas that \u2014 by failing to provide consular notice in accordance with the Vienna Convention \u2014 ensnared the United States in the current controversy. Having already put the Nation in breach of one treaty, it is now up to Texas to prevent the breach of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The decision in <em>Avena </em>merely obligates the United States \u201cto provide, by means of its own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences of the [affected] Mexican nationals,\u201d 2004 I. C. J., at 72, \u00b6 153(9), \u201cwith a view to ascertaining\u201d whether the failure to provide proper notice to consular officials \u201ccaused actual prejudice to the defendant in the process of administration of criminal justice,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 60, \u00b6 121. The cost to Texas of complying with <em>Avena </em>would be minimal, particularly given the remote likelihood that the violation of the Vienna Convention actually prejudiced Jos\u00e9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Ernesto Medellin. See <em>ante, </em>at 500-502, and n. 1. It is a cost that the State of Oklahoma unhesitatingly assumed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">On the other hand, the costs of refusing to respect the ICJ\u2019s judgment are significant. The entire Court and the President agree that breach will jeopardize the United States-\u2019 \u201cplainly compelling\u201d interests in \u201censuring the reciprocal observance of the Vienna Convention, protecting relations with foreign governments, and demonstrating commitment to the role of international law.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 524. When the honor of the Nation is balanced against the modest cost of compliance, Texas would do well to recognize that more is at stake than whether judgments of the ICJ, and the principled admonitions of the President of the United States, trump state procedural rules in the absence of implementing legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The Court\u2019s judgment, which I join, does not foreclose further appropriate action by the State of Texas.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-7\"> See, <em>e. g., </em>Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID Convention), ch.

Mexico claimed that state authorities within the United States had failed to notify the arrested persons of their Vienna Convention rights and, by applying state procedural law in a manner which did not give full effect to the Vienna Convention rights, had deprived them of an appropriate remedy. <em>Ibid. </em>The ICJ judgment in <em>Avena </em>requires that the United States reexamine \u201cby means of its own choosing\u201d certain aspects of the relevant state criminal proceedings of 51 of these individual Mexican nationals. <em>Id., </em>at 62, \u00b6 129 (internal quotation marks omitted). The President has determined that this should be done. See President\u2019s Memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The critical question here is whether the Supremacy Clause requires Texas to follow, <em>i. e., </em>to enforce, this ICJ judgment. The Court says \u201cno.\u201d And it reaches its negative answer by interpreting the labyrinth of treaty provisions as creating a legal obligation that binds the United States internationally, but which, for Supremacy Clause purposes, is not automatically enforceable as domestic law. In the majority\u2019s view, the Optional Protocol simply sends the dispute to the ICJ; the ICJ Statute says that the ICJ will subsequently reach a judgment; and the U. N. Charter contains no more than a promise to \u201c\u2018undertak[e] to comply\u2019\u201d with that judgment. <em>Ante, </em>at 500. Such a promise, the majority says, does not as a domestic-law matter (in Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s words) \u201coperat[e] of itself without the aid of any legislative provision.\u201d <em>Foster, supra, </em>at 314. Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>here (and presumably in any other ICJ judgment rendered pursuant to any of the approximately 70 U. S. treaties in force that contain similar provisions for submitting treaty-based disputes to the ICJ for decisions that bind the parties) Congress must enact specific legislation before ICJ judgments entered pursuant to our consent to compulsory ICJ jurisdiction can become domestic law. See Brief for International Court of Justice Experts as <em>Amici Curiae </em>18 (\u201cApproximately 70 U. S. treaties now in force contain obligations comparable to those in the Optional Protocol for submission of treaty-based disputes to the ICJ\u201d); see also <em>id., </em>at 18, n. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">In my view, the President has correctly determined that Congress need not enact additional legislation. The majority places too much weight upon treaty language that says little about the matter. The words \u201c \u2018undertake] to comply/ \u201d for example, do not tell us whether an ICJ judgment rendered pursuant to the parties\u2019 consent to compulsory ICJ jurisdiction does, or does not, automatically become part of our domestic law. To answer that question we must look instead t\u00f3 our own domestic law, in particular, to the many treaty-related cases interpreting the Supremacy Clause. Those cases, including some written by Justices well aware of the Founders\u2019 original intent, lead to the conclusion that the ICJ judgment before us is enforceable as a matter of domestic law without further legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Supreme Court case law stretching back more than 200 years helps explain what, for present purposes, the Founders meant when they wrote that \u201call Treaties . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land.\u201d Art. VI, cl. 2. In 1796, for example, the Court decided the case of <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Hylton, </em>3 Dall. 199. A British creditor sought payment of an American\u2019s Revolutionary War debt. The debtor argued that he had, under Virginia law, repaid the debt by complying with a state statute enacted during the Revolutionary War that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>required debtors to repay money owed to British creditors into a Virginia state fund. <em>Id., </em>at 220-221 (opinion of Chase, J.). The creditor, however, claimed that this state-sanctioned repayment did not count because a provision of the 1783 Paris Peace Treaty between Britain and the United States said that \u201c\u2018the creditors of either side should meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value ... of all <em>bona fide </em>debts, theretofore contracted\u2019 and that provision, the creditor argued, effectively nullified the state law. <em>Id., </em>at 203-204 (Reporter\u2019s Summary). The Court, with each Justice writing separately, agreed with the British creditor, held the Virginia statute invalid, and found that the American debtor remained liable for the debt. <em>Id., </em>at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The key fact relevant here is that Congress had not enacted a specific statute enforcing the treaty provision at issue. Hence the Court had to decide whether the provision was (to put the matter in present terms) \u201cself-executing.\u201d Justice Iredell, a member of North Carolina\u2019s Ratifying Convention, addressed the matter specifically, setting forth views on which Justice Story later relied to explain the Founders\u2019 reasons for drafting the Supremacy Clause. 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 696-697 (1833) (hereinafter Story). See V\u00e1zquez, The Four Doctrines of Self-Executing Treaties, 89 Am. J. Int\u2019l L. 695, 697-700 (1995) (hereinafter V\u00e1zquez) (describing the history and purpose of the Supremacy Clause). See also Flaherty, History Right?: Historical Scholarship, Original Understanding, and Treaties as \u201cSupreme Law of the Land,\u201d 99 Colum. L. Rev. 2095 (1999) (contending that the Founders crafted the Supremacy Clause to make ratified treaties self-executing). But see Yoo, Globalism and the Constitution: Treaties, Non-Self-Execution, and the Original Understanding, 99 Colum. L. Rev. 1955 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Justice Iredell pointed out that some treaty provisions, those, for example, declaring the United States an independ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>ent Nation or acknowledging its right to navigate the Mississippi River, were <em>\u201cexecuted,\u201d </em>taking effect automatically upon ratification. 3 Dall., at 272. Other provisions were <em>\u201cexecutory,\u201d </em>in the sense that they were \u201cto be carried into execution\u201d by each signatory nation \u201cin the manner which the Constitution of that nation prescribes.\u201d <em>Ibid. Before </em>adoption of the U. S. Constitution, all such provisions would have taken effect as domestic law <em>only if </em>Congress on the American side, or Parliament on the British side, had written them into domestic law. <em>Id., </em>at 274-277.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">But, Justice Iredell adds, <em>after </em>the Constitution\u2019s adoption, while further parliamentary action remained necessary in Britain (where the \u201cpractice\u201d of the need for an \u201cact of parliament\u201d in respect to \u201cany thing of a legislative nature\u201d had \u201cbeen constantly observed,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 275-276), further legislative action in respect to the treaty\u2019s debt-collection provision <em>was no longer necessary </em>in the United States. <em>Id., </em>at 276-277. The ratification of the Constitution with its Supremacy Clause means that treaty provisions that bind the United States may (and in this instance did) also enter domestic law without further congressional action and automatically bind the States and courts as well. <em>Id., </em>at 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">\u201cUnder this Constitution,\u201d Justice Iredell concluded, \u201cso far as a treaty constitutionally is binding, upon principles of <em>moral obligation, </em>it is also by the vigour of its own authority to be executed in fact. It would not otherwise be the <em>Supreme law </em>in the new sense provided for.\u201d <em>Ibid.; </em>see also Story, \u00a7 1833, at 697 (noting that the Supremacy Clause\u2019s language was crafted to make the Clause\u2019s \u201cobligation more strongly felt by the state judges\u201d and to \u201cremov[e] every pretense\u201d by which they could \u201cescape from [its] controlling power\u201d); see also The Federalist No. 42, p. 264 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison) (Supremacy Clause \u201cdisembarrassed\u201d the Convention of the problem presented by the Articles of Confederation where \u201ctreaties might be substantially frustrated by regulations of the States\u201d). Justice Ire-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>dell gave examples of provisions that would no longer require further legislative action, such as those requiring the release of prisoners, those forbidding war-related \u201c\u2018future confiscations\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018prosecutions,\u2019 \u201d and, of course, the specific debt-collection provision at issue in the <em>Ware </em>case itself. 3 Dall., at 273, 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Some 30 years later, the Court returned to the \u201cself-execution\u201d problem. In <em>Foster, 2 </em>Pet. 253, the Court examined a provision in an 1819 treaty with Spain ceding Florida to the United States; the provision said that \u201c \u2018grants of land made\u2019 \u201d by Spain before January 24, 1818, \u201c \u2018shall be ratified and confirmed\u2019 \u201d to the grantee. <em>Id., </em>at 310. Chief Justice Marshall, writing for the Court, noted that, as a general matter, one might expect a signatory nation to execute a treaty through a formal exercise of its domestic sovereign authority <em>(e. g., </em>through an act of the legislature). <em>Id., </em>at 314. But in the United States <em>\u201ca different principle\u201d </em>applies. <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added). The Supremacy Clause means that, here, a treaty is \u201cthe law of the land ... to be regarded in Courts of justice as equivalent to an act of the legislature\u201d and \u201coperates of itself without the aid of any legislative provision\u201d unless it specifically contemplates execution by the legislature and thereby <em>\u201caddresses itself to the political, not the judicial department.\u201d Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). The Court decided that the treaty provision in question was <em>not </em>self-executing; in its view, the words \u201cshall be ratified\u201d demonstrated that the provision foresaw further legislative action. <em>Id., </em>at 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The Court, however, changed its mind about the result in <em>Foster </em>four years later, after being shown a less legislatively oriented, less tentative, but equally authentic Spanish-language version of the treaty. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Percheman, </em>7 Pet. 51, 88-89 (1833). And by 1840, instances in which treaty provisions automatically became part of domestic law were common enough for one Justice to write that \u201cit would be a bold proposition\u201d to assert \u201cthat an act of Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>gress must be first passed\u201d in order to give a treaty effect as \u201ca supreme law of the land.\u201d <em>Lessee of Pollard\u2019s Heirs </em>v. <em>Kibbe, </em>14 Pet. 353, 388 (1840) (Baldwin, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Since <em>Foster </em>and <em>Pollard, </em>this Court has frequently held or assumed that particular treaty provisions are self-executing, automatically binding the States without more. See Appendix A, <em>infra </em>(listing, as examples, 29 such cases, including 12 concluding that the treaty provision invalidates state or territorial law or policy as a consequence). See also Wu, Treaties\u2019 Domains, 93 Va. L. Rev. 571, 583-584 (2007) (concluding \u201cenforcement against States is the primary and historically most significant type of treaty enforcement in the United States\u201d). As far as I can tell, the Court has held to the contrary only in two cases: <em>Foster, supra, </em>which was later reversed, and <em>Cameron Septic Tank Co. </em>v. <em>Knoxville, </em>227 U. S. 39 (1913), where specific congressional actions indicated that Congress thought further legislation necessary. See also V\u00e1zquez 716. The Court has found \u201cself-executing\u201d provisions in multilateral treaties as well as bilateral treaties. See, <em>e. g., Trans World Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Franklin Mint Corp., </em>466 U. S. 243, 252 (1984); <em>Bacardi Corp. of America </em>v. <em>Domenech, </em>311 U. S. 150, 160, and n. 9, 161 (1940). And the subject matter of such provisions has varied widely, from extradition, see, <em>e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Rauscher, </em>119 U. S. 407, 411-412 (1886), to criminal trial jurisdiction, see <em>Wildenhus\u2019s Case, </em>120 U. S. 1, 11, 17-18 (1887), to civil liability, see, <em>e. g., El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Tsui Yuan Tseng, </em>525 U. S. 155, 161-163 (1999), to trademark infringement, see <em>Bacardi, supra, </em>at 160, and n. 9, 161, to an alien\u2019s freedom to engage in trade, see, <em>e. g., Jordan </em>v. <em>Tashiro, </em>278 U. S. 123, 126, n. 1 (1928), to immunity from state taxation, see <em>Nielsen </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>279 U. S. 47, 50, 58 (1929), to land ownership, <em>Percheman, supra, </em>at 88-89, and to inheritance, see, <em>e. g., Kolovrat </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>366 U. S. 187, 191, n. 6, 198 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Of particular relevance to the present case, the Court has held that the United States may be obligated by treaty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>comply with the judgment of an international tribunal interpreting that treaty, despite the absence of any congressional enactment specifically requiring such compliance. See <em>Comegys </em>v. <em>Vasse, </em>1 Pet. 193, 211-212 (1828) (holding that decision of tribunal rendered pursuant to a United States-Spain treaty, which obliged the parties to \u201cundertake to make satisfaction\u201d of treaty-based rights, was \u201cconclusive and final\u201d and \u201cnot re-examinable\u201d in American courts); see also <em>Meade </em>v. <em>United States, </em>9 Wall. 691, 725 (1870) (holding that decision of tribunal adjudicating claims arising under United States-Spain treaty \u201cwas final and conclusive, and bar[red] a recovery upon the merits\u201d in American court).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">All of these cases make clear that self-executing treaty provisions are not uncommon or peculiar creatures of our domestic law; that they cover a wide range of subjects; that the Supremacy Clause itself answers the self-execution question by applying many, but not all, treaty provisions directly to the States; and that the Clause answers the self-execution question differently than does the law in many other nations. See <em>supra, </em>at 541-545 and this page. The cases also provide criteria that help determine <em>which </em>provisions automatically so apply \u2014 a matter to which I now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">The case law provides no simple magic answer to the question whether a particular treaty provision is self-executing. But the case law does make clear that, insofar as today\u2019s majority looks for language about \u201cself-execution\u201d in the treaty itself and insofar as it erects \u201cclear statement\u201d presumptions designed to help find an answer, it is misguided. See, <em>e.g., ante, </em>at 517 (expecting \u201cclea[r] state[ment]\u201d of parties\u2019 intent where treaty obligation \u201cmay interfere with state procedural rules\u201d); <em>ante, </em>at 526 (for treaty to be self-executing, Executive should at drafting \u201censur[e] that it contains language plainly providing for domestic enforceability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>The many treaty provisions that this Court has found self-executing contain no textual language on the point (see Appendix A, <em>infra). </em>Few, if any, of these provisions are clear. See, <em>e. g., </em>Ware, 3 Dall., at 273 (opinion of Iredell, J.). Those that displace state law in respect to such quintessential state matters as, say, property, inheritance, or debt repayment, lack the \u201cclea[r] state[ment]\u201d that the Court today apparently requires. Compare <em>ante, </em>at 517 (majority expects \u201cclea[r] state[ment]\u201d of parties\u2019 intent where treaty obligation \u201cmay interfere with state procedural rules\u201d). This is also true of those cases that deal with state rules roughly comparable to the sort that the majority suggests require special accommodation. See, <em>e. g., Hopkirk </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>3 Cranch 454, 457-458 (1806) (treaty pre-empts Virginia state statute of limitations). Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 517 (setting forth majority\u2019s reliance on case law that is apparently inapposite). These many Supreme Court cases finding treaty provisions to be self-executing cannot be reconciled with the majority\u2019s demand for textual clarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Indeed, the majority does not point to a single ratified United States treaty that contains the kind of \u201cclea[r]\u201d or \u201cplai[n]\u201d textual indication for which the majority searches. <em>Ante, </em>at 517,526. Justice Stevens\u2019 reliance upon one ratified and one m-ratified treaty to make the point that a treaty <em>could </em>speak clearly on the matter of self-execution, see <em>ante, </em>at 533-534, and n. 1 (opinion concurring in judgment), does suggest that there are a few such treaties. But that simply highlights how few of them actually <em>do </em>speak clearly on the matter. And that is not because the United States never, or hardly ever, has entered into a treaty with self-executing provisions. The case law belies any such conclusion. Rather, it is because the issue whether further legislative action is required before a treaty provision takes domestic effect in a signatory nation is often a matter of how that nation\u2019s domestic law regards the provision\u2019s legal status. And that domestic status-determining law differs markedly from one nation to another. See generally Hollis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Comparative Approach to Treaty Law and Practice, in National Treaty Law and Practice 1, 9-50 (D. Hollis, M. Blakeslee, &amp; L. Ederington eds. 2005) (hereinafter Hollis). As Justice Iredell pointed out 200 years ago, Britain, for example, taking the view that the British Crown makes treaties but Parliament makes domestic law, virtually always requires parliamentary legislation. See <em>Ware, supra, </em>at 274-277; Sinclair, Dickson, &amp; Maciver, United Kingdom, in National Treaty Law and Practice, <em>supra, </em>at 727, 733, and n. 9 (in Britain, \u201c\u2018treaties are not self-executing\u2019\u201d (citing <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex parte Lord Rees-Mogg, </em>[1994] Q. B. 552 (1993))). See also Torruella, The <em>Insular Cases: </em>The Establishment of a Regime of Political Apartheid, 29 U. Pa. J. Int\u2019l L. 283, 337 (2007). On the other hand, the United States, with its Supremacy Clause, does not take Britain\u2019s view. See, <em>e, g., Ware, supra, </em>at 277 (opinion of Iredell, J.). And the law of other nations, the Netherlands for example, directly incorporates many treaties concluded by the executive into its domestic law even without explicit parliamentary approval of the treaty. See Brouwer, The Netherlands, in National Treaty Law and Practice, <em>supra, </em>at 483, 483-502.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The majority correctly notes that the treaties do not explicitly state that the relevant obligations are self-executing. But given the differences among nations, why would drafters write treaty language stating that a provision about, say, alien property inheritance, is self-executing? How could those drafters achieve agreement when one signatory nation follows one tradition and a second follows another? Why would such a difference matter sufficiently for drafters to try to secure language that would prevent, for example, Britain\u2019s following treaty ratification with a further law while (perhaps unnecessarily) insisting that the United States apply a treaty provision without further domestic legislation? Above all, what does the absence of specific language about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>\u201cself-execution\u201d prove? It may reflect the drafters\u2019 awareness of national differences. It may reflect the practical fact that drafters, favoring speedy, effective implementation, conclude they should best leave national legal practices alone. It may reflect the fact that achieving international agreement on <em>this </em>point is simply a game not worth the candle.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">In a word, for present purposes, the absence or presence of language in a treaty about a provision\u2019s self-execution proves nothing at all. At best the Court is hunting the snark. At worst it erects legalistic hurdles that can threaten the application of provisions in many existing commercial and other treaties and make it more difficult to negotiate new ones. (For examples, see Appendix B, <em>infra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The case law also suggests practical, context-specific criteria that this Court has previously used to help determine whether, for Supremacy Clause purposes, a treaty provision is self-executing. The provision\u2019s text matters very much. Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 514-516. But that is not because it contains language that explicitly refers to self-execution. For reasons I have already explained, Part I-B-l, <em>swpra, </em>one should not expect <em>that </em>kind of textual statement. Drafting history is also relevant. But, again, that is not because it will explicitly address the relevant question. Instead text and history, along with subject matter and related characteristics, will help our courts determine whether, as Chief Justice Marshall put it, the treaty provision \u201caddresses itself to the political... department^]\u201d for further action or to \u201cthe judicial department\u201d for direct enforcement. <em>Foster, </em>2 Pet., at 314; see also <em>Ware, </em>3 Dali, at 244 (opinion of Chase, J.) (\u201cNo one can doubt that a treaty may stipulate, that certain acts shall be done by the Legislature; that other acts shall be done by the Executive; and others by the Judiciary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">In making this determination, this Court has found the provision\u2019s subject matter, of particular importance. Does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>the treaty provision declare peace? Does it promise not to engage in hostilities? If so, it addresses itself to the political branches. See <em>id., </em>at 259-262 (opinion of Iredell, J.). Alternatively, does it concern the adjudication of traditional private legal rights such as rights to own property, to conduct a business, or to obtain civil tort recovery? If so, it may well address itself to the judiciary. Enforcing such rights and setting their boundaries is the bread-and-butter work of the courts. See, <em>e. g., Clark </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>331 U. S. 503 (1947) (treating provision with such subject matter as self-executing); <em>Asakura </em>v. <em>Seattle, </em>265 U. S. 332 (1924) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">One might also ask whether the treaty provision confers specific, detailed individual legal rights. Does it set forth definite standards that judges can readily enforce? Other things being equal, where rights are specific and readily enforceable, the treaty provision more likely \u201caddresses\u201d the judiciary. See, <em>e. g., Olympic Airways </em>v. <em>Husain, </em>540 U. S. 644 (2004) (specific conditions for air-carrier civil liability); <em>Geofroy </em>v. <em>Riggs, </em>133 U. S. 258 (1890) (French citizens\u2019 inheritance rights). Cf. <em>Foster, supra, </em>at 314-315 (treaty provision stating that landholders\u2019 titles \u201cshall be ratified and confirmed\u201d foresees legislative action).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Alternatively, would direct enforcement require the courts to create a new cause of action? Would such enforcement engender constitutional controversy? Would it create constitutionally undesirable conflict with the other branches? In such circumstances, it is not likely that the provision contemplates direct judicial enforcement. See, <em>e. g., Asakura, supra, </em>at 341 (although \u201cnot limited by any express provision of the Constitution,\u201d the treaty-making power of the United States \u201cdoes not extend \u2018so far as to authorize what the Constitution forbids\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Such questions, drawn from case law stretching back 200 years, do not create a simple test, let alone a magic formula. But they do help to constitute a practical, context-specific judicial approach, seeking to separate run-of-the-mill judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>matters from other matters, sometimes more politically charged, sometimes more clearly the responsibility of other branches, sometimes lacking those attributes that would permit courts to act on their own without more ado. And such an approach is all that we need to find an answer to the legal question now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Applying the approach just described, I would find the relevant treaty provisions self-executing as applied to the ICJ judgment before us (giving that judgment domestic legal effect) for the following reasons, taken together.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\"><em>First, </em>the language of the relevant treaties strongly supports direct judicial enforceability, at least of judgments of the kind at issue here. The Optional Protocol bears the title \u201cCompulsory Settlement of Disputes,\u201d thereby emphasizing the mandatory and binding nature of the procedures it sets forth. 21 U. S. T., at 326. The body of the Protocol says specifically that \u201cany party\u201d that has consented to the ICJ\u2019s \u201ccompulsory jurisdiction\u201d may bring a \u201cdispute\u201d before the court against any other such party. Art. I, <em>ibid. </em>And the Protocol contrasts proceedings of the compulsory kind with an alternative \u201cconciliation procedure,\u201d the recommendations of which a party may decide \u201cnot\u201d to \u201caccep[t].\u201d Art. Ill, <em>id., </em>at 327. Thus, the Optional Protocol\u2019s basic objective is not just to provide a forum for <em>settlement </em>but to provide a forum for <em>compulsory </em>settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Moreover, in accepting Article 94(1) of the Charter, \u201c[e]ach Member . . . undertakes to comply with the decision\u201d of the ICJ \u201cin any case to which it is a party.\u201d 59 Stat. 1051. And the ICJ Statute (part of the U. N. Charter) makes clear that a decision of the ICJ between parties that have consented to the ICJ\u2019s compulsory jurisdiction has <em>\u201cbinding force . </em>.. between the parties and in respect of that particular case.\u201d Art. 59, <em>id., </em>at 1062 (emphasis added). Enforcement of a court\u2019s judgment that has \u201cbinding force\u201d involves quintessential judicial activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>True, neither the Protocol nor the Charter explicitly states that the obligation to comply with an ICJ judgment automatically binds a party <em>as a matter of domestic law </em>without further domestic legislation. <em>But how could the language of those documents do otherwise? </em>The treaties are multilateral. And, as I have explained, some signatories follow British further-legislation-always-needed principles, others follow United States Supremacy Clause principles, and still others, <em>e. g., </em>the Netherlands, can directly incorporate treaty provisions into their domestic law in particular circumstances. See Hollis 9-50. Why, given national differences, would drafters, seeking as strong a legal obligation as is practically attainable, use treaty language that <em>requires </em>all signatories to adopt uniform domestic-law treatment in this respect?</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The absence of that likely unobtainable language can make no difference. We are considering the language for purposes of applying the Supremacy Clause. And for that purpose, this Court has found to be self-executing multilateral treaty language that is far less direct or forceful (on the relevant point) than the language set forth in the present treaties. See, <em>e. g., Trans World Airlines, </em>466 U. S., at 247, 252; <em>Bacardi, </em>311 U. S., at 160, and n. 9, 161. The language here in effect tells signatory nations to make an ICJ compulsory jurisdiction judgment \u201cas binding as you can.\u201d Thus, assuming other factors favor self-execution, the language <em>adds, </em>rather than <em>subtracts, </em>support.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Indeed, as I have said, <em>swpra, </em>at 540-541, the United States has ratified approximately 70 treaties with ICJ dispute resolution provisions roughly similar to those contained in the Optional Protocol; many of those treaties contemplate ICJ adjudication of the sort of substantive matters (property, commercial dealings, and the like) that the Court has found self-executing, or otherwise appear addressed to the judicial branch. See Appendix B, <em>infra. </em>None of the ICJ provisions in these treaties contains stronger language about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>self-execution than the language at issue here. See, <em>e. g., </em>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Denmark, Art. XXIV(2), Oct. 1, 1951, [1961] 12 U. S. T. 935, T. I. A. S. No. 4797 (\u201cAny dispute between the Parties as to the interpretation or application of the present Treaty, not satisfactorily adjusted by diplomacy, shall be submitted to the International Court of Justice, unless the Parties agree to settlement by some other pacific means\u201d). In signing these treaties (in respect to, say, alien land ownership provisions) was the United States engaging in a near useless act? Does the majority believe the drafters expected Congress to enact further legislation about, say, an alien\u2019s inheritance rights, decision by decision?</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">I recognize, as the majority emphasizes, that the U. N. Charter uses the words \u201cundertakes to comply,\u201d rather than, say, \u201cshall comply\u201d or \u201cmust comply.\u201d But what is inadequate about the word \u201cundertake]\u201d? A leading contemporary dictionary defined it in terms of \u201clay[ing] oneself under obligation ... to perform or to execute.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 2770 (2d ed. 1939). And that definition is just what the equally authoritative Spanish version of the provision (familiar to Mexico) says directly: The words \u201ccompromete a cumplir\u201d indicate a present obligation to execute, without any tentativeness of the sort the majority finds in the English word \u201cundertakes.\u201d See Carta de las Naciones Unidas, Art. 94(1), 59 Stat. 1175 (1945); Spanish and English Legal and Commercial Dictionary 44 (1945) (defining \u201ccomprometer\u201d as \u201cbecome liable\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 59 (defining \u201ccumplir\u201d as \u201cto perform, discharge, carry out, execute\u201d); see also Art. Ill, 59 Stat. 1054 (Spanish-language version equally valid); <em>Percheman, </em>7 Pet., at 88-89 (looking to Spanish version of a treaty to clear up ambiguity in English version). Cf. <em>Todok </em>v. <em>Union State Bank of Harvard, </em>281 U. S. 449, 453 (1930) (treating a treaty provision as self-executing even though it <em>expressly </em>stated what the majority says the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>word \u201cundertakes\u201d <em>implicitly </em>provides: that \u201c\u2018[tjhe United States ... shall be at liberty to make respecting this matter, such laws as they think proper\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">And even if I agreed with Justice Stevens that the language is perfectly ambiguous (which I do not), I could not agree that \u201cthe best reading... is ... one that contemplates future action by the political branches.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 534. The consequence of such a reading is to place the fate of an international promise made by the United States in the hands of a single State. See <em>ante, </em>at 536-537. And that is precisely the situation that the Framers sought to prevent by enacting the Supremacy Clause. See 3 Story 696 (purpose of Supremacy Clause \u201cwas probably to obviate\u201d the \u201cdifficulty\u201d of a system where treaties were \u201cdependent upon the good will of the states for their execution\u201d); see also <em>Ware, </em>3 Dall., at 277-278 (opinion of Iredell, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">I also recognize, as the majority emphasizes, <em>ante, </em>at 509-511, that the U. N. Charter says that \u201c[i]f any party to a case fails to perform the obligations incumbent upon it under a judgment rendered by the International Court of Justice, the other party may have recourse to the Security Council.\u201d Art. 94(2), 59 Stat. 1051. And when the Senate ratified the charter, it took comfort in the fact that the United States has a veto in the Security Council. See 92 Cong. Rec. 10694-10695 (1946) (statements of Sens. Pepper and Connally).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">But what has that to do with the matter? To begin with, the Senate would have been contemplating politically significant IC J decisions, not, <em>e. g., </em>the bread-and-butter commercial and other matters that are the typical subjects of self-executing treaty provisions. And in any event, both the Senate debate and U. N. Charter provision discuss and describe what happens (or does not happen) when a nation decides <em>not </em>to carry out an ICJ decision. See Charter of the United Nations for the Maintenance of International Peace and Security: Hearings before .the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 286 (1945) (statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>of Leo Pasvolsky, Special Assistant to the Secretary of State for International Organization and Security Affairs) (\u201c[W]hen the Court has rendered a judgment and one of the parties refuses to accept it, then the dispute becomes political rather than legal\u201d). The debates refer to remedies for a breach of our promise to carry out an ICJ decision. The Senate understood, for example, that Congress (unlike legislatures in other nations that do not permit domestic legislation to trump treaty obligations, Hollis 47-49) can block through legislation self-executing, as well as non-self-executing determinations. The debates nowhere refer to the method we use for affirmatively carrying out an ICJ obligation that no political branch has decided to dishonor, still less to a decision that the President (without congressional dissent) seeks to enforce. For that reason, these aspects of the ratification debates are here beside the point. See <em>infra, </em>at 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The upshot is that treaty language says that an ICJ decision is legally binding, but it leaves the implementation of that binding legal obligation to the domestic law of each signatory nation. In this Nation, the Supremacy Clause, as long and consistently interpreted, indicates that ICJ decisions rendered pursuant to provisions for binding adjudication must be domestically legally binding and enforceable in domestic courts <em>at least sometimes. </em>And for purposes of this argument, that conclusion is all that I need. The remainder of the discussion will explain why, if ICJ judgments <em>sometimes </em>bind domestic courts, then they have that effect here.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\"><em>Second, </em>the Optional Protocol here applies to a dispute about the meaning of a Vienna Convention provision that is itself self-executing and judicially enforceable. The Convention provision is about an individual\u2019s \u201crights,\u201d namely, his right upon being arrested to be informed of his separate right to contact his nation\u2019s consul. See Art. 36(l)(b), 21 U. S. T., at 101. The provision language is precise. The dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>pute arises at the intersection of an individual right with ordinary rules of criminal procedure; it consequently concerns the kind of matter with which judges are familiar. The provisions contain judicially enforceable standards. See Art. 36(2), <em>ibid, </em>(providing for exercise of rights \u201cin conformity with the laws and regulations\u201d of the arresting nation provided that the \u201claws and regulations . . . enable full effect to be given to the purposes for which the rights accorded under this Article are intended\u201d). And the judgment itself requires a further hearing of a sort that is typically judicial. See <em>infra, </em>at 562-564.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">This Court has found similar treaty provisions self-executing. See, <em>e. g., Rauscher, </em>119 U. S., at 410-411, 429-430 (violation of extradition treaty could be raised as defense in criminal trial); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Browne, </em>205 U. S. 309, 317-322 (1907) (extradition treaty required grant of writ of habeas corpus); <em>Wildenhus\u2019s Case, </em>120 U. S., at 11, 17-18 (treaty defined scope of state jurisdiction in a criminal case). It is consequently not surprising that, when Congress ratified the Convention, the State Department reported that the \u201cConvention is considered entirely self-executive and does not require any implementing or complementing legislation.\u201d S. Exec. Rep. No. 91-9, p. 5 (1969); see also <em>id., </em>at 18 (\u201cTo the extent that there are conflicts with Federal legislation or State laws the Vienna Convention, after ratification, would govern\u201d). And the Executive Branch has said in this Court that other, indistinguishable Vienna Convention provisions are self-executing. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>in <em>Sanchez-Llamas </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>O. T. 2005, Nos. 05-51 and 04-10566, p. 14, n. 2; cf. <em>ante, </em>at 506, n. 4 (majority leaves question open).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\"><em>Third, </em>logic suggests that a treaty provision providing for \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201cbinding\u201d judgments that \u201csettl[e]\u201d treaty-based disputes is self-executing insofar as the judgment in question concerns the meaning of an underlying treaty provision that is itself self-executing. Imagine that two parties to a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>tract agree to binding arbitration about whether a contract provision\u2019s word \u201cgrain\u201d includes rye. They would expect that, if the arbitrator decides that the word \u201cgrain\u201d does include rye, the arbitrator will then simply read the relevant provision as if it said \u201cgrain including rye.\u201d They would also expect the arbitrator to issue a binding award that embodies whatever relief would be appropriate under that circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Why treat differently the parties\u2019 agreement to binding ICJ determination about, <em>e. g., </em>the proper interpretation of the Vienna Convention clauses containing the rights here at issue? Why not simply read the relevant Vienna Convention provisions as if (between the parties and in respect to the 51 individuals at issue) they contain words that encapsulate the ICJ\u2019s decision? See Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062 (ICJ decision has \u201cbinding force . . . between the parties and in respect of [the] particular case\u201d). Why would the ICJ judgment not bind in precisely the same way those words would bind if they appeared in the relevant Vienna Convention provisions \u2014 just as the ICJ says, for purposes of this case, that they do?</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">To put the same point differently: What sense would it make (1) to make a self-executing promise and (2) to promise to accept as final an ICJ judgment interpreting that self-executing promise, yet (3) to insist that the judgment itself is not self-executing <em>(i. e., </em>that Congress must enact specific legislation to enforce it)?</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">I am not aware of any satisfactory answer to these questions. It is no answer to point to the fact that in <em>Sanchez-Llamas </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>548 U. S. 331 (2006), this Court interpreted the relevant Convention provisions differently from the ICJ in <em>Avena. </em>This Court\u2019s <em>Sanchez-Llamas </em>interpretation binds our courts with respect to individuals whose rights were not espoused by a state party in <em>Avena. </em>Moreover, as the Court itself recognizes, see <em>ante, </em>at 497-499, and as the President recognizes, see President\u2019s Memorandum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>the question here is the very different question of applying the ICJ\u2019s <em>Avena </em>judgment to the very parties whose interests Mexico and the United States espoused in the ICJ <em>Avena </em>proceeding. It is in respect to these individuals that the United States has promised the ICJ decision will have binding force. Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062. See 1 Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 98 (1969); 1 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations \u00a7 481 (1986); 1 Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 17 (1980) (all calling for recognition of judgment rendered after fair hearing in a contested proceeding before a court with adjudicatory authority over the case). See also 1 Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 106 (\u201cA judgment will be recognized and enforced in other states even though an error of fact or of law was made in the proceedings before judgment. .. \u201d); <em>id., </em>\u00a7 106, Comment <em>a </em>(\u201cTh[is] rule is . . . applicable to judgments rendered in foreign nations ... \u201d); Reese, The Status in This Country of Judgments Rendered Abroad, 50 Colum. L. Rev. 783, 789 (1950) (\u201c[Foreign] judgments will not be denied effect merely because the original court made an error either of fact or of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, see <em>ante, </em>at 511-512, that binding force does not disappear by virtue of the fact that Mexico, rather than Medellin himself, presented his claims to the ICJ. Mexico brought the <em>Avena </em>case in part in \u201cthe exercise of its right of diplomatic protection of its nationals,\u201d <em>e. g., </em>2004 I. C. J., at 20-21, \u00b6\u00b6 13(1), (3), including Medellin, see <em>id., </em>at 25, \u00b6 16. Such derivative claims are a well-established feature of international law, and the United States has several times asserted them on behalf of its own citizens. See 2 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7713, Comments <em>a, b, </em>at 217-218; <em>Case Concerning Elettronic Sicula S. p. A. (U. S. </em>v. <em>Italy), </em>1989 I. C. J. 15, 20 (Judgment of July 20); <em>Case Concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (U. S. </em>v. <em>Iran), </em>1979 I. C. J. 7, 8 (Judgment of Dec. 15); <em>Case Concerning </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number><em>Rights of Nationals of the United States of America in Morocco (Fr. </em>v. <em>U S.), </em>1952 I. C. J. 176, 180-181 (Judgment of Aug. 27). They are treated in relevant respects as the claims of the represented individuals themselves. See 2 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations, \u00a7713, Comments <em>a, b. </em>In particular, they can give rise to remedies, tailored to the individual, that bind the nation against whom the claims are brought (here, the United States). See <em>ibid.; </em>see also, <em>e. g., Frelinghuysen </em>v. <em>Key, </em>110 U. S. 63, 71-72 (1884).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Nor does recognition of the ICJ judgment as binding with respect to the individuals whose claims were espoused by Mexico in any way derogate from the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Sanchez-Llamas, supra. </em>See <em>ante, </em>at 512-513, n. 8. This case does not implicate the general interpretive question answered in <em>Sanchez-Llamas: </em>whether the Vienna Convention displaces state procedural rules. We are instead confronted with the discrete question of Texas\u2019 obligation to comply with a binding judgment issued by a tribunal with undisputed jurisdiction to adjudicate the rights of the individuals named therein. \u201cIt is inherent in international adjudication that an international tribunal may reject one country\u2019s legal position in favor of another\u2019s \u2014 and the United States explicitly accepted this possibility when it ratified the Optional Protocol.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>22.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\"><em>Fourth, </em>the majority\u2019s very different approach has seriously negative practical implications. The United States has entered into at least 70 treaties that contain provisions for ICJ dispute settlement similar to the Protocol before us. Many of these treaties contain provisions similar to those this Court has previously found self-executing \u2014 provisions that involve, for example, property rights, contract and commercial rights, trademarks, civil liability for personal injury, rights of foreign diplomats, taxation, domestic-court jurisdiction, and so forth. Compare Appendix A, <em>infra, </em>with Appendix B, <em>infra. </em>If the Optional Protocol here, taken to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>gether with the U. N. Charter and its annexed ICJ Statute, is insufficient to warrant enforcement of the ICJ judgment before us, it is difficult to see how one could reach a different conclusion in any of these other instances. And the consequence is to undermine longstanding efforts in those treaties to create an effective international system for interpreting and applying many, often commercial, self-executing treaty provisions. I thus doubt that the majority is right when it says, \u201cWe do not suggest that treaties can never afford binding domestic effect to international tribunal judgments.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 519. In respect to the 70 treaties that currently refer disputes to the ICJ\u2019s binding adjudicatory authority, some multilateral, some bilateral, that is just what the majority has done.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Nor can the majority look to congressional legislation for a quick fix. Congress is unlikely to authorize automatic judicial enforceability of <em>all </em>ICJ judgments, for that could include some politically sensitive judgments and others better suited for enforcement by other branches: for example, those touching upon military hostilities, naval activity, handling of nuclear material, and so forth. Nor is Congress likely to have the time available, let alone the will, to legislate judgment-by-judgment enforcement of, say, the ICJ\u2019s (or other international tribunals\u2019) resolution of non-politically-sensitive commercial disputes. And as this Court\u2019s prior case law has avoided laying down bright-line rules but instead has adopted a more complex approach, it seems unlikely that Congress will find it easy to develop legislative bright lines that pick out those provisions (addressed to the Judicial Branch) where self-execution seems warranted. But, of course, it is not necessary for Congress to do so \u2014 at least not if one believes that this Court\u2019s Supremacy Clause cases <em>already </em>embody criteria likely to work reasonably well. It is those criteria that I would apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\"><em>Fifth, </em>other factors, related to the particular judgment here at issue, make that judgment well suited to direct judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>cial enforcement. The specific issue before the ICJ concerned \u201c \u2018review and reconsideration\u2019 \u201d of the \u201cpossible prejudice\u201d caused in each of the 51 affected cases by an arresting State\u2019s failure to provide the defendant with rights guaranteed by the Vienna Convention. <em>Avena, </em>2004 I. C. J., at 65, \u00b6 138. This review will call for an understanding of how criminal procedure works, including whether, and how, a notification failure may work prejudice. <em>Id., </em>at 56-57. As the ICJ itself recognized, \u201cit is the judicial process that is suited to this task.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 66, \u00b6 140. Courts frequently work with criminal procedure and related prejudice. Legislatures do not. Judicial standards are readily available for working in this technical area. Legislative standards are not readily available. Judges typically determine such matters, deciding, for example, whether further hearings are necessary, after reviewing a record in an individual case. Congress does not normally legislate in respect to individual eases. Indeed, to repeat what I said above, what kind of special legislation does the majority believe Congress ought to consider?</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\"><em>Sixth, </em>to find the United States\u2019 treaty obligations self-executing as applied to the ICJ judgment (and consequently to find that judgment enforceable) does not' threaten constitutional conflict with other branches; it does not require us to engage in nonjudicial activity; and it does not require us to create a new cause of action. The only question before us concerns the application of the ICJ judgment as binding law applicable to the parties in a particular criminal proceeding that Texas law creates independently of the treaty. I repeat that the question before us does not involve the creation of a private right of action (and the majority\u2019s reliance on authority regarding such a circumstance is misplaced, see <em>ante, </em>at 506, n. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\"><em>Seventh, </em>neither the President nor Congress has expressed concern about direct judicial enforcement of the ICJ decision. To the contrary, the President favors enforcement of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>judgment. Thus, insofar as foreign policy impact, the interrelation of treaty provisions, or any other matter within the President\u2019s special treaty, military, and foreign affairs responsibilities might prove relevant, such factors <em>favor, </em>rather than militate against, enforcement of the judgment before us. See, <em>e. g., Jama </em>v. <em>Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>543 U. S. 335, 348 (2005) (noting Court\u2019s \u201ccustomary policy of deference to the President in matters of foreign affairs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">For these seven reasons, I would find that the United States\u2019 treaty obligation to comply with the ICJ judgment in <em>Avena </em>is enforceable in court in this case without further congressional action beyond Senate ratification of the relevant treaties. The majority reaches a different conclusion because it looks for the wrong thing (explicit textual expression about self-execution) using the wrong standard (clarity) in the wrong place (the treaty language). Hunting for what the text cannot contain, it takes a wrong turn. It threatens to deprive individuals, including businesses, property owners, testamentary beneficiaries, consular officials, and others, of the workable dispute resolution procedures that many treaties, including commercially oriented treaties, provide. In a world where commerce, trade, and travel have become ever more international, that is a step in the wrong direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Were the Court for a moment to shift the direction of its legal gaze, looking instead to the Supremacy Clause and to the extensive case law interpreting that Clause as applied to treaties, I believe it would reach a better supported, more felicitous conclusion. That approach, well embedded in Court case law, leads to the conclusion that the ICJ judgment before us is judicially enforceable without further legislative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">A determination that the ICJ judgment is enforceable does not quite end the matter, for the judgment itself requires us to make one further decision. It directs the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>United States to provide further judicial review of the 51 cases of Mexican nationals \u201cby means of its own choosing.\u201d <em>Avena, </em>2004 I. C. J., at 72, \u00b6 153(9). As I have explained, I believe the judgment addresses itself to the Judicial Branch. This Court consequently must \u201cchoose\u201d the means. And rather than, say, conducting the further review in this Court, or requiring Medellin to seek the review in another federal court, I believe that the proper forum for review would be the Texas-court proceedings that would follow a remand of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Beyond the fact that a remand would be the normal course upon reversing a lower court judgment, there are additional reasons why further state-court review would be particularly appropriate here. The crime took place in Texas, and the prosecution at issue is a Texas prosecution. The President has specifically endorsed further Texas-court review. See President\u2019s Memorandum. The ICJ judgment requires further hearings as to whether the police failure to inform Medellin of his Vienna Convention rights prejudiced Medellin, even if such hearings would not otherwise be available under Texas\u2019 procedural default rules. While Texas has already considered that matter, it did not consider fully, for example, whether appointed counsel\u2019s coterminous 6-month suspension from the practice of the law \u201ccaused actual prejudice to the defendant\u201d \u2014 prejudice that would not have existed had Medellin known he could contact his consul and thereby find a different lawyer. <em>Id., </em>at 60, \u00b6 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Finally, Texas law authorizes a criminal defendant to seek postjudgment review. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 11.071, \u00a7 5(a)(1) (Vernon Supp. 2006). And Texas law provides for further review where American law provides a \u201c\u2018legal basis\u2019\u201d that was previously \u201c\u2018unavailable.\u2019\u201d See <em>Ex parte Medellin, </em>223 S. W. 3d 315, 352 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). Thus, I would send this case back to the Texas courts, which must then apply the <em>Avena </em>judgment as binding law. See U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2; see also, <em>e. g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number><em>Dominguez </em>v. <em>State, </em>90 Tex. Crim. 92, 99, 234 S. W. 79, 83 (1921) (recognizing that treaties are \u201cpart of the supreme law of the land\u201d and that \u201cit is the duty of the courts of the state to take cognizance of, construe and give effect\u201d to them (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Because the majority concludes that the Nation\u2019s international legal obligation to enforce the ICJ\u2019s decision is not automatically a domestic legal obligation, it must then determine whether the President has the constitutional authority to enforce it. And the majority finds that he does not. See Part III, <em>ante.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">In my view, that second conclusion has broader implications than the majority suggests. The President here seeks to implement treaty provisions in which the United States agrees that the ICJ judgment is binding with respect to the <em>Avena </em>parties. Consequently, his actions draw upon his constitutional authority in the area of foreign affairs. In this case, his exercise of that power falls within that middle range of Presidential authority where Congress has neither specifically authorized nor specifically forbidden the Presidential action in question. See <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>343 U. S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). At the same time, if the President were to have the authority he asserts here, it would require setting aside a state procedural law.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">It is difficult to believe that in the exercise of his Article II powers pursuant to a ratified treaty, the President can <em>never </em>take action that would result in setting aside state law. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pink, </em>315 U. S. 203, 233 (1942) (\u201cNo State can rewrite our foreign policy to conform to its own domestic policies\u201d). Suppose that the President believes it necessary that he implement a treaty provision requiring a prisoner exchange involving someone in state custody in order to avoid a proven military threat. Cf. <em>Ware, </em>3 Dall., at 205. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Or suppose he believes it necessary to secure a foreign consul\u2019s treaty-based rights to move freely or to contact an arrested foreign national. Cf. Vienna Convention, Art. 34, 21 U. S. T., at 98. Does the Constitution require the President in each and every such instance to obtain a special statute authorizing his action? On the other hand, the Constitution must impose significant restrictions upon the President\u2019s ability, by invoking Article II treaty-implementation authority, to circumvent ordinary legislative processes and to preempt state law as he does so.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Previously this Court has said little about this question. It has held that the President has a fair amount of authority to make and to implement executive agreements, at least in respect to international claims settlement, and that this authority can require contrary state law to be set aside. See, <em>e. g., Pink, supra, </em>at 223, 230-231, 233-234; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Belmont, </em>301 U. S. 324, 326-327 (1937). It has made clear that principles of foreign sovereign immunity trump state law and that the Executive, operating without explicit legislative authority, can assert those principles in state court. See <em>Ex parte Peru, </em>318 U. S. 578, 588 (1943). It has also made clear that the Executive has inherent power to bring a lawsuit \u201cto carry out treaty obligations.\u201d <em>Sanitary Disk of Chicago </em>v. <em>United States, </em>266 U. S. 405, 425, 426 (1925). But it has reserved judgment as to \u201cthe scope of the President\u2019s power to preempt state law pursuant to authority delegated by ... a ratified treaty\u201d \u2014 a fact that helps to explain the majority\u2019s inability to find support in precedent for its own conclusions. <em>Barclays Bank PLC </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal., </em>512 U. S. 298, 329 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Given the Court\u2019s comparative lack of expertise in foreign affairs; given the importance of the Nation\u2019s foreign relations; given the difficulty of finding the proper constitutional balance among state and federal, executive and legislative, powers in such matters; and given the likely future importance of this Court\u2019s efforts to do so, I would very much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>hesitate before concluding that the Constitution implicitly sets forth broad prohibitions (or permissions) in this area. Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 523, n. 13 (stating that the Court\u2019s holding is \u201climited\u201d by the facts that (1) this treaty is non-self-executing and (2) the judgment of an international tribunal is involved).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">I would thus be content to leave the matter in the constitutional shade from which it has emerged. Given my view of this case, I need not answer the question. And I shall not try to do so. That silence, however, cannot be taken as agreement with the majority\u2019s Part III conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">The majority\u2019s two holdings taken together produce practical anomalies. They unnecessarily complicate the President\u2019s foreign affairs task insofar as, for example, they increase the likelihood of Security Council <em>Avena </em>enforcement proceedings, of worsening relations with our neighbor Mexico, of precipitating actions by other nations putting at risk American citizens who have the misfortune to be arrested while traveling abroad, or of diminishing our Nation\u2019s reputation abroad as a result of our failure to follow the \u201crule of law\u201d principles that we preach. The holdings also encumber Congress with a task (postratification legislation) that, in respect to many decisions of international tribunals, it may not want and which it may find difficult to execute. See <em>supra, </em>at 560 (discussing the problems with case-by-case legislation). At the same time, insofar as today\u2019s holdings make it more difficult to enforce the judgments of international tribunals, including technical non-politieally-controversial judgments, those holdings weaken that rule of law for which our Constitution stands. Cf. Hughes Defends Foreign Policies in Plea for Lodge, N. Y. Times, Oct. 31, 1922, p. 1, col. 1, p. 4, col. 1 (then-Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes stating that \u201cwe favor, and always have favored, an inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>national court of justice for the determination according to judicial standards of justiciable international disputes\u201d); Mr. Root Discusses International Problems, N. Y. Times, July 9, 1916, section 6, book review p. 276 (former Secretary of State and U. S. Senator Elihu Root stating that \u201c \u2018a court of international justice with a general obligation to submit all justiciable questions to its jurisdiction and to abide by its judgment is a primary requisite to any real restraint of law\u2019\u201d); Mills, The Obligation of the United States Toward the World Court, 114 Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 128 (1924) (Congressman Ogden Mills describing the efforts of then-Secretary of State John Hay, and others, to establish a world court, and the support therefor).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">These institutional considerations make it difficult to reconcile the majority\u2019s holdings with the workable Constitution that the Founders envisaged. They reinforce the importance, in practice and in principle, of asking Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s question: Does a treaty provision address the \u201cJudicial\u201d Branch rather than the \u201cPolitical Branches\u201d of Government. See <em>Foster, </em>2 Pet., at 314. And they show the wisdom of the well-established precedent that indicates that the answer to the question here is \u201cyes.\u201d See Parts I and II, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">In sum, a strong line of precedent, likely reflecting the views of the Founders, indicates that the treaty provisions before us and the judgment of the International Court of Justice address themselves to the Judicial Branch and consequently are self-executing. In reaching a contrary conclusion, the Court has failed to take proper account of that precedent and, as a result, the Nation may well break its word even though the President seeks to live up to that word and Congress has done nothing to suggest the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">For the reasons set forth, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>APPENDIXES</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Examples of Supreme Court decisions considering a treaty provision to be self-executing.
