S. C. \u00a7 360k, bars common-law claims challenging the safety and effectiveness of a medical device given premarket approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 52 Stat. 1040, as amended, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 301 <em>et seq., </em>has long required FDA approval for the introduction of new drugs into the market. Until the statutory enactment at issue here, however, the introduction of new medical devices was left largely for the States to supervise as they saw fit. See <em>Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr, </em>518 U. S. 470, 475-476 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">The regulatory landscape changed in the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s, as complex devices proliferated and some failed. Most notably, the Daikon Shield intrauterine device, introduced in 1970, was linked to serious infections and several deaths, not to mention a large number of pregnancies. Thousands of tort claims followed. R. Bacigal, The Limits of Litigation: The Daikon Shield Controversy 3 (1990). In the view of many, the Daikon Shield failure and its aftermath demonstrated the inability of the common-law tort system to manage the risks associated with dangerous devices. See, <em>e. g., </em>S. Foote, Managing the Medical Arms Race 151-152 (1992). Several States adopted regulatory measures, including California, which in 1970 enacted a law requiring premarket approval of medical devices. 1970 Cal. Stats, ch. 1573, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 26670-26693; see also Leflar &amp; Adler, The Preemption Pentad: Federal Preemption of Products Liability Claims After <em>Medtronic, </em>64 Tenn. L. Rev. 691,703, n. 66 (1997) (identifying 13 state statutes governing medical devices as of 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Congress stepped in with passage of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA), 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 360c <em>et seq.,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which swept back some state obligations and imposed a regime of detailed federal oversight. The MDA includes an express pre-emption provision that states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">\u201cExcept as provided in subsection (b) of this section, no State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">\u201c(1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">\u201c(2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.\u201d \u00a7360k(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">The exception contained in subsection (b) permits the FDA to exempt some state and local requirements from pre-emption.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">The new regulatory regime established various levels of oversight for medical devices, depending on the risks they present. Class I, which includes such devices as elastic bandages and examination gloves, is subject to the lowest level of oversight: \u201cgeneral controls,\u201d such as labeling requirements. \u00a7 360c(a)(l)(A); FDA, Device Advice: Device Classes, http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/3132.html (all Internet materials as visited Feb. 14, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). Class II, which includes such devices as powered wheelchairs and surgical drapes, <em>ibid., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>is subject in addition to \u201cspecial controls\u201d such as performance standards and postmarket surveillance measures, \u00a7 360c(a)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The devices receiving the most federal oversight are those in Class III, which include replacement heart valves, implanted cerebella stimulators, and pacemaker pulse generators, FDA, Device Advice: Device Classes, <em>supra. </em>In general, a device is assigned to Class III if it cannot be established that a less stringent classification would provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, and the device is \u201cpurported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health,\u201d or \u201cpresents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.\u201d \u00a7 360c(a)(l)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Although the MDA established a rigorous regime of premarket approval for new Class III devices, it grandfathered many that were already on the market. Devices sold before the MDA\u2019s effective date may remain on the market until the FDA promulgates, after notice and comment, a regulation requiring premarket approval. \u00a7\u00a7 360c(f)(l), 360e(b)(l). A related provision seeks to limit the competitive advantage grandfathered devices receive. A new device need not undergo premarket approval if the FDA finds it is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to another device exempt from premarket approval. \u00a7 360c(f)(l)(A). The agency\u2019s review of devices for substantial equivalence is known as the \u00a7 510(k) process, named after the statutory provision describing the review. Most new Class III devices enter the market through \u00a7 510(k). In 2005, for example, the FDA authorized the marketing of 3,148 devices under \u00a7 510(k) and granted premarket approval to just 32 devices. P. Hutt, R. Merrill, &amp; L. Grossman, Food and Drug Law 992 (3d ed. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Premarket approval is a \u201crigorous\u201d process. <em>Lohr, supra, </em>at 477. A manufacturer must submit what is typically a multivolume application. FDA, Device Advice \u2014 Premar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ket Approval (PMA) 18, http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/ pma/printer.html. It includes, among other things, full reports of all studies and investigations of the device\u2019s safety and effectiveness that have been published or should reasonably be known to the applicant; a \u201cfull statement\u201d of the device\u2019s \u201ccomponents, ingredients, and properties and of the principle or principles of operation\u201d; \u201ca full description of the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and, when relevant, packing and installation of, such device\u201d; samples or device components required by the FDA; and a specimen of the proposed labeling. \u00a7 360e(c)(l). Before deciding whether to approve the application, the agency may refer it to a panel of outside experts, 21 CFR \u00a7 814.44(a) (2007), and may request additional data from the manufacturer, \u00a7 360e(c)(l)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The FDA spends an average of 1,200 hours reviewing each application, <em>Lohr, </em>518 U. S., at 477, and grants premarket approval only if it finds there is a \u201creasonable assurance\u201d of the device\u2019s \u201csafety and effectiveness,\u201d \u00a7 360e(d). The agency must \u201cweig[h] any probable benefit to health from the use of the device against any probable risk of injury or illness from such use.\u201d \u00a7 360c(a)(2)(C). It may thus approve devices that present great risks if they nonetheless offer great benefits in light of available alternatives. It approved, for example, under its Humanitarian Device Exemption procedures, a ventricular assist device for children with failing hearts, even though the survival rate of children using the device was less than 50 percent. FDA, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Debakey VAD Child Left Ventricular Assist System-H030003, Summary of Safety and Probable Benefit 20 (2004), http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/pdf3/H030003b.pdf.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The premarket approval process includes review of the device\u2019s proposed labeling. The FDA evaluates safety and effectiveness under the conditions of use set forth on the label, \u00a7 360c(a)(2)(B), and must determine that the proposed labeling is neither false nor misleading, \u00a7 360e(d)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>After completing its review, the FDA may grant or deny premarket approval. \u00a7 360e(d). It may also condition approval on adherence to performance standards, 21 CFR \u00a7 861.1(b)(3), restrictions upon sale or distribution, or compliance with other requirements, \u00a7814.82. The agency is also free to impose device-specific restrictions by regulation. \u00a7 360j(e)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">If the FDA is unable to approve a new device in its proposed form, it may send an \u201capprovable letter\u201d indicating that the device could be approved if the applicant submitted specified information or agreed to certain conditions or restrictions. 21 CFR \u00a7 814.44(e). Alternatively, the agency may send a \u201cnot approvable\u201d letter, listing the grounds that justify denial and, where practical, measures that the applicant could undertake to make the device approvable. \u00a7 814.44(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Once a device has received premarket approval, the MDA forbids the manufacturer to make, without FDA permission, changes in design specifications, manufacturing processes, labeling, or any other attribute, that would affect safety or effectiveness. \u00a7 360e(d)(6)(A)(i). If the applicant wishes to make such a change, it must submit, and the FDA must approve, an application for supplemental premarket approval, to be evaluated under largely the same criteria as an initial application. \u00a7 360e(d)(6); 21 CFR \u00a7 814.39(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">After premarket approval, the devices are subject to reporting requirements. \u00a7 360i. These include the obligation to inform the FDA of new clinical investigations or scientific studies concerning the device which the applicant knows of or reasonably should know of, 21 CFR \u00a7 814.84(b)(2), and to report incidents in which the device may have caused or contributed to death or serious injury, or malfunctioned in a manner that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if it recurred, \u00a7 803.50(a). The FDA has the power to withdraw premarket approval based on newly reported data or existing information and must withdraw ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>proval if it determines that a device is unsafe or ineffective under the conditions in its labeling. \u00a7 360e(e)(l); see also \u00a7 360h(e) (recall authority).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Except as otherwise indicated, the facts set forth in this section appear in the opinion of the Court of Appeals. The device at issue is an Evergreen Balloon Catheter marketed by defendant-respondent Medtronic, Inc. It is a Class III device that received premarket approval from the FDA in 1994; changes to its label received supplemental approvals in 1995 and 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Charles Riegel underwent coronary angioplasty in 1996, shortly after suffering a myocardial infarction. App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a. His right coronary artery was diffusely diseased and heavily calcified. Riegel\u2019s doctor inserted the Evergreen Balloon Catheter into his patient\u2019s coronary artery in an attempt to dilate the artery, although the device\u2019s labeling stated that use was contraindicated for patients with diffuse or calcified stenoses. The label also warned that the catheter should not be inflated beyond its rated burst pressure of eight atmospheres. Riegel\u2019s doctor inflated the catheter five times, to a pressure of 10 atmospheres; on its fifth inflation, the catheter ruptured. Complaint 3. Riegel developed a heart block; was placed on life support, and underwent emergency coronary bypass surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Riegel and his wife Donna brought this lawsuit in April 1999, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. Their complaint alleged that Medtronic\u2019s catheter was designed, labeled, and manufactured in a manner that violated New York common law, and that these defects caused Riegel to suffer severe and permanent injuries. The complaint raised a number of common-law claims. The District Court held that the MDA pre-empted Riegel\u2019s claims of strict liability; breach of implied warranty; and negligence in the design, testing, inspection, distribution, labeling, marketing, and sale of the catheter. App. to</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Pet. for Cert. 68a; Complaint 3-4. It also held that the MDA pre-empted a negligent manufacturing claim insofar as it was not premised on the theory that Medtronic violated federal law. App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a. Finally, the court concluded that the MDA pre-empted Donna Riegel\u2019s claim for loss of consortium to the extent it was derivative of the pre-empted claims. <em>Id., </em>at 68a; see also <em>id., </em>at 75a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed these dismissals. 451 F. 3d 104 (2006). The court concluded that Medtronic was \u201cclearly subject to the federal, device-specific requirement of adhering to the standards contained in its individual, federally approved\u201d premarket approval application. <em>Id., </em>at 118. The Riegels\u2019 claims were pre-empted because they \u201cwould, if successful, impose state requirements that differed from, or added to,\u201d the device-specific federal requirements. <em>Id., </em>at 121. We granted certiorari.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 551 U. S. 1144 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Since the MDA expressly pre-empts only state requirements \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable ... to the device\u201d under federal law, \u00a7 360k(a)(l), we must determine whether the Federal Government has established requirements applicable to Medtronic\u2019s catheter. If so, we must then determine whether the Riegels\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>common-law claims are based upon New York requirements with respect to the device that are \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to,\u201d the federal ones, and that relate to safety and effectiveness. \u00a7 360k(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">We turn to the first question. In <em>Lohr, </em>a majority of this Court interpreted the MDA\u2019s pre-emption provision in a manner \u201csubstantially informed\u201d by the FDA regulation set forth at 21 CFR \u00a7 808.1(d). 518 U. S., at 495; see also <em>id., </em>at 500-501. That regulation says that state requirements are pre-empted \u201conly when the Food and Drug Administration has established specific counterpart regulations or there are other specific requirements applicable to a particular device . . . .\u201d 21 CFR \u00a7 808.1(d). Informed by the regulation, we concluded that federal manufacturing and labeling requirements applicable across the board to almost all medical devices did not pre-empt the common-law claims of negligence and strict liability at issue in <em>Lohr. </em>The federal requirements, we said, were not requirements specific to the device in question \u2014 they reflected \u201centirely generic concerns about device regulation generally.\u201d 518 U. S., at 501. While we disclaimed a conclusion that general federal requirements could never pre-empt, or general state duties never be pre-empted, we held that no pre-emption occurred in the case at hand based on a careful comparison between the state and federal duties at issue. <em>Id., </em>at 500-501.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Even though substantial-equivalence review under \u00a7 510(k) is device specific, <em>Lohr </em>also rejected the manufacturer\u2019s contention that \u00a7 510(k) approval imposed device-specific \u201crequirements.\u201d We regarded the fact that products entering the market through \u00a7 510(k) may be marketed only so long as they remain substantial equivalents of the relevant pre-1976 devices as a qualification for an exemption rather than a requirement. <em>Id., </em>at 493-494; see also <em>id., </em>at 513 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Premarket approval, in contrast, imposes \u201crequirements\u201d under the MDA as we interpreted it in <em>Lohr. </em>Unlike gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>eral labeling duties, premarket approval is specific to individual devices. And it is in no sense an exemption from federal safety review \u2014 it <em>is </em>federal safety review. Thus, the attributes that <em>Lohr </em>found lacking in \u00a7510(k) review are present here. While \u00a7510(k) is \u201c\u2018focused on <em>equivalence, </em>not safety,\u2019\u201d <em>id., </em>at 493 (opinion of the Court), premarket approval is focused on safety, not equivalence. While devices that enter the market through \u00a7510(k) have \u201cnever been formally reviewed under the MDA for safety or efficacy,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>the FDA may grant premarket approval only after it determines that a device offers a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, \u00a7 360e(d). And while the FDA does not \u201c\u2018require\u2019\u201d that a device allowed to enter the market as a substantial equivalent \u201ctake any particular form for any particular reason,\u201d 518 U. S., at 493, the FDA requires a device that has received premarket approval to be made with almost no deviations from the specifications in its approval application, for the reason that the FDA has determined that the approved form provides a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"AGL\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">We turn, then, to the second question: whether the Riegels\u2019 common-law claims rely upon \u201cany requirement\u201d of New York law applicable to the catheter that is \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to,\u201d federal requirements and that \u201crelates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device.\u201d \u00a7 360k(a). Safety and effectiveness are the very subjects of the Riegels\u2019 common-law claims, so the critical issue is whether New York\u2019s tort duties constitute \u201crequirements\u201d under the MDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">In <em>Lohr, </em>five Justices concluded that common-law causes of action for negligence and strict liability do impose \u201crequirement[s]\u201d and would be pre-empted by federal require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ments specific to a medical device. See 518 U. S., at 512 (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Scalia and Thomas, JJ.); <em>id., </em>at 503-505 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). We adhere to that view. In interpreting two other statutes we have likewise held that a provision pre-empting state \u201crequirements\u201d pre-empted common-law duties. <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Dow Agrosciences LLC, </em>544 U. S. 431 (2005), found common-law actions to be pre-empted by a provision of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act that said certain States \u201c \u2018shall not impose or continue in effect <em>any requirements </em>for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required under this subchapter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 443 (discussing 7 U. S, C. \u00a7 136v(b); emphasis added). <em>Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., </em>505 U. S. 504 (1992), held common-law actions preempted by a provision of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1334(b), which said that \u201c[n]o requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of aiiy cigarettes\u201d whose packages were labeled in accordance with federal law. See 505 U. S., at 523 (plurality opinion); <em>id., </em>at 548-549 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Congress is entitled to know what meaning this Court will assign to terms regularly used in its enactments. Absent other indication, reference to a State\u2019s \u201crequirements\u201d includes its common-law duties. As the plurality opinion said in <em>Cipollone, </em>common-law liability is \u201cpremised on the existence of a legal duty,\u201d and a tort judgment therefore establishes that the defendant has violated a state-law obligation. <em>Id., </em>at 522. And while the common-law remedy is limited to damages, a liability award \u201c \u2018can be, indeed is designed to be, a potent method of governing conduct and controlling policy.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">In the present case, there is nothing to contradict this normal meaning. To the contrary, in the context of this leg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>islation excluding common-law duties from the scope of preemption would make little sense. State tort law that requires a manufacturer\u2019s catheters to be safer, but hence less effective, than the model the FDA has approved disrupts the federal scheme no less than state regulatory law to the same effect. Indeed, one would think that tort law, applied by juries under a negligence or strict-liability standard, is less deserving of preservation. A state statute, or a regulation adopted by a state agency, could at least be expected to apply cost-benefit analysis similar to that applied by the experts at the FDA: How many more lives will be saved by a device which, along with its greater effectiveness, brings a greater risk of harm? A jury, on the other hand, sees only the cost of a more dangerous design, and is not concerned with its benefits; the patients who reaped those benefits are not represented in court. As Justice Breyer explained in <em>Lohr, </em>it is implausible that the MDA was meant to \u201cgrant greater power (to set state standards \u2018different from, or in addition to,\u2019 federal standards) to a single state jury than to state officials acting through state administrative or legislative lawmaking processes.\u201d 518 U. S., at 504. That perverse distinction is not required or even suggested by the broad language Congress chose in the MDA,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and we will not turn somersaults to create it.</p>\n<p id=\"AZY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The dissent would narrow the pre-emptive scope of the term \u201crequirement\u201d on the grounds that it is \u201cdifficult to believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse\u201d for consumers injured by FDA-approved devices. <em>Post, </em>at 337 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted). But, as we have explained, this is exactly what a pre-emption clause for medical devices does by its terms. The operation of a law enacted by Congress need not be seconded by a committee report on pain of judicial nullification. See, <em>e. g., Connecticut Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Germain, </em>503 U. S. 249, 253-254 (1992). It is not our job to speculate upon congressional motives. If we were to do so, however, the only indication available \u2014 the text of the statute \u2014 suggests that the solicitude for those injured by FDA-approved devices, which the dissent finds controlling, was overcome in Congress\u2019s estimation by solicitude for those who would suffer without new medical devices if juries were allowed to apply the tort law of 50 States to all innovations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In the case before us, the FDA has supported the position taken by our opinion with regard to the meaning of the statute. We have found it unnecessary to rely upon that agency view because we think the statute itself speaks clearly to the point at issue. If, however, we had found the statute ambiguous and had accorded the agency\u2019s current position deference, the dissent is correct, see <em>post, </em>at 338, n. 8, that\u2014 inasmuch as mere <em>Skidmore </em>deference would seemingly be at issue \u2014 the degree of deference might be reduced by the fact that the agency\u2019s earlier position was different. See <em>Skidmore </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U. S. 134 (1944); <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>v. <em>Mead Corp., </em>533 U. S. 218 (2001); <em>Good Samaritan Hospital </em>v. <em>Shalala, </em>508 U. S. 402, 417 (1993). But of course the agency\u2019s earlier position (which the dissent describes at some length, <em>post, </em>at 337-338, and finds preferable) is even more compromised, indeed deprived of all claim to deference, by the fact that it is no longer the agency\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The dissent also describes at great length the experience under the FDCA with respect to drugs and food and color additives. <em>Post, </em>at 339-342. Two points render the conclusion the dissent seeks to draw from that experience \u2014 that the pre-emption clause permits tort suits \u2014 unreliable. (1) It has not been established (as the dissent assumes) that no tort lawsuits are pre-empted by drug or additive approval under the FDCA. (2) If, as the dissent believes, the pre-emption clause permits tort lawsuits for medical devices just as they are (by hypothesis) permitted for drugs and additives; and if, as the dissent believes, Congress wanted the two regimes to be alike; Congress could have applied the pre-emption clause to the entire FDCA. It did not do so, but instead wrote a pre-emption clause that applies only to medical devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The Riegels contend that the duties underlying negligence, strict-liability, and implied-warranty claims are not preempted even if they impose \u201c \u2018requirements,\u2019 \u201d because general common-law duties are not requirements maintained \u201c\u2018with respect to devices.\u2019\u201d Brief for Petitioner 34-36. Again, a majority of this Court suggested otherwise in <em>Lohr. </em>See 518 U. S., at 504-505 (opinion of Breyer, J.); <em>id., </em>at 514 (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Scalia and Thomas, JJ.).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And with good reason. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>language of the statute does not bear the Riegels\u2019 reading. The MDA provides that no State \u201cmay establish or continue in effect <em>with respect to a device . . . any </em>requirement\u201d relating to safety or effectiveness that is different from, or in addition to, federal requirements. \u00a7 360k(a) (emphasis added). The Riegels\u2019 suit depends upon New York\u2019s \u201ccontinu[ing] in effect\u201d general tort duties \u201cwith respect to\u201d Medtronic\u2019s catheter. Nothing in the statutory text suggests that the pre-empted state requirement must apply <em>only </em>to the relevant device, or only to medical devices and not to all products and all actions in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The Riegels\u2019 argument to the contrary rests on the text of an FDA regulation which states that the MDA\u2019s pre-emption clause does not extend to certain duties, including \u201c[s]tate or local requirements of general applicability where the purpose of the requirement relates either to other products in addition to devices (e. g., requirements such as general electrical codes, and the Uniform Commercial Code (warranty of fitness)), or to unfair trade practices in which the requirements are not limited to devices.\u201d 21 CFR \u00a7 808.1(d)(1). Even assuming that this regulation could play a role in defining the MDA\u2019s pre-emptive scope, it does not provide unambiguous support for the Riegels\u2019 position. The agency\u2019s reading of its own rule is entitled to substantial deference, see <em>Auer </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>519 U. S. 452, 461 (1997), and the FDA\u2019s view put forward in this case is that the regulation does not refer to general tort duties of care, such as those underlying the claims in this case that a device was designed, labeled, or manufactured in an unsafe or ineffective manner, Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>27-28. That is so, according to the FDA, because the regulation excludes from pre-emption requirements that relate only incidentally to medical devices, but not other requirements. General tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>duties of care, unlike fire codes or restrictions on trade practices, \u201cdirectly regulate\u201d the device itself, including its design. <em>Id., </em>at 28. We find the agency\u2019s explanation less than compelling, since the same could be said of general requirements imposed by electrical codes, the Uniform Commercial Code, or unfair-trade-practice law, which the regulation specifically excludes from pre-emption.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Other portions of 21 CFR \u00a7 808.1, however, support the agency\u2019s view that \u00a7 808.1(d)(1) has no application to this case (though still failing to explain why electrical codes, the Uniform Commercial Code, or unfair-trade-practice requirements are different). Section 808.1(b) states that the MDA sets forth a \u201cgeneral rule\u201d pre-empting state duties \u201chaving the force and effect of law (whether established by statute, ordinance, regulation, or <em>court decision) </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This sentence is far more comprehensible under the FDA\u2019s view that \u00a7 808.1(d)(1) has no application here than under the Riegels\u2019 view. We are aware of no duties established by court decision other than common-law duties, and we are aware of no common-law duties that relate solely to medical devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The Riegels\u2019 reading is also in tension with the regulation\u2019s statement that adulteration and misbranding claims are pre-empted when they \u201cha[ve] the effect of establishing a substantive requirement for a specific device, e. g., a specific labeling requirement\u201d that is \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to,\u201d a federal requirement. \u00a7 808.1(d)(6)(h). Surely this means that the MDA would pre-empt a jury determination that the FDA-approved labeling for a pacemaker violated a state common-law requirement for additional warnings. The Riegels\u2019 reading of \u00a7 808.1(d)(1), however, would allow a claim for tortious mislabeling to escape pre-emption so long as such a claim could also be brought against objects other than medical devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">All in all, we think that \u00a7 808.1(d)(1) can add nothing to our analysis but confusion. Neither accepting nor rejecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>proposition that this regulation can properly be consulted to determine the statute\u2019s meaning; and neither accepting nor rejecting the FDA\u2019s distinction between general requirements that directly regulate and those that regulate only incidentally; the regulation fails to alter our interpretation of the text insofar as the outcome of this case is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">State requirements are pre-empted under the MDA only to the extent that they are \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to\u201d the requirements imposed by federal law. \u00a7 360k(a)(l). Thus, \u00a7 360k does not prevent a State from providing a damages remedy for claims premised on a violation of FDA regulations; the state duties in such a case \u201cparallel,\u201d rather than add to, federal requirements. <em>Lohr, </em>518 U. S., at 495; see also <em>id., </em>at 513 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The District Court in this case recognized that parallel claims would not be pre-empted, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 70a-71a, but it interpreted the claims here to assert that Medtronic\u2019s device violated state tort law notwithstanding compliance with the relevant federal requirements, see <em>id., </em>at 68a. Although the Riegels now argue that their lawsuit raises parallel claims, they made no such contention in their briefs before the Second Circuit, nor did they raise this argument in their petition for certiorari. We decline to address that argument in the first instance here.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-11\"> Unqualified \u00a7 360 <em>et seq. </em>numbers hereinafter refer to sections of 21 U.

But a law that permits an agency to exempt certain \u201crequirements\u201d from pre-emption does not suggest that no other \u201crequirements\u201d exist. The Riegels also invoke \u00a7 360h(d), which provides that compliance with certain FDA orders \u201cshall not relieve any person from liability under Federal or State law.\u201d This indicates that some state-law claims are not pre-empted, as we held in <em>Lohr. </em>But it could not possibly mean that <em>all </em>state-law claims are not pre-empted, since that would deprive the MDA pre-emption clause of all content.

It is an example of a statute whose text and general objective cover territory not actually envisioned by its authors. In such cases we have frequently concluded that \u201cit is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\u201d <em>Oncale </em>v. <em>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., </em>523 U. S. 75, 79-80 (1998). Accordingly, while I agree with Justice Ginsburg\u2019s description of the actual history and principal purpose of the pre-emption provision at issue in this case, <em>post, </em>at 335-342 (dissenting opinion), I am persuaded that its text does pre-empt state-law requirements that differ. I therefore write separately to add these few words about the MDA\u2019s history and the meaning of \u201crequirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">There is nothing in the preenactment history of the MDA suggesting that Congress thought state tort remedies had impeded the development of medical devices. Nor is there any evidence at all to suggest that Congress decided that the cost of injuries from Food and Drug Administration-approved medical devices was outweighed \u201cby solicitude for those who would suffer without new medical devices if juries were allowed to apply the tort law of 50 States to all innovations.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 326 (opinion of the Court). That is a policy argument advanced by the Court, not by Congress. As Justice Ginsburg persuasively explains, the overriding purpose of the legislation was to provide additional protection to consumers, not to withdraw existing protections. It was the then-recent development of state premarket regulatory regimes that explained the need for a provision pre-empting conflicting administrative rules. See <em>Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr, </em>518 U. S. 470, 489 (1996) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[W]hen Congress enacted \u00a7 360k, it was primarily concerned with the problem of specific, conflicting state statutes and regulations rather than the general duties enforced by common-law actions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>But the language <em>of the </em>provision reaches beyond such regulatory regimes to encompass other types of \u201crequirements.\u201d Because common-law rules administered by judges, like statutes and regulations, create and define legal obligations, some of them unquestionably qualify as \u201crequirements.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., </em>505 U. S. 504, 522 (1992) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[C]ommon-law damages actions of the sort raised by petitioner are premised on the existence of a legal duty, and it is difficult to say that such actions do not impose \u2018requirements or prohibitions.\u2019...

Moreover, I agree with the Court\u2019s cogent explanation of why the Riegels\u2019 claims are predicated on New York common-law duties that constitute requirements with respect to the device at issue that differ from federal requirements relating to safety and effectiveness. I therefore join the Court\u2019s judgment and all of its opinion except for Parts III-A and III-B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-5\"> The verdicts of juries who obey those rules, however, are not \u201crequirements\u201d of that kind. Juries apply rules, but do not make them. And while a jury\u2019s finding of liability may induce a defendant to alter its device or its label, this does not render the finding a \u201crequirement\u201d within the meaning of the MDA. \u201cA requirement is a rule of law that must be obeyed; an event, such as a jury verdict, that merely motivates an optional decision is not a requirement.\u201d <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U.

But \u00a7 360k(a)\u2019s confinement to medical devices hardly renders irrelevant to the proper construction of the MDA\u2019s preemption provision the long history of federal and state controls over drugs and additives in the interest of public health and welfare.

Premarket control, as already noted, commenced with drugs in 1938. In 1958, Congress required premarket approval for food additives. Food Additives Amendment, \u00a7 4, 72 Stat. 1785, as amended, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 348. In 1960, it required premarket approval for color additives. Color Additive Amendments, \u00a7 103(b), 74 Stat. 399, as amended, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 379e. In 1962, it expanded the premarket approval process for new drugs to include review for effectiveness. Drug Amendments, \u00a7102, 76 Stat. 781, as amended, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 321, 355. And in 1968, it required premarket approval for new animal drugs. Animal Drug Amendments, \u00a7 101(b), 82 Stat. 343, as amended, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 360b. None of these Acts contained a preemption clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The measures just listed, like the MDA, were all enacted with common-law personal injury litigation over def\u00e9ctive products a prominent part of the legal landscape.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>time of each enactment, no state regulations required premarket approval of the drugs or additives in question, so no preemption clause was needed as a check against potentially conflicting state regulatory regimes. See Brief for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>10.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">A different situation existed as to medical devices when Congress developed and passed the MDA. As the House Report observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">\u201cIn the absence of effective Federal regulation of medical devices, some States have established their own programs. The most comprehensive State regulation of which the Committee is aware is that of California, which in 1970 adopted the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law. This law requires premarket approval of all new medical devices, requires compliance of device manufacturers with good manufacturing practices and authorizes inspection of establishments which manufacture devices. Implementation of the Sherman Law has resulted in the <em>requirement </em>that intrauterine devices are subject to premarket clearance in California.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 94-853, p. 45 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">In sum, state premarket regulation of medical devices, not any design to suppress tort suits, accounts for Congress\u2019 inclusion of a preemption clause in the MDA; no such clause figures in earlier federal laws regulating drugs and additives, for States had not installed comparable control regimes in those areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Congress\u2019 experience regulating drugs also casts doubt on Medtronic\u2019s policy arguments for reading \u00a7360k(a) to preempt state tort claims. Section 360k(a) must preempt state common-law suits, Medtronic contends, because Congress would not have wanted state juries to second-guess the FDA\u2019s finding that a medical device is safe and effective when used as directed. Brief for Respondent 42-49. The Court is similarly minded. <em>Ante, </em>at 324-325.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">But the process for approving new drugs is at least as rigorous as the premarket approval process for medical devices.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Courts that have considered the question have overwhelmingly held that FDA approval of a new drug application does not preempt state tort suits.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Decades of drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>regulation thus indicate, contrary to Medtronic\u2019s argument, that Congress did not regard FDA regulation and state tort claims as mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Refusing to read \u00a7 360k(a) as an automatic bar to state common-law tort claims would hardly render the FDA\u2019s premarket approval of Medtronic\u2019s medical device application irrelevant to the instant suit. First, a \u201cpre-emption provision, by itself, does not foreclose (through negative implication) any possibility of implied conflict preemption.\u201d <em>Geier </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., </em>529 U. S. 861, 869 (2000) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). See also <em>Freightliner Corp. </em>v. <em>Myrick, </em>514 U. S. 280, 288-289 (1995). Accordingly, a medical device manufacturer may have a dis-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>positive defense if it can identify an actual conflict between the plaintiff\u2019s theory of the case and the FDA\u2019s premarket approval of the device in question. As currently postured, this case presents no occasion to take up this issue for Medtronic relies exclusively on \u00a7 360k(a) and does not argue conflict preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Second, a medical device manufacturer may be entitled to interpose a regulatory compliance defense based on the FDA\u2019s approval of the premarket application. Most States do not treat regulatory compliance as dispositive, but regard it as one factor to be taken into account by the jury. See Sharkey, Federalism in Action: FDA Regulatory Preemption in Pharmaceutical Cases in State Versus Federal Courts, 15 J. Law &amp; Pol\u2019y 1013, 1024 (2007). See also Restatement (Third) of Torts \u00a7 16(a) (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, Apr. 6, 2005). In those States, a manufacturer could present the FDA\u2019s approval of its medical device as evidence that it used due care in the design and labeling of the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The Court\u2019s broad reading of \u00a7 360k(a) saves the manufacturer from any need to urge these defenses. Instead, regardless of the strength of a plaintiff\u2019s case, suits will be barred <em>ab initio. </em>The constriction of state authority ordered today was not mandated by Congress and is at odds with the MDA\u2019s central purpose: to protect consumer safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">For the reasons stated, I would hold that \u00a7360k(a) does not preempt Riegel\u2019s suit. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in relevant part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\"> In part, <em>Lohr </em>spoke for the Court, and in part, for a plurality.
