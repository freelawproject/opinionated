S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 14501(c)(1), 41713(b)(4)(A); see Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 1555-C(3)(C), 1555-D (second sentence) (2004). We hold that the federal law pre-empts both provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">In 1978, Congress \u201cdetermin[ed] that \u2018maximum reliance on competitive market forces\u2019\u201d would favor lower airline fares and better airline service, and it enacted the Airline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Deregulation Act. <em>Morales </em>v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>504 U. S. 374, 378 (1992) (quoting 49 U. S. C. App. \u00a7 1302(a)(4) (1988 ed.)); see 92 Stat. 1705. In order to \u201censure that the States would not undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own,\u201d that Act \u201cincluded a pre-emption provision\u201d that said \u201cno State . . . shall enact or enforce any law . . . relating to rates, routes, or services of any air carrier.\u201d <em>Morales, supra, </em>at 378; 49 U. S. C. App. \u00a7 1305(a)(1) (1988 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">In 1980, Congress deregulated trucking. See Motor Carrier Act of 1980, 94 Stat. 793. And a little over a decade later, in 1994, Congress similarly sought to pre-empt state trucking regulation. See Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994,108 Stat. 1605-1606; see also ICC Termination Act of 1995, 109 Stat. 899. In doing so, it borrowed language from the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 and wrote into its 1994 law language that says: \u201c[A] State ... may not enact or enforce a law . . . related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier ... with respect to the transportation of property.\u201d 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14501(c)(1); see also \u00a7 41713(b)(4)(A) (similar provision for combined motor-air carriers).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The State of Maine subsequently adopted An Act To Regulate the Delivery and Sales of Tobacco Products and To Prevent the Sale of Tobacco Products to Minors, 2003 Me. Acts p. 1089, two sections of which are relevant here. The first section forbids anyone other than a Maine-licensed tobacco retailer to accept an order for delivery of tobacco. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 22, \u00a7 1555-C(1). It then adds that, when a licensed retailer accepts an order and ships tobacco, the retailer must \u201cutilize a delivery service\u201d that provides a special kind of <em>recipient-verification </em>service. \u00a7 1555-C(3)(C). The delivery service must make certain that (1) the person who bought the tobacco is the person to whom the package is addressed; (2) the person to whom the package is addressed is of legal age to purchase tobacco; (3) the person to whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the package is addressed has himself or herself signed for the package; and (4) the person to whom the package is addressed, if under the age of 27, has produced a valid government-issued photo identification with proof of age. <em>Ibid. </em>Violations are punishable by civil penalties. See \u00a7\u00a7 1555-C(3)(E) to C(3)(F) (first offense up to $1,500; subsequent offenses up to $5,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The second section forbids any person \u201cknowingly\u201d to \u201ctransport\u201d a \u201ctobacco product\u201d to \u201ca person\u201d in Maine unless either the sender or the receiver has a Maine license. \u00a71555-D. It then adds that a \u201cperson is <em>deemed to know </em>that a package contains a tobacco product\u201d (1) if the package is marked as containing tobacco and displays the name and license number of a Maine-licensed tobacco retailer; or (2) if the person receives the package from someone whose name appears on a list of m-licensed tobacco retailers that Maine\u2019s attorney general distributes to various package-delivery companies. <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added); see also \u00a7\u00a7 1555\u2014 C(3)(B), 1555-D(1). Violations are again punishable by civil penalties. \u00a7 1555-D(2) (up to $1,500 per violation against violator and/or violator\u2019s employer).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Respondents, several transport carrier associations, brought this lawsuit in federal court, claiming that federal law pre-empts several sections of Maine\u2019s statute. The District Court held (among other things) that federal law preempts the portions of the two sections we have described, namely, the \u201crecipient-verification\u201d provision (\u00a7 1555-C(3)(C)) and the \u201cdeemed to know\u201d provision (the second sentence of \u00a7 1555-D). See 377 F. Supp. 2d 197, 220 (Me. 2005). On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit agreed that federal law pre-empted the two provisions. 448 F. 3d 66, 82 (2006). We granted certiorari to review these determinations. 551 U. S. 1144 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In <em>Morales, </em>this Court interpreted the pre-emption provision in the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. See 504 U. S., at 378. And we follow <em>Morales </em>in interpreting similar language in the 1994 Act before us here. We have said that \u201cwhen judicial interpretations have settled the meaning of an existing statutory provision, repetition of the same language in a new statute indicates, as a general matter, the intent to incorporate its judicial interpretations as well.\u201d <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. </em>v. <em>Dabit, </em>547 U. S. 71, 85 (2006) (internal, quotation marks and alteration omitted). Here, the Congress that wrote the language before us copied the language of the air-carrier pre-emption provision of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. Compare 49 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 14501(c)(1), 41713(b)(4)(A), with 49 U. S. C. App. \u00a7 1305(a)(1) (1988 ed.); see also H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-677, pp. 82-83, 85 (1994) (hereinafter H. R. Conf. Rep.). And it did so fully aware of this Court\u2019s interpretation of that language as set forth in <em>Morales. </em>See H. R. Conf. Rep., at 83 (motor carriers will enjoy \u201cthe identical intrastate preemption of prices, routes and services as that originally contained in\u201d the Airline Deregulation Act); <em>ibid, </em>(expressing agreement with \u201cthe broad preemption interpretation adopted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Morales\u201d)-, id., </em>at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In <em>Morales, </em>the Court determined: (1) that \u201c[s]tate enforcement actions <em>having a connection with, or reference to,\u201d </em>carrier \u201c\u2018rates, routes, or services\u2019 are pre-empted,\u201d 504 U. S., at 384 (emphasis added); (2) that such pre-emption may occur even if a state law\u2019s effect on rates, routes, or services \u201cis only indirect,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 386 (internal quotation marks omitted); (3) that, in respect to pre-emption, it makes no difference whether a state law is \u201cconsistent\u201d or \u201cinconsistent\u201d with federal regulation, <em>id., </em>at 386-387 (emphasis deleted); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>and (4) that pre-emption occurs at least where state laws have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d related to Congress\u2019 deregulatory and pre-emption-related objectives, <em>id., </em>at 390. The Court described Congress\u2019 overarching goal as helping ensure transportation rates, routes, and services that reflect \u201cmaximum reliance on competitive market forces,\u201d thereby stimulating \u201cefficiency, innovation, and low prices,\u201d as well as \u201cvariety\u201d and \u201cquality.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 378 (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>Morales </em>held that, given these principles, federal law pre-empts States from enforcing their consumer-fraud statutes against deceptive airline-fare advertisements. <em>Id., </em>at 391. See <em>American Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wolens, </em>513 U. S. 219, 226-228 (1995) (federal law pre-empts application of a State\u2019s general consumer-protection statute to an airline\u2019s frequent flyer program).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Finally, <em>Morales </em>said that federal law might not pre-empt state laws that affect fares in only a \u201ctenuous, remote, or peripheral. . . manner,\u201d such as state laws forbidding gambling. 504 U. S., at 390 (internal quotation marks omitted). But the Court did not say where, or how, \u201cit would be appropriate to draw the line,\u201d for the state law before it did not \u201cpresent a borderline question.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Wolens, supra, </em>at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">In light of <em>Morales, </em>we find that federal law pre-empts the Maine laws at issue here. Section 1555-C(3)(C) of the Maine statute forbids licensed tobacco retailers to employ a \u201cdelivery service\u201d unless that service follows particular delivery procedures. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 22, \u00a7 1555-C(3)(C). In doing so, it focuses on trucking and other motor-carrier services (which make up a substantial portion of all \u201cdelivery services,\u201d \u00a7 1551(1-C)), thereby creating a direct \u201cconnection with\u201d motor-carrier services. See <em>Morales, </em>504 U. S., at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqm\">At the same time, the provision has a \u201csignificant\u201d and adverse \u201cimpact\u201d in respect to the federal Act\u2019s ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>achieve its pre-emption-related objectives. <em>Id., </em>at 390. The Solicitor General and the carrier associations claim (and Maine does not deny) that the law will require carriers to offer a system of services that the market does not now provide (and which the carriers would prefer not to offer). And even were that not so, the law would freeze into place services that carriers might prefer to discontinue in the future. The Maine law thereby produces the very effect that the federal law sought to avoid, namely, a State\u2019s direct substitution of its own governmental commands for \u201ccompetitive market forces\u201d in determining (to a significant degree) the services that motor carriers will provide. <em>Id., </em>at 378 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">We concede that the regulation here is less \u201cdirect\u201d than it might be, for it tells <em>shippers </em>what to choose rather than <em>carriers </em>what to do. Nonetheless, the effect of the regulation is that carriers will have to offer tobacco delivery services that differ significantly from those that, in the absence of the regulation, the market might dictate. And that being so, \u201ctreating sales restrictions and purchase restrictions differently for pre-emption purposes would make no sense.\u201d <em>Engine Mfrs. Assn. </em>v. <em>South Coast Air Quality Management Dist., </em>541 U. S. 246, 255 (2004). If federal law preempts state efforts to regulate, and consequently to affect, the advertising <em>about </em>carrier rates and services at issue in <em>Morales, </em>it must pre-empt Maine\u2019s efforts to regulate carrier delivery services themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Section 1555-D\u2019s \u201cdeemed to know\u201d provision applies yet more directly to motor-carrier services. The provision creates a conclusive presumption of carrier knowledge that a shipment contains tobacco when it is marked as originating from a Maine-licensed tobacco retailer or is sent by anyone Maine has specifically identified as an unlicensed tobacco retailer. That presumption means that the Maine law imposes civil liability upon the carrier, not simply for its knowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>transport of (unlicensed) tobacco, but for the carrier\u2019s <em>failure sufficiently to examine every package. </em>The provision thus requires the carrier to check each shipment for certain markings and to compare it against the Maine attorney general\u2019s list of proscribed shippers. And it thereby directly regulates a significant aspect of the motor carrier\u2019s package pickup and delivery service. In this way it creates the kind of state-mandated regulation that the federal Act pre-empts.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Maine replies that the regulation will impose no significant additional costs upon carriers. But even were that so (and the carriers deny it), Maine\u2019s reply is off the mark. As with the recipient-verification provision, the \u201cdeemed to know\u201d provision would freeze in place and immunize from competition a service-related system that carriers do not (or in the future might not) wish to provide. <em>Supra, </em>at 371-372. To allow Maine to insist that the carriers provide a special checking system would allow other States to do the same. And to interpret the federal law to permit these, and similar, state requirements could easily lead to a patchwork of state service-determining laws, rules, and regulations. That state regulatory patchwork is inconsistent with Congress\u2019 major legislative effort to leave such decisions, where federally unregulated, to the competitive marketplace. See H. R. Conf. Rep., at 87. If federal law pre-empts state regulation of the details of an air carrier\u2019s frequent flyer program, a program that primarily <em>promotes </em>carriage, see <em>Wolens, supra, </em>at 226-228, it must pre-empt state regulation of the essential details of a motor carrier\u2019s system for picking up, sorting, and carrying goods \u2014 essential details of the carriage itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Maine\u2019s primary arguments focus upon the <em>reason why </em>it has enacted the provisions in question. Maine argues for an exception from pre-emption on the ground that its laws help it prevent minors from obtaining cigarettes. In Maine\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>view, federal law does not pre-empt a State\u2019s efforts to protect its citizens\u2019 public health, particularly when those laws regulate so dangerous an activity as underage smoking.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Despite the importance of the public health objective, we cannot agree with Maine that the federal law creates an exception on that basis, exempting state laws that it would otherwise pre-empt. The Act says nothing about a public health exception. To the contrary, it explicitly lists a set of exceptions (governing motor vehicle safety, certain local route controls, and the like), but the list says nothing about public health. See 49 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 14501(c)(2) to (c)(3); see also \u00a7 41713(b)(4)(B). Maine suggests that the provision\u2019s history indicates that Congress\u2019 primary concern was not with the sort of law it has enacted, but instead with state \u201ceconomic\u201d regulation. See, <em>e. g., </em>H. R. Conf. Rep., at 88; see also <em>Columbus </em>v. <em>Ours Garage &amp; Wrecker Service, Inc., </em>536 U. S. 424, 440 (2002). But it is frequently difficult to distinguish between a State\u2019s \u201ceconomic\u2019\u2019-related and \u201chealth\u201d-related motivations, see <em>infra, </em>at 375, and, indeed, the parties vigorously dispute Maine\u2019s actual motivation for the laws at issue here. Consequently, it is not surprising that Congress declined to insert the term \u201ceconomic\u201d into the operative language now before us, despite having at one time considered doing so. See S. Rep. No. 95-631, p. 171 (1978) (reprinting Senate bill).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Maine\u2019s argument for an implied \u201cpublic health\u201d or \u201ctobacco\u201d exception to federal pre-emption rests largely upon (1) legislative history containing a list of nine States, with laws resembling Maine\u2019s, that Congress thought did not regulate \u201cintrastate prices, routes and services of motor carriers,\u201d see H. R. Conf. Rep., at 86; and (2) the Synar Amendment, a law that denies States federal funds unless they forbid sales of tobacco to minors, see 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 300x-26(a)(1), (b)(1). The legislative history, however, does not suggest Congress made a firm judgment about, or even focused upon, the issue now before us. And the Synar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Amendment nowhere mentions the particular state enforcement method here at issue; indeed, it does not mention specific state enforcement methods at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Maine\u2019s inability to find significant support for some kind of \u201cpublic health\u201d exception is not surprising. \u201cPublic health\u201d does not define itself. Many products create \u201cpublic health\u201d risks of differing kind and degree. To accept Maine\u2019s justification in respect to a rule regulating services would legitimate rules regulating routes or rates for similar public health reasons. And to allow Maine directly to regulate carrier services would permit other States to do the same. Given the number of States through which carriers travel, the number of products, the variety of potential adverse public health effects, the many different kinds of regulatory rules potentially available, and the difficulty of finding a legal criterion for separating permissible from impermissible public-health-oriented regulations, Congress is unlikely to have intended an implicit general \u201cpublic health\u201d exception broad enough to cover even the shipments at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">This is not to say that this federal law generally pre-empts state public health regulation: for instance, state regulation that broadly prohibits certain forms of conduct and affects, say, truckdrivers, only in their capacity as members of the public <em>(e.g., </em>a prohibition on smoking in certain public places). We have said that federal law does not pre-empt state laws that affect rates, routes, or services in \u201ctoo tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner.\u201d <em>Morales, </em>504 U. S., at 390 (internal quotation marks omitted). And we have written that the state laws whose \u201ceffect\u201d is \u201cforbidden\u201d under federal law are those with a <em>\u201csignificant </em>impact\u201d on carrier rates, routes, or services. <em>Id., </em>at 388, 390 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">In this ease, the state law is not general, it does not affect truckers solely in their capacity as members of the general public, the impact is significant, and the connection with trucking is not tenuous, remote, or peripheral. The state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>statutes aim directly at the carriage of goods, a commercial field where carriage by commercial motor vehicles plays a major role. The state statutes require motor-carrier operators to perform certain services, thereby limiting their ability to provide incompatible alternative services; and they do so simply because the State seeks to enlist the motor-carrier operators as allies in its enforcement efforts. Given these circumstances, from the perspective of pre-emption, this case is no more \u201cborderline\u201d than was <em>Morales. Id., </em>at 390 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Wolens, </em>513 U. S., at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Maine adds that it possesses legal authority to prevent <em>any </em>tobacco shipments from entering into or moving within the State, and that the broader authority must encompass the narrower authority to regulate the <em>manner </em>of tobacco shipments. But even assuming purely for argument\u2019s sake that Maine possesses the broader authority, its conclusion does not follow. To accept that conclusion would permit Maine to regulate carrier routes, carrier rates, and carrier services, all on the ground that such regulation would not restrict carriage of the goods as seriously as would a total ban on shipments. And it consequently would severely undermine the effectiveness of Congress\u2019 pre-emptive provision. Indeed, it would create the very exception that we have just rejected, extending that exception to all other products a State might ban. We have explained why we do not believe Congress intended that result. <em>Supra, </em>at 373-375 and this page.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Finally, Maine says that to set aside its regulations will seriously harm its efforts to prevent cigarettes from falling into the hands of minors. The Solicitor General denies that this is so. He suggests that Maine, like other States, can prohibit all persons from providing tobacco products to minors (as it already has, see Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 22, \u00a7 1555-B(2) (Supp. 2007)); that it can ban all non-face-to-face sales of tobacco; that it might pass other laws of general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>(non-carrier-specific) applicability; and that it can, if necessary, seek appropriate federal regulation (see, <em>e.g., </em>H. R. 4081, 110th Cong., 1st Sess. (2007) (proposed bill regulating tobacco shipment); H. R. 4128, 110th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7\u00a7 1411-1416, pp. 577-583 (2007) (proposed bill providing criminal penalties for trafficking in contraband tobacco)). Regardless, given <em>Morales, </em>where the Court held that federal law pre-empts state consumer-protection laws, we find that federal law must also pre-empt Maine\u2019s efforts directly to regulate carrier services.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b635-7\">Justice Ginsburg,</author>\n<p id=\"A-_\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Today\u2019s decision declares key portions of Maine\u2019s Tobacco Delivery Law incompatible with the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1.994 (FAAAA). The breadth of the FAAAA\u2019s preemption language, 49 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 14501(c)(1) and 41713(b)(4)(A), coupled with our decisions closely in point, <em>Morales </em>v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>504 U. S. 374 (1992), and <em>American Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wolens, </em>513 U. S. 219 (1995), impel that conclusion. I write separately to emphasize the large regulatory gap left by an application of the FAAAA perhaps overlooked by Congress, and the urgent need for the National Legislature to fill that gap.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Tobacco use by children and adolescents, we have recognized, may be \u201cthe single most significant threat to public health in the United States.\u201d <em>FDA </em>v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>529 U. S. 120, 161 (2000). But no comprehensive federal law currently exists to prevent tobacco sellers from exploiting the underage market. Instead, Congress has encouraged state efforts. Congress has done so by providing funding incentives for the States to pass legislation making it unlawful to \u201csell or distribute any [tobacco] product to any individual under the age of 18.\u201d Synar Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>ment, 106 Stat. 394, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 300x-26(a)(l). See <em>Lorillard Tobacco Co. </em>v. <em>Reilly, </em>533 U. S. 525, 552, 571 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">State measures to prevent youth access to tobacco, however, are increasingly thwarted by the ease with which tobacco products can be purchased through the Internet. \u201cAs cyberspace acts as a risk-free zone where minors can anonymously purchase tobacco, unrestricted online tobacco sales create a major barrier to comprehensive youth tobacco control.\u201d Brief for Tobacco Control Legal Consortium et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>10 (footnote omitted). See also Brief for California et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>9 (\u201cIllegal Internet tobacco sales have reached epidemic proportions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Maine and its <em>amici </em>maintain that, to guard against delivery of tobacco products to children, \u201cthe same sort of age verification safeguards [must be] used when tobacco is handed over-the-doorstep as ... when it is handed over-the-counter.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 8; Brief for California et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>11; Brief for Tobacco Control Legal Consortium et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>11-12; cf. Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>16. The FAAAA\u2019s broad preemption provisions, the Court holds, bar States from adopting this sensible enforcement strategy. While I join the Court\u2019s opinion, I doubt that the drafters of the FAAAA, a statute designed to deregulate the carriage of goods, anticipated the measure\u2019s facilitation of minors\u2019 access to tobacco. Now alerted to the problem, Congress has the capacity to act with care and dispatch to provide an effective solution.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b636-6\">Justice Scalia,</author>\n<p id=\"ASv\">concurring in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">I join the opinion of the Court, except those portions <em>(ante, </em>at 370, 373, and 374) that rely on the reports of committees of one House of Congress to show the intent of that full House and of the other \u2014 with regard to propositions that are apparent from the text of the law, unnecessary to the disposition of the case, or both.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
