S. 220, 244 (2005), instructed district courts to read the United States Sentencing Guidelines as \u201ceffectively advisory,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 245. In accord with 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(a), the Guidelines, formerly mandatory, now serve as one factor among several courts must consider in determining an appropriate sentence. <em>Booker </em>further instructed that \u201creason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>ableness\u201d is the standard controlling appellate review of the sentences district courts impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Under the statute criminalizing the manufacture and distribution of crack cocaine, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 841, and the relevant Guidelines prescription, \u00a72D1.1, a drug trafficker dealing in crack cocaine is subject to the same sentence as one dealing in 100 times more powder cocaine. The question here presented is whether, as the Court of Appeals held in this case, \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 174 Fed. Appx. 798, 799 (CA4 2006) <em>(per curiam). </em>We hold that, under <em>Booker, </em>the cocaine Guidelines, like all other Guidelines, are advisory only, and that the Court of Appeals erred in holding the crack/powder disparity effectively mandatory. A district judge must include the Guidelines range in the array of factors warranting consideration. The judge may determine, however, that, in the particular case, a within-Guidelines sentence is \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d to serve the objectives of sentencing. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). In making that determination, the judge may consider the disparity between the Guidelines\u2019 treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In September 2004, petitioner Derrick Kimbrough was indicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and charged with four offenses: conspiracy to distribute crack and powder cocaine; possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine; possession with intent to distribute powder cocaine; and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense. Kimbrough pleaded guilty to all four charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Under the relevant statutes, Kimbrough\u2019s plea subjected him to an aggregate sentence of 15 years to life in prison: 10 years to life for the three drug offenses, plus a consecutive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>term of 5 years to life for the firearm offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In order to determine the appropriate sentence within this statutory range, the District Court first calculated Kimbrough\u2019s sentence under the advisory Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Kimbrough\u2019s guilty plea acknowledged that he was accountable for 56 grams of crack cocaine and 92.1 grams of powder cocaine. This quantity of drugs yielded a base offense level of 32 for the three drug charges. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) (Nov. 2004) (USSG). Finding that Kimbrough, by asserting sole culpability for the crime, had testified falsely at his codefendant\u2019s trial, the District Court increased his offense level to 34. See \u00a7 3C1.1. In accord with the presentence report, the court determined that Kimbrough\u2019s criminal history category was II. An offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of II yielded a Guidelines range of 168 to 210 months for the three drug charges. See <em>id., </em>ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table. The Guidelines sentence for the firearm offense was the statutory minimum, 60 months. See \u00a7 2K2.4(b). Kimbrough\u2019s final advisory Guidelines range was thus 228 to 270 months, or 19 to 22.5 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">A sentence in this range, in the District Court\u2019s judgment, would have been \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d to accomplish the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(a). App. 72. As required by \u00a7 3553(a), the court took into account the \u201cnature and circumstances\u201d of the offense and Kimbrough\u2019s \u201chistory and characteristics.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 72-73. The court also commented that the case exemplified the \u201cdisproportionate and unjust effect that crack cocaine guidelines have in sentencing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 72. In this regard, the court contrasted Kimbrough\u2019s Guidelines range of 228 to 270 months with the range that would have applied had he been accountable for an equivalent amount of powder cocaine: 97 to 106 months, inclusive of the 5-year mandatory minimum for the firearm charge, see USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c); <em>id., </em>ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table. Concluding that the statutory minimum sentence was \u201cclearly long enough\u201d to accomplish the objectives listed in \u00a7 3553(a), the court sentenced Kimbrough to 15 years, or 180 months, in prison plus 5 years of supervised release. App. 74-75.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">In an unpublished <em>per curiam </em>opinion, the Fourth Circuit vacated the sentence. Under Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals observed, a sentence \u201coutside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 174 Fed. Appx., at 799 (citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Eura, </em>440 F. 3d 625, 633-634 (CA4 2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">We granted certiorari, 551 U. S. 1113 (2007), to determine whether the crack/powder disparity adopted in the United States Sentencing Guidelines has been rendered \u201cadvisory\u201d by our decision in <em>Booker:</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">We begin with some background on the different treatment of crack and powder cocaine under the federal sentencing laws. Crack and powder cocaine are two forms of the same drug. Powder cocaine, or cocaine hydrochloride, is generally inhaled through the nose; it may also be mixed with water and injected. See United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 5, 12 (Feb. 1995), available at http:// www.ussc.gov/crack/exec.htm (hereinafter 1995 Report). (All Internet materials as visited Dec. 7, 2007, and included in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file.) Crack cocaine, a type of cocaine base, is formed by dissolving powder cocaine and baking soda in boiling water. <em>Id., </em>at 14. The resulting solid is divided into single-dose \u201crocks\u201d that users smoke. <em>Ibid. </em>The active ingredient in powder and crack cocaine is the same. <em>Id., </em>at 9. The two forms of the drug also have the same physiological and psychotropic effects, but smoking crack cocaine allows the body to absorb the drug much faster than inhaling powder cocaine, and thus produces a shorter, more intense high. <em>Id., </em>at 15-19.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Although chemically similar, crack and powder cocaine are handled very differently for sentencing purposes. The 100-to-1 ratio yields sentences for crack offenses three to six times longer than those for powder offenses involving equal amounts of drugs. See United States Sentencing Commission, Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Policy iv (May 2002), available at http://www.ussc.gov/ r_congress/02crack/2002crackrpt.pdf (hereinafter 2002 Report).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This disparity means that a major supplier of powder cocaine may receive a shorter sentence than a low-level dealer who buys powder from the supplier but then converts it to crack. See 1995 Report 193-194.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The crack/powder disparity originated in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (1986 Act), 100 Stat. 3207. The 1986 Act created a two-tiered scheme of five- and ten-year mandatory minimum sentences for drug manufacturing and distribution offenses. Congress sought \u201cto link the ten-year mandatory minimum trafficking prison term to major drug dealers and to link the five-year minimum term to serious traffickers.\u201d 1995 Report 119. The 1986 Act uses the weight of the drugs involved in the offense as the sole proxy to identify \u201cmajor\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d dealers. For example, any defendant responsible for 100 grams of heroin is subject to the five-year mandatory minimum, see 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(i) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), and any defendant responsible for 1,000 grams of heroin is subject to the ten-year mandatory minimum, see \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Crack cocaine was a relatively new drug when the 1986 Act was signed into law, but it was already a matter of great public concern: \u201cDrug abuse in general, and crack cocaine in particular, had become in public opinion and in members\u2019 minds a problem of overwhelming dimensions.\u201d 1995 Report 121. Congress apparently believed that crack was significantly more dangerous than powder cocaine in that: (1) crack was highly addictive; (2) crack users and dealers were more likely to be violent than users and dealers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>other drugs; (3) crack was more harmful to users than powder, particularly for children who had been exposed by their mothers\u2019 drug use during pregnancy; (4) crack use was especially prevalent among teenagers; and (5) crack\u2019s potency and low cost were making it increasingly popular. See 2002 Report 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Based on these assumptions, the 1986 Act adopted a \u201c100-to-1 ratio\u201d that treated every gram of crack cocaine as the equivalent of 100 grams of powder cocaine. The 1986 Act\u2019s five-year mandatory minimum applies to any defendant accountable for 5 grams of crack or 500 grams of powder, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(ii), (iii); its ten-year mandatory minimum applies to any defendant accountable for 50 grams of crack or 5,000 grams of powder, \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii), (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">While Congress was considering adoption of the 1986 Act, the Sentencing Commission was engaged in formulating the Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the main, the Commission developed Guidelines sentences using an empirical approach based on data about past sentencing practices, including 10,000 presentence investigation reports. See USSG \u00a71A.1, intro, comment., pt. A, \u00b6 3. The Commission \u201cmodified] and adjust[ed] past practice in the interests of greater rationality, avoiding inconsistency, complying with congressional instructions, and the like.\u201d <em>Rita </em>v. <em>United States, </em>551 U. S. 338, 349 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The Commission did not use this empirical approach in developing the Guidelines sentences for drug-trafficking offenses. Instead, it employed the 1986 Act\u2019s weight-driven scheme. The Guidelines use a drug quantity table based on drug type and weight to set base offense levels for drug-trafficking offenses. See USSG \u00a72Dl.l(c). In setting of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>fense levels for crack and powder cocaine, the Commission, in line with the 1986 Act, adopted the 100-to-l ratio. The statute itself specifies only two quantities of each drug, but the Guidelines \u201cgo further and set sentences for the full range of possible drug quantities using the same 100-to-l quantity ratio.\u201d 1995 Report 1. The Guidelines\u2019 drug quantity table sets base offense levels ranging from 12, for offenses involving less than 250 milligrams of crack (or 25 grams of powder), to 38, for offenses involving more than 1.5 kilograms of crack (or 150 kilograms of powder). USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Although the Commission immediately used the 100-to-l ratio to define base offense levels for all crack and powder offenses, it later determined that the crack/powder sentencing disparity is generally unwarranted. Based on additional research and experience with the 100-to-l ratio, the Commission concluded that the disparity \u201cfails to meet the sentencing objectives set forth by Congress in both the Sentencing Reform Act and the 1986 Act.\u201d 2002 Report 91. In a series of reports, the Commission identified three problems with the crack/powder disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">First, the Commission reported, the 100-to-l ratio rested on assumptions about \u201cthe relative harmfulness of the two drugs and the relative prevalence of certain harmful conduct associated with their use and distribution that more recent research and data no longer support.\u201d <em>Ibid.; </em>see United States Sentencing Commission, Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 8 (May 2007), available at http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/cocaine2007.pdf (hereinafter 2007 Report) (ratio Congress embedded in the statute far \u201coverstate^]\u201d both \u201cthe relative harmfulness\u201d of crack co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>caine, and the \u201cseriousness of most crack cocaine offenses\u201d). For example, the Commission found that crack is associated with \u201csignificantly less trafficking-related violence . . . than previously assumed.\u201d 2002 Report 100. It also observed that \u201cthe negative effects of prenatal crack cocaine exposure are identical to the negative effects of prenatal powder cocaine exposure.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 94. The Commission furthermore noted that \u201cthe epidemic of crack cocaine use by youth never materialized to the extent feared.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Second, the Commission concluded that the crack/powder disparity is inconsistent with the 1986 Act\u2019s goal of punishing major drug traffickers more severely than low-level dealers. Drug importers and major traffickers generally deal in powder cocaine, which is then converted into crack by street-level sellers. See 1995 Report 66-67. But the 100-to-l ratio can lead to the \u201canomalous\u201d result that \u201cretail crack dealers get longer sentences than the wholesale drug distributors who supply them the powder cocaine from which their crack is produced.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Finally, the Commission stated that the crack/powder sentencing differential \u201cfosters disrespect for and lack of confidence in the criminal justice system\u201d because of a \u201cwidely-held perception\u201d that it \u201cpromotes unwarranted disparity based on race.\u201d 2002 Report 103. Approximately 85 percent of defendants convicted of crack offenses in federal court are black; thus the severe sentences required by the 100-to-l ratio are imposed \u201cprimarily upon black offenders.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Despite these observations, the Commission\u2019s most recent reports do not urge identical treatment of crack and powder cocaine. In the Commission\u2019s view, \u201csome differential in the quantity-based penalties\u201d for the two drugs is warranted, <em>id., </em>at 102, because crack is more addictive than powder, crack offenses are more likely to involve weapons or bodily, injury, and crack distribution is associated with higher levels of crime, see <em>id., </em>at 93-94, 101-102. But the 100-to-l crack/ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>powder ratio, the Commission concluded, significantly overstates the differences between the two forms of the drug. Accordingly, the Commission recommended that the ratio be \u201csubstantially\u201d reduced. <em>Id., </em>at viii.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The Commission has several times sought to achieve a reduction in the crack/powder ratio. In 1995, it proposed amendments to the Guidelines that would have replaced the 100-to-l ratio with a 1-to-l ratio. Complementing that change, the Commission would have installed special enhancements for trafficking offenses involving weapons or bodily injury. See Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts, 60 Fed. Reg. 25075-25077 (1995). Congress, acting pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 994(p),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> rejected the amendments. See Pub. L. 104-38, \u00a7 1, 109 Stat. 334. Simultaneously, however, Congress directed the Commission to \u201cpropose revision of the drug quantity ratio of crack cocaine to powder cocaine under the relevant statutes and guidelines.\u201d \u00a7 2(a)(2), <em>id., </em>at 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">In response to this directive, the Commission issued reports in 1997 and 2002 recommending that Congress change the 100-to-l ratio prescribed in the 1986 Act. The 1997 Report proposed a 5-to-l ratio. See United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 2 (Apr. 1997), http://www.ussc.gov/ r_congress/newcrack.pdf. The 2002 Report recommended lowering the ratio \u201cat least\u201d to 20 to 1. 2002 Report viii. Neither proposal prompted congressional action.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The Commission\u2019s most recent report, issued in 2007, again urged Congress to amend the 1986 Act to reduce the 100-to-l ratio. This time, however, the Commission did not simply await congressional action. Instead, the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>adopted an ameliorating change in the Guidelines. See 2007 Report 9. The alteration, which became effective on November 1, 2007, reduces the base offense level associated with each quantity of crack by two levels. See Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts, 72 Fed. Reg. 28571-28572 (2007).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This modest amendment yields sentences for crack offenses between two and five times longer than sentences for equal amounts of powder. See <em>ibid. </em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Describing the amendment as \u201conly... a partial remedy\u201d for the problems generated by the crack/powder disparity, the Commission noted that \u201c[a]ny comprehensive solution requires appropriate' legislative action by Congress.\u201d 2007 Report 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">With this history of the crack/powder sentencing ratio in mind, we next consider the status of the Guidelines tied to the ratio after our decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U. S. 220 (2005). In <em>Booker, </em>the Court held that the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines system violated the Sixth Amendment. See <em>id., </em>at 226-227. The <em>Booker </em>remedial opinion determined that the appropriate cure was to sever and excise the provision of the statute that rendered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Guidelines mandatory, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This modification of the federal sentencing statute, we explained, \u201cmakes the Guidelines effectively advisory.\u201d 543 U. S., at 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The statute, as modified by <em>Booker, </em>contains an overarching provision instructing district courts to \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to accomplish the goals of sentencing, including \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense,\u201d \u201cto promote respect for the law,\u201d \u201cto provide just punishment for the offense,\u201d \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d and \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). The statute further provides that, in determining the appropriate sentence, the court should consider a number of factors, including \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense,\u201d \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d \u201cthe sentencing range established\u201d by the Guidelines, \u201cany pertinent policy statement\u201d issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to its statutory authority, and \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In sum, while the statute still requires a court to give respectful consideration to the Guidelines, see <em>Gall </em>v. <em>United States, ante, </em>at 46, 49, <em>Booker </em>\u201cpermits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well,\u201d 543 U. S., at 245-246.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The Government acknowledges that the Guidelines \u201care now advisory\u201d and that, as a general matter, \u201ccourts may vary [from Guidelines ranges] based solely on policy considerations, including disagreements with the Guidelines.\u201d Brief for United States 16; cf. <em>Rita, </em>551 U. S., at 351 (a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>trict court may consider arguments that \u201cthe Guidelines sentence itself fails properly to reflect \u00a7 3553(a) considerations\u201d). But the Government contends that the Guidelines adopting the 100-to-l ratio are an exception to the \u201cgeneral freedom that sentencing courts have to apply the [\u00a7 3553(a)] factors.\u201d Brief for United States 16. That is so, according to the Government, because the ratio is a \u201cspecific policy determinatio[n] that Congress has directed sentencing courts to observe.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 25. The Government offers three arguments in support of this position. We consider each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">As its first and most heavily pressed argument, the Government urges that the 1986 Act itself prohibits the Sentencing Commission and sentencing courts from disagreeing with the 100-to-l ratio.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Government acknowledges that the \u201cCongress did not <em>expressly </em>direct the Sentencing Commission to incorporate the 100:1 ratio in the Guidelines.\u201d Brief for United States 33 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). Nevertheless, it asserts that the Act \u201c[i]mplicit[ly]\u201d requires the Commission and sentencing courts to apply the 100-to-l ratio. <em>Id., </em>at 32. Any deviation, the Government urges, would be \u201clogically incoherent\u201d when combined with mandatory minimum sentences based on the 100-to-l ratio. <em>Id., </em>at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">This argument encounters a formidable obstacle: It lacks grounding in the text of the 1986 Act. The statute, by its terms, mandates only maximum and minimum sentences: A person convicted of possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of crack cocaine must be sentenced to a mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>mum of 5 years and the maximum term is 40 years. A person with 50 grams or more of crack cocaine must be sentenced to a minimum of ten years and the maximum term is life. The statute says nothing about the appropriate sentences within these brackets, and we decline to read any implicit directive into that congressional silence. See <em>Jama </em>v. <em>Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>543 U. S. 335, 341 (2005) (\u201cWe do not lightly assume that Congress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that it nonetheless intends to apply . . . .\u201d). Drawing meaning from silence is particularly inappropriate here, for Congress has shown that it knows how to direct sentencing practices in express terms. For example, Congress has specifically required the Sentencing Commission to set Guidelines sentences for serious recidivist offenders \u201cat or near\u201d the statutory maximum. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 994(h). See also \u00a7 994(i) (\u201cThe Commission shall assure that the guidelines specify a sentence to a substantial term of imprisonment\u201d for specified categories of offenders.).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Our cautious reading of the 1986 Act draws force from <em>Neal </em>v. <em>United States, </em>516 U. S. 284 (1996). That case involved different methods of calculating lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) weights, one applicable in determining statutory minimum sentences, the other controlling the calculation of Guidelines ranges. The 1986 Act sets mandatory minimum sentences based on the weight of \u201ca mixture or substance containing a detectable amount\u201d of LSD. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(v), (B)(v). Prior to <em>Neal, </em>we had interpreted that language to include the weight of the carrier medium (usually blotter paper) on which LSD is absorbed even though the carrier is usually far heavier than the LSD itself. See <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>500 U. S. 453, 468 (1991). Until 1993, the Sentencing Commission had interpreted the relevant Guidelines in the same way. That year, however, the Commission changed its approach and \u201cinstructed courts to give each dose of LSD on a carrier medium a constructive or presumed weight of 0.4 milligrams.\u201d <em>Neal, </em>516 U. S., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>at 287 (citing USSG \u00a72Dl.l(c), n. (H) (Nov. 1995)). The Commission\u2019s change significantly lowered the Guidelines range applicable to most LSD offenses, but defendants remained subject to higher statutory minimum sentences based on the combined weight of the pure drug and its carrier medium. The defendant in <em>Neal </em>argued that the revised Guidelines and the statute should be interpreted consistently and that the \u201cpresumptive-weight method of the Guidelines should also control the mandatory minimum calculation.\u201d 516 U. S., at 287. We rejected that argument, emphasizing that the Commission had not purported to interpret the statute and could not in any event overrule our decision in <em>Chapman. </em>See 516 U. S., at 293-295.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">If the Government\u2019s current position were correct, then the Guidelines involved in <em>Neal </em>would be in serious jeopardy. We have just recounted the reasons alleged to justify reading into the 1986 Act an implicit command to the Commission and sentencing courts to apply the 100-to-l ratio to all quantities of crack cocaine. Those same reasons could be urged in support of an argument that the 1986 Act requires the Commission to include the full weight of the carrier medium in calculating the weight of LSD for Guidelines purposes. Yet our opinion in <em>Neal </em>never questioned the validity of the altered Guidelines. To the contrary, we stated: \u201cEntrusted within its sphere to make policy judgments, the Commission may abandon its old methods in favor of what it has deemed a more desirable \u2018approach\u2019 to calculating LSD quantities.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 295.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If the 1986 Act does not require the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>sion to adhere to the Act\u2019s method for determining LSD weights, it does not require the Commission \u2014 or, after <em>Booker, </em>sentencing courts \u2014 to adhere to the 100-to-l ratio for crack cocaine quantities other than those that trigger the statutory mandatory minimum sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In addition to the 1986 Act, the Government relies on Congress\u2019 disapproval of the Guidelines amendment that the Sentencing Commission proposed in 1995. Congress \u201cnot only disapproved of the 1:1 ratio,\u201d the Government urges; it also made clear \u201cthat the 1986 Act required the Commission (and sentencing courts) to take drug quantities into account, and to do so in a manner that respects the 100:1 ratio.\u201d Brief for United States 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">It is true that Congress rejected the Commission\u2019s 1995 proposal to place a 1-to-l ratio in the Guidelines, and that Congress also expressed the view that \u201cthe sentence imposed for trafficking in a quantity of crack cocaine should generally exceed the sentence imposed for trafficking in a like quantity of powder cocaine.\u201d Pub. L. 104-38, \u00a7 2(a)(1)(A), 109 Stat. 334. But nothing in Congress\u2019 1995 reaction to the Commission-proposed 1-to-l ratio suggested that crack sentences must exceed powder sentences by a ratio of 100 to 1. To the contrary, Congress\u2019 1995 action required the Commission to recommend a \u201crevision of the drug quantity ratio of crack cocaine to powder cocaine.\u201d \u00a7 2(a)(2), <em>id., </em>at 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">The Government emphasizes that Congress required the Commission to propose changes to the 100-to-l ratio in <em>both </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>the 1986 Act and the Guidelines. This requirement, the Government contends, implicitly foreclosed any deviation from the 100-to-l ratio in the Guidelines (or by sentencing courts) in the absence of a corresponding change in the statute. See Brief for United States 35-36. But it does not follow as the night follows the day that, by calling for recommendations to change the statute, Congress meant to bar any Guidelines alteration in advance of congressional action. The more likely reading is that Congress sought proposals to amend both the statute and the Guidelines because the Commission\u2019s criticisms of the 100-to-l ratio, see Part II-B, <em>supra, </em>concerned the exorbitance of the crack/powder disparity in both contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Moreover, as a result of the 2007 amendment, see <em>supra, </em>at 99-100, the Guidelines now advance a crack/powder ratio that varies (at different offense levels) between 25 to 1 and 80 to 1. See Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts, 72 Fed. Reg. 28571-28572. Adopting the Government\u2019s analysis, the amended Guidelines would conflict with Congress\u2019 1995 action, and with the 1986 Act, because the current Guidelines ratios deviate from the 100-to-l statutory ratio. Congress, however, did not disapprove or modify the Commission-initiated 2007 amendment. Ordinarily, we resist reading congressional intent into congressional inaction. See <em>Bob Jones Univ. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>461 U. S. 574,600 (1983). But in this case, Congress failed to act on a proposed amendment to the Guidelines in a high-profile area in which it had previously exercised its disapproval authority under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 994(p). If nothing else, this tacit acceptance of the 2007 amendment undermines the Government\u2019s position, which is itself based on implications drawn from congressional silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Finally, the Government argues that if district courts are free to deviate from the Guidelines based on disagreements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>with the crack/powder ratio, unwarranted disparities of two kinds will ensue. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) (sentencing courts shall consider \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities\u201d)- First, because sentencing courts remain bound by the mandatory minimum sentences prescribed in the 1986 Act, deviations from the 100-to-l ratio could result in sentencing \u201ccliffs\u201d around quantities that trigger the mandatory m\u00ednimums. Brief for United States 33 (internal quotation marks omitted). For example, a district court could grant a sizable downward variance to a defendant convicted of distributing 49 grams of crack but would be required by the statutory minimum to impose a much higher sentence on a defendant responsible for only 1 additional gram. Second, the Government maintains that, if district courts are permitted to vary from the Guidelines based on their disagreement with the crack/powder disparity, \u201cdefendants with identical real conduct will receive markedly different sentences, depending on nothing more than the particular judge drawn for sentencing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Neither of these arguments persuades us to hold the crack/ powder ratio untouchable by sentencing courts. As to the first, the LSD Guidelines we approved in <em>Neal </em>create a similar risk of sentencing \u201ccliffs.\u201d An offender who possesses LSD on a carrier medium weighing ten grams is subject to the ten-year mandatory minimum, see 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(v), but an offender whose carrier medium weighs slightly less may receive a considerably lower sentence based on the Guidelines\u2019 presumptive-weight methodology. Concerning the second disparity, it is unquestioned that uniformity remains an important goal of sentencing. As we explained in <em>Booker, </em>however, advisory Guidelines combined with appellate review for reasonableness and ongoing revision of the Guidelines in response to sentencing practices will help to \u201cavoid excessive sentencing disparities.\u201d 543 U. S., at 264. These measures will not eliminate variations between district courts, but our opinion in <em>Booker </em>rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>ognized that some departures from uniformity were a necessary cost of the remedy we adopted. See <em>id., </em>at 263 (\u201cWe cannot and do not claim that use of a \u2018reasonableness\u2019 standard will provide the uniformity that Congress originally sought to secure [through mandatory Guidelines].\u201d). And as to crack cocaine sentences in particular, we note a congressional control on disparities: possible variations among district courts are constrained by the mandatory m\u00ednimums Congress prescribed in the 1986 Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Moreover, to the extent that the Government correctly identifies risks of \u201cunwarranted sentence disparities\u201d within the meaning of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6), the proper solution is not to treat the crack/powder ratio as mandatory. Section 3553(a)(6) directs <em>district courts </em>to consider the need to avoid unwarranted disparities \u2014 along with other \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 when imposing sentences. See <em>Gall, ante, </em>at 50, n. 6, 54. Under this instruction, district courts must take account of sentencing practices in other courts and the \u201ccliffs\u201d resulting from the statutory mandatory minimum sentences. To reach an appropriate sentence, these disparities must be weighed against the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors and any unwarranted disparity created by the crack/powder ratio itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">While rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, <em>Booker, </em>543 U. S., at 245, we have nevertheless preserved a key role for the Sentencing Commission. As explained in <em>Rita </em>and <em>Gall, </em>district courts must treat the Guidelines as the \u201cstarting point and the initial benchmark,\u201d <em>Gall, ante, </em>at 49. Congress established the Commission to formulate and constantly refine national sentencing standards. See <em>Rita, </em>551 U. S., at 347-350. Carrying out its charge, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Commission fills an important institutional role: It has the capacity courts lack to \u201cbase its determinations on empirical data and national experience, guided by a professional staff with appropriate expertise.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pruitt, </em>502 F. 3d 1154,1171 (CA10 2007) (McConnell, J., concurring); see <em>supra, </em>at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">We have accordingly recognized that, in the ordinary case, the Commission\u2019s recommendation of a sentencing range will \u201creflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s objectives.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>551 U. S., at 350. The sentencing judge, on the other hand, has \u201cgreater familiarity with . . . the individual case and the individual defendant before him than the Commission or the appeals court.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 357-358. He is therefore \u201cin a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d in each particular case. <em>Gall, ante, </em>at 51 (internal quotation marks omitted). In light of these discrete institutional strengths, a district court\u2019s decision to vary from the advisory Guidelines may attract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case \u201coutside the \u2018heartland\u2019 to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>551 U. S., at 351. On the other hand, while the Guidelines are no longer binding, closer review may be in order when the sentencing judge varies from the Guidelines based solely on the judge\u2019s view that the Guidelines range \u201cfails properly to reflect \u00a7 3553(a) considerations\u201d even in a mine-run case. <em>Ibid. </em>Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. in <em>Gall </em>v. <em>United States, </em>O. T. 2007, No. 06-7949, pp. 38-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The crack cocaine Guidelines, however, present no occasion for elaborative discussion of this matter because those Guidelines do not exemplify the Commission\u2019s exercise of its characteristic institutional role. In formulating Guidelines ranges for crack cocaine offenses, as we earlier noted, the Commission looked to the mandatory minimum sentences set in the 1986 Act, and did not take account of \u201cempirical data and national experience.\u201d See <em>Pruitt, </em>502 F. 3d, at 1171 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>(McConnell, J., concurring). Indeed, the Commission itself has reported that the crack/powder disparity produces disproportionately harsh sanctions, <em>i. e., </em>sentences for crack cocaine offenses \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d in light of the purposes of sentencing set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). See <em>supra, </em>at 97-98. Given all this, it would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Taking account of the foregoing discussion in appraising the District Court\u2019s disposition in this case, we conclude that the 180-month sentence imposed on Kimbrough should survive appellate inspection. The District Court began by properly calculating and considering the advisory Guidelines range. It then addressed the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. First, the court considered \u201cthe nature and circumstances\u201d of the crime, see \u00a7 3553(a)(1), which was an unremarkable drug-trafficking offense. App. 72-73 (\u201c[T]his defendant and another defendant were caught sitting in a car with some crack cocaine and powder by two police officers \u2014 that\u2019s the sum and substance of it \u2014 [and they also had] a firearm.\u201d). Second, the court considered Kimbrough\u2019s \u201chistory and characteristics.\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The court noted that Kimbrough had no prior felony convictions, that he had served in combat during Operation Desert Storm and received an honorable discharge from the Marine Corps, and that he had a steady history of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Furthermore, the court alluded to the Sentencing Commission\u2019s reports criticizing the 100-to-l ratio, cf. \u00a7 3553(a)(5) (2000 ed., Supp. V), noting that the Commission \u201crecognizes that crack cocaine has not caused the damage that the Justice Department alleges it has.\u201d App. 72. Comparing the Guidelines range to the range that would have applied if Kimbrough had possessed an equal amount of powder, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>court suggested that the 100-to-l ratio itself created an unwarranted disparity within the meaning of \u00a7 3553(a). Finally, the court did not purport to establish a ratio of its own. Rather, it appropriately framed its final determination in line with \u00a73553(a)\u2019s overarching instruction to \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to accomplish the sentencing goals advanced in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). See <em>supra, </em>at 101. Concluding that \u201cthe crack cocaine guidelines [drove] the offense level to a point higher than is necessary to do justice in this case,\u201d App. 72, the District Court thus rested its sentence on the appropriate considerations and \u201ccommitted no procedural error,\u201d <em>Gall, ante, </em>at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The ultimate question in Kimbrough\u2019s case is \u201cwhether the sentence was <em>reasonable </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>whether the District Judge abused his discretion in determining that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported a sentence of [15 years] and justified a substantial deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The sentence the District Court imposed on Kimbrough was 4.5 years below the bottom of the Guidelines range. But in determining that 15 years was the appropriate prison term, the District Court properly homed in on the particular circumstances of Kimbrough\u2019s case and accorded weight to the Sentencing Commission\u2019s consistent and emphatic position that the crack/powder disparity is at odds with \u00a7 3553(a). See Part II-B, <em>supra. </em>Indeed, aside from its claim that the 100-to-l ratio is mandatory, the Government did not attack the District Court\u2019s downward variance as unsupported by \u00a7 3553(a). Giving due respect to the District Court\u2019s reasoned appraisal, a reviewing court could not rationally conclude that the 4.5-year sentence reduction Kimbrough received qualified as an abuse of discretion.

S., at 358-360.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is reversed, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-6\"> The statutory range for possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack is ten years to life.

I join the opinion only because I do not take this to be an unannounced abandonment of the following clear statements in our recent opinions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">\u201c[Our remedial opinion] requires a sentencing court to consider Guidelines ranges,. . . but it permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well, see \u00a7 3553(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">\u201c[W]ithout this provision \u2014 namely, the provision that makes \u2018the relevant sentencing rules . . . mandatory and impose[s] binding requirements on all sentencing judges\u2019 \u2014 the statute falls outside the scope of <em>Apprendi\u2019s </em>requirement. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">\u201cThe district courts, while not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U. S. 220, 245-246, 259, 264 (2005).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-11\">\u201cUnder the system described in Justice Breyer\u2019s opinion for the Court in <em>Booker, </em>judges would no longer be tied to the sentencing range indicated in the Guidelines. But they would be obliged to \u2018take account of\u2019 that range along with the sentencing goals Congress enumerated in the [Sentencing Reform Act of 1984] at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>California, </em>549 U. S. 270, 286-287 (2007).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">\u201c[The sentencing judge] may hear arguments by prosecution or defense that the Guidelines sentence should not apply, perhaps because (as the Guidelines themselves foresee) the case at hand falls outside the 'heartland\u2019 to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply, USSG \u00a75K2.0, perhaps because the Guidelines sentence itself fails properly to reflect \u00a7 3553(a) considerations, or perhaps because the case warrants a different sentence regardless. See Rule 32(f)____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">\u201cA nonbinding appellate presumption that a Guidelines sentence is reasonable does not <em>require </em>the sentencing judge to impose that sentence. Still less does it <em>prohibit </em>the sentencing judge from imposing a sentence higher than the Guidelines provide for the jury-determined facts standing alone. As far as the law is concerned, the judge could disregard the Guidelines and apply the same sentence (higher than the statutory minimum or the bottom of the unenhanced Guidelines range) in the absence of the special facts (say, gun brandishing) which, in the view of the Sentencing Commission, would warrant a higher sentence within the statutorily permissible range.\u201d <em>Rita, supra, </em>at 351, 353.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">These statements mean that the district court is free to make its own reasonable application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and to reject (after due consideration) the advice of the Guidelines. If there is any thumb on the scales; if the Guidelines <em>must </em>be followed even where the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is entirely reasonable; then the \u201cadvisory\u201d Guidelines would, over a large expanse of their application, <em>entitle </em>the defendant to a lesser sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number><em>but for </em>the presence of certain additional facts found by judge rather than jury. This, as we said in <em>Booker, </em>would violate the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b372-5\">Justice Thomas,</author>\n<p id=\"Amy\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">I continue to disagree with the remedy fashioned in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U. S. 220, 258-265 (2005). The Court\u2019s <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing cases illustrate why the remedial majority in <em>Booker </em>was mistaken to craft a remedy far broader than necessary to correct constitutional error. The Court is now confronted with a host of questions about how to administer a sentencing scheme that has no basis in the statute. Because the Court\u2019s decisions in this area are necessarily grounded in policy considerations rather than law, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Court held that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines violate the Sixth Amendment insofar as they permit a judge to make findings that raise a sentence beyond the level justified by the \u201c Tacts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 232 (quoting <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>542 U. S. 296, 303 (2004); emphasis deleted). In my view, this violation was more suitably remedied by requiring any such facts to be submitted to the jury. <em>Booker, </em>543 U. S., at 323-325 (Thomas, J., dissenting in part). That approach would have been consistent with our longstanding presumption of the severability of unconstitutional applications of statutory provisions. <em>Id., </em>at 322-323. And it would have achieved compliance with the Sixth Amendment while doing the least amount of violence to the mandatory sentencing regime that Congress enacted. <em>Id., </em>at 324-326. The Court, however, chose a more sweeping rerpedy. Despite acknowledging that under the mandatory Guidelines not \u201cevery sentence gives rise to a Sixth Amendment violation,\u201d the Court rendered the Guidelines advisory in their entirety and mandated appellate review of all sentences for \u201creasonableness.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 268. Because the Court\u2019s \u201csolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>tion fail[ed] to tailor the remedy to the wrong,\u201d I dissented from the remedi\u00e1l opinion. <em>Id., </em>at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">As a result of the Court\u2019s remedial approach, we are now called upon to decide a multiplicity of questions that have no discernibly legal answers. Last Term, in <em>Rita </em>v. <em>United States, </em>551 U. S. 338 (2007), the Court held that a Court of Appeals may treat sentences within the properly calculated Guidelines range as presumptively reasonable. Today, in <em>Gall </em>v. <em>United States, ante, </em>p. 38, the Court holds that a Court of Appeals may not require sentences that deviate substantially from the Guidelines range to be justified by extraordinary circumstances. And here the Court holds that sentencing courts are free to reject the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 100-to-l crack-to-powder ratio.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">These outcomes may be perfectly reasonable as a matter of policy, but they have no basis in law. Congress did not mandate a reasonableness standard of appellate review\u2014 that was a standard the remedial majority in <em>Booker </em>fashioned out of whole cloth. See 543 U. S., at 307-312 (Scalia, J., dissenting in part). The Court must now give content to that standard, but in so doing it does not and cannot rely on any statutory language or congressional intent. We are asked here to determine whether, under the new advisory Guidelines regime, district courts may impose sentences based in part on their disagreement with a categorical policy judgment reflected in the Guidelines. But the Court\u2019s answer to that question necessarily derives from something other than the statutory language or congressional intent because Congress, by making the Guidelines mandatory, quite clearly intended to bind district courts to the Sentencing Commission\u2019s categorical policy judgments. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(b) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (excised by <em>Booker). </em>By rejecting this statutory approach, the <em>Booker </em>remedial majority has left the Court with no law to apply and forced it to assume the legislative role of devising a new sentencing scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Although I joined Justice Scalia in <em>Rita </em>accepting the <em>Booker </em>remedial opinion as a matter of \u201cstatutory <em>stare decisis,\u201d </em>551 U. S., at 368 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), I am now convinced that there is no principled way to apply the <em>Booker </em>remedy \u2014 certainly not one based on the statute. Accordingly, I think it best to apply the statute as written, including 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3553(b), which makes the Guidelines mandatory. Cf. <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>530 U. S. 428, 465 (2000) (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Applying the statute as written, it is clear that the District Court erred by departing below the mandatory Guidelines range. I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals vacating petitioner\u2019s sentence and remanding for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b374-6\">Justice Alito,</author>\n<p id=\"ASJ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">For the reasons explained in my dissent in <em>Gall </em>v. <em>United States, ante, </em>p. 61, I would hold that, under the remedial decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U. S. 220, 258-265 (2005), a district judge is still required to give significant weight to the policy decisions embodied in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. The <em>Booker </em>remedial decision, however, does not permit a court of appeals to treat the Guidelines\u2019 policy decisions as binding. I would not draw a distinction between the Guideline at issue here and other Guidelines. Accordingly, I would vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
