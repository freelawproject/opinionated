S. 1 (1984), the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9 U. S. C. \u00a7 1 <em>et seq. </em>(2000 ed. and Supp. V), establishes a national policy favoring arbitration when the parties contract for that mode of dispute resolution. The Act, which rests on Congress\u2019 authority under the Commerce Clause, supplies not simply a procedural framework applicable in federal courts; it also calls for the application, in state as well as federal courts, of federal substantive law regarding arbitration. 465 U. S., at 16. More recently, in <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cardegna, </em>546 U. S. 440 (2006), the Court clarified that, when parties agree to arbitrate all disputes arising under their contract, questions concerning the validity of the entire contract are to be resolved by the arbitrator in the first instance, not by a federal or state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The instant petition presents the following question: Does the FAA override not only state statutes that refer certain state-law controversies initially to a judicial forum, but also state statutes that refer certain disputes initially to an administrative agency? We hold today that, when parties agree to arbitrate all questions arising under a contract, state laws lodging primary jurisdiction in another forum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>whether judicial or administrative, are superseded by the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">This case concerns a contract between respondent Alex E. Ferrer, a former Florida trial court judge who currently appears as \u201cJudge Alex\u201d on a Fox television network program, and petitioner Arnold M. Preston, a California attorney who renders services to persons in the entertainment industry. Seeking fees allegedly due under the contract, Preston invoked the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate \u201cany dispute . . . relating to the terms of [the contract] or the breach, validity, or legality thereof... in accordance with the rules [of the American Arbitration Association].\u201d App. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Preston\u2019s demand for arbitration, made in June 2005, was countered a month later by Ferrer\u2019s petition to the California Labor Commissioner charging that the contract was invalid and unenforceable under the California Talent Agencies Act (TAA), Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \u00a71700 <em>et seq. </em>(West 2003 and Supp. 2008). Ferrer asserted that Preston acted as a talent agent without the license required by the TAA, and that Preston\u2019s unlicensed status rendered the entire contract void.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The Labor Commissioner\u2019s hearing officer, in November 2005, determined that Ferrer had stated a \u201ccolorable basis for exercise of the Labor Commissioner\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d App. 33. The officer denied Ferrer\u2019s motion to stay the arbitration, however, on the ground that the Labor Commissioner lacked authority to order such relief. Ferrer then filed suit in the Los Angeles Superior Court, seeking a declaration that the controversy between the parties \u201carising from the [c]ontract, including in particular the issue of the validity of the [c]ontract, is not subject to arbitration.\u201d <em>Id., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>at 29. As interim relief, Ferrer sought an injunction restraining Preston from proceeding before the arbitrator. Preston responded by moving to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">In December 2005, the Superior Court denied Preston\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and enjoined Preston from proceeding before the arbitrator \u201cunless and until the Labor Commissioner determines that . . . she is without jurisdiction over the disputes between Preston and Ferrer.\u201d No. BC342454 (Dec. 7, 2005), App. C to Pet. for Cert. 18a, 26a-27a. During the pendency of Preston\u2019s appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s decision, this Court reaffirmed, in <em>Buckeye, </em>that challenges to the validity of a contract providing for arbitration ordinarily \u201cshould ... be considered by an arbitrator, not a court.\u201d 546 U. S., at 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">In a 2-to-l decision issued in November 2006, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s judgment. The appeals court held that the relevant provision of the TAA, Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \u00a7 1700.44(a) (West 2003), vests \u201cexclusive original jurisdiction\u201d over the dispute in the Labor Commissioner. 145 Cal. App. 4th 440, 447, 51 Cal. Rptr. 3d 628, 634. <em>Buckeye </em>is \u201cinapposite,\u201d the court said, because that case \u201cdid not involve an administrative agency with exclusive jurisdiction over a disputed issue.\u201d 145 Cal. App. 4th, at 447, 51 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 634. The dissenting judge, in contrast, viewed <em>Buckeye </em>as controlling; she reasoned that the FAA called for immediate recognition and enforcement of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate and afforded no basis for distinguishing prior resort to a state administrative agency from prior resort to a state court. 145 Cal. App. 4th, at 450-451,51 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 636-637 (Vogel, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The California Supreme Court denied Preston\u2019s petition for review. No. S149190 (Feb. 14, 2007), 2007 Cal. LEXIS 1539, App. A to Pet. for Cert. la. We granted certiorari to determine whether the FAA overrides a state law vesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>initial adjudicatory authority in an administrative agency. 551 U. S. 1190 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">An easily stated question underlies this controversy. Ferrer claims that Preston was a talent agent who operated without a license in violation of the TAA. Accordingly, he urges, the contract between the parties, purportedly for \u201cpersonal management,\u201d is void, and Preston is entitled to no compensation for any services he rendered. Preston, on the other hand, maintains that he acted as a personal manager, not as a talent agent, hence his contract with Ferrer is not governed by the TAA and is both lawful and fully binding on the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Because the contract between Ferrer and Preston provides that \u201cany dispute . . . relating to the . . . validity, or legality,\u201d of the agreement \u201cshall be submitted to arbitration,\u201d App. 18, Preston urges that Ferrer must litigate \u201chis TAA defense in the arbitral forum,\u201d Reply Brief 31. Ferrer insists, however, that the \u201cpersonal manager\u201d or \u201ctalent agent\u201d inquiry falls, under California law, within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Labor Commissioner, and that the FAA does not displace the Commissioner\u2019s primary jurisdiction. Brief for Respondent 14, 30, 40-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">The dispositive issue, then, contrary to Ferrer\u2019s suggestion, is not whether the FAA preempts the TAA wholesale. See <em>id., </em>at 44-48. The FAA plainly has no such destructive aim or effect. Instead, the question is simply who decides whether Preston acted as personal manager or as talent agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">Section 2 of the FAA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-11\">\u201cA written provision in any . . . contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>able, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a7 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Section 2 \u201cdeclared] a national policy favoring arbitration\u201d of claims that parties contract to settle in that manner. <em>Southland Corp., </em>465 U. S., at 10. That national policy, we held in <em>Southland, </em>\u201cappli[es] in state as well as federal courts\u201d and \u201cforeclosed] state legislative attempts to undercut the enforceability of arbitration agreements.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 16. The FAA\u2019s displacement of conflicting state law is \u201cnow well-established,\u201d <em>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. </em>v. <em>Dobson, </em>513 U. S. 265, 272 (1995), and has been repeatedly reaffirmed, see, <em>e. g., Buckeye, </em>546 U. S., at 445-446; <em>Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Casarotto, </em>517 U. S. 681, 684-685 (1996); <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>482 U. S. 483, 489 (1987).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">A recurring question under \u00a72 is who should decide whether \u201cgrounds ... exist at law or in equity\u201d to invalidate an arbitration agreement. In <em>Prima Paint Corp. </em>v. <em>Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., </em>388 U. S. 395, 403-404 (1967), we held that attacks on the validity of an entire contract, as distinct from attacks aimed at the arbitration clause, are within the arbitrator\u2019s ken.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The litigation in <em>Prima Paint </em>originated in federal court, but the same rule, we held in <em>Buckeye, </em>applies in state court. 546 U. S., at 447-448. The plaintiffs in <em>Buckeye </em>alleged that the contracts they signed, which contained arbitration clauses, were illegal under state law and void <em>ab initio. Id., </em>at 443. Relying on <em>Southland, </em>we held that the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge was within the province of the arbitrator to decide. See 546 U. S., at 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number><em>Buckeye </em>largely, if not entirely, resolves the dispute before us. The contract between Preston and Ferrer clearly \u201cevidenced] a transaction involving commerce,\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a7 2, and Ferrer has never disputed that the written arbitration provision in the contract falls within the purview of \u00a72. Moreover, Ferrer sought invalidation of the contract as a whole. In the proceedings below, he made no discrete challenge to the validity of the arbitration clause. See 145 Cal. App. 4th, at 449, 51 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 635 (Vogel, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ferrer thus urged the Labor Commissioner and California courts to override the contract\u2019s arbitration clause on a ground that <em>Buckeye </em>requires the arbitrator to decide in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Ferrer attempts to distinguish <em>Buckeye </em>by arguing that the TAA merely requires exhaustion of administrative remedies before the parties proceed to arbitration. We reject that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The TAA regulates talent agents and talent agency agreements. \u201cTalent agency\u201d is defined, with exceptions not relevant here, as \u201ca person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring, offering, promising, or attempting to procure employment or engagements for an artist or artists.\u201d Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \u00a7 1700.4(a) (West 2003). The definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u201cdoes not cover other services for which artists often contract, such as personal and career management (i. e., advice, direction, coordination, and oversight with respect to an artist\u2019s career or personal or financial affairs).\u201d <em>Styne </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>26 Cal. 4th 42, 51, 26 P. 3d 343, 349 (2001) (emphasis deleted). The TAA requires talent agents to procure a license from the Labor Commissioner. \u00a7 1700.5. \u201cIn furtherance of the [TAA\u2019s] protective aims, an unlicensed person\u2019s contract with an artist to provide the services of a talent agency is illegal and void.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Section 1700.44(a) of the TAA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">\u201cIn cases of controversy arising under this chapter, the parties involved shall refer the matters in dispute to the Labor Commissioner, who shall hear and determine the same, subject to an appeal within 10 days after determination, to the superior court where the same shall be heard de novo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"pAc0\">Absent a notice of appeal filed within ten days, the Labor Commissioner\u2019s determination becomes final and binding on the parties. <em>REO Broadcasting Consultants </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>69 Cal. App. 4th 489, 495, 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d 639, 642-643 (1999).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The TAA permits arbitration in lieu of proceeding before the Labor Commissioner if an arbitration provision \u201cin a contract between a talent agency and [an artist]\u201d both \u201cprovides for reasonable notice to the Labor Commissioner of the time and place of all arbitration hearings\u201d and gives the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>missioner \u201cthe right to attend all arbitration hearings.\u201d \u00a7 1700.45. This prescription demonstrates that there is no inherent conflict between the TAA and arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism. But \u00a7 1700.45 was of no utility to Preston. He has consistently maintained that he is <em>not </em>a talent agent as that term is defined in \u00a7 1700.4(a), but is, instead, a personal manager not subject to the TAA\u2019s regulatory regime. 145 Cal. App. 4th, at 444, 51 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 631. To invoke \u00a7 1700.45, Preston would have been required to concede a point fatal to his claim for <em>compensation </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>that he is a talent agent, albeit an unlicensed one \u2014 and to have drafted his contract in compliance with a statute that he maintains is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Procedural prescriptions of the TAA thus conflict with the FAA\u2019s dispute resolution regime in two basic respects: First, the TAA, in \u00a7 1700.44(a), grants the Labor Commissioner exclusive jurisdiction to decide an issue that the parties agreed to arbitrate, see <em>Buckeye, </em>546 U. S., at 446; second, the TAA, in \u00a7 1700.45, imposes prerequisites to enforcement of an arbitration agreement that are not applicable to contracts generally, see <em>Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc., </em>517 U. S., at 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Ferrer contends that the TAA is nevertheless compatible with the FAA because \u00a7 1700.44(a) merely postpones arbitration until after the Labor Commissioner has exercised her primary jurisdiction. Brief for Respondent 14, 40. The party that loses before the Labor Commissioner may file for <em>de novo </em>review in Superior Court. See \u00a7 1700.44(a). At that point, Ferrer asserts, either party could move to compel arbitration under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 1281.2 (West 2007), and thereby obtain an arbitrator\u2019s determination prior to judicial review. See Brief for Respondent 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">That is not the position Ferrer took in the California courts. In his complaint, he urged the Superior Court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>declare that \u201cthe [contract, including in particular the issue of the validity of the [cjontract, <em>is not subject to arbitration,\u201d </em>and he sought an injunction stopping arbitration \u201cunless and until, <em>if ever, </em>the Labor Commissioner determines that he/ she has no jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 dispute.\u201d App. 29 (emphasis added). Ferrer also told the Superior Court: \u201c[I]f . . . the Commissioner rules that the [cjontract is void, Preston may appeal that ruling and have a hearing de novo <em>before this Court.\u201d </em>Appellant\u2019s App. in No. B188997 (Cal. App.), p. 157, n. 1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Nor does Ferrer\u2019s current argument \u2014 that \u00a7 1700.44(a) merely postpones arbitration \u2014 withstand examination. Section 1700.44(a) provides for <em>de novo </em>review in Superior Court, not elsewhere.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Arbitration, if it ever occurred following the Labor Commissioner\u2019s decision, would likely be long delayed, in contravention of Congress\u2019 intent \u201cto move the parties to an arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as possible.\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U. S. 1, 22 (1983). If Ferrer prevailed in the California courts, moreover, he would no doubt argue that judicial findings of fact and conclusions of law, made after a full and fair <em>de novo </em>hearing in court, are binding on the parties and preclude the arbitrator from making any contrary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">A prime objective of an agreement to arbitrate is to achieve \u201cstreamlined proceedings and expeditious results.\u201d <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>473 U. S. 614, 633 (1985). See also <em>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos., </em>513 U. S., at 278; <em>Southland Corp., </em>465 U. S., at 7. That objective would be frustrated even if Preston could compel arbitration in lieu of <em>de novo </em>Superior Court review. Requiring initial reference of the parties\u2019 dispute to the Labor Commissioner would, at the least, hinder speedy resolution of the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Ferrer asks us to overlook the apparent conflict between the arbitration clause and \u00a7 1700.44(a) because proceedings before the Labor Commissioner are administrative rather than judicial. Brief for Respondent 40-48. Allowing parties to proceed directly to arbitration, Ferrer contends, would undermine the Labor Commissioner\u2019s ability to stay informed of potentially illegal activity, <em>id., </em>at 43, and would deprive artists protected by the TAA of the Labor Commissioner\u2019s expertise, <em>id., </em>at 41-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">In <em>Gilmer </em>v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., </em>500 U. S. 20 (1991), we considered and rejected a similar argument, namely, that arbitration of age discrimination claims would undermine the role of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in enforcing federal law. The \u201cmere involvement of an administrative agency in the enforcement of a statute,\u201d we held, does not limit private parties\u2019 obligation to comply with their arbitration agreements. <em>Id., </em>at 28-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Ferrer points to our holding in <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>Waffle House, Inc., </em>534 U. S. 279, 293-294 (2002), that an arbitration agreement signed by an employee who becomes a discrimination complainant does not bar the EEOC from filing an enforcement suit in its own name. He further emphasizes our observation in <em>Gilmer </em>that individuals who agreed to arbitrate their discrimination claims would \u201cstill be free to file a charge with the EEOC.\u201d 500 U. S., at 28. Consistent with these decisions, Ferrer argues, the arbitration clause in his contract with Preston leaves undisturbed the Labor Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>missioner\u2019s independent authority to enforce the TAA. See Brief for Respondent 44-48. And so it may.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But in proceedings under \u00a7 1700.44(a), the Labor Commissioner functions not as an advocate advancing a cause before a tribunal authorized to find the facts and apply the law; instead, the Commissioner serves as impartial arbiter. That role is just what the FAA-governed agreement between Ferrer and Preston reserves for the arbitrator. In contrast, in <em>Waffle House </em>and in the <em>Gilmer </em>aside Ferrer quotes, the Court addressed the role of an agency, not as adjudicator but as prosecutor, pursuing an enforcement action in its own name or reviewing a discrimination charge to determine whether to initiate judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Finally, it bears repeating that Preston\u2019s petition presents precisely and only a question concerning the forum in which the parties\u2019 dispute will be heard. See <em>supra, </em>at 352. \u201cBy agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral... forum.\u201d <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp., </em>473 U. S., at 628. So here, Ferrer relinquishes no substantive rights the TAA or other California law may accord him. But under the contract he signed, he cannot escape resolution of those rights in an arbitral forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In sum, we disapprove the distinction between judicial and administrative proceedings drawn by Ferrer and adopted by the appeals court. When parties agree to arbitrate all questions arising under a contract, the FAA supersedes state laws lodging primary jurisdiction in another forum, whether judicial or administrative.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Ferrer\u2019s final attempt to distinguish <em>Buckeye </em>relies on <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., </em>489 U. S. 468 (1989). <em>Volt </em>involved a California statute dealing with cases in which \u201c[a] party to [an] arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court action . . . [involving] a third party [not bound by the arbitration agreement], arising out of the same transaction or series of related transactions.\u201d Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 1281.2(c) (West 2007). To avoid the \u201cpossibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact,\u201d the statute gives the Superior Court authority, <em>inter alia, </em>to stay the court proceeding \u201cpending the outcome of the arbitration\u201d or to stay the arbitration \u201cpending the outcome of the court action.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Volt Information Sciences and Stanford University were parties to a construction contract containing an \u00bfrbitration clause. When a dispute arose and Volt demanded arbitration, Stanford sued Volt and two other companies involved in the construction project. Those other companies were not parties to the arbitration agreement; Stanford sought indemnification from them in the event that Volt prevailed against Stanford. At Stanford\u2019s request, the Superior Court stayed the arbitration. The California Court of Appeal affirmed the stay order. Volt and Stanford incorporated \u00a7 1281.2(c) into their agreement, the appeals court held. They did so by stipulating that the contract \u2014 otherwise silent on the priority of suits drawing in parties not subject to arbitration\u2014 would be governed by California law. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ. </em>v. <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc., </em>240 Cal. Rptr. 558, 561 (1987) (officially depublished). Relying on the Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation of the contract, we held that the FAA did not bar a stay of arbitration pending the resolution of Stanford\u2019s Superior Court suit against Volt and the two companies not bound by the arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Preston and Ferrer\u2019s contract also contains a choice-of-law clause, which states that the \u201cagreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California.\u201d App. 17. A separate saving clause provides: \u201cIf there is any conflict between this agreement and any present or future law,\u201d the law prevails over the contract \u201cto the extent necessary to bring [the contract] within the requirements of said law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 18. Those contractual terms, according to Ferrer, call for the application of California procedural law, including \u00a7 1700.44(a)\u2019s grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the Labor Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Ferrer\u2019s reliance on <em>Volt </em>is misplaced for two discrete reasons. First, arbitration was stayed in <em>Volt </em>to accommodate litigation involving third parties who were strangers to the arbitration agreement. Nothing in the arbitration agreement addressed the order of proceedings when pending litigation with third parties presented the prospect of inconsistent rulings. We thought it proper, in those circumstances, to recognize state law as the gap filler.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Here, in contrast, the arbitration clause speaks to the matter in controversy; it states that \u201cany dispute . . . relating to ... the breach, validity, or legality\u201d of the contract should be arbitrated in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) rules. App. 18. Both parties are bound by the arbitration agreement; the question of Preston\u2019s status as a talent agent relates to the validity or legality of the contract; there is no risk that related litigation will yield conflicting rulings on common issues; and there is no other procedural void for the choice-of-law clause to fill.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Second, we are guided by our more recent decision in <em>Mastrobuono </em>v. <em>Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., </em>514 U. S. 52 (1995). Although the contract in <em>Volt </em>provided for \u201carbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association,\u201d 489 U. S., at 470, n. 1 (internal quotation marks omitted), Volt never argued that incorporation of those rules trumped the choice-of-law clause contained in the contract, see Brief for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Appellant, and Reply Brief, in <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., O. </em>T. 1988, No. 87-1318. Therefore, neither <em>our </em>decision in <em>Volt </em>nor the decision of the California appeals court in that case addressed the import of the contract\u2019s incorporation by reference of privately promulgated arbitration rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In <em>Mastrobuono, </em>we reached that open question while interpreting a contract with both a New York choice-of-law clause and a clause providing for arbitration in accordance with the rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD). 514 U. S., at 58-59.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The \u201cbest way to harmonize\u201d the two clauses, we held, was to read the choice-of-law clause \u201cto encompass substantive principles that New York courts would apply, but not to include [New York\u2019s] special rules limiting the authority of arbitrators.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 63-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Preston and Ferrer\u2019s contract, as noted, provides for arbitration in accordance with the AAA rules. App. 18. One of those rules states that \u201c[t]he arbitrator shall have the power to determine the existence or validity of a contract of which an arbitration clause forms a part.\u201d AAA, Commercial Arbitration Rules \u00b6 R-7(b) (2007), online at http:// www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=22440 (as visited Feb. 15,2008, and in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). The incorporation of the AAA rules, and in particular Rule 7(b), weighs against inferring from the choice-of-law clause an understanding shared by Ferrer and Preston that their disputes would be heard, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the first instance, by the Labor Commissioner. Following the guide <em>Mastrobuono </em>provides, the \u201cbest way to harmonize\u201d the parties\u2019 adoption of the AAA rules and their selection of California law is to read the latter to encompass prescriptions governing the substantive rights and obligations of the parties, but not the State\u2019s \u201cspecial rules limiting the authority of arbitrators.\u201d 514 U. S., at 63-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the California Court of Appeal is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-9\"> The TAA uses the term \u201ctalent agency\u201d to describe both corporations and individual talent agents.

The NASD rules, in contrast, authorized \u201cdamages and other relief,\u201d which, according to an NASD arbitration manual, included punitive damages. <em>Id., </em>at 61 (internal quotation marks omitted). Relying on <em>Volt, </em>respondents argued that the choice-of-law clause incorporated into the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement New York\u2019s ban on arbitral awards of punitive damages. Opposing that argument, petitioners successfully urged that the agreement to arbitrate in accordance with the NASD rules controlled.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b621-8\">Justice Thomas,</author>\n<p id=\"ASF\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">As I have stated on many previous occasions, I believe that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. \u00a7 1 <em>et seq. </em>(2000 ed. and Supp. V), does not apply to proceedings in state courts. See <em>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. </em>v. Dobson, 513 U.

S. 440, 449 (2006) (same); <em>Green Tree Financial Corp. </em>v. <em>Bazzle, </em>539 U. S. 444, 460 (2003) (same); <em>Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Casarotto, </em>517 U. S. 681, 689 (1996) (same). Thus, in state-court proceedings, the FAA cannot displace a state law that delays arbitration until administrative proceedings are completed. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
