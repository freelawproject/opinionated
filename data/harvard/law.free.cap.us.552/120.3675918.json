S. C. \u00a7 2254, reasoning that his lawyer\u2019s assistance was presumptively ineffective owing to his participation in a plea hearing by speakerphone. <em>Van Patten </em>v. <em>Deppisch, </em>434 F. 3d 1038 (2006). We granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Musladin, </em>549 U. S. 70 (2006). On remand, the Seventh Circuit adhered to its original decision, concluding that \u201c[njothing in <em>Musladin </em>requires that our 2006 opinion be changed.\u201d <em>Van Patten </em>v. <em>Endicott, </em>489 F. 3d 827, 828 (2007) <em>(per curiam). </em>We grant the petition for certiorari now before us and this time reverse the judgment of the Seventh Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Van Patten was charged with first-degree intentional homicide and pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of first-degree reckless homicide. His counsel was not physically present at the plea hearing but was linked to the courtroom by speakerphone. After the state trial court imposed the maximum term of 25 years in prison, Van Patten retained different counsel and moved in the Wisconsin Court of Appeals to withdraw his no-contest plea. The thrust of the motion was that Van Patten\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated by his trial counsel\u2019s physical absence from the plea hearing. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals noted that, under state law, a postconviction motion to withdraw a no-contest plea will be granted only if a defendant establishes \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d by clear and convincing evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Van Pattten, </em>No. 96-3036-CR (May 28, 1997), App. to Pet. for Cert. A47-A48. While the court acknowledged that \u201cthe violation of the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel may constitute a manifest injustice,\u201d <em>id., </em>at A48, it found that the absence of Van Patten\u2019s lawyer from the plea hearing did not violate his right to counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">\u201cThe plea hearing transcript neither indicates any deficiency in the plea colloquy, nor suggests that Van Pat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>ten\u2019s attorney\u2019s participation by telephone interfered in any way with [Van Patten\u2019s] ability to communicate with his attorney about his plea. Van Patten confirmed that he had thoroughly discussed his case and plea decision with his attorney and was satisfied with the legal representation he had received. The court gave Van Patten the opportunity to speak privately with his attorney over the phone if he had questions about the plea, but Van Patten declined. Further, when Van Patten exercised his right to allocution at sentencing, in the personal presence of his attorney, he raised no objection to his plea.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at A49-A50.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Applying <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U. S. 668 (1984), the court concluded that \u201c[t]he record does not support, nor does Van Patten\u2019s appellate brief include, any argument that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient or prejudicial,\u201d No. 96-3036-CR, App. to Pet. for Cert. A51, and denied Van Patten\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">After the Wisconsin Supreme Court declined further review, Van Patten petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254 in Federal District Court. The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. It held that Van Patten\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim should have been resolved, not under <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>two-pronged test (which requires a showing of deficient performance and prejudice to the defendant), but under the standard discussed in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cronic, </em>466 U. S. 648 (1984) (under which prejudice may be presumed). Although the Seventh Circuit recognized that this case \u201cpresents [a] novel . . . question,\u201d <em>Deppisch, </em>434 F. 3d, at 1040, and conceded that \u201c[u]nder <em>Strickland, </em>it seems clear [that] Van Patten would have no viable claim,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 1042, the court concluded that \u201cit is clear to us that Van Patten\u2019s case must be resolved under <em>Cronic,\u201d id., </em>at 1043. The resolution was in Van Patten\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>While the prison warden\u2019s petition for certiorari was pending, this Court decided <em>Musladin, supra. </em>Musladin had invoked this Court\u2019s cases recognizing \u201cthat certain courtroom practices are so inherently prejudicial that they deprive the defendant of a fair trial,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 72. The issue was the significance of these precedents in a case under \u00a72254, which bars relief on any claim \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d in state court, unless the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The prejudicial conduct involved in <em>Musladin </em>was courtroom conduct of private actors. We held that the \u201cinheren[t] prejudic[e]\u201d test, which we thus far have applied only in cases involving government-sponsored conduct, see, <em>e. g., Estelle </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>425 U. S. 501 (1976); <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>475 U. S. 560 (1986), did not clearly extend to the conduct of independently acting courtroom spectators. See <em>Musladin, supra, </em>at 76 (\u201c[Although the Court articulated the test for inherent prejudice that applies to state conduct in <em>Williams </em>and <em>Flynn, </em>we have never applied that test to spectators\u2019 conduct. Indeed, part of the legal test of <em>Williams </em>and <em>Flynn </em>\u2014 asking whether the practices furthered an essential <em>state </em>interest \u2014 suggests that those cases apply only to state-sponsored practices\u201d). For that reason, we reversed the Court of Appeals\u2019 grant of habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\"><em>Musladin\u2019% </em>explanation of the \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d requirement prompted us to remand Van Patten\u2019s case to the Seventh Circuit for further consideration. A majority of the panel reaffirmed its original judgment, however, on the ground that \u201c[ujnlike <em>Musladin, </em>this case does not concern an open constitutional question,\u201d because \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has long recognized a defendant\u2019s right to relief if his defense counsel was actually or constructively absent at a critical stage of the proceedings.\u201d 489 F. 3d, at 828. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Judge Coffey disagreed, observing that \u201cthe United States Supreme Court has never held that an attorney is presumed to be ineffective if he participates in a plea hearing by speaker phone rather than by physical appearance.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis deleted). He found that \u201c[t]he Majority Opinion does not comport with <em>Musladin,\u201d ibid., </em>and dissented from \u201cthe court\u2019s erroneous decision to allow\u201d its original opinion \u201cto stand as written,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 829. We reach the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\"><em>Strickland, supra, </em>ordinarily applies to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at the plea hearing stage. See <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U. S. 52, 58 (1985) (\u201c[T]he two-part <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d). And it was in a different context that <em>Cronic </em>\u201crecognized a narrow exception to <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>holding that a defendant who asserts ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate not only that his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient, but also that the deficiency prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>543 U. S. 175,190 (2004) (discussing Cronic). <em>Cronic </em>held that a Sixth Amendment violation may be found \u201cwithout inquiring into counsel\u2019s actual performance or requiring the defendant to show the effect it had on the trial,\u201d <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Cone, </em>535 U. S. 685, 695 (2002), when \u201ccircumstances [exist] that are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified,\u201d <em>Cronic, supra, </em>at 658. <em>Cronic, </em>not <em>Strickland, </em>applies \u201cwhen ... the likelihood that any lawyer, even a fully competent one, could provide effective assistance is so small that a presumption of prejudice is appropriate without inquiry into the actual conduct of the trial,\u201d 466 U. S., at 659-660,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>one circumstance warranting the presumption is the \u201ccomplete denial of counsel,\u201d that is, when \u201ccounsel [is] either totally absent, or prevented from assisting the accused during a critical stage of the proceeding,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 659, and n. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">No decision of this Court, however, squarely addresses the issue in this case, see <em>Deppisch, </em>434 F. 3d, at 1040 (noting that this case \u201cpresents [a] novel . . . question\u201d), or clearly establishes that <em>Cronic </em>should replace <em>Strickland </em>in this novel factual context. Our precedents do not clearly hold that counsel\u2019s participation by speakerphone should be treated as a \u201ccomplete denial of counsel,\u201d on par with total absence. Even if we agree with Van Patten that a lawyer physically present will tend to perform better than one on the phone, it does not necessarily follow that mere telephone contact amounted to total absence or \u201cprevented [counsel] from assisting the accused,\u201d so as to entail application of <em>Cronic. </em>The question is not whether counsel in those circumstances will perform less well than he otherwise would, but whether the circumstances are likely to result in such poor performance that an inquiry into its effects would not be worth the time. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U. S. 140, 147 (2006) (Sixth Amendment ensures <em>\u201ceffective </em>(not mistake-free) representation\u201d (emphasis in original)). Our cases provide no categorical answer to this question, and for that matter the several proceedings in this case hardly point toward one. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals held counsel\u2019s performance by speakerphone to be constitutionally effective; neither the Magistrate Judge, the District Court, nor the Seventh Circuit disputed this conclusion; and the Seventh Circuit itself stated that \u201c[u]nder <em>Strickland, </em>it seems clear Van Patten would have no viable claim,\u201d <em>Deppisch, supra, </em>at 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Because our cases give no clear answer to the question presented, let alone one in Van Patten\u2019s favor, \u201cit cannot be said that the state court \u2018unreasonably] applied] clearly established Federal law.\u2019\u201d <em>Musladin, </em>549 U. S., at 77 (quoting 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)). Under the explicit terms of \u00a7 2254(d)(1), therefore, relief is unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Petitioner tells us that \u201c[i]n urging review, [the State] does not condone, recommend, or encourage the practice of defense counsel assisting clients by telephone rather than in person at court proceedings, even in nonadversarial hearings such as the plea hearing in this case,\u201d Pet. for Cert. 5, and he acknowledges that \u201c[p]erhaps, under similar facts in a direct federal appeal, the Seventh Circuit could have properly reached the same result it reached here,\u201d <em>ibid. </em>Our own consideration of the merits of telephone practice, however, is for another day, and this case turns on the recognition that no clearly established law contrary to the state court\u2019s conclusion justifies collateral relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-7\"><em>Cronic </em>also applies when \u201cthere [is] a breakdown in the adversarial process,\u201d 466 U. S., at 662, such that \u201ccounsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 659. We have made clear that \u201c[w]hen we spoke in <em>Cronic of </em>the possibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>presuming prejudice based on an attorney\u2019s failure to test the prosecutor\u2019s case, we indicated that the attorney\u2019s failure must be c<em>o</em>mplete.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b384-9\">Justice Stevens,</author>\n<p id=\"AVV\">concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">An unfortunate drafting error in the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cronic, </em>466 U. S. 648 (1984), makes it necessary to join the Court\u2019s judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">In <em>Cronic, </em>this Court explained that some violations of the right to counsel arise in \u201ccircumstances that are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 658. One such circumstance exists when the accused is \u201cdenied the presence of counsel at a critical stage of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 662. We noted that the \u201cpresence\u201d of lawyers \u201cis essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>because they are the means through which the other rights of the person on trial are secured.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 653. Regrettably, <em>Cronic </em>did not \u201cclearly establis[h]\u201d the full scope of the defendant\u2019s right to the presence of an attorney. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The Court of Appeals apparently read \u201cthe presence of counsel\u201d in <em>Cronic </em>to mean \u201cthe presence of counsel <em>in open court.\u201d </em>Initially, all three judges on the panel assumed that the constitutional right at stake was the right to have counsel by one\u2019s side at all critical stages of the proceeding.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>See also <em>Van Patten </em>v. <em>Deppisch, </em>No. 04-1276, 2006 U. S. App. LEXIS 5147 (CA7, Feb. 27, 2006) (noting that no member of the Seventh Circuit requested a vote on the warden\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc). In my view, this interpretation is correct. The fact that in 1984, when <em>Cronic </em>was decided, neither the parties <em>nor </em>the Court contemplated representation by attorneys who were not present in the flesh explains the author\u2019s failure to add the words \u201cin open court\u201d after the word \u201cpresent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">As the Court explains today, however, the question is not the reasonableness of the federal court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Cronic, </em>but rather whether the Wisconsin court\u2019s narrower reading of that opinion was \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>529 U. S. 362, 409 (2000). In light of Cronic\u2019s references to the \u201ccomplete denial of counsel\u201d and \u201ctotally absent\u201d counsel, 466 U. S., at 659, and n. 25, and the opinion\u2019s failure to state more explicitly that the defendant is entitled to \u201cthe presence of counsel [in open court],\u201d <em>id., </em>at 662, I acquiesce in this Court\u2019s conclusion that the state-court decision was not an unreasonable application of clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>established federal law. In doing so, however, I emphasize that today\u2019s opinion does not say that the state courts\u2019 interpretation of <em>Cronic </em>was correct, or that we would have accepted that reading if the case had come to us on direct review rather than by way of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254. See <em>ante, </em>at 126; see also <em>Williams, </em>529 U. S., at 410 (\u201c[A]n <em>unreasonable </em>application of federal law is different from an <em>incorrect </em>application of federal law\u201d).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In his opinion for a unanimous panel, Judge Evans explained at length why respondent had not had the assistance of counsel at a critical stage of the proceeding \u2014 the plea hearing \u2014 which resulted in a sentence of imprisonment for 25 years. He wrote, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u201cThe Sixth Amendment\u2019s right-to-counsel guarantee recognizes \u2018the obvious truth that the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to protect himself when brought before a tribunal with power to take his life or liberty.\u2019 <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U. S. 458, 462-63 . . . (1938). \u2018Of all the rights that an accused person has, the right to be represented by counsel is by far the most pervasive for it affects his ability to assert any other rights he may have.\u2019 <em>Cronic, </em>466 U. S. at 654... (citation omitted). Thus, a defendant requires an attorney\u2019s \u2018guiding hand\u2019 through every stage of the proceedings against him. <em>Powell v. Alabama, </em>287 U. S. 45, 53 . . . (1932); <em>Cronic, </em>466 U. S. at 658 .... It is well-settled that a court proceeding in which a defendant enters a plea (a guilty plea or, as here, a plea of no contest) is a \u2018critical stage\u2019 where an attorney\u2019s presence is crucial because \u2018defenses may be .. . irretrievably lost, if not then and there asserted.\u2019 <em>Hamilton v. Alabama, </em>368 U. S. 52, 54 . .. (1961). <em>See also White v. Maryland, </em>373 U. S. 59, 60 . .. (1963); <em>United States ex rel. Thomas v. O\u2019Leary, </em>856 F. 2d 1011, 1014 (7th Cir. 1988). Indeed, with plea bargaining the norm and trial the exception, for most criminal defendants a change of plea hearing is <em>the </em>critical stage of their prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">\u201cIn deciding whether to dispense with the two-part <em>Strickland </em>[v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U. S. 668 (1984),] inquiry, a court must evaluate whether the \u2018surrounding circumstances make it unlikely that the defendant could have received the effective assistance of counsel,\u2019 <em>Cronic, </em>466 U. S. at 666, .. . and thus \u2018justify a presumption that [the] conviction was insufficiently reliable to satisfy the Constitution,\u2019 <em>id. </em>at 662 .... In this ease, although the transcript shows that the state trial judge did his best to conduct the plea colloquy with care, the arrangements made it impossible for Van Pat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>ten to have the \u2018assistance of counsel\u2019 in anything but the most perfunctory sense. Van Patten stood alone before judge and prosecutor. Unlike the usual defendant in a criminal ease, he could not turn to his lawyer for private legal advice, to clear up misunderstandings, to seek reassurance, or to discuss any last-minute misgivings. Listening over an audio connection, counsel could not detect and respond to cues from his client\u2019s demeanor that might have indicated he did not understand certain aspects of the proceeding, or that he was changing his mind. If Van Patten wished to converse with his attorney, anyone else in the courtroom could effectively eavesdrop. (We assume the district attorney would balk if he were expected to conduct last-minute consultations with his staff via speakerphone in open court, \u2018on the record,\u2019 with the defendant taking in every word.) No advance arrangements had been made for a private line in a private place, and even if one could \u2018perhaps\u2019 have been provided, it would have required a special request by Van Patten and, apparently, a break in the proceedings. In short, this was not an auspicious setting for someone about to waive very valuable constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Van Patten </em>v. <em>Deppisch, </em>434 F. 3d 1038,1042-1043 (CA7 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
