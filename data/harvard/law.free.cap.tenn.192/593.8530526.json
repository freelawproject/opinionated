We have repeatedly held that if there was material evidence to support the decision of the Trial Judge on the evidence, that this Court would not disturb his finding. <em>Ezell </em>v. <em>Tipton, </em>150 Tenn. 300, 264 S. W. 355; <em>Bon Air Coal </em>&amp; <em>Iron Corp. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>153 Tenn. 255, 283 S. W. 447, <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Ill. Cent. Ry. Co., </em>153 Tenn. 144, 281 S. W. 927.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Likewise, the credibility of witnesses, <em>Odom </em>v. <em>Sandford </em>&amp; <em>Treadway, </em>156 Tenn. 202, 299 S. W. 1045, and the qualification of experts, <em>Powers </em>v. <em>McKenzie, </em>90 Tenn. 167, 16 S. W. 559; <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Beall, </em>99 Tenn. 303, 41 S. W. 445; <em>Roper </em>v. <em>Memphis St. Ry. Co., </em>136 Tenn. 23, 188 S. W. 588, are matters .finally determined in the Trial Court and will not be disturbed on appeal unless there is an obvious abuse of discretion. There is no insistence made nor showing that the Trial Judge abused his discretion in the present case. He merely believed one set of witnesses and disbelieved the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">In the present case, the only reviewable question presented by the appeal is whether there was substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>material evidence to support the finding of the Trial Judge. After giving the details of the accident and injury which occurred on August 8, 1949, while he was lifting a case of milk in the packing room of the Respondent, Petitioner testified that prior to the accident his back had caused him no discomfort nor disability from manual labor, and that immediately after the accident he had suffered such severe pain that he was disabled from performing any type of manual labor, and that this disability continued at the time of the trial. Dr. Hal Hardin and Dr. J. B. Lawrence both supported the Petitioner\u2019s testimony, and with lighted X-ray pictures, which the Doctors had made of \u00a1Petitioner\u2019s back, demonstrated to the Trial Judge the spinal displacement or abnormality which they testified was probably traumatic in origin, and which caused Petitioner\u2019s disability. Accordingly, we find that there was material substantial evidence to support the following finding of the Trial Judge: \u201cProm the evidence in this case I find, (1) that the injury was caused by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment with the defendant. I find that either the accident caused his disability, or the accident accelerated or aggravated a condition that existed thereby bringing about the disability. I am inclined to the view that it brought about the disability, but in either case the disability was caused by the accident. (2)1 find that the plaintiff or petitioner at this time is totally disabled to engage in any manual labor or any work he is reasonably fitted for. This is borne out by the plaintiff, his lay witnesses and some of the doctors. He certainly has carried the burden of proof in that respect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">All assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b624-6\">All concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
