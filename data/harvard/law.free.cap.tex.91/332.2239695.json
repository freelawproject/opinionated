Gorbett, 49 Texas, 573; Railway v. Leslie, 57 Texas, 88; Railway v. Geiger, 79 Texas, 21; Whittaker\u2019s Smith on Negligence, chap. 5, p. 459; Railway v. LeGierse, 51 Texas, 202; Railway v.

(2) That the charge by said expression misstated and exaggerated the amount to which the plaintiff was entitled at law and under his pleadings in this: That while his petition, filed April 18, 1896, claimed as damages for the present, past and future consequences of the injury, simply the sum of fifteen thousand one hundred and seventy dollars, yet the charge authorized the jury to find this amount, together with six per cent interest per annum thereon from the date of the injury, April 24, 1894, to the date of the judgment, April 20, 1896, a period of two years, thus allowing for such past, present and future results an item of damages, to-wit, interest, which was not recoverable at law nor claimed by the petition.

We insist that the amount of the verdict was greatly in excess of the injury and damages proven, and that such excess was superinduced in part by the errors in the court\u2019s charge mentioned in the first and second grounds of this petition.

A. Carr recovered judgment against the Texas &amp; New Orleans Railroad Company for \u00a713,742.86, for personal injuries received April 24, 1894, which judgment was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals. The petition, after stating the circumstances, alleged: \u201cThat by reason of the injuries aforesaid, plaintiff has been actually damaged in the sum of Ten Thousand One Hundred and Seventy Dollars (\u00a710,170) and that, by reason of the crushing, mangling and bruising of plaintiff\u2019s leg as aforesaid, plaintiff has suffered great physical pain and mental anguish and agony, to his damage in the further sum of Five Thousand Dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The trial court instructed the jury that if they should find for plaintiff they might assess his damages at a sum \u201cnot to exceed the amount sued for, to-wit: fifteen thousand one hundred and seventy dollars, with six per cent interest per annum from date of injury to the present time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The action of the Court of Civil Appeals in overruling the assignment of error complaining of this charge is assigned as error here. We think the charge was on its face erroneous in that it permitted the jury to allow interest for the period of one year eleven months and twenty-six days intervening between the dates of the injury and judgment (Watkins v. Junker, 90 Texas, 584). This erroneous statement of the law may have resulted in the addition of such interest, and to that extent but no further may have prejudiced defendant. The judgment will therefore be reversed and the cause remanded unless plaintiff below within ten . days from this date files a remittitur reducing the original judgment to \u00a712,277.75,\u2014that being the sum which put at interest at the rate of six per cent per annum for one year eleven months and twenty-six days will amount to the original judgment, \u00a713,742.86; but if such remittitur be filed the judgment will be reversed and here rendered for plaintiff below for \u00a712,277.75, with interest thereon at six per cent per annum from the date of the judgment below, and all costs of the trial court,\u2014plaintiff in error to recover all costs of appeal and Writ of error.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"remittitur\">\n<p id=\"b358-9\">on remittitur.</p>\n<author id=\"b358-10\">DENMAN, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ATb\">Plaintiff below having filed the suggested remittitur, judgment will be here rendered in his favor for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>the amount above indicated. We deem it proper to say that while we are of opinion that the question decided by us was properly raised by the assignment made in the Court of Civil Appeals, yet it was not urged there in the written argument contained in appellant\u2019s brief, and for that reason was doubtless overlooked by the court. We therefore do not understand that Honorable Court to have intended to hold the converse of the proposition of law upon which we have decided this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\">\n<em>Rendered on remittitur.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">December 23, 1897.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
