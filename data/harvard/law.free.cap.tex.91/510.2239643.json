A contract to purchase land, or the acquisition by contract of the potentiality to earn land by services, does not confer a right of alienation, or fix the status of the property. If alienation is permitted before the land is earned, it is of an estate to be created in the future, and not of a title then existing. Colonization Law of Coahuila and Texas; Pasch.

Power and his wife Dolores, (a) Because property acquired during marriage is presumed to have been acquired upon an onerous consideration, and to belong to the community, (b) Because, though it be admitted that the grant was made, in part, for a consideration belonging to the separate estate of the empresario, as well as upon a community consideration, if the proportionate amounts of the two considerations cannot be measured, the community will not be lost and merged, in the separate estate, but the latter will be lost in the community.

Batts, </em>for appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK2n\">filed a motion for rehearing, in which they urged that the answer given to the first certified question was erroneous in the following particulars:</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-7\">1. Error in assuming that under the Spanish law everything which may have been called \u201cbienes\u201d would be looked upon as property, and considered as separate or community according to the time of its acquisition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-8\">2. Error in assuming that everything which might have been called ' an \u201cacci\u00f3n\u201d was \u201cbienes\u201d in the same sense in which that term was applied to the law of ganancial property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-9\">3. Error in considering: (a) A concession\u2014a matter of grace\u2014a revocable privilege as an \u201cacci\u00f3n,\u201d as \u201cbienes,\u201d as property in the sense of the law of ganancias, (b) The concession to Power and Hewitson as a contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-10\">4. Error in making the status of the property as -separate or community depend upon the date of the initiatory steps taken in ifs acquisition rather than upon the date of its acquisition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-11\">5. Error in holding that, without reference to the time of acquisition of property, if the title thereto had its \u201corigin\u201d prior to the marriage the property is separate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-12\">6. Error in confounding the efficient cause,\u2014the \u201ccausa,\u201d the essential thing fixing a property right,\u2014with the origin or initiatory steps, and making rights to depend on the latter rather than the former.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>7. Error in holding that property in premium lands acquired by an empresario had its origin in the concession, in the mere privilege to introduce families, rather than in the introduction of families.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-3\">8. Error in assuming that the fixing of the rights of property depended either upon the determination of when the title was initiated (that is, when the first steps were taken), or upon a determination of when the grant was made, since it is immaterial when the initiatory steps were taken and also immaterial (except as to the law of presumptions) when evidence of the acquisitions (final title) was given, the material inquiry being when the property was acquired.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-4\">9. Error in denying that when property has been acquired during matrimony it is presumed to be community.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-5\">10. Error in making the status of property as community or separate depend upon the initiatory steps taken in its acquisition rather than upon the character of the property or labor by or through which it was acquired.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-6\">11. Error in violating a principle which has become a rule of property right in this State\u2014the equitable and well established rule that property is separate or community as the consideration was separate or community, and that when part of the consideration was separate and part community the property is separate and community in the same proportion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AO_\">12. Error in ignoring the fact that at least part of the \u201cefficient cause,\u201d the \u201ccausa,\u201d by, through, or by reason of which the property in controversy was acquired belonged to or was of the community.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ak3\">13. Error in not recognizing the fact that even if the concession was an \u201cacci\u00f3n,\u201d was \u201cbienes,\u201d it was not the \u201cbienes\u201d which is in suit, but that at most it was property which, together with other property, belonging to the community, and other labor of the community has been invested in or \u201cpermuted\u201d into the property in controversy, and which, therefore, in any event is at least community in part.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-13\">14. The court erred in not applying the statutory presumption that property held by the husband or wife at the time of the dissolution of the marriage is community.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-14\">15. The court erred in not applying the principle, that, when it has been established that a portion of the fund with which property was acquired was community property, the burden of proof is upon one undertaking to show a separate interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-15\">In an argument in support of the motion for rehearing (which cannot be intelligibly condensed in the space here permissible) counsel reviewed Spanish, French, and Louisiana authorities, with those of other \u201ccommunity\u201d States upon the doctrine of \u201crelation,\u201d and cited and discussed the following Texas cases: Hawley v.

Pasch. Dig., arts. 574, 586, 589; Bissel v. Haynes, 9 Texas, 585. By analogy to concessions to Mexican citizens: Ryan v. Jackson, 11 Texas, 401; Clay v. Holbert, 14 Texas, 189; Fulton v. Duncan, 18 Texas, 37; Martin v. Parker, 26 Texas, 260. Being a right guaranteed by law was accordingly alienable: Johnson v. <em>New</em>man, 43 Texas, 639; Herman v. Reynolds, 52 Texas, 395.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-9\">This alienable property right accruing to Power when he was a single man, fixes the legal status of the grant issued pursuant to such right, as Power\u2019s separate property. Manchaca v. Field, 62 Texas, 135; Porter v. Chronister, 58 Texas, 54; Wilkinson v. Wilkinson, 20 Texas, 244; Yates v. Houston, 3 Texas, 452.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-10\">If the fact that the grant to the land in controversy was extended by virtue of the contract right acquired by Power prior to his marriage, did not have the effect to absolutely impress upon such grant the legal characteristic of separate estate, still such fact was sufficient to rebut any community presumption arising from the mere extension of said grant after the marriage, and prima facie to constitute such grant separate property of James Power and impose upon appellants the burden of proving a community interest and its amount. Manchaca v. Field, 62 Texas, 135; Marlin v. Kosmyroski, 27 S. W. Rep., 1042.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-11\">Under the facts of this case there was no presumption that the grant in controversy was community property of the marriage of James Power with Dolores de la Portilla, or if such presumption ever obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>it was destroyed by the evidence, and the court correctly held that the burden was on appellants to establish that there was a community interest, and the amount of such interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-3\">The evidence disclosing a sufficient reason why said grant was not earlier extended, to say that there was no officer authorized to do so, no presumption that said grant was community property arises from the mere fact that it was extended after the marriage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-4\">If any community presumption ever obtained in this case, the issue being between the heirs of the husband and the heirs of the wife, whether the land in controversy was the separate estate of the husband or community estate of such husband and wife, this issue is determined like other issues, by a preponderance of the evidence, and any testimony reasonably satisfactory to the court is sufficient to destroy such community presumption. Mitchell v. Mitchell, 80 Texas, 101; Same case in 84 Texas, 306; Ballinger on Community Property, sec. 168.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-5\">The labors performed and expenses incurred in the procurement of the contract and its performance, are proper subjects of inquiry in determining the issue whether the consideration for said grant was separate or community property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-6\">Whether we consider the introduction of the colonists, or the labors performed and expenses paid in their introduction, as the consideration for this grant, still in either event the evidence discloses that the major part of said consideration was performed prior to said marriage, and a comparatively small part after said marriage, and hence it follows that there is no presumption that said grant was community property. Medlenka v. Downing, 59 Texas, 37; Watts v. Miller, 76 Texas, 14; McDougal v. Bradford, 80 Texas, 564; Marlin v. Kosmyroski, 23 S. W. Rep., 1042; Love v. Robertson, 78 Texas, 6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-7\">There being no presumption that said grant was community property, but the evidence merely disclosing that an interest therein might be community property, it therefore devolved upon appellants, as plaintiffs, to prove that there was such interest and its amount.

The statement and questions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">\u201cThe appellants, Dolores Welder and others, brought the suit against the appellees, Pat Lambert and others, in form for the partition of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>part of 4-| leagues of land situated in Refugio County, on the west side of the San Antonio River, granted to the empresarios James Power and James Hewitson as premium lands for the introduction of colonists under a contract with the State of Coahuila and Texas. There had been a partition of the interests of Power and Hewitson, and the 4-j- leagues above mentioned were set apart to Power. The contract for colonization was made June 11, 1828. The grant of the 4-\u00a3 leagues was made October 12, 1834; and the other premium lands were granted in December, 1834. Power was twice married. In July, 1832, he married Dolores de la Portilla. By this marriage there were two children, the appellant, Dolores Welder, and a son James Power, who was the father of the other appellants. The appellants are the only heirs of Dolores, the first wife. She died in 1836. Afterwards James Power married Tomasa de la Portilla, a sister of the first wife, who bore him five children. James Power died in 1852 and Tomasa his second wife died in 1893. The appellees represent the entire interest of the five children by the second marriage. Appellants contend that the land was the community property of James Power and his first wife Dolores, and that they are entitled to one-half thereof in the right of their mother and to two-sevenths of the remaining one-half in their right as heirs of James Power, while appellees contend that the land was the separate property of James Power and that the appellants' are only entitled to two-sevenths of the whole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-3\">\u201cThe contract of Power and Hewitson with the State of Coahuila and Texas was for a colony within the littoral leagues, and received the approbation of the Supreme Government. Article 1 refers to the approbation of the Supreme Government, and states that government admits the project so far as conformable to the law of April 24, 1824. It defines the limits of the colony, which was afterwards on March 13, 1829, augmented, and the colony was established in the augmentation limits.

The evidence shows that colonists were introduced both before and after the marriage, but it is uncertain how many were introduced before and how many were introduced after. If the respective interests in the land are to be established by proof as to what proportion of the consideration for the grant was of the separate estate of Power and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>what of the community estate of himself and his wife Dolores, the party having the burden of proof will be at great disadvantage on account of the uncertainty of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-3\">\u201cAppellees pleaded stale demand against the right of appellants to maintain their suit. The plea is substantially as follows: It alleged that plaintiffs claimed the land in controversy was community property of James Power and Dolores de la Portilla, and that they inherited from said Dolores her community interest; and then further stated, that the grant to James Power and James Hewitson of four and one-half leagues, embracing the land in controversy, and of five leagues in which Power relinquished his interest for that of Hewitson in said four and one-half leagues grant, were both made to James Power and James Hewitson as grantees, and invested them with the legal title, and the record and apparent title thereto, and in no manner disclose any trust or interest in favor of said Dolores. That said Dolores, wife of James Power, died intestate in about 1836 and prior to 1840, leaving surviving as her heirs at law the plaintiff Dolores Welder and a son, James Power, Jr. That the plaintiff, Dolores Welder, was born in 1835, married in 1850, arid her husband died in 18\u00cd6, and that continuously thereafter she had been a feme sol\u00e9. That said son James Power, Jr., was born in 1833, and consequently became of age in 1854 and died intestate in 1886, leaving as his heirs at law the other plaintiffs, Mary F. Swift, Agnes E. Shelley and James Power. That neither Dolores Welder nor James Power were at any time subject to any other disability than those named. That from the time of the accrual of such r ight, if any, until the institution, on August 18, 1890, of this suit, neither said James Power, Jr., nor plaintiffs ever actively asserted any claim to any community interest of Dolores Power. That defendants claimed title to interests therein as though it were separate estate of James Power and as devisees and purchasers from devisees under his will. That while the land in controversy has been used by all parties to the suit, yet such use was entirely consistent with the interests as defendants assert them, and inconsistent with plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and that the right to the use and enjoyment therefor has been recognized and respected by all parties to this suit and their predecessors in estate to be as defendants contend, and the burdens incident to the ownership have been borne in the same proportions. That none of the defendants ever sanctioned, recognized or respected any such claim as now asserted to a community interest under Dolores Power. That if any such interest ever existed the delay by plaintiffs to institute this suit has resulted in the loss of evidence which would establish its amount, and that the evidence probably once obtainable to establish that there was no such interest can no longer be obtained. Accordingly defendants contend that plaintiffs\u2019 demand was stale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">\u201cTo this plea the appellants demurred as follows: \u2018And further that said pl\u00e9a, in so far as it attempts to set up a use of said lands by the parties plaintiff and defendant inconsistent with plaintiffs\u2019 demands and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>consistent with the alleged claim of defendants, is insufficient in that it does not set up any facts as to such user as would tend to show such, and further because, in so far as by the allegations of said plea an equitable estoppel is attempted to be set up, it is insufficient in that it does not allege any facts constituting such estoppel, nor does it allege that-any act of the plaintiffs was to the injury of the rights of defendants, or that by such act or acts they were lead by plaintiffs into a false position as to their rights, or that they were thereby in any manner misled by any such act or acts or were induced to act thereon to their injury. And further, in so far as this said plea undertakes to set up a plea of stale demand, same is insufficient in that it attempts to set up a plea not applicable to the case made by the pleadings.\u2019 The demurrer was sustained, because the court was of the opinion that there was no such defense as stale demand. There is a cross-assignment of error upon this ruling of the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-3\">\u201cUpon the foregoing statement the opinion of the Supreme Court is requested upon the following questions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\">\u201c1. Did the fact that the grant to the land in controversy was made after the marriage of James Power and Dolores de la Portilla create the presumption that the land was the community property of the said James Power and his said wife Dolores?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">\u201c2. Upon an issue of fact as to how much of the consideration for the grant was of the separate estate of Power and how much was of the community estate of himself and his wife, on which party should the burden of proof rest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">\u201c3. What efforts or expenditures of Power should be estimated in determining the extent of the separate and community interests in the land? Should his expenditures and labors in obtaining the contract be taken into the estimation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">\u201c4. What was the character of the title inherited by the appellants from their mother? Was it legal or equitable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">\u201c5. Does the doctrine of stale demand apply to the appellants\u2019 cause of action?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">\u201c6. Should the demurrer of appellees setting up stale demand against the appellants\u2019 cause of action have been sustained?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">Preliminary to answering the questions certified, we deem it expedient to determine what the respective interests of Power and his first wife were in the lands at the time the final title was extended. The Spanish law being at that time in force, the result of the inquiry must depend upon the principles of that system of jurisprudence. There are decisions of this court which bear upon the question, but there are none that we have found in which the precise point has been considered. The Spanish authors, having no precedents to guide them, are necessarily confined to the enunciation of general principles, which fall short of declaring the law as to the specific question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">We are of the opinion that the concession made to Power and He wit-son under the law of Coahuila and Texas of March 24, 1825, by which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>in consideration of their stipulating to introduce into the State a certain number of families, they were given the right to a premium in lands to be selected and granted to them upon their compliance with the agreement, has all the elements of a contract, and it seems to us that it is a matter of no moment whether the right so acquired was alienable or not. It was a fixed contract right, which entitled them to acquire the lands by a compliance with its conditions; and as we think was property under the Spanish law. Escriche in his dictionary treats of the respective rights of the husband and wife in the property held by them, under the words \u201cBienes Gananciales;\u201d and he there says: \u201cAmong \u2018las bienes gananciales\u2019 are not considered: (1) Those which the consorts had at the time of contracting the marriage * * Escriche Die. Leg., p. 36?. In defining the meaning of the word \u201cbienes,\u201d he uses this language: \u201cUnder the word \u2018bienes\u2019 are included also \u2018las acciones\u2019 of whatever kind they may be. \u2018Acque bonis adnumeratur quod est in actionibus, petitionibus, persecutionibus.\u2019 \u201d Id. p. 362. The first class of \u201cacciones\u201d defined by the author cited are shares in a partnership or incorporated company. Id. p. 48. Then again, under a separate head, he defines the word \u201cacci\u00f3n\u201d as follows: \u201cThe right to demand anything; and the method of judicial procedure which we have for the recovery of that which is ours, or which another owes us. * * *. \u2018La acci\u00f3n\u2019 meant in the first sense, that is, such as a right which belongs to us to demand anything,\u2014may be considered movable or immovable [that is\u2014personal or real] by reason of its object, although it may be neither the one nor the other in its nature.\u201d Id. p. 49. The result is that all choses in action owned by either of the consorts before marriage, remain the separate property of such consort.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">If contracts be property and if all property held by either the husband or wife at the time of the marriage be the separate property of the consort who held it, it follows that the right of acquisition secured to Power by the contract of himself and Hewitson with the- State of Coahuila and Texas remained his separate property upon his marriage and did not fall into the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">But this comes short of settling the point under consideration. The inquiry still remains, is the status of the property to be determined by the acquisition of the final title or by the origin of the title? Upon this point we have found no direct expression in the authorities upon the Spanish law. But in Louisiana, where the community system prevails, the question has been set at rest by repeated decisions of the Supreme Court of that State. In the case of Barbet v. Langlois, 5 La. Ann., 212, the husband at the time of his marriage was possessed of a tract of land fronting on Bayou Placquemine. By a statute of the Congress of the United States the owners of land in Louisiana fronting on any water course were given a preference right to purchase the vacant lands lying adjacent to and in rear of his plantation, and upon his death the question arose whether the land so purchased was his separate property or belonged to the community of himself and wife. It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>held to be of his separate estate. After quoting Pothier, to the effect that vhe individual acquisitions of the spouses are community property only when the title or cause of the acquisition has not preceded the marriage, the court in their opinion proceed to say: \u201cHe [Pothier] gives numerous examples in illustration of this rule. A person, says he, who died before my marriage, has left me by will an estate, upon a condition which is not accomplished until after my marriage. The estate is my separate property because the will is my title, and it preceded the marriage. So where I have bought an estate before marriage, at a sum below the half of its just value, and after marriage I give validity to the sale by paying my vendor the residue of the just price, the estate is my separate property.\u201d Again, after quoting from Pothier to the effect that if a parent die after having sold property with the right of redemption, and the heir redeem it with community funds, it becomes his separate property,\u2014although he did not inherit the property, but merely a right of redemption,\u2014the court say: \u201cThe doctrine is a deduction from the maxim, is qui actionem habet, ipsam rem habere videtur. Now, although the illustrations we have cited are not identical with the one at bar, they present a very strong analogy. It is true that the land was not purchased from the United States until after Langlois\u2019 marrirge. But the \u2018cause\u2019 of the acquisitions may be fairly considered as having preceded the marriage. It was because he was the owner of the front land, an ownership acquired long before, that under the liberal legislation of Congress he was allowed a preference to enter, and that, too, at a low price, specific lands, which may perhaps have been worth much more.\u201d The same ruling was made in the case of the Succession of Morgan, 12 La. Ann., 153, in which the court say: \u201cBut we consider the decision in the case of Barbet v. Langlois, 5 Ann., 212, as decisive of this question. The only right to which the community is entitled is that of claiming the reimbursement of the sum paid on account of the entry of the double concession, if such payment has been made out of the funds of the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The principle was also embraced in the later case of the Succession of Moseman, reported in 38 La. Ann., 219; and the previous rulings of the court were followed. In that case, the husband, a short while before his marriage, had taken, out a policy of insurance on his own life, payable \u201cto his executors, administrators or assigns.\u201d After his.marriage the premiums were paid from community funds. After his death, upon settlement of his estate, the question was agitated whether the money paid by the insurance company upon the policy belonged to the community; and it was held, that it was property of his separate estate, but that it was chargeable in favor of the community with the premiums which had been paid with community funds. The court in that case say: \u201cThe contract creates certain rights and obligations which spring into existence the moment it is formed. Thus, at the date of the policies, Moseman acquired for himself the right to' receive, at his death, through his executors, administrators or assigns, the sums stipulated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>be paid, subject to the condition of compliance with his own engagements to pay the premiums as they fell due. This condition having been complied with, \u2018has a retrospective effect to the day that the engagement was contracted.\u2019 C. C., 2041. The character of the interest and of the ownership thereof takes its impress from the date of the contract.\u201d The quotation in the opinion is from the Civil Code of Louisiana. But the same rule seems to prevail under the Spanish law. Schmidt says: \u201cWhen the condition is accomplished, it refers back to the time of the making of the contract, and it is considered as made at that time; but if the condition be not duly accomplished, it is considered as never made.\u201d Schmidt\u2019s Spanish Law, art. 512. See also Escriche, under the words \u201cObligaci\u00f3n Condicional,\u201d to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Our own decisions are in harmony with the principles announced in the cases referred to, although as we have said\u2014the precise point seems not to have been determined. In Mills v. Brown, 69 Texas, 244, a widow, the head of a family, was entitled to acquire a homestead by settling upon the public domain, causing a survey to be made of the land, and by a continued residence thereon with an improvement of the same. While still a widow she made application for the land and paid the surveying fees. Thereafter she married, and moved with her husband upon the property. The conditions of the law were complied with, and, she having died, a patent issued to her heirs. The question came up in a suit between the heirs and a purchaser holding under the husband. It was held that the land was community and not separate property, and that the heirs were entitled to recover only one-half and the surveying fees paid' by their mother. The court, speaking through Chief Justice Willie, say: \u201cTo ascertain, therefore, the status of the property in controversy, we must find out by whom the first actual settlement upon it was made, of what the family consisted who first occupied the land, and in whose behalf an application could thereafter be made for a homestead pre-emption. The evidence upon that point is clear and undisputed; the settlement was made by Yarborough and his wife, formerly Mary Roberts, and her children by a former marriage. This initial and absolutely essential step was the joint enterprise of husband and wife, the occupation was continued by them jointly so long as the wife lived, and by the husband till the title matured. Considered in reference to this state of facts alone, there can not be a shadow of a doubt that the husband had the same interest in the land as that held by the wife or her heirs, and that it was community estate. We are of opinion that the facts that Yarbrough\u2019s wife had, before marriage, filed a pre-emption claim to the land and paid the surveying fees out of her own money, do not affect the right of her husband to a community interest in the homestead pre-emption. The law, as we have seen, does not contemplate that a survey shall be made on an application therefor filed until the pre-emptors have actually settled upon the land. Such acts must necessarily enure to the benefit of the family who make the first settlement, and no steps taken previous to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>that time by any member thereof for the benefit of any portion of the family and the exclusion of the remainder, can defeat the object of the law, which is to give to actual settlers a home upon land previously occupied by them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In Man chaca v. Field, 62 Texas, 1\u00bf5, the husband obtained a concession for the purchase of eleven leagues of land to be selected by him under the 24th section of the Colonization law, March 24, 1825. He obtained the final title to ten leagues under the concession granted to him, but before the extension of that title the wife died. The grant Was held to be community property. In that case the court say: \u201cIt is urged by the defendants that, although the concession had issued in the life-time of Mrs. Sanches, no step had been taken to appropriate any land under it; that, before the grant could be made effectual by the issuance of the final title, it was necessary to'obtain the consent of the empresario to locate the concession within his colony; that the particular land must have been selected, and surveyed and classified by an authorized surveyor, and the survey and classification approved by the commissioner, and that the fees of the empresario and other colonial officials, and the amount due the government for the land according to its classification, must have been paid or secured; and that the mere concession, which was nothing more than a license to purchase so many leagues of the public domain, to be subsequently selected, and at a price and on terms to be subsequently determined, ought not to be treated as property in being at the death of Mrs. Sanches so as to entitle her heirs to claim a community interest in the land afterwards granted Under it. There is much force in the argument, and it finds an apparent sanction in Webb v. Webb, 15 Texas, 274; Walters v. Jewett, 28 Texas, 192, and perhaps other decisions of this court; but the later decisions and the weight of authority seem to favor the proposition of appellants, that the concession having a money value, and being the\" subject of sale, was property, in which Mrs. Sanches had a community interest which descended to her heirs at her death, and which attached to the grant subsequently extended in the name of her husband. Porter v. Chronister, 58 Texas, 54; Wilkinson v. Wilkinson, 20 Texas, 244; Yates v. Houston, 3 Texas, 452.\u201d See also Hodge v. Donald, 55 Texas, 344. All these cases turned upon the determination of the question, whether or not the party taking the initial step in the acquisition of the property was at the time married or single.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Nor do we regard either the ruling in Webb v. Webb, 15 Texas, 275, or that in Walters v. Jewett, 28 Texas, 192, as being in conflict with these views. In the former, Judge Lipscomb, speaking for the court, says: \u201cThe question presented by this statement of facts is, was the property in controversy held by the husband and wife at the time of her death as community property? If it was, there is no question but that her heirs are entitled to the one-half, after the payment of the community debts. The statement of facts shows conclusively that the title to the land was not obtained until after the dissolution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>the matrimonial relations by the death of the wife. Does it show that anything had been done before this dissolution, giving a right in law to demand the title that subsequently issued to the husband, on which an equity could be raised in favor of the heirs of the wife, and attach to the land? The record of the statement of facts shows that the land had been selected before the death of the wife, but does not show in what way it had been selected, whether by application to the commissioner or in any other way. It does not show that the requisite qualifications of the applicant had been decided upon by the commissioner, or that anything had been done that was essential to the validity of the grant, prior to the death of the wife. We have no evidence that the necessary qualification of the colonist had been adjudicated upon by the commissioner before the date of the title; and at that time the husband was qualified as a head of a family to have received the same quantity of land, as his children were in the country with him.\u201d This extract, as we think, makes it manifest that if it had been shown that the land had been lawfully selected and the qualifications of the husband adjudicated before the death of the wife, the result would have been different. The ruling, that the immigration of the husband with the wife did not of itself entitle the latter to a half interest in the land granted by reason of that immigration, may be in conflict with other decisions upon that point, but in so far as the decision bears upon the question under consideration it seems to us to be in accord with our cases previously cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In Walters v. Jewett, supra, we do not understand the court to hold that the heirs of the wife were not originally entitled in equity to an interest in the land by reason of their mother\u2019s community right. There, during the life of the wife the husband sold one-half of his right to acquire land from the Republic by reason of his immigration as the head of a family. After her death he sold the other half. Both sales were made before the certificate issued. The certificate was issued to Jewett, his assignee, and the patent issued in the name of Jewett. The court hold, that the heirs of the wife had a mere equitable claim upon the land, and that it could not be recovered in action of trespass to try title.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In most of the cases cited, where the initial step in procuring title was taken, the purpose was to acquire a specific tract of land. In that respect the case before us is different. Power and Hewitson were not entitled, upon compliance with the conditions of their contract, to any specific tract or tracts,\u2014they were entitled only to so many leagues of land, which were to be selected. In this respect it does not differ from the case of Man chaca v. Field, before cited. In that case, however, the concession was obtained while Sanches was a married man, and the lands were held to be of the community although the final title was not extended until after the death of the wife. If he had been single at the date of the concession and had married before the issuing of the title, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the lands would doubtless have been held his separate property and the case would have been precisely in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\">In this cause the title originated in the contract of Power and Hewitson with the State of Coahuila and Texas. That contract, in the language of the Louisiana court, was the \u201ccause\u201d of the title. Power was single when it was entered into, and the right to earn the lands acquired by it was his separate property. The title relates to its origin, and must take the impress of its character from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The rule of Spanish law as to improvements made with community funds upon the separate property of the husband or wife is thus stated by Schmidt: \u201cMoney, expended in improving property belonging to one of the spouses, belongs to the community, but gives the other no claims to the property itself.\u201d Schmidt\u2019s Spanish Law, art. 48. It was so ruled by the Supreme Court of Louisiana in cases in which the rights of the parties depended upon the laws of Spain. Hughey v. Barrow, 4 La. Ann., 248; Frique v. Hopkins, 4 Mart. N. S., 212. These were cases in which the lands of one of the spouses were improved from community funds. We find no rule laid down in the Spanish laws which applies to a case precisely like this; but, as we understand that law, improvements, such as buildings and the like, made upon the land of one of the consorts by the community must, upon partition, be credited to the community estate, and are made a charge upon the property. 2 Febrero Reformado, arts. 2403-4, p. 95. The question here must therefore be determined by analogy to that principle. In Mills v. Brown, before cited, the expense of acquiring the land (which was held to be community property) was borne in part by the separate money of the Wife. It was ruled that the heirs of the wife were entitled to one-half of the land as community, and to a reimbursement of one-half of the expense so paid as a charge upon the husband\u2019s half of the property itself. They were not entitled to recover the other half of such expense, because they received one-half of the land; and in that had one half of the benefit of the expense. This decision would, we think, be absolutely controlling but for the fact that it is a ruling upon our own statutes and not upon the Spanish law. But we think the principle was deduced from the latter law. In the case of Moseman\u2019s Succession, before cited, the doctrine was distinctly announced and applied. It follows, as we think, that upon partition of the property in controversy the land was chargeable in favor of the community with whatever the community may have contributed in labor and funds to its acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Having disposed of the preliminary points which as we think are necessarily involved in the questions propounded by the Court of Civil Appeals, we proceed to answer as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">1. Although both under our statute and under the Spanish law the presumption of community property arises from the naked fact that it was acquired during the marriage, yet when, as in this case, upon an exhibition of the whole title it appears that its origin preceded the mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>riage and that it is the separate property of one of the spouses, we are of the opinion that the presumption no longer prevails.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\">2. The lands in controversy appearing to be of the separate estate of Power, we are of opinion that in order for the heirs of the first wife to establish a charge upon them for a reimbursement of community funds expended in their acquisition, the burden was upon them to prove that the funds had been so expended. 2 Febrero Ref., art. 2414, p. 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">3. We do not deem it necessary to decide the third question. The lands being the separate property of Power, and the heirs of the wife as such having no title in the property itself, the questions are,\u2014Were community funds invested in acquiring them? And if \u2022 so, how much?</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">4. The fourth question we consider abstract. We think this suffi ciently appears from what we have already said.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">5 and 6. If, as asserted in defendants\u2019 plea, the parties have had common use and enjoyment of the property in question as tenants in common, we are of the opinion that the demand of plaintiffs for reimbursement of the community for community funds expended in their acquisition could be asserted at any time in a suit for partition. In other words, we think that the matter was adjustable upon the final division of the property, and that it was not necessary to assert the claim until partition was sought. 2 Febrero Ref., art. 2250, p. 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">In our view of the law, the question of stale demand only arises in case the appellants in their pleadings alleged that community funds Bad been used in the acquisition of the lands, and sought, at least in the alternative, a restitution of their mother\u2019s half of the community funds so used. Whether or not they did this, we cannot determine from the statement which accompanies the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">This opinion will be certified to the Court of Civil Appeals of the First Supreme Judicial District as an answer to the questions propounded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
