L. Blackwell, against N. B. Means and plaintiffs as defendants, to foreclose a vendor\u2019s lien on the land conveyed by Wilhelmine Seibert to Bergman \u2022and wife, said lien having been executed by one through whom Mrs. Seibert deraigned title, that plaintiffs contested the said suit to the best of their ability, but that on June 29, 1892, a judgment was rendered in favor .of Blackwell, foreclosing a vendor\u2019s lien on said tract of land in the sum of $1031. That Bergman and wife appealed from the judgment, but it was affirmed. That afterwards an order of sale was issued and said land was sold, said Bergman and wife being too poor to pay off the lien, and in consequence lost the property, and have been ousted from the same. It was further alleged that the land was worth less than the amount of the purchase money and interest. It was further alleged that Mrs. Seibert was in peaceful possession of the land conveyed to her by plaintiffs, that she had refused to pay off the lien on their land, that she owned no property except the land conveyed to her by plaintiffs, and they prayed that a vendor\u2019s lien be recognized in their favor against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>land sold by them to Mrs. Seibert and that the same be foreclosed on. the land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-3\">\u201cAmong other exceptions Mrs. Seibert filed one setting up limitation of four years, which was overruled by the court and judgment was rendered in favor of Bergman and wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-4\">\u201cWhen did limitation begin to run against the cause of action of Bergman and wife?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">We answer the foregoing question, that the statute of limitations did not begin to run against the right of action of Bergman against Seibert upon the implied covenant against incumbrances until the land was sold under the judgment which foreclosed and enforced the incumbrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The implied covenant against incumbrances which arose under the statute, upon the language used in the deed, was broken at the time the deed was made, in the \u201csense that the promise relates to an existing condition and is falsified then if it ever is. But if the damage do not then result, it is misleading and mischievous to treat this mere technical breach as constituting plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.\u201d Post v. Campau, 42 Mich., 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The right of action for the actual damages sustained by the appellees by the breach of the covenant did not arise until the land was sold under the judgment enforcing it, although the incumbrance existed when the deed was executed. Prescott v. Trueman, 4 Mass., 629; Andrews v. Davidson, 17 N. H., 413; 43 Am. Dec., 606; Moore v. Merrill, 17 N. H., 75; 43 Am. Dec., 593; Funk v. Vonieda, 11 Serg. &amp; R., 110; 14 Am. Dec., 617; Reed v. Pierce, 36 Me., 455; 58 Am. Dec., 761; Post v. Campau, 42 Mich., 90; Wyatt v. Dunn., 93 Mo., 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The statute of limitation did not begin to run until the covenantee could maintain a suit to recover the damages sustained by the breach of the covenant. In commenting upon the position taken, that the cause of action accrued when the deed was made, Judge Cooley, in the case of Post v. Campau, before cited, said: \u201cAs the terms of the covenant sued upon were falsified by facts existing at the time, a technical breach may be said to have then taken place; but as no damage followed from this breach, until the claimant purchased from Butler more than ten years afterwards, the rule that the claimant\u2019s right of action shall be deemed to have arisen at the delivery of the deed involves this manifest absurdity: that the claimant\u2019s remedy was barred before he was damnified; a result that can scarcely be consistent with any just or proper rule of law.\u201d This clear and forcible statement of the proposition effectually refutes the claim that upon the making of a covenant against existing incumbrances, the statute of limitation commences to run against an action to recover actual damages thereon when such damages do not accrue at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">From the foregoing well-sustained propositions it follows, that the statute of limitations could not begin to run in this case until the land was sold in the enforcement of the incumbrance, because up to that time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the covenantee had lost nothing and could have maintained no action except for nominal damages, which would have been no recompense for the injury afterwards suffered by the eviction. This conclusion is sustained in able and well-considered opinions in the cases of Post v. Campau, 42 Mich., 90, and Wyatt v. Dunn, 93 Mo., 459, which we have before cited.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
