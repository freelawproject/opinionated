Smyth, who were all principals in said bond, when it reversed and remanded the cause as to Smyth and Price and affirmed as to McFarlane alone: (1) Because such a bond is joint and not several and cannot be made a several bond as to principals. (2) Because the sureties have a right to look to the solvency and character of their principals when requested to go on bonds, and the solvency of the principal in bonds of this kind is the greatest incentive or inducement to accede to or perform the unpleasant task of becoming surety for another. McFarlane being a defaulter the sureties relied more strongly, if not altogether, upon the other two principals, Smyth and Price, for their protection, which was the intention of all parties, and to release them by such a judgment is to do violence both to the legal effect of said bond as well as to the intention of the parties thereto. (3) Because the judgment rendered by affirmation against W. M. Mc-Farlane in this court, is not the judgment from which appellants appealed and for which they agreed to answer. This suit was against W. M. McFarlane and his sureties on his official bond and for a breach thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-11\">The court erred in holding the sureties on supersedeas bond, W.

Price shall prosecute their appeal with effect (Blair v. Sanborn, 82 Texas, 686) and in case the judgment of the Supreme Court or of the Court of Civil Appeals shall be against them they shall perform its judgment, sentence or decree and pay all such damages as said court may award against them (not him, McFarlane) then this obligation shall become null and void.

C. Price and G. W. Smyth, as sureties on an instrument in writing declared on as the official bond of McFarlane, given as treasurer of the county, for the security of the school fund, under art. 921, Rev. Stats., and payable to the County Judge of said county, to recover a sum of money belonging to such school fund, which it was alleged McFarlane had received after the execution of such bond and had failed at the expiration of his term of office to pay over to his successor or otherwise account for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">\u201cThe defendants pleaded a general denial, and specially that the bond sued on had never been delivered to, accepted or approved by the obligee, the County Judge, and hence was not the official bond of the treasurer. One of the sureties further pleaded that he had signed the bond and left it in the hands of McFarlane, with the understanding that it was not to be delivered to the County Judge until the signature of another solvent surety had been procured; that such signature had not been obtained, and that the County Judge knew of these facts when he had accepted the bond, if in fact he had ever done so. This special defense was stricken out on exceptions and the case was tried on the other issues, and judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff, that plaintiff recover of W. M. McFarlane, W. C. Price and G. W. Smyth the sum of twenty-three hundred and sixty-four and 48/100 dollars with interest, etc., for all of which let execution issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">\u201cThe defendants filed a

Smyth upon rulings of the court below affecting the only issue as to the validity of the bond sued on, but held that, inasmuch as the pleadings and evidence showed McFarlane\u2019s liability independently and regardless of the bond, the judgment against him should be afiirmed, and accordingly judgment was entered affirming judgment of the District Court as to McFarlane and reversing it and remanding the cause for a new trial of the issues upon which the validity of the bond and the liability of the sureties on it depended.

Pl. &amp; Pr., 1014. The text quoted is sustained by the following cases cited in its support: Seacord v. Morgan, 3 Keyes (N. Y.), 636; Burrall v. DeGroot, 1 Bosw. (N. Y.), 637; Ives v. Hulce, 17 Ill. App., 35; see also Neff v. Edwards, 81 Ala., 247. The rule may not apply in a case in which the judgment appealed is founded upon a liability joint merely and not joint and several, provided the law of the jurisdiction requires a joint judgment against all the original defendants. But it would seem that in such a case the question could not arise, for there a reversal of the judgment as to one defendant would reverse it as to all. In this State, however, all joint obligors need not be sued, and a judgment may be taken against one or more without taking it against all. Miller v. Sullivan, 89 Texas, 480; Hinchman v. Riggins, 1 White &amp; W. App. Civ. Cas., sec. 295. Each party to a suit against whom a judgment is rendered who desires to supersede the judgment is required to give an appeal bond; and each may give a separate bond; and, while they may give a joint bond, we are of opinion that it was never intended that by doing so either they or their sureties could change their liability in the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">We answer the question in the affirmative and our opinion will be so certified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
