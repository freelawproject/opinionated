(Pp. 160, 162.)</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b175-13\">(2) This conclusion was not affected by the fact that all the parties were joined as plaintiffs instead of some being made defendants, as is usual. On such an issue each is necessarily antagonistic to the other throughout the entire proceeding, whether they put in motion the machinery of the law as co-plaintiffs or otherwise. (P. 161.)</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b175-14\">(3) The allegation that a just partition could not be effected without a sale, with special prayer therefor, was not binding on the court, which might have disregarded same and proceeded to partition in kind, if such course had been deemed to the best interest of all concerned. (P. 161.)</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b175-15\">(4) Since a minor was interested, it was the duty of the court to inquire into and determine the truth of the allegation before entering any decree thereon, and in this collateral attack the presumption that the court did so is conclusive. Its action in finding the allegation true and granting the special prayer did not disprove its jurisdiction, which depended on the character of the case, and not the action of the court in disposing of same. (P. 161.)</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b175-16\">(5) The prayer for \u2018 \u2018different and general relief\u2019 \u2019 evidences that the parties did not intend to insist upon a sale as a sine qua non. (P. 161.)</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b175-17\">(6) The District Court prior to the Revised Statutes of 1879, first specifically authorizing such proceeding, had power, as a part of its general equity jurisdiction in partition cases, to order the sale of property for partition, though some of the parties to the proceeding, being under disability, were incapable of consenting (reviewing the legislation and authorities on this question). (Pp. 162 to 166.)</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b175-18\">(7) The action of the court in ordering sale and conveyance of the land without report of sale or order of confirmation, though probably erroneous, did not make the title of the purchaser void on collateral attack. (P. 166.)</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b176-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>(8) A party having capacity to consent to such proceedings and who received a part of the land bid in for her at the sale, the part in controversy having been bid in for another owner, was bound by the proceeding as a verbal partition, and could not avail herself of insufficiency in the description of the land in the partition and order of sale.

Blagge was estopped from asserting the invalidity of said partition proceedings, because the same were procured by her and she received large benefits thereunder, and with full knowledge of all the facts acquiesced therein for nearly or quite twenty years before the instituton of this suit, during which time the defendants herein purchased and paid for the land in good faith, relying on the validity of the partition had under said proceedings, and had, during such acquiescence and before the institution of this suit, in such good faith, made large and valuable improvements on the land sued for, the title to which was acquired through said partition.

Such matters go to the form and not to the validity of the action of the court, which cannot be impeached in that regard except by direct appeal. 70 Texas, 744; 65 Texas, 592; 54 Texas, 83; 49 Texas, 715; 52 Texas, 603; Shaw v.

Hot even a right to a confirmation existed in this case, because the property in question was bought in by the attorney for the parties in trust for George Butler, and title was taken in the attorney\u2019s name without expressing the trust and without paying for the land, which was not authorized by the decree of sale.

C., 34; 2 Jones, Mortgages, secs. 1608, 1637.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-7\">The sale in question was void as a judicial sale, because it was not authorized by the order of court in that the order did not authorize the making of a sale or title to McLeinore or others without consideration upon any parol agreement that he would hold it in trust for others. As appellants claim benefit from the fact, not apparent of record, but proved in the case# that McLemore did not buy the land bought by him for cash, but without consideration, to be sold by him for the heirs, appellants must take the disadvantage of this state of facts which they set up; and accepting this to be the fact the result is that the sale of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>land in controversy to McLemore was in violation of the order of sale and void as a judicial sale, and could not be binding on Mrs. Blagge, a married woman, as an agreement to pass title in this manner, if she agreed to it, which we deny, unless she was guilty of fraud, which would estop her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-5\">The order of sale was void for uncertainty in the description of the land, as the description, \u201cone-fifth of two leagues granted to T. J. Chambers in McLennan County\u201d does not show whether it was an undivided interest which was to be sold or a certain part in severalty. The ambiguity is a patent one, and cannot be cured by evidence not referred to in the order. Davenport v. Chilton, 25 Texas, 518; Norris v. Hunt, 51 Texas, 609; Pfeiffer v. Lindsay, 66 Texas, 123.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-6\">If the description, one-fifth of two leagues, be construed to mean an undivided one-fifth of two leagues, an order of sale containing such a description, when the parties to the suit did not own such an interest, but only 640 acres, and that not as an undivided interest in the two leagues, but owned a particular 640 acres set aside to them before the order of sale, did not authorize the sale of said 640 acres, and without the order of the court to support the sale the sale was void. Henry v. Mitchell, 32 Mo., 512; Pfeiffer v. Lindsay, 66 Texas, 123.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-7\">The consent by Mrs. Blagge to her attorney at law taking such steps as he saw proper to partition the estate in which she was interested, his application in her name to the court to sell for partition vhich application failed to give the court any jurisdiction over her estate or over her in regard thereto, the subsequent sales made and procured by McLemore as her attorney, and the receipt by her husband of the consideration obtained by McLemore for the sale of other lands than this tract, and her acquiescence in what was done in this regard with a knowledge of what was done, without concealment or misrepresentation by her or other conduct amounting to actual fraud, and without the proceeds of the sale having gone to release any charge upon her separate property, does not estop her or call for refunding of money as a condition of recovery.

And it being made known to the court at this January term, 1870, of the said court that the decree of this court heretofore made in this behalf has not been carried into execution, and the parties in interest being present by their attorneys ask that the said order heretofore made be executed on the 1st Tuesday in March next, A.

D., 1870. The said lands to be sold as under said order being as follows, to-wit:\u201d (here follows description of lands same as given in exhibit \u201cA\u201d attached to the original petition.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The order of sale issued in pursuance of said decree and under which the lands were sold has been lost and the record does not show affirmatively what description of the land-in controversy was given therein, but the return of the sheriff shows sale thereof under said order by the following description: \u201cOne-fifth of two leagues, 640 acres, McLennan County, T. C. Chambers headright to M. C. McLemore, $3.60 per acre, $3100.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The deed from the sheriff of Galveston County to McLemore in pursuance of said sale is not Set out in full in statement of facts, but is described in the following language: \u201cThe defendant then introduced the deed from Frank Dirks, Sheriff of Galveston County, Texas, which recites that the same is made under and by virtue of an order of sale issued out of the District Court of Galveston County, in a certain cause No. 4248\u2014Harry W. Blagge, Caroline E. Blagge, Geo. J. Butler and Fannie Butler, minor, by George Butler, guardian, and in pursuance of a decree rendered therein on the 5th day of July, 1869, and a further order on January 17, 1870, which deed conveys the land in controversy to M. C. McLemore for the sum of $3.50 per acre, which deed is dated the first day of March, 1870.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">This is a suit in trespass to try title brought in the District Court of McLennan County by said Caroline E. Blagge, joined by her husband H. W. Blagge, Fannie Nichols nee Fannie Butler, joined by her husband M. C. Nichols; and the children of said Geo. J. Biitler, who died subsequent to said proceedings in District Court of Galveston County, to recover the land in controversy from plaintiffs in error who claimed the same through mesne conveyances under said McLemore. On the first trial the trial court instructed a verdict for the, defendants and rendered judgment accordingly, but its judgment was reversed by the Court of Civil Appeals, Fisher, Chief Justice, dissenting. Blagge v. Moore, 23 S. W. Rep., 467; 26 S. W. Rep., 305. On the second trial the trial court, following the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals, rendered judgment for the plaintiff Caroline E. Blagge for one half of the land, it being admitted that the other plaintiffs were barred by limitation, and on appeal to the Court of Civil Appeals said judgment having been affirmed, Fisher, Chief Justice, dissenting, plaintiffs in error, defendants below, have brought thecause to this court by writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">The majority of the Court of Civil Appeals held that the District Court of Galveston County \u201chad no jurisdiction, and that the proceedings referred to were not binding on Mrs. Blagge as a judgment,\u201d and therefore did not divest her of her title to her one-half of the land in controversy. The correctness of this ruling is challenged by assignment of error in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">The position of the majority of the Court of Civil Appeals upon this question is stated in their opinions above cited as follows: \u201cIn the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>ceedings under consideration, the pleadings which form the basis of jurisdiction were not only ex parte, but they disclosed the utmost harmony among the parties to the supposed litigation. Each conceded all the rights that the others asserted. Nothing was left for the court to decide; they were agreed in every particular, and even the possibility of an issue did not exist. All that was asked of the court was to enter the agreement upon its records, and issue a mandate for its execution. Such being the case, the District Court of Galveston County had no jurisdiction, and the orders made by it are not binding upon Mrs. Blagge. If it be suggested that as Fanny Butler was a minor, it was necessary to have a judicial sale of her interest in the property, otherwise title could not be divested out of her, it may be answered, that the proper court to make such a sale, so as to bind the minor\u2019s estate, was the Probate Court in which the guardianship of said estate was pending.\u201d And again: \u201cIf we could find sufficient reason for holding that the proceeding was a partition suit, we could concur with counsel for appellees in the contention that the court had jurisdiction. But, in our opinion, it was merely an application for the appointment of an agent to sell certain real estate. It asked the court to exercise, independently, certaiii functions which it had no power to exercise, separate and apart from other proceedings. Because the court may have had the power in a partition suit to order the property sold, it does not follow that such power existed independently of such a suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\">The Constitutions of 1866 and 1869, under which the proceedings in question were had, each provided that \u201cthe District Court shall have original jurisdiction * * * of all suits for the trial of title to land * * * and of all suits, complaints or pleas whatever, without regard to any distinction between law and equity, when the matter in controversy shall be valued at, or amount to, one hundred dollars, exclusive of interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Since the property involved in the proceeding before the District Court &lt;pf Galveston is not claimed to have been valued at or amounted to less than \u00a7100, exclusive of interest, we do not feel called upon in this case to determine which of such clauses conferred jurisdiction upon the District Court to entertain partition proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">If, as was held by the Court of Civil Appeals, the proceeding \u201cwas merely an application for the appointment of an agent to sell certain real estate,\u201d it would be difficult indeed to find authority in the Constitution for the exercise of such power (Messner v. Giddings, 65 Texas, 301); but we think it was more\u2014that it was essentially a suit for partition, the parties expressing a wish or preference to have the property sold by the sheriff as part of the procedure. The petition alleged that petitioners were joint owners of the property, stating their respective interests,, that it was not susceptible of division in kind so as to make an equitable partition, and that it was advisable and necessary that a partition of same \u201cshould be made between the said parties in interest,\u201d and concluded with a prayer for general relief. - If it had contained no more, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>there could have been no room for doubt that the facts stated would have been sufficient to have called into exercise the power or jurisdiction of the court to proceed to partition the property in such manner as it might deem proper within the rules of law. This conclusion cannot be affected by the fact that all the parties were joined as plaintiffs, instead of some of them being made defendants, as is usual. While they saw fit to unite in a request that the court exercise-the jurisdiction conferred upon it by law, such joinder was of no avail for that purpose, for either party could as a matter of right, without the assent of the others, have invoked the exercise of such jurisdiction. The real question at issue in such cases is whether the portion which may be finally allotted to each is his fair share of the whole. On this issue each is necessarily antagonistic to the other during the entire proceeding, no matter whether they put in motion the machinery of the law as co-plaintiffs or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">But the petition further alleged \u201cthat the only mode by which such end (i. e. the partition) can be justly attained is by and through a public sale of the same, under the order of your honor,\u201d and, therefore, it was specially prayed by all the parties that the court order a sale by the sheriff, giving each party the right to bid in any of the lands and have the sheriff convey same to him, without payment of money, to the extent of his interest in the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">We are of opinion, that such allegation that a just partition could not be effected without a sale, and the consequent special prayer for an order of sale, was not binding on the court, but upon the hearing it might have disregarded same and proceeded to partition in kind if such course had been deemed to the best interest of all concerned; that since a minor was interested it was the duty of the court to enquire into and determine the truth of the allegation before entering any decree thereon; and that in this collateral attack the presumption that the court did so is conclusive. If upon the hearing the court had found such allegation untrue and proceeded to partition the land in kind it could not have been urged with any degree of plausibility that the proceedings were void for want of jurisdiction. If we are correct in this, it must follow that the court had jurisdiction, although it found such allegation to be true and granted the special prayer; for it would be absurd to make the jurisdiction of the court depend not upon the character of the case, but upon some action of the court in disposing of same.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Again, the petition evidences the fact that the parties did not intend to insist upon a sale as a sine qua non, for after the special prayer the petition closes, \u201cand for different and general relief\u201d; thus requesting the court, in case it should decline to order the sale specially prayed for, to give such \u201cdifferent\u201d relief as the court might deem them entitled to under the law as applied to the facts of the case. This \u201cdifferent relief\u201d must have referred to a partition in kind in case the special prayer was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">When we consider the allegations in the petition that petitioners were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>joint owners, that the property was not susceptible of division in kind so as to make an equitable partition of same between the owners, that it was \u201cadvisable and necessary that a partition of the estate should be made between the parties in interest, and that the only mode by which such an end can be justly attained\u201d is through a sale, taken in connection with the special prayer and the provisions therein allowing each to bid in property, without money, to the extent of his interest in the estate, and the alternative prayer seeking such relief as the parties might be entitled to if the special prayer were refused, we think it clear, as indicated above, that the proceeding was not \u201cmerely an application for the appointment of an agent to sell certain real estate,\u201d as held by the Court of Civil Appeals, but was essentially a suit for partition, the parties expressing a wish or preference to have the .property sold by the sheriff as part of the procedure. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\">It is urged by defendants in error that, though the court had jurisdiction, it was without power to order a sale for partition and therefore the decree is void. The Court of Civil Appeals, having held the court without jurisdiction, did not reach this question and expressed no opinion thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The act of February 5, 1840 (Acts 1839-40, Hartley\u2019s Dig., arts. 2617-2620) allowed partition and prescribed a procedure, but made no provision for sale in any case. In 1857, in Grassmeyer v. Beeson, 18 Texas, 754, referring to this statute, this court through Wheeler, J., said: \u201cThe giving of the remedy by statute in a court of law has never been deemed to take away, or in any degree to abridge the original and inherent powers and jurisdiction of the court of chancery in respect to the partitioning of estates. The statute prescribes a procedure which parties may adopt if they see proper; but it is not obligatory. Our courts, possessing the powers of courts of chancery, may proceed to administer relief upon the principles of equity, as fully and completely as a court of chancery in England could do, without the aid of the statute. The foundation of the jurisdiction of equity is not in the statute, but in the judicial incompetency of the courts of common law to furnish a plain, complete and adequate remedy; and in complicated cases, the statute would afford a very inadequate and incomplete remedy. But it is usual to provide in the decree, for the commissioners to report; and .upon confirmation of their report, to direct conveyances to be made. It is competent for the court to direct the manner of making the partition, and to decree the making of the conveyances, without the necessity of a report and decree of confirmation. The court may, in the first instance direct conveyances to be made in pursuance of the allotments of the commissioners, if that be deemed proper. There can be no doubt that the powers of the court are adequate for this purpose; and if the decree should be erroneous none but a party or privy, or some one whose interest is in some way affected by it, could complain or take advantage of the error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">At its next session the Legislature, evidently intending to leave the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>procedure in partition to be regulated by the court according to the rules of equity, which were held in said opinion to be more adaptable to the -exigencies of particular cases than those prescribed by the statute, repealed all that portion of said statute attempting to prescribe such procedure. Acts of 17th Leg., chap. 92, sec. 21, p. 114; Pasch. Ann, Dig., Vol. 1, art. 4708, note 1066. Thus the law stood until the adoption of the Revised Statutes of 1879, which \"again provided a procedure in such cases, and as a part thereof provided for sale if in the judgment of the commissioners and the court \u201ca fair and equitable division of the real estate, or any part thereof, can not be made.\u201d This is the first provision made by statute in this State for the sale of real property for partition, and it seems to have been intended only as part of the statutory proceeding there prescribed. But by article 8490 of said statutes the original power of courts of equity to partition, as asserted in Grassmeyer v. Beeson, was recognized and preserved by the declaration that the provisions thereof should not \u201cpreclude partition in any other manner authorized by the rules of equity.\u201d Thus it appears that from the adoption of the common law as the rule of decision by Act approved January 20, 1840, to the present time courts of equity have had and exercised the power, independent of any procedure prescribed by statute, to partition realty according to their own procedure. Since there has been no statute expressly conferring upon them the power to sell for partition, when thus proceeding, the inquiry as to whether it exists is of vital importance in determining the validity of titles deraigned through such sales. Though it is generally stated that in England there was no jurisdiction in equity, independent of statute, to order a sale for partition, it is by no means clear that such proposition is supported by the adjudicated cases. It was there settled at an early day that partition was a matter of right and that the inconvenience or difficulty attending same was no ground for refusing the relief. Thus in Turner v. Morgan (8 Ves. Jr., pp. 144, 145 and note, decided in 1807), the bill prayed partition of a house but did not ask a sale. The principal question seems to have been as to whether a court of equity should order a partition in such case. Lord Eldon, after much hesitation, appointed commissioners, holding that the difficulty of partition was no objection in equity, and after the commission reported he refused to set aside their report, excepted to on the ground \u201cthat they allotted to the plaintiff the whole \u25a0stack of chimneys, all the fire places, the only staircase in the house and all the conveniences in the yard,\u201d stating that \u201che did not know how to make a better partition for these parties; that he granted the commission with great reluctance; but was bound by authority; and it must be a strong case to induce the court to interpose; as the parties ought to agree to buy and sell.\u201d This case is meagerly reported and is much cited as authority for the proposition that there is no power in equity independent of statute to sell for partition, but we do not understand that question to have been involved, discussed or decided. The house seems to have been of such character as not to be easily susceptible of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>partition, and the right to proceed in equity under the circumstances was contested; but it was held that the proceeding in equity would lie where the writ of partition would lie at law, the Chancellor saying: \u201cI know no rule, but by considering the commission as due in a case where the writ would lie.\u201d As to the remarks of the Chancellor to the effect that it must be a strong case to induce the court to interpose we think they had reference solely to the question as to whether the court would exercise its discretion by setting aside the report of the commissioners. In 1863 in Griffies v. Griffies, 11 Weekly Reporter, 943, the bill being for \u201cpartition or sale\u201d of a two room cottage and about four acres of land, the plaintiff requested a sale which defendant resisted and it was said by Kindersley, V. C., that \u201cwhere one tenant in common refused to consent to a sale he could insist on there being a partition.\u201d Ho authorities are cited and no reasons are given for the ruling and no showing was made as reason for sale except that the value of the property would probably not exceed the costs of partition proceedings. In Davis v. Turvey, 32 Beav. 554, decided in 1863, the suit was for a partition and the parties who were entitled in ninths were desirous in order to save expense that the sale should take place instead of a partition, but one of the parties was an infant and could not consent. Sir John Romily, Master of the Rolls, said: \u201cI think I can do it, considering the smallness of the property and the number of the shares,\u201d and entered an order stating \u201cthat it is for the benefit of the infant defendant and of the other parties interested that the entirety of the said hereditaments and premises including the one ninth of the said infant therein should be sold. And it is ordered that said hereditaments and premises be sold accordingly.\u201d And a similar decree in a similar cause was made by Wood, V. C., in 1863 in Thackeray v. Parker, N. R. Vol. 1, p. 567. In December, 1863, in Hubbard v. Hubbard, 2Hem. &amp; M., 39, adult plaintiffs requested a sale for partition instead of partition in kind and read the evidence of competent surveyors to show that such sale would be for the benefit of the infant defendant. Wood, V. C., at first doubted whether such an order could be made, but eventually, considering it to the interest of all parties, ordered the sale. The proceedings show that when the decree was brought into the registrar\u2019s office to be drawn up it was objected that no such order had ever been or could be made, and it was not ultimately passed until March, 1864, when the order directing the sale was entered. In note (a) to the report of said case it is stated that in Donaldson v. Fairfax, Kindersley, V. C., had in 1861 made a similar order, a feme covert, who was the only party not sui juris, consenting, as far as she might be able to do so, to the sale. Whatever doubt may have existed on account of these decisions was put at rest by the Partition Act in 1868 (31 and 32 Vict. Ch. 40) providing for such sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">These and other decisions seem to establish the practice in English, courts of equity, prior to said statute, to have been, (1) that where all the parties were sui juris, no matter how inconvenient or destructive of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the interests of the parties a partition might be, a sale would not be ordered except by common consent in which case it would be, (2) that where all the parties sui juris consented the sale would be ordered, if the Chancellor deemed it to the best interest of all concerned, notwithstanding the fact of the inability of some of the parties to consent therto on account of infancy, and (3) that if all the parties sui juris consented the sale would be ordered, if deemed for the best interest of all parties, though a feme covert were a party, provided she consented; but in our judgment they fall far short of holding that they were without jurisdiction to order a sale for partition against the consent of one or more of the parties sui juris, if they had seen fit to so far free themselves from the embarassment due to the conservative and almost reverential regard of the English people for titles to realty as to have actually exercised such power. On the contrary we think that it logically results from the decisions that they had the jurisdiction, but, out of regard to precedent and the sanctity of landed estates, they had refrained from its exercise up to the enactment of said statute. Had not such statute been passed it is entirely probable that in the conservatively slow development of English jurisprudence such power would have soon been exercised. If such courts had jurisdiction to order a sale by consent of all parties, they had jurisdiction to do so without such consent, for consent cannot confer jurisdiction. That jurisdiction did not depend upon the fact that all parties consented, is evident from the fact that they ordered sales where some of the parties were by reason of minority incapable of consent. If as contended by defendant in error such jurisdiction was chargeable to the general jurisdiction of such courts over estates of minors, which did not exist in this State when the proceedings Ex parte Blagge were had, such facts seem to have escaped the observation of learned counsel and courts in said cases, for no reference is made thereto in support of the power so reluctantly exercised. That jurisdiction to order a sale for partition is not based either upon consent of all parties nor upon the fact that the court had general jurisdiction over estates of minors, is evidenced by the decree in Donaldson v. Fairfax supra, for the feme covert clearly could consent, during the progress of the cause to which she was a party, to any decree which the court had jurisdiction to make, but her consent could give no validity to a decree directing sale of her land made by a court without jurisdiction to enter same. There is a broad distinction between the questions whether a court will in deference to precedents regulating its procedure, order a sale for partition, and whether if it goes beyond such precedents and orders same its decree will be a nullity when collaterally attacked by a party thereto. Only the first question has, so far as we are advised, been considered by the English courts, but as above indicated we are of opinion that the logical result of their decisions would lead them to answer the second in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">But whatever may be, or may have been, the true limit in this respect of the jurisdiction of the Chancery Court in England, the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\"was not fixed by positive law, but was the subject of judicial determination, and was unsettled when our system was inaugurated in 1840, as above indicated. Our courts of equity were therefore called upon to grapple with the question of their jurisdiction to order sales for partition long before many of the decisions above referred to in the English; courts were rendered. Seeing that courts of equity derived their procedure largely from the civil law, which had also but recently been the basis of the law of this State, it was but natural for them to turn te that system to aid them in the solution of this question. There they found that it was competent to order a sale for partition, and by analogy thereto we understand it has been the practice in this State from the earliest time to this date for courts of equity to order property sold for partition when found to be incapable of partition in kind without serious injury to the interests of the parties. This we believe to be the-correct rule, and our conclusion results in upholding instead of uprooting titles to land based upon a judicious construction by our courts of the extent of their powers acquiesced in by a learned profession for many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\">It is also urged by defendants in error that the proceedings are void, because the decree ordered sale of the property and making of the deeds by the sheriff without any report of sale and confirmation by the court, being contemplated. We are of opinion that, while the action complained of would probably be error for which a decree would be reversed or set aside in a direct attack, it is not for that reason, under the; rule laid down in Grassmeyer v. Beeson, supra, void. In the case before us the parties requested and the court decreed a sale by the sheriff, the decree being so worded as to show that no further action of the court was expected, as was the case in Grassmeyer v. Beeson. We feel, bound by that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">We are therefore of opinion that the Court of Civil Appeals erred in-holding that the District Court of Galveston County \u201chad no jurisdiction and that the proceedings referred to were not binding on Mrs. Blagge as a judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Since the court had jurisdiction of the cause, with power to order the sale for partition, Mrs. Blagge had capacity to agree as shown by her pleadings, which were evidence of such agreement, that the sheriff' should deed to each party the lands bid in by him as his portion of the-common estate, and since the uncontradicted evidence supports the finding of the court below that the land in controversy was bid in by Mc-Lemore for Geo. J. Butler, and other property was bid in by him for Mrs. Blagge and each received the proceeds of the sales of the property so purchased for them, and since the property bid in for Geo. J. Butler was deeded to McLemore by the same description as is given in the petition in this suit, we are of the opinion that Mrs. Blagge, is after so long a time, bound by the setting aside of said property to Geo. J. Butler as a verbal partition, no matter whether the division was equal or not, and therefore we do not deem it necessary to determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>description given in the proceedings prior to the sheriff\u2019s deed were sufficient to pass the title at a sheriff\u2019s sale under order of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\">The judgments of the trial court and Court of Civil Appeals will therefore he reversed and judgment here rendered that plaintiffs below take nothing by their suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><em>Reversed and rendered for plaintiffs in </em>error\u201e</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Opinion delivered January 28, 1897.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b191-7\">DENMAN, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Ani\">In this motion for rehearing, defendants in error do not, as we understand, controvert the correctness of the conclusions reached by us in the opinion that the suit in Galveston was one for partition, and that in such proceeding the court had power to order a sale for partition, but they contend that the land in controversy in this cause was not included in that transaction, and that the Court of Civil Appeals found as a fact that there was no parol partition, and hence this court, having no jurisdiction to find such a fact, is bound by their action, and must affirm this judgment, unless the description in the judicial proceedings be sufficient to pass the title.</p>\n<p id=\"AQS\">We are of opinion that this position is not well taken. The finding of fact and the undisputed evidence show that: \u201cIt was admitted in open\" court by counsel for both plaintiffs and defendants that Jonas Butler did own an undivided one-fifth interest in the T. J. Chambers two league grant in McLennan County, Texas, and that in 1859 in partition proceeding between himself and the co-owners of said land, said one-fifth interest in said T. J. Chambers grant, being the six hundred and forty acres in controversy, was set apart to him as his undivided interest therein, and is the same land in controversy herein;\u201d that the same land was conveyed by the sheriff\u2019s deed to McLemore; that in the petition for partition it is described: \u201cMcLennan County. John S. Sydnor to James Butler, one-fifth of two leagues situated where the City of Waco is now built, T. C. Chambers, grantee; recorded in Milam County, Book V, p. 166 and 167;\u201d that in the sheriff\u2019s return, it is described \u201cone-fifth of two leagues, six hundred and forty acres, McLennan County, T. C. Chambers headright to M. C. McLemore;\u201d that McLemore bought for Geo. J. Butler, one of plaintiffs in the partition, in pursuance of the agreement and purpose shown by the proceedings therein, and that none of the parties ever questioned this setting aside of this land to Geo. J. Butler until this suit was filed. The only defect in the description of the very 640 acres in controversy herein, in said partition proceedings, is that it is therein referred to by the description under which Jonas Butler, the ancestor, held it prior to the partition in 1859. Whatever may be said of the sufficiency of this mode of identifying the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>in a judicial sale, there can, we think, be no question that in the friendly partition, a setting aside of the property by the description under which the undivided interest was originally held by Jonas Butler would pass to the party thus receiving it the 640 acres which was allotted to Jonas Butler in the partition of 1859. The estate of Jonas Butler before was the same as that held by him after such-partition, the only difference being that his interest was segregated, a conveyance not being necessary to accomplish that result. It would be sacrificing substance to form to hold that the heirs did not intend to include the segregated 640 acres in the partition because they made a mistake in taking the description from the original title under which their ancestor acquired and held it. We think that the uncontradicted evidence in this case shows that a partition of the property was made, and that therein this land was set aside to Geo. J. Butler; nor do we think that the Court of Civil Appeals intended to find the contrary. We understand their position to be that if Mrs. Blagge be not bound by the partition proceedings, and the pleadings therein, then there was no evidence that she took \u00a1Dart in any partition. That court first held that those proceedings as to her were nullities, and therefore reached the conclusion that, as to her, there was no participation in the partition shown. We have reached the opposite conclusion, that the proceedings, though irregular, were had in a court of competent jurisdiction, and that they, as a matter of law, evidenced her assent and agreement that the property should be divided in the manner indicated therein; and we think the question as to whether she got in such division her proper share of the property is foreign to any issue in this case. The fairness of a partition is a matter to be tested in some proceeding instituted for that purpose and cannot be questioned in this action of trespass to try title.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\">The motion will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\n<em>Motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Opinion delivered June 26, 1897.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
