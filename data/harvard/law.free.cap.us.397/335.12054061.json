The sole remaining question therefore seems to be whether petitioner\u2019s failure to seek relief in the Court of Military Appeals precludes consideration of petitioner\u2019s claims by the federal courts. While the Solicitor General concedes that resort to that judicial remedy does not preclude consideration of petitioner\u2019s claim by the federal courts, there is a conflict among the circuits. It is for consideration of that question, or alternatively the merits, that the case is remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
