J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUx3\">Action for damages for personal injuries resulting from assault and battery allegedly committed by an employee of a bowling alley and liquor bar. Defendants Mr. and Mrs. Crow were the owners of the alley and bar; and defendant Laurine Sehaal, a sister of Mrs. Crow, was the alleged employee. In a nonjury trial, judgment was for plaintiff for $5,000. Mr. and Mrs. Crow (the owners) appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Appellants contend that the evidence does not support the findings: (1) that the assault and battery arose out of and occurred in the scope and course of Laurine\u2019s employment; and (2) that appellants knew or should have known that Laurine had a propensity to be violent when drinking intoxicating liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The alleged assault and battery occurred on September 19, 1956, about 12 :30 a.m., in a bedroom adjoining the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">On September 18, 1956, about 6 :15 p.m., plaintiff and her husband, a fireman, went to the bowling alley to bowl with a firemen\u2019s bowling league. Plaintiff bowled until approximately 9:30 p.m., and soon thereafter she went into the barroom. Plaintiff\u2019s husband came into the barroom about 10:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">A part of plaintiff\u2019s testimony was as follows: After her husband came into the barroom they sat at the bar. Laurine came into the barroom and requested plaintiff to go with her to the restroom. On the way to the restroom they went into the bedroom (which was between the barroom and restroom), and while they were in the bedroom Laurine started to talk about her troubles. Laurine said, among other things, that she was in love with Mr. Crow. Plaintiff tried to get away, but Laurine grabbed her arm, and said, \u201cI could break your arm. \u201d Bach time plaintiff tried to get away, Laurine pulled her and prevented her from leaving. Mrs. Crow came into the room, and Laurine told plaintiff to 1 \u2018 Tell her I insulted you or something,\u201d and to tell her \u201cAnything to get rid of her.\u201d Plaintiff told Mrs. Crow that Laurine had insulted her. Mrs. Crow said, \u201cLaurine you have no business drinking liquor. You are a sick girl.\u201d Mrs. Crow left the bedroom, and then plaintiff returned to the barroom. Laurine remained in the bedroom. Thereafter Laurine returned to the barroom and talked to plaintiff\u2019s husband who was playing juke box records. Plaintiff sat at the bar and talked to Mr. Crow who was tending the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">There was other evidence as follows: About midnight plaintiff became ill and went out of the building to a place near <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>the outside door of the bedroom. About 20 minutes thereafter, Mr. Crow went out of the building and noticed that plaintiff was lying on the ground. He knelt beside her and held her head. Laurine came to the outside door of the bedroom, and Mr. Crow asked her to \u201cgo get\u201d Mrs. Crow. While Laurine was in the doorway, plaintiff\u2019s husband and Mr. Parkinson, a fireman, came to the doorway. Plaintiff\u2019s husband went to the place where Mr. Crow was kneeling and struck him. Laurine screamed, and said, \u201cLeave my brother-in-law (Crow) alone.\u201d Then she went outside and tried to attack plaintiff and her husband. Parkinson held Laurine. Plaintiff and her husband went into the bedroom. Parkinson and Laurine returned to the bedroom, and Laurine said to plaintiff: \u201cI\u2019ll get you. You won\u2019t get away with it.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s husband started out the rear door of the bedroom. At that time Mr. Crow came to the rear or outside door of the bedroom, and then he and plaintiff\u2019s husband and Parkinson argued, while they were near the doorway. While they were arguing, Laurine (who had been sitting on the bed) jumped up, ran over to the place where plaintiff was standing and violently twisted plaintiff\u2019s arm, and threw her to the floor. Plaintiff\u2019s husband \u201cput a headlock\u201d on Laurine, and then Laurine released plaintiff\u2019s arm. While plaintiff\u2019s husband was holding Laurine, Mr. Crow started toward him. At that time someone struck Mr. Crow and as a result thereof he was unconscious. Then plaintiff and her husband left the bowling alley and bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Mr. Parkinson, a witness called by plaintiff, testified that the man who struck Mr. Crow came into the bedroom from the bar and returned to the bar immediately after he struck Mr. Crow; he (witness) did not know the man; after the altercation, and while he (witness), Mr. Crow, and Laurine were in the bedroom, Mrs. Crow came into the room; he \u201cdidn\u2019t think she knew exactly what happened all around, the whole story on that\u201d; she said to Laurine: \u201cMother will be sick when she hears about it. You are always doing like this. We are sick of it. Get out and stay out. \u2019 \u2019 He testified further that at the time of the attack Mrs. Crow was the only one who was sober; Laurine was \u201ccompletely intoxicated\u201d; and plaintiff was \u201cnot completely sober.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In 1952 (approximately four years prior to the attack), Laurine received treatment for alcoholism in a private sanitarium. In December, 1953 (approximately three <em>years </em>prior to the attack), she was committed to Camarillo State Hospital as a mentally ill person. Between March, 1954, and August, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>1955, she had been released from the hospital \u201con leave\u201d on several occasions. On May 30, 1956 (approximately three and a half months prior to the attack), she had been released from the hospital as a \u201cnormal person.\u201d She went to the bowling alley and bar about the last of August, 1956 (approximately three weeks prior to the attack), and lived in the bedroom above referred to. She left the place about the last of September, 1956 (approximately two weeks after the altercation). On October 4, 1956 (approximately three weeks after the altercation), she was recommitted to the hospital. On March 27, 1957, she was discharged from the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Laurine was not present at the trial. In her deposition, she said that on the several occasions when she had been released from the hospital (prior to the attack) she would \u201cfeel herself slipping again,\u201d and she would start drinking, and then would return to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The court found: That at the time of the attack, Laurine was an employee of the Crows, and the attack arose out of and occurred in the course and scope of her employment. That Laurine did not act in defense of herself or in defense of Mr. Crow. Plaintiff's injuries were not the result of a private quarrel between plaintiff and Laurine. At the time of the attack, Laurine was not an incompetent person. She was an alcoholic and had a propensity to be violent when drinking intoxicating liquor. Mr. and Mrs. Crow knew and (or), in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of that propensity. On the evening of the attack, Mr. and Mrs. Crow served alcoholic drinks to Laurine, and Laurine was intoxicated. They knew that she was intoxicated, and they were negligent in permitting her to mingle with the patrons and in failing to take care to protect plaintiff from Laurine although they had the opportunity and the ability to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">As above stated, one of the contentions of appellants is that the evidence does not support the finding that the assault arose out of and occurred in the scope and course of Laurine's employment. Appellants testified that Laurine was not employed by them. On appeal they state that although the evidence on the issue of employment was highly conflicting, there is sufficient evidence to support the finding that Laurine was employed as a cocktail waitress serving customers at the bowling alley until midnight. They also state that the finding that Laurine \u201cdid not go to the defense\u201d of Mr. Crow is supported by the evidence for the reason that plaintiff did not attack Mr. Crow. They argue that the only reasonable infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>ence which the evidence supports, other than an inference of \u201cdefense of person,\u201d is that the attack arose out of animosity of Laurine toward plaintiff as a result of attentions directed by plaintiff toward Mr. Crow, and that under such circumstances the attack did not arise out of or occur in the scope and course of Laurine\u2019s employment. They also argue that the evidence introduced by plaintiff shows that Laurine was not on duty at the time of the attack <em>{i.e., </em>was not on duty after midnight).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Plaintiff testified that during the evening, and preceding the attack, Laurine served drinks to bowlers at the bowling alley; that a week previous to the attack, plaintiff was at the bowling alley and on that occasion Laurine served drinks to the bowlers.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s husband testified that there was a red light which bowlers used for the purpose of calling a waitress; that when a bowler wanted a drink he would press a button which would turn on a light, and then a waitress would come, turn off the light, and take the order; Laurine was \u201ccarrying out that function\u201d during the evening and preceding the attack; a week previous to the attack, he was at the alley and on that occasion she served drinks to the bowlers.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Mrs. MeMenamin, a witness called by plaintiff, testified that she was at the bowling alley during the evening of the attack; she observed Laurine serving drinks there; during the evening Mrs. Crow asked her (witness) if she would make a hamburger for a customer \u201cbecause Laurine had passed out in the back room,\u201d and that Laurine \u201cwas unable to do this job, to make the hamburger. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Mr. Crow testified that Laurine lived on the premises from approximately the first of September until approximately the last week of September; during that time she took drinks \u201ctoward the alley\u201d; on the evening of the attack, she got one drink at the bar about 8 o \u2019clock and another drink about 8:30 o \u2019clock; he did not know whether or not they were for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">The trial court could reasonably infer from the evidence that Laurine was employed by appellants on the date of the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">In <em>Haworth </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>67 Cal.App.2d 77 [153 P.2d 804], an owner of a barroom was sued for damages for injuries received by a patron who was forcibly ejected from the barroom by the bartenders.  In that case it was said, at page 81: \u201cIn order to establish the liability of the employer for injuries inflicted by his employees it is sufficient to prove merely that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>excessive force was applied and that the servant was acting within the general scope of his employment. [Citation.] It is statutory that a principal is responsible for the wrongful acts committed by his agent when done as a part of the transaction of the business of the agency (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2338). . . . His [proprietor\u2019s] responsibility for wrongful acts of his agents is to be determined from the nature of the tort and from the \u2018activity of the agent on behalf of the principal in connection with which the act was committed.\u2019 The question is not whether the wrongful act itself was authorized but whether it was committed in the course of a series of acts of the agent which were authorized by the principal. [Citation.] It is sufficient proof of Elliott\u2019s [the proprietor\u2019s] liability that the bartenders were acting in his behalf at the time they ejected Haworth [plaintiff] from the barroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In the present case, as above stated, there was evidence that Laurine was employed by appellants as a waitress at the time of the attack. She was in the establishment, and patrons were there. She testified, regarding the attack, that: \u2018\u2018They were fighting. Whether or not she [plaintiff] was trying to help her husband or what, I don't know. All I know is they were in after Rick [Mr. Crow] and all I wanted to do was stop the fight and I pulled her away.\u201d As above stated, there was evidence to the effect that, a short time before the attack, plaintiff\u2019s husband struck Mr. Crow, and that Laurine tried to attack plaintiff and her husband. Immediately after plaintiff and her husband, and Parkinson and Laurine, had returned to the bedroom, and after Parkinson had released Laurine, the attack was made. Laurine was intoxicated at that time. The court could reasonably infer that Laurine, by reason of her intoxication, believed that a fight was in progress. She testified that she was attempting to stop the fight. The question as to whether Laurine was acting as a result of personal animosity or was acting in the scope and course of her employment at the time of the attack was a question of fact. Under the circumstances here, it cannot be said as a matter of law that she was not acting within the scope and course of her employment at the time of the attack. The evidence was sufficient to support the finding that the attack arose out of and occurred in the scope and course of Laurine\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Also, the evidence was sufficient to support the finding that appellants knew or should have known that Laurine had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>a propensity to be violent when she was drinking intoxicating liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Fount, J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied October 5, 1960, and appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 26, 1960.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
