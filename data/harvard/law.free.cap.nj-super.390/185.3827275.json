The issue presented by this appeal is whether the word \u201cinland\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-23(b) modifies not only \u201clake or pond\u201d but also \u201ca river or stream,\u201d thus exempting wetlands that discharge into tidal rivers or streams from the prohibition against issuance of general permits for activities on wetlands that are part of a surface water tributary system. We conclude that the word \u201cinland\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-23(b) only modifies \u201clake or pond\u201d and, therefore, a general permit may not be issued for an activity on a wetland that discharges into a tidal river or stream.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">Appellant is the owner of a small undeveloped lot in West Cape May. Appellant\u2019s lot consists almost entirely of freshwater wetlands. These wetlands drain into a stormwater system, which discharges into Cape Island Creek, a tidal stream that discharges into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">In 2003, appellant applied to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-23(b) for a general permit, referred to as a GP6, see <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.6, to fill the wetlands on his property for construction of a single family house. If an applicant does not qualify for issuance of a general permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-23(b), he must apply for an individual permit pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-9 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-13. <em>See In re Authorization for Freshwater Wetlands Gen. Permits, </em>372 <em>N.J.Super. </em>578, 582 n. 2, 860 A.2d 450 (App.Div.2004); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-1.4; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-4.2(e); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-7.1 to 7.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Appellant\u2019s application was denied on the grounds that the wetlands on his property are part of a surface water tributary system that discharges into a river or stream and that the wetlands are of exceptional resource value due to the presence in a nearby forest of the southern gray treefrog, a state endangered species. Appellant filed an appeal from this denial, which was referred to the Office of Administrative Law as a contested case.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">At the hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), the parties stipulated that the wetlands on appellant\u2019s lot discharge into Cape Island Creek, which is a tidal stream. However, appellant argued that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-23(b) prohibits issuance of a general permit only for an activity on wetlands that discharge into a non-tidal waterway. In view of the parties\u2019 stipulation that the wetlands on appellant\u2019s property discharge into a tidal stream, the evidence presented at the hearing related solely to the issue of whether the wetlands are of exceptional resource value because they are part of the habitat of the endangered southern gray treefrog.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">The ALJ found that the wetlands on appellant\u2019s property are not part of the habitat of the southern gray treefrog. Notwithstanding this finding, the ALJ upheld the denial of the general permit. The ALJ concluded, without substantial discussion, that the prohibition against issuance of a general permit for an activity on a wetland that discharges into a surface water tributary system only applies to wetlands that discharge into non-tidal waterways. He then found, apparently forgetting the parties\u2019 stipulation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>the wetlands on appellant\u2019s property discharge into a tidal waterway, that appellant had failed to establish this fact. Both parties filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s recommended decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The Commissioner of the DEP issued a final decision that upheld the denial of appellant\u2019s application for a general permit but rejected the ALJ\u2019s proposed findings and conclusions. The Commissioner concluded that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-23(b) prohibits issuance of a general permit for a regulated activity on any wetlands that discharge into a surface water tributary system, regardless of whether that system is non-tidal or tidal. In reaching this conclusion, the Commissioner relied on the plain language of the statute and its legislative history. The Commissioner also upheld the denial of appellant\u2019s application on the alternative grounds that the wetlands are of exceptional resource value because they adjoin a breeding and overwintering habitat for the endangered southern gray treefrog and that appellant\u2019s property is within the 150-foot transition area associated with the habitat of this species.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">We affirm the denial of appellant\u2019s application for a general permit on the ground that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-23(b) prohibits issuance of a general permit for a regulated activity on any wetlands that discharge into a river or stream, regardless of whether it is non-tidal or tidal. This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider the Commissioner\u2019s alternative grounds for denial of appellant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-23(b) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">The department shall issue a general permit for an activity in a freshwater wetland <em>which is not a surface water tributary system discharging into an inland lake or pond, or a river or stream, </em>and which would not result in the loss or substantial modification of more than one acre of freshwater wetland, provided that this activity will not take place in a freshwater wetland of exceptional resource value____ The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any wetlands designated as priority wetlands by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-10\">(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">These requirements are also set forth in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-5.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">Under this subsection, a general permit for filling or any other regulated activity on a freshwater wetland may be issued only if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>four requirements are satisfied: (1) the wetland is one acre or less; (2) the United States Environmental Protection Agency has not designated the wetland as a \u201cpriority wetland[]\u201d; (3) the wetland is not part of \u201ca surface water tributary system discharging into an inland lake or pond, or a river or stream\u201d; and (4) the wetland is not \u201cof exceptional resource value.\u201d These requirements are conjunctive; a general permit may be granted under <em>N.J.SA </em>13:9B-23(b) only if the applicant satisfies all four requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Appellant argues that he satisfied the requirement that his wetlands are not part of \u201ca surface water tributary system discharging into an inland lake or pond, or a river or stream,\u201d because the wetlands on his property do not discharge into an \u201cinland\u201d waterway. The question posed by this argument is whether the word \u201cinland\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-23(b) modifies only \u201clake or pond\u201d or also modifies \u201ca river or stream.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The starting point in statutory construction, and if the meaning is sufficiently clear, all that may be required, \u201cis to look at the plain language of the statute.\u201d <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands Prot. Act Rules, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>478, 491, 852 A.2d 1083 (2004). \u201cIf the statute is clear and unambiguous on its face and admits of only one interpretation, [courts] need delve no deeper than the act\u2019s literal terms to divine the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>State v. S.R., </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>23, 31, 811 A.2d 439 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">We conclude that it is clear on the face of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-23(b) that the word \u201cinland\u201d modifies only \u201clake or pond.\u201d If the drafters of this subsection had intended \u201cinland\u201d also to modify \u201ca river or stream,\u201d there would have been no reason to separate \u201can inland lake or pond\u201d from \u201ca river or stream\u201d by inserting a comma and the word \u201cor\u201d between them. Instead, the drafters would have used the single phrase: \u201can inland lake, pond, river or stream.\u201d Therefore, as a matter of syntactical analysis, \u201cinland\u201d does not modify \u201ca river or stream,\u201d and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-23(b) must be read to prohibit issuance of a general permit for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>regulated activity on wetlands that discharge into any river or stream, regardless of whether it is non-tidal or tidal.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Moreover, even if it were necessary to refer to legislative history to determine the intended application of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-23(b), this history confirms our interpretation of the plain language. The Legislature enacted the FWPA in 1987 \u201cto provide a comprehensive scheme for the regulation and protection of New Jersey\u2019s freshwater wetlands.\u201d <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands Prot. Act Rules, supra, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>at 482, 852 A.2d 1083. One of the FWPA\u2019s stated purposes was for the State to \u201cassume the freshwater wetlands permit jurisdiction ... exercised by the United States Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to [section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1344] and implementing regulations.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-2. \u201cThe CWA authorized states to assume the regulatory responsibilities of the federal program, ... provided the state program was \u2018as stringent as the federal program and ... complied] with all the requirements of the federal regulations^]\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands Prot. Act Rules, supra, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>at 483, 852 A.2d 1083 (quoting <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands Prot. Act Rules, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>516, 520, 570 A.2d 435 (App.Div.1989)). In enacting the FWPA, the New Jersey Legislature chose to adopt a state program that does not simply replicate the federal regulatory program but instead affords even \u201cgreater protection for wetlands\u201d than the CWA. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The CWA conferred jurisdiction upon the Army Corps of Engineers to issue permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the \u201cnavigable waters\u201d of the United States. 33 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1344(a), (e). Pursuant to this authority, the Army Corps adopted regulations that authorized issuance of nationwide general permits, commonly referred to as NWPs, for certain activities on wetlands. 33 <em>C.F.R. </em>330.5(a) (July 1, 1987).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Generally, these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>regulations only authorized nationwide permits for \u201cactivities which [had] relatively insignificant impact on wetlands and involved discharges of dredged or fill material which [would] cause minimal adverse effects on the environment when performed separately and minimal cumulative effects overall.\u201d <em>AR. Criscuolo &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>290, 296, 592 A.2d 313 (App.Div.1991); <em>see also Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Home Builders v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, </em>417 <em>F.3d </em>1272, 1276 (D.C.Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The FWPA authorizes the DEP to issue general permits under circumstances analogous to those under which the CWA authorized the Army Corps to issue nationwide permits. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-23(b),(c). When the FWPA was enacted, the applicable federal regulation, 33 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 330.5(a)(26) (sometimes referred to as NWP 26, see <em>Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Home Builders, supra, </em>417 F.3d at 1276), authorized the Army Corps to issue nationwide general permits for regulated activities on certain wetlands and other waterways that were not part of a surface tributary system, but limited this authorization to \u201cnon-tidal\u201d waterways. This regulation provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">(26) Discharges of dredged or fill material into the waters listed in paragraphs (a)(26)(i) and (ii) of this section except those which cause the loss or substantial adverse modification of 10 acres or more of such waters of the United States, including wetlands____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">(i) <em>Non-tidal rivers, streams, and their lakes and impoundments, </em>including adjacent wetlands, that are located above the headwaters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">(ii) <em>Other non-tidal waters of the United States, </em>including adjacent wetlands, that are not part of a surface tributary system to interstate waters or navigable waters of the United States (i.e., isolated waters).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">[33 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 330.5(a)(26) (emphasis added) (quoted in <em>A.R. Criscuolo &amp; Assocs., supra, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 296, 592 A.2d 313).] <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Thus, the specific Army Corps regulation upon which <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-23(b) was based did not authorize the issuance of a nationwide general permit for filling or other regulated activity in a wetland that discharged into a tidal waterway. Rather, such an activity had to be authorized by an individual permit issued pursuant to 33 <em>C.F.R. </em>323.3(a). Consequently, if the FWPA authorized the issuance of a general permit for a regulated activity on a wetland discharging into a tidal waterway, this would violate the CWA\u2019s mandate that any state program must be \u201cas stringent as the federal program and compl[y] with all the requirements of the federal regulations,\u201d <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands Prot. Act Rules, supra, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>at 483, 852 A.2d 1083 (quoting <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands Prot. Act Rules, supra, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. at 520, </em>570 A.2d 435), contrary to the expressed intent of the FWPA to assume the Army Corps\u2019 regulatory functions. Therefore, the legislative history of the FWPA reinforces our conclusion, derived from the plain language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-23(b), that the DEP does not have authority to issue a general permit for a regulated activity on a wetland that discharges into a river or stream, regardless of whether it is non-tidal or tidal.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Appellant contends that the DEP has previously construed N.J.S.A. 13:9B-23(b)\u2019s prohibition against the issuance of a general permit for a regulated activity on a wetland that discharges into a river or stream not to apply if the waterway is tidal. However, the three decisions appellant relies upon in support of this contention do not establish such a prior administrative construction. The first was made by an AL J and apparently not reviewed by the Commissioner; the second did not require the Commissioner to determine whether a general permit may be issued for a regulated activity on a wetland that discharges into a tidal waterway because the wetland was \u201cisolated\u201d; and the Commissioner declined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>address the issue in the third. Moreover, even if appellant could show that the DEP previously construed <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-23(b) to authorize issuance of a general permit for a regulated activity on a wetland that discharges into a tidal waterway, it still would be our obligation to construe the statute to effectuate the plainly expressed legislative intent to prohibit issuance of a general permit for a regulated activity on wetlands that discharge into a stream or river, regardless of whether it is non-tidal or tidal, rather than to perpetuate an administrative construction of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-23(b) that the DEP now recognizes was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-9\"> Because we do not need to reach the exceptional resource value issue to decide this appeal, there is no reason to discuss the evidence presented at the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b220-7\"> These regulations were revised in 1991 when the Army Corps issued ten new NWPs and moved the text of the NWPs into an appendix to the regulations. 59 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>Fed.
