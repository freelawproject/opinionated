He was subsequently convicted by the same jury of possession of a weapon by a convicted felon, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-7b. The conviction of possession of a weapon for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>an unlawful purpose was merged into the carjacking and robbery convictions, and defendant received concurrent sentences aggregating twenty-five years with 85% to be served before parole eligibility under the No Early Release Act (NERA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-7.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The charges stemmed from a January 6, 2001 incident, in which Tynetta Kareem was approached as she sat in the car of her friend, Vicky Leonard. A man brandished a handgun and directed Kareem to exit the vehicle. He then demanded Kareem\u2019s jewelry and ripped it off her when she failed to comply with his request quickly enough. The perpetrator then drove away in the vehicle, which also contained both the handcuffs of both Kareem and Leonard.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Three days later, police officers approached Leonard\u2019s vehicle after an unidentified individual claiming to be Leonard\u2019s brother saw it parked on a street in Newark. Alterick Hamlet was seated in the driver\u2019s seat. Defendant was in the passenger seat. Police officers arrested the two individuals, called Kareem to the police station, and showed her defendant\u2019s picture in a photographic lineup. Kareem identified him as her assailant. The trial court initially suppressed testimony regarding defendant\u2019s out-of-court identification, because the original photographic lineup was misplaced but later admitted the evidence when the lineup was located. There is no contention that the evidence, if admissible, was insufficient or that the conviction was against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">In his original brief on this appeal, defendant argued that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">POINT I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">THE ADMISSION INTO EVIDENCE OF THE TESTIMONY CONCERNING THE INHERENTLY UNRELIABLE OUT-OF-COURT AND IN-COURT IDENTIFICATIONS BY TYNETTA KAREEM DEPRIVED [HIM] OF DUE PROCESS OF LAW GUARANTEED BY THE UNITED STATES AND NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfK\">POINT II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-11\">THE SUPPRESSION OF THE TESTIMONY OF MR. KING\u2019S ALIBI WITNESS VIOLATED HIS RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS AND A FAIR TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>POINT III</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED WHEN IT PERMITTED THE SOLE DEFENSE WITNESS TO TESTIFY WHILE WEARING PRISON GARB AND SHACKLES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">POINT IV</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">THE SENTENCE MUST BE REVERSED BECAUSE THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO SUBMIT TO THE JURY FOR DETERMINATION BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THE EXISTENCE OF FACTORS WHICH THE COURT USED TO INCREASE THE SENTENCE BEYOND THAT WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSED SOLELY ON THE FACTS REFLECTED IN THE JURY VERDICT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">On August 25, 2005, we remanded for resentencing in accordance with <em>State v. Natale, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>458, 878 A.2d 724 (2005) and <em>State v. Abdullah, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>497, 878 A.2d 746 (2005). We also directed the trial court to address the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">1. Was the photographic identification unduly suggestive? When the original photo array was found, the pretrial hearing was not resumed to consider that issue before the photo identification was admitted into evidence. If the trial judge concludes the photographic identification was unduly suggestive, the judge should reconsider his initial determination that the in-court identification was reliable and admissible irrespective of the out-of-court identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">2. Would the proffered testimony of Edward Weems potentially make a difference in the outcome of the case? To that end, defense counsel may present the testimony of Mr. Weems for purposes of making a record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-11\">3. Did witness Alterick Hamlet testify while dressed in prison clothes and/or while shackled? The parties dispute that question, and the record is unclear. If the answer is \u201cyes\u201d in whole or in part, does the policy of <em>State </em>v. <em>Artwell, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>526, 832 A.2d 295 (2003), and the facts of this ease warrant a new trial even though <em>State v. Artwell </em>applies only to \"future cases,\u201d 177 <em>N.J. </em>at 539, 832 A.2d 295, as a <em>per se </em>rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">We retained jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">On the remand, the trial judge found no basis for granting a new trial. The judge also reimposed the original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-14\">Following the remand, defendant again argues that \u201c[t]he out-of-court identification procedure was unduly suggestive and created a substantial likelihood of misidentification in this case\u201d; \u201c[u]n-der the circumstances of this case, where the evidence of Mr. King\u2019s guilt consisted solely of the identification testimony of a single witness, the fact that the only defense witness testified in prison garb and handcuffs undermined Mr. King\u2019s right to due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>process of law and a fair trial\u201d; and \u201c[t]he exclusion of Edward Weems\u2019 testimony was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d We now reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Kareem testified at a pretrial hearing regarding the admissibility of the identification. At approximately 8:30 p.m. on January 6, 2001, Kareem rode as a passenger in Leonard\u2019s vehicle, as Leonard drove to another friend\u2019s apartment complex. As they arrived, Kareem noticed a person later identified as defendant standing in the street on the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle. Kareem testified that she drew attention to the person, asking Leonard, \u201c[l]ook at this guy, what is he up to?\u201d Kareem estimated that the man stood approximately seven feet away from the car. At that time, Kareem noticed the man\u2019s hat and looked at his face. Kareem believed \u201cthat [the] guy look[ed] familiar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">After arriving at the apartment complex, Leonard left the engine of the car running and went into the apartment to briefly \u201cpick something up\u201d from her friend while Kareem remained in the car. Kareem described the evening as being \u201cdark,\u201d but she further stated that the parking lot was under \u201clights.\u201d As Kareem sat in the car, she saw the man she had previously noticed walk past the driver\u2019s side and then walk to the passenger side of Leonard\u2019s vehicle. The individual said something, and Kareem gestured \u201cwhat are you talking about[,]\u201d because she did not hear or understand what he said. The individual then \u201cheld his coat back\u201d and \u201cshowed [Kareem] his gun\u201d as he stood approximately three feet away from the front passenger door. Kareem testified that she looked at the individual\u2019s face as he approached but then focused on the gun under his coat.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The individual then screamed at Kareem, \u201c[g]et the F. out of the car.\u201d The individual opened the front passenger door, stood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>\u201cright up on [Kareem],\u201d and stated \u201c[g]et the F. out of the car. I am going to [blow] you f.\u2019g brain out.\u201d The individual noticed Kareem\u2019s jewelry and demanded she \u201ctake [it] off.\u201d He then pulled off Kareem\u2019s bracelets because she was shaking so badly that she could not take them off herself. Kareem testified that the lighting conditions were sufficient for her to see his face clearly. The entire incident lasted less than five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">As Kareem exited the vehicle, the perpetrator noticed the pocketbook she was wearing around her waist. He told her to \u201cleave that, too.\u201d Again, Kareem testified that she was looking \u201cfrom him to the gun.\u201d Finally, Kareem gave up her pocketbook and ran towards the apartment while \u201cscreaming.\u201d She did not look back but \u201chear[d] him get in the car.\u201d She testified that \u201cit didn\u2019t sound like he knew how to drive a stick[,]\u201d because \u201c[h]e was making all this noise trying to get out of the parking lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">After reaching a point of safety, Kareem contacted the police and gave them a description of her assailant. Kareem described the assailant a having \u201cdark skin\u201d with a height of \u201cabout 5'7\",\u201d and a weight of \u201cabout 165, 170\u201d pounds. Kareem testified that her estimate of 5'7\" was based upon the fact \u201che was about [her] height.\u201d Kareem stated that she was 5'7\" and \u201cthat I could look that person straight in the[ ] face.\u201d She said her assailant wore a \u201cdark jacket with a dark hat, dark pants[,]\u201d and he \u201chad a sear or a birth mark ... standing out\u201d on his face.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">After the stolen vehicle was recovered, Kareem went to the police station to look at pictures of potential suspects. Kareem stated that she was presented with six color photographs of black males, \u201cthree on the top, three on the bottom.\u201d She was then asked if she recognized any of the men as the carj acker, and she said that the officer did not suggest which man to pick out. Kareem also testified that the pictures were of men \u201capproximately the same age\u201d \u201cwith the exception of maybe two of them.\u201d Finally, Kareem testified that she was \u201c[o]ne hundred percent\u201d certain that she correctly identified the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>On cross-examination, Kareem described the gun as \u201cblack ... with a long barrel\u201d and admitted that she focused her attention on it \u201c[m]ost of the time when [her assailant] wasn\u2019t talking ... because [she] was trying to distinguish whether it was a real gun or not.\u201d She further testified that she was \u201cvery nervous\u201d and \u201cvery afraid[.]\u201d Kareem was also questioned about her statement to the police in which she described the assailant as having \u201ca scar on the left cheek.\u201d Kareem denied making the statement and instead asserted that the mark was \u201con the left side from the eyes to the cheek, probably somewhere in that area.\u201d Kareem claimed, however, that she \u201cwasn\u2019t looking for a scar\u201d as she reviewed the photos and thus could not recall how many of the photos were of men with scars on their faces. When asked if there was \u201c[a]ny possibility that the person could have been 6'3\",\u201d she testified there was no possibility at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">On redirect, Kareem was asked \u201c[i]f you leam[ed] that [the defendant was] 6'3\", would that change your mind that he was the one that did it,\u201d and she responded, \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Detective Murad Muhammed testified that, based on the description given, defendant\u2019s photograph was placed into an array along with five other pictures. Detective Muhammed testified that the color photos were of six black men who had \u201csimilar features\u201d and were approximately the same age.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">According to Detective Muhammed, on January 10, 2001, Kareem was brought in to look at the photo array and made a \u201cpositive identification\u201d of the defendant\u2019s photo. Muhammed testified that he did not gesture or in any way suggest who to pick. The detective further described Kareem\u2019s resolve as \u201cabsolutely certain.\u201d After Kareem picked defendant\u2019s photo, \u201cshe signed the back with her name and the date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">However, while Muhammed retained a photocopy of the array, the police were unable to locate the original photo array that was shown to the victim. Muhammed also stated that he neither knew the defendant\u2019s actual height or considered that factor in placing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>defendant in the photo lineup, and he never compiled a photo array with Hamlet, the driver of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The trial court initially determined that no evidence concerning the out-of-court identification would be admitted unless defense counsel opened the door by questioning why the original photo array was missing. The trial judge also ruled that defense counsel could not suggest that the out-of-court identification had tainted the in-court identification without \u201copening the door\u201d to the events relating to the original identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">At the trial, Leonard testified that while in her friend\u2019s apartment, she heard Kareem \u201cscreaming\u201d and \u201ccalling [her] name.\u201d Leonard and her friend proceeded to the hallway, where Kareem was \u201cvery hysterical.\u201d Kareem screamed, \u201c[s]omebody put a gun to me, stol[e] your car and robbed me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Kareem testified before the jury substantially as she did in the pretrial hearing, but she added some additional details. Kareem noted that she initially focused on the defendant\u2019s face because he was talking to her, and she thought \u201che was somebody trying to just approach me or talk to me.\u201d Kareem also stated that defendant did not take the gun out of his pants until he opened the car door, demanded that she take off her bracelets, and started \u201cpulling [her] jewelry off.\u201d Kareem again described the gun as being black \u201cwith a long black barrel[,]\u201d but also specified that it was metal.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Kareem also testified at trial that after the defendant drove away, she gave the police a description of her assailant. She stated that he was a \u201c[b]lack male, he had dark clothing ... a scar on his face from his eye to his cheek, somewhere in that area.\u201d She later clarified that by reporting that the assailant had either a \u201c[s]car or birthmark, something like that.\u201d She further recalled that he was \u201cdark skin[ned],\u201d approximately 165 pounds, and \u201cmaybe ... 5'7\" or taller than me.\u201d Kareem stated \u201c[h]e was like small frame but he had on a coat, a big coat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Kareem further testified that as she exited the vehicle, defendant was \u201cstanding in front of [her]\u201d with his face approximately \u201ctwo inches\u201d from hers, and the hat he was wearing did not prevent her from seeing his face. She also gave an in-court identification of defendant of which she was \u201cone hundred percent\u201d \u201cpositive[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Finally, Kareem described the photographic lineup consisting of six photos of black men, \u201cthree on the top, three on the bottom.\u201d Kareem reaffirmed that no one coerced her or told her what to say, and she was \u201cone hundred percent sure[ ]\u201d that the defendant was the one who carjacked her. Kareem was then presented with the original photographic lineup, which was recovered between the pretrial hearing and the second day of testimony. Kareem acknowledged that she identified and signed picture number five and that picture is of the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">On the remand, the parties stipulated that the photo array introduced at trial was the photo array that was missing during the pretrial hearing but later discovered. No additional testimony was given on that issue, but defendant highlighted the inconsistencies between the defendant\u2019s appearance and the description that Kareem gave the police at the scene and prior to viewing the photo array. As noted, Kareem described the assailant as being about five feet, seven inches tall and having a scar on his face from his eye to his cheek; whereas, according to the police report, defendant is six feet, three inches tall and has no scar. The trial judge nevertheless found that the photographic array was \u201cnot unduly suggestive,\u201d and sustained its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Weems and Linda King, defendant\u2019s mother, testified at the remand hearing. King was permitted to \u201cclarify\u201d Weems\u2019 testimony. Defendant also attempted to call Brian Combs to testify as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>an alibi witness to corroborate Weems\u2019 testimony that he and defendant spent about an hour at the home of Combs\u2019 girlfriend on the evening in question. However, the State objected, because defendant gave no notice of his intent to present Combs as an alibi witness until the day of the remand hearing. Defendant then withdrew Combs as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">At the conclusion of the remand hearing, the judge found that Weems failed to present \u201ca coherent statement of the relevant time, [ ] date, and place [which] would have been necessary ... to affect the verdict in this ease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">On the issue of witness Hamlet\u2019s attire while testifying, the trial judge had \u201cno independent recollection as to whether or not [Hamlet] was dressed in prison garb and/or shackled.\u201d The Assistant Prosecutor who tried the case also stated that she lacked a recollection but emphasized there was no objection to his appearance. However, defendant\u2019s trial attorney, Louis Al-Misri,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> testified that Hamlet testified wearing \u201cEssex County Jail prison garb, two piece prison garb outfit.\u201d Counsel also asserted that Hamlet was shackled and wore handcuffs while testifying. Defense counsel testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">Q And where was Mr. Altaric Hamlet residing at the time that you presented him as a witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">A Essex County Jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">Q Do you, how was he dressed when he testified for Mr. King?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">A In Essex County Jail prison garb, two piece prison garb outfit. I believe it was at the time orange if I\u2019m not mistaken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">Q And do you recall whether or not he was shackled?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-12\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-13\">Q And was he, did he have handcuffs on when he testified?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-14\">AI believe so, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-15\">Q And do you recall where the jury was when, well, Mr. Hamlet was that the first time that he was in court when he testified?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-16\">A My recollection is that he was brought in on two discre[te] occasions. The first time he was brought in was because there was an issue as to the voluntariness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>his testimony. He was represented by the Public Defender\u2019s Office, Essex County Public Defender\u2019s Office and an issue arose concerning my having spoken to him. Two different Public Defenders] came to raise that issue with the Court and as a result [the trial judge] wanted to have a, have testimony from Mr. Hamlet concerning whether or not his testifying was voluntary. So he was brought in. At that time that was outside of the presence of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">Q And what happened when those proceedings were over?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">A We, he was removed. We went onto other business. I think Mr. Mercurio was raising some other issues and then when it became time for Mr. Hamlet to testify again he was led back in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">Q Do you remember where he came from or how he was led in? Do you have any recollection of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">A My recollection is that he was being held in the adjourning court or the court across the hall[,] and he was just led straight in through the doors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">Q And, and who was with him when he was, who led him in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">A Sheriff\u2019s Officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-12\">Q One or more than one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-13\">AI believe there were two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-14\">Q At the, at the conclusion of his testimony do you recall what happened at the end of his testimony when he was, when he was done? Where did he go?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcR\">AI assume he went back to where he came from. The Judge told him he could go back to where he came from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-15\">Q Was the jury still here at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-16\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-17\">Q And did the Sheriff\u2019s officers then escort him out of the courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-18\">A They did.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-19\">In making Ms findings on the issue, the trial judge candidly concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-20\">The answer to that is while there is nothing definitive in the record I have no reason to dispute Mr. Al-Misri\u2019s recollection of the events and find as a matter of fact that Mr. Hamlet was dressed in prison garb and at the very least cuffed when brought in the presence of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>I can certainly relate my ordinary and customary practice with regard to dealing with defense witnesses who were incarcerated at the time of their testimony, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I have a specific recollection as to what happened in this case[.] I don\u2019t. But Mr. Al-Misri\u2019s testimony has the ring of truth because of the fact that, that would have ordinarily been my, my course of action, that is, to allow the witnesses to testify in their prison garb and cuffed, the cuffing for security purposes and prison garb because that\u2019s the clothes that they wore, would not, I would not have without, without objection have considered the arguments raised in <em>Artwell </em>which are the arguments that the defense makes here, and they are all very good arguments and, and it causes one pause with regard to the fact that-trial court judges [ ] like [me] may not have considered such weighty issues certainly without the participation of the defense counsel with regard to raising those issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The judge concluded, however, that because <em>Artwell </em>was not to be given \u201cretroactive application,\u201d he would not order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">We are convinced that a new trial is required under the totality of circumstances. Although not retroactive regarding the appearance of a defense witness in prison garb, <em>State v. Artwell </em>requires a reversal in this matter because there was no finding, or basis in the record for a finding, of a necessity that Hamlet testify while in restraints. <em>See State v. Artwell, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>526, 530, 537-38, 832 A.2d 295 (2003); <em>see also State v. Russell, </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>586, 592-99, 895 A.2d 1163 (App.Div.2006). Moreover, the error cannot be disregarded as \u201charmless.\u201d In so concluding, we do not preclude introduction of the identification testimony at the retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">We cannot disagree with the trial judge\u2019s assessment that both the out-of-court and in-court identifications were admissible. In order to be admitted into evidence, eyewitness identifications must undergo a two-step analysis established by the United States Supreme Court. <em>State v. Herrera, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>493, 503-04, 902 A.2d 177 (2006); <em>State v. Madison, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>223, 232, 536 A.2d 254 (1988) (citations omitted). First, a court must \u201cascertain whether the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive[.]\u201d <em>Herrera, supra, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>at 503, 902 A.2d 177. If it is, the court must \u201cdecide whether the objectionable procedure resulted in a Very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v.

Farrow, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>434, 451, 294 A.2d 873 (1972)). The court\u2019s analysis must look at the facts surrounding the identification procedure to determine the existence of undue suggestibility. <em>See id. </em>at 234-37, 536 A.2d 254. Types of factors to be considered include whether the police told the eyewitness that the photo array contains a picture of a suspect, although that alone is not determinative, and if a defendant\u2019s photograph is repeatedly shown in a photo array, though the circumstances of the repetition are determinative of suggestibility. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The second step of the analysis asks whether the identification itself was reliable based on the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233, 536 A.2d 254. \u201cIf the court finds that the identification is reliable despite the impermissibly suggestive nature of the procedure, the identification may be admitted into evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Madison, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 232, 536 A.2d 254. In essence, \u201c[reliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 <em>U.S. </em>98, 114, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2243, 2253, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>140, 154 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">In assessing the totality of the circumstances, factors enumerated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Manson, </em>and reiterated by the New Jersey Supreme Court in Madison, \u201cmust be weighed against the corrupting effect of the suggestive proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>dure.\u201d <em>Madison, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 240, 536 A.2d 254 (citations omitted). The factors are \u201cthe \u2018opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019s degree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated at the time of the confrontation and the time between the crime and the confrontation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id </em>at 239-40, 536 A.2d 254 (quoting <em>Manson, supra, </em>432 <em>U.S. </em>at 114, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2253, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 154). <em>See also State v. Herrera, supra, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>at 501-09, 902 A.2d 177 (finding impermissible suggestivity but sufficient reliability to sustain the admission).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The burden of proof for the admissibility of eyewitness identifications depends on the circumstances under which the identification is being offered. Ordinarily, the burden of \u201cdemonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that the pretrial identification was so suggestive as to result in a substantial likelihood of misidentification\u201d lies with the defendant. <em>State v. Hurd </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>525, 548, 432 A.2d 86 (1981), <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Moore, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>182, 902 A.2d 1212 (2006).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c[C]onvietions based on eyewitness identification at trial following a pretrial identification by photograph will be set aside on that ground only if the photographic identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>Simmons, supra, </em>390 <em>U.S. </em>at 384, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 971, 19 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Recognizing that the out-of-court array was ultimately observed by the judge who had the opportunity to review it and found it to be admissible, we are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s claims for its exclusion or for concluding the in-court identification was tainted.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>However, proper instructions had to be given to the jury. The police may have suggested to Kareem that they had a suspect when they asked her to review the photo array. There is also no indication she was told the array might not include a photo of the perpetrator. Moreover, she believed that persons in two of the pictures in the array appeared older than the others, and, based on police and eyewitness recollection, only defendant\u2019s photo had a facial marking, even though she had described a scar to the police. Furthermore, defendant was eight inches taller than Kareem\u2019s initial description, and all of the men in the photo array had facial hair despite the fact Kareem did not describe facial hair in her description of the carj acker. Therefore, while we do not disturb the trial judge\u2019s conclusion as to admissibility of the identification based on its \u201creliability,\u201d we also conclude that a more detailed charge directed to the contested facts relevant to the claim of suggestiveness was warranted. <em>See State v. Herrera, supra, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>at 509-10, 902 A.2d 177.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For example, in <em>State v. Ledbetter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the Connecticut Supreme Court required a detailed instruction on suggestivity where victim was not told \u201cthat the perpetrator <em>may or may not </em>be present\u201d in the procedure. <em>State v. Ledbetter, </em>275 <em>Conn. </em>534, 579, 881 A.2d 290 (2005) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <em>Ledbetter </em>Court concluded that in circumstances like those before us, the instruction should include a charge to the effect that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">In this ease, the state has presented evidence that an eyewitness identified the defendant in connection with the crime charged. That identification was the result of an identification procedure in which the individual conducting the procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>either indicated to the witness that a suspect was present in the procedure or failed to warn the witness that the perpetrator may or may not be in the procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">Indicating to a witness that a suspect is present in an identification procedure or failing to warn the witness that the perpetrator may or may not be in the procedure may increase the likelihood that the witness will select one of the individuals in the procedure even when the perpetrator is not present. Thus, such action on the part of the procedure administrator may increase the probability of a misidentification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">This information is not intended to direct you to give more or less weight to the eyewitness identification evidence offered by the state. It is your duty to determine what weight to give to that evidence. You may, however, take into account this information, as just explained to you, in making that determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 579-80, 881 A.2d 290.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">We believe that, under <em>Herrera, </em>a similar charge was warranted in this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">In any event, while admissible, the identification testimony was not overwhelming or strong. Based on our careful review of the record, the weakness of the identification testimony adds to our conclusion that defendant was prejudiced by the fact that Alteriq Hamlet, the critical defense witness, testified while in prison garb and handcuffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">In <em>State v. Artwell, </em>the Supreme Court held that defense witnesses may not appear in physical restraints unless the trial court determines in a hearing, out of the jury\u2019s presence and for specific reasons, that the restraints are \u201cnecessary to maintain the security of the courtroom.\u201d <em>State v. Artwell, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 537-38, 832 A.2d 295 (2003) (citation omitted). The Court also held that a defense witness is prohibited from testifying in \u201cprison garb.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539, 832 A.2d 295. The latter holding was expressly made prospective, <em>ibid,.; </em>the former was not. <em>Artwell </em>did not apply its ban on defense witnesses testifying in \u201cprison garb\u201d to the witness in that case, and used the term \u201cgoing forward\u201d to specify that the change in policy was prospective only. <em>Id. </em>at 530, 539, 832 A.2d 295. However, regarding a defense witness testify<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>ing while handcuffed, the Court found that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s failure to state on the record its reasons for requiring defendant\u2019s witness to appear in restraints was reversible error.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 530, 538, 832 A.2d 295. As a result, the <em>Artwell </em>Court \u201cvacate[d] defendant\u2019s conviction and remand[ed] for a new trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539, 832 A.2d 295. <em>See also State v. Russell, supra, </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 592-99, 895 A.2d 1163 (retroactively applying <em>Artwell </em>to vacate a conviction where a co-defendant testified for the prosecution while shackled and the court failed to hold a hearing to determine the necessity of the shackles).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Here, the trial record reflects no reasons expressed for the restraints. To the contrary, no mention of restraints is made in the original record, thereby necessitating the remand proceedings. Nor was there a charge to the jury relating to Hamlet\u2019s appearance. Id. at 538, 832 A.2d 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Hamlet\u2019s being observed by the jury in prison garb and handcuffs, despite his acknowledged criminal record, may well have had an impact on his credibility. The defendant was found in the passenger seat of the stolen vehicle three days after the carjacking in the presence of Hamlet, and Hamlet was called by defendant to exculpate him. Hamlet testified that he \u201cgot the car from Fu\u201d and was arrested for receiving the stolen car, but to his knowledge, defendant had never seen the car before Hamlet gave him a ride that day.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial judge\u2019s factual determination that Hamlet testified while \u201cdressed in prison garb and at the very least cuffed when brought in the presence of the jury[]\u201d is supported by the uncontroverted testimony of defendant\u2019s trial counsel<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and not disputed by any testimony by the trial prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>The State now contends that \u201cthere was simply no support for the proposition that the jury observed the witness in handcuffs or shackles.\u201d The State offers nothing to rebut the defense counsel\u2019s testimony as to Hamlet\u2019s appearance. Further, the record supports defense counsel\u2019s testimony and the judge\u2019s finding that Hamlet testified in prison garb and handcuffs. The trial transcript reveals that when Hamlet was called as a witness, he was \u201cled in\u201d and the judge introduced him to the jury by stating \u201c[ljadies and gentlemen, this is Mr. Hamlet. I am going to ask that he be put on the witness stand.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, at the end of Hamlet\u2019s testimony before the jury, the trial judge stated in the presence of the jury, \u201cMr. Hamlet, please accompany the police officer to your place of accommodation.\u201d Read in context, the use of the word \u201caccommodation\u201d must be understood to signify a jail or prison. Under the facts, we cannot find the error was harmless even if, for the sake of argument, the \u201charmless error\u201d doctrine can apply in a case in which a defense witness testified in handcuffs before <em>Artwell </em>was decided.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Our reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction permits a new trial at which the alibi witnesses can testify in light of the notice now given.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>The convictions are reversed, and the matter is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-9\"> Defendant no longer challenges the sentence.
