Appellants, in a single point of argument with several facets, contend that the approval granted was invalid because the Commissioner, without sound basis, failed to comply with regulatory requirements governing CN calls, particularly <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:33-4.1(a), and thus erred in applying the CN process in this matter. We granted Virtua\u2019s motion for leave to intervene in the appeal; and we denied, as had the Commissioner, appellants\u2019 motion for a stay of the decision pending appeal. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">On March 3, 2003, the Department issued a \u201cNotice of Rescheduling of Certificate of Need Call for Applications for Maternal and Child Health Consortia Change in Membership and Intermediate and Intensive Bassinets in Certain Maternal and Child Health Consortia Regions.\u201d 35 <em>N.J.R. </em>1311(b). The notice invited</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">certificate of need applications on a full review basis for Maternal and Child Health Consortia change in membership, and for intermediate and intensive bassinets in licensed general hospitals in those Maternal and Child Health Consortia (MCHC) regions in which a need has been identified based on the most recent utilization projections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">This CN call specified the needs for both intermediate and intensive care bassinets in the Southern NJ Perinatal Cooperative, Inc., as well as in other areas of the State. <em>See ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">In response, Virtua submitted a timely application dated May 1, 2003. It sought approval \u201cto change its designation from a Community Perinatal Center-Intensive to a Regional Perinatal Center and to add four intensive care bassinets and eight intermediate care bassinets[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">Following Virtua\u2019s submission of additional information as requested, the Department, on April 12, 2004, announced that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>application was complete. Pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:33, the Department referred Virtua\u2019s application to the State Health Planning Board (SHPB) for \u201cthe full review process\u201d and, on July 8, 2004, \u201cto consider applications, receive public comment and make recommendations to the Commissioner.\u201d On June 30, 2004, appellants objected to the Department\u2019s decision to accept the designation-changing aspect of Virtua\u2019s application and requested that Virtua\u2019s \u201crequest for a change in designation level not be permitted to move forward at this time to the [SHPB].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">On July 8, 2004, the SHPB held a meeting, at which the Department staff submitted a report recommending that the SHPB approve Virtua\u2019s application in its entirety, including, for reasons stated, its redesignation as an RPC. The SHPB also entertained public comment on the application. Appellants\u2019 representatives were heard, among others, and their written presentations were received. Cooper Health System\u2019s representative stated: \u201cIf Virtua is approved, there will be a serious and damaging impact on the existing Regional Perinatal Center in Camden.\u201d Further, he said: \u201cno study has been conducted that has identified the need for [an] additional Regional Perinatal Center in South Jersey.\u201d He opined that \u201cchanges in designation level specifically require ... the full review in [the] CN process and [a] separate CN call which was not accomplished here.\u201d He questioned, \u201c[H]ow did the Department allow Virtua to request a change in designation ... when the Department itself never issued the CN call for a change in designation ... ?\u201d He concluded by stressing that, if Virtua were designated as an RPC, then appellants \u201cwill have to cut off services to the indigent in Camden____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The SHPB considered all the data it had received and views it had heard. Following discussion among its members that reflected a weighing of pertinent considerations, the SHPB voted to approve Virtua\u2019s CN application in its entirety. The approval on the redesignation issue was by a vote of five votes in the affirmative and one vote in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>On October 4, 2004, appellants wrote the Commissioner with a \u201crequest that [he] invalidate that part of the Virtua application pertaining to a change in perinatal designation level____\u201d Nevertheless, on October 5, 2004, the final decision issued, approving Virtua\u2019s CN application in its entirety. The decision stated that the Commissioner was \u201csatisfied that Virtua\u2019s RPC designation would not impact current referral patterns of the other two RPCs in the consortium region (Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center and Cooper Hospital), since the majority of Virtua\u2019s projected additional patients would originate from within the Virtua Health System.\u201d Furthermore, according to the decision, \u201cthe balance of Virtua\u2019s additional patients [is] anticipated to be from Virtua\u2019s service area who currently outmigrate to Philadelphia hospitals.\u201d Hence, \u201cVirtua has sufficiently documented that its RPC designation would primarily reduce current transfers out of Virtua\u2019s system and recapture patients going out of state, rather than compete with the existing Camden City RPCs for their patients.\u201d Ultimately, \u2018Virtua\u2019s project will provide families who choose Virtua the opportunity to receive Regional Perinatal Center level services at the same location, will improve their access to care and reduce incentives for these families to leave New Jersey to get more complex services out of state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Specifically with respect to the redesignation application, the Commissioner found that Virtua met the requirements of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:33C-3.4(a) by establishing the required number of very low birth weight infants annually. Furthermore, the decision stated: \u2018Vir-tua has also documented that all professional staff necessary for RPC designation are currently in place.\u201d Therefore, \u201cbeing satisfied that [Virtua] has documented compliance with the applicable statutory and regulatory criteria,\u201d the Commissioner approved Virtua\u2019s application in full, as recommended by the SHPB.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">We reject appellant\u2019s argument that we should reverse the Commissioner\u2019s decision on the redesignation question because it constituted an ultra vires act. Out of respect for the Legislature\u2019s commitment of regulatory control to an agency\u2019s expertise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>and well-considered discretion, we will not upset the ultimate determination of the agency unless it is established that the challenged action was outside the scope of its authority; or that it was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable; or that it violated legislative policies expressed or fairly implied in the act governing the agency; or that the findings on which the decision was based were unsupported by the evidence. <em>See Campbell v. Dep\u2019t of Civil Serv., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>556, 562, 189 A.2d 712 (1963). An appellate court \u201cis, however, in no way bound by the agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute or its determination of a strictly legal issue.\u201d <em>Mayflower Sec. Co. v. Bureau of Sec. in Div. of Consumer Affairs of Dep\u2019t of Law &amp; Pub. Safety, </em>64 <em>N.J. 85, </em>93, 312 A.2d 497 (1973). We are, nevertheless, obliged to accord \u201csubstantial deference to the interpretation an agency gives to a statute that the agency is charged with enforcing.\u201d <em>Saint Peter\u2019s Univ. Hosp. v. Lacy, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>1, 15, 878 A.2d 829 (2005)(quoting <em>Smith v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>19, 25-26, 527 A.2d 843 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">It is axiomatic that the scope of appellate review is limited with respect to an agency\u2019s factfinding. The court will decide only whether the findings made could reasonably have been reached on \u201csufficient\u201d or \u201csubstantial\u201d credible evidence present in the record, considering the proofs as a whole. The scope of appellate review is likewise limited where an agency\u2019s expertise is a factor in the decision. <em>See In re Taylor, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>644, 656-57, 731 A.2d 35 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In 1971, the Legislature adopted the Health Care Facilities Planning Act (the Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-1 to -26, \u201cdeclar[ing it] to be the public policy of the State that hospital and related health care services of the highest quality, of demonstrated need, efficiently provided and properly utilized at a reasonable cost are of vital concern to the public health.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-1. The Act confers upon the Department \u201cthe central responsibility for the development and administration of the State\u2019s policy with respect to health planning, hospital and related health care services and health care facility cost containment programs[.]\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>establishes the CN process as the primary method for approving construction or expansion of health care facilities and the institution of health care services. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-7. Certain services are exempt from the CN process, see, <em>e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-6.1; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-7a; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-7c; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:33-6.1, but the subject matter of the instant application is not among the exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">An application for a CN must meet certain requirements, among which are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">No certificate of need shall be issued unless the action proposed in the application for such certificate is necessary to provide required health care in the area to be served, can be economically accomplished and maintained, will not have an adverse economic or financial impact on the delivery of health care services in the region or Statewide, and will contribute to the orderly development of adequate and effective health care services. In making such determinations there shall be taken into consideration (a) the availability of facilities or services which may serve as alternatives or substitutes, (b) the need for special equipment and services in the area, (c) the possible economies and improvement in services to be anticipated from the operation of joint central services, (d) the adequacy of financial resources and sources of present and future revenues, (e) the availability of sufficient manpower in the several professional disciplines, and (f) such other factors as may be established by regulation. The State Health Plan may also be considered in determining whether to approve a certificate of need application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-8; <em>see also N.J.A.C. </em>8:33-4.9.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The Legislature, in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-5b, mandated the adoption of \u201crules and regulations ... to effectuate the provisions and purposes of this act.\u201d Accordingly, the Commissioner has promulgated general regulations pertaining to the CN application and review process, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:33-1.1 to -6.2, and specific regulations pertaining to the CN application and review process for MCHCs, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:33C-1.1 to -7.3. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:33-4.1 provides for review cycles and submission dates premised on the concept that the Commissioner is empowered to call for the submission of CN applications on an established and announced schedule. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-7c.c. Ultimately, the Department has control over whether to review an application. \u201cAn application which is unresponsive to the notice issued by the Commissioner ... may be declared not acceptable for processing by the Department.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:33-4.5(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>The precise question posed in this case is whether the CN application process requires the Commissioner to call for an application of a certain type before he may review a proposal. Prior to the Legislature\u2019s modifications of the CN application process in 1998, we stated in respect of CN calls, that \u201cthe administrative process is triggered by a \u2018call\u2019 from the Department of Health and Senior Services inviting the submission of [CN] applications based upon a preliminary finding of need or patient access problems[,]\u201d <em>In re Certificate of Need of the Visiting Nurse Ass\u2019n, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>85, 89, 694 A.2d 1038 (App.Div.1997); and that \u201can application to provide a particular health care service cannot be submitted until the Department issues a \u2018call,\u2019 ... inviting the submission of [CN] applications for that specific service[,]\u201d <em>In re Certificate of Need Granted to The Harborage, </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363, 368, 693 A.2d 133 (App.Div.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">In these passages, we were describing the customary course of the CN process. We did not intend to suggest that the Commissioner, under current standards governing the CN process, acts in an ultra vires manner in choosing to pass upon a feature of a CN application not within the expressed scope of a call, but germane to it. It is essential, however, that those affected by the proposal have actual notice of it and an adequate opportunity to submit their views and objections for consideration at all significant stages of the process. The Commissioner\u2019s discretionary action in approving Virtua\u2019s application for a change in MCHC designation from CPC to RPC was not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable; it did not violate express or implied legislative policies; and there was sufficient credible evidence in the record developed to support the Commissioner\u2019s findings that all pertinent criteria had been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Both the Department and Virtua concede that the CN call in question did not solicit the application Virtua made regarding a change in its MCHC designation. But, no provision of statute or regulation requires a specific call before the Department can consider a particular aspect of a CN application. We are unaware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>of any expressed limitation on the Commissioner\u2019s discretion to review and approve a contextually related application for a change of designation in the absence of a specific call for such a change; and appellants\u2019 arguments have provided no basis from which such a limitation may be construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The statutory focus in such matters is upon \u201cthe action proposed in the application!,]\u201d <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-8, <em>i.e., </em>the decision whether to grant a CN is based upon the contents of the application, not the need identified in the call. Although <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:33-4.5(b) establishes the Department\u2019s discretion not to review applications that are unresponsive to the notices sent out by the Commissioner, that regulation does not require the Department to reject aspects of CN applications that go beyond the specific needs identified in the call but relate to it. We must defer to the Commissioner\u2019s determination that he has the authority under the current statutory and regulatory scheme to employ his discretion in deciding whether to review or reject the portion of an application that goes beyond the precise scope of the call. <em>See Saint Peter\u2019s, supra, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>at 15-17, 878 A.2d 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The call system provides a structure for the Department to evaluate the needs within an area of service and to invite the submission of applications for certificates to fill those needs. The March 2000 report of the Certificate of Need Study Commission noted that the call system in place at that time resulted \u201cin irregular calls for applications\u201d and a lack of ability to \u201cpredict!] when such calls will occur.\u201d Procedures adopted in response to those identified defects now provide for the regularly-scheduled submission of batched applications. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>8:33-4.1(a)(2). A regulation emphasizes that acceptance of batched applications does not connote that needs identified by applicants represent the needs the Department may actually find to exist. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:33-4.1(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">The scheduled-call mechanism requires the Department to analyze needs on a regular and timely basis, <em>see N.J.A.C. </em>8:33-4.1(c), and it allows the Department to manage its workload, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Department must review those applications that conform to the requirements of the call notice. There is no concomitant restriction in statute or regulation, however, that limits the Department from recognizing a germane need identified by an application that was not expressly within the four comers of the call. In requiring the Commissioner to issue calls on a regular basis, the Legislature did not mandate that the Department issue a call regarding a specific need before it could review an application for a CN. Ultimately, the need identified in the call, without more, is not outcome determinative. Therefore, it is within the discretionary authority of the agency to recognize a need not previously identified and to approve or disapprove a proposal as the public interest may require, as long as appropriate procedural protections are provided for those affected by the proposal to make a case for and against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">We hold, therefore, that the Commissioner\u2019s decision to review and approve Virtua\u2019s application for a change of designation in the absence of a specific call in that regard did not violate legislative polices as expressed or implied in the Act. The Department\u2019s review of Virtua\u2019s application met all of the statutory and regulatory requirements associated with a CN application. The Commissioner recognized that the issuance of a CN must be based upon the applicant\u2019s fulfillment of statutory and regulatory criteria, specifically <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-8, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:33 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:33C. The Commissioner applied the standards elaborated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:2H-8 to Virtua\u2019s application and, in granting the redesignation request, found \u201cdocumented compliance with the applicable statutory and regulatory criteria,\u201d including satisfaction of all four of the specified tests. Appellants and others affected had notice and the opportunity to be heard. Thus, the Commissioner\u2019s decision was consistent with both the express and implied policies of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Our independent review of the record discloses that the findings upon which the Commissioner\u2019s decision was based were supported by sufficient credible evidence. According to the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>ment staff, Virtua complied with the statutory criteria elaborated in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:33 and 8:33C. The staffs recommendation bespoke a painstaking review of Virtua\u2019s application and a detailed analysis of Virtua\u2019s compliance with statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">We conclude that the Commissioner\u2019s approval of the re-designation application did not amount to an ultra vires act because of the absence of a specific call in that regard. Once the Department issues a call, it is required to consider all applications answering that call; however, the absence from the call of a specific end does not require the Department to reject an application for the non-specified result. As long as essential procedural safeguards are in place, it is within the Commissioner\u2019s discretion whether or not to consider that aspect of the application. The review and approval of Virtua\u2019s application complied with all statutory and regulatory mandates, as well as with essential procedural requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">In reaching our conclusion, we take as a guide the Supreme Court\u2019s approach in <em>Saint Peter\u2019s, </em>according substantial deference to departmental choices in administering a subject matter area affected by statutory CN requirements. Here, the Commissioner\u2019s exercise of discretion in considering the proposal for redesig-nation in the absence of a call in that regard must also be respected. Appellants have not demonstrated any prejudice they suffered in the procedures employed that would not have been experienced if Virtua\u2019s proposal for redesignation had been preceded by a call.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
