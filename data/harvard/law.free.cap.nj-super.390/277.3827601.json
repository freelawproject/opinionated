Defendant, Chrissy La-Croix (Chrissy), sustained serious personal injuries in a July 10, 2003 automobile accident. She was driving a vehicle owned by her father, Robert LaCroix (Robert), and insured by plaintiff, Rutgers Casualty Insurance Company (Rutgers). She had her father\u2019s permission to drive the car. Chrissy appeals from the Law Division\u2019s March 1, 2006 order, entered after a bench trial, denying her the right to receive Personal'Injury Protection (PIP) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>benefits under the personal automobile policy issued by Rutgers to Robert. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The facts, which were established in the bench trial, are not in dispute. On August 8, 2002, Robert completed and signed a Rutgers personal automobile insurance application for liability, PIP, medical payments, and uninsured motorist insurance coverage. Robert listed himself as the applicant and 15 B Pacific Drive, Winfield, as his residence. Page one of the application contained a block for the applicant to list <em>\u201cALL LICENSED </em>and <em>UNLICENSED </em>individuals permanently and/or temporarily residing with applicant.\u201d Robert listed two of his daughters, Glenda and Maria. However, Robert failed to list Chrissy as a licensed driver permanently residing with him. Chrissy, who was age eighteen and Robert\u2019s youngest daughter, was living with him at the time of the application. The insurance application also contained a section highlighted in red, titled \u201cApplicant\u2019s Statement,\u201d which in applicable part confirmed that Robert had listed all permanent residents of his household and acknowledged Robert\u2019s understanding that this information was a material representation relied upon by Rutgers in determining whether to insure him. On the same date, Robert signed and furnished to Rutgers a document entitled \u201cConfirmation,\u201d in which he acknowledged his understanding that the insurance application required him to list all permanent residents of his household. Relying on Robert\u2019s representations in the application and confirmation, Rutgers issued a personal automobile policy for one year, effective August 16, 2002 to August 16,2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In 2003, Chrissy drove Robert\u2019s car two to three times a week. It is undisputed that Chrissy had no part in or knowledge of her father\u2019s failure to name her in the application as a licensed driver permanently residing in his household.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">After Chrissy\u2019s July 10, 2003 accident, a claim for PIP benefits was filed on her behalf with Rutgers. During Rutgers\u2019 investigation of Chrissy\u2019s claim, Robert admitted in a statement he gave to an insurance company investigator that he did not list Chrissy on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>the policy application \u201cto keep the cost down.\u201d According to the testimony of a Rutgers\u2019 senior underwriter, the policy premium would have increased by approximately $500 if Chrissy\u2019s name had been disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">As a result of Robert\u2019s misrepresentation, Rutgers filed a complaint seeking that the policy be declared void ab initio, thereby negating any liability of Rutgers to pay PIP benefits on behalf of Chrissy. Chrissy, contending that she was an innocent third party entitled to benefits under Robert\u2019s policy, counterclaimed for payment of her medical bills pursuant to the PIP coverage contained in her father\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 mandates that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">Every standard automobile liability insurance policy ... shall contain personal injury protection benefits for the payment of benefits without regard to ... fault of any kind, to the named insured and members of his family residing in his household who sustain bodily injury as a result of an accident while occupying ... or using an automobile ... and to other persons sustaining bodily injury while occupying ... or using the automobile of the named insured, with permission of the named insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">In <em>Palisades Safety &amp; Insurance Association v. Bastien, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>144, 147-48, 814 A.2d 619 (2003), the Supreme Court stated the legislative underpinnings of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">The Legislature provided for PIP benefits as part of New Jersey\u2019s no-fault compulsory automobile-insurance system in the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1 to -35 (the Act). Since their enactment in 1972, PIP statutory benefits are a required component of every standard automobile insurance policy, and provide an efficient system of \u201crecovery for losses sustained in automobile accidents.\u201d Stated generally, the benefits include payment of medical expenses, without regard to fault, for the named insured and resident members of his or her family, others occupying a vehicle of the named insured, or pedestrians injured in an automobile accident. N.J.S.A. 39:6A-4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-10\">As remedial legislation that is protective of automobile accident victims, the PIP statute is given liberal construction to provide such victims with the \u201cbroadest possible coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-11\">[ (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">Nevertheless, the Court pointed out that \u201csuch coverage is unavailable when it is sought as part of an insured\u2019s first-party claim for benefits under his or her own policy of insurance declared void because of material misrepresentations made to the insurer.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>at 148, 814 A.2d 619. Chrissy concedes that Robert\u2019s intentional omission of her name from the insurance application constituted a material misrepresentation. <em>See Longobardi v. Chubb Ins. Co. of N.J., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>530, 542, 582 A.2d 1257 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">In a series of eases, we have imposed coverage in favor of innocent third parties, while at the same time voiding coverage to the first-party insured as a result of the insured\u2019s material misrepresentations to his insurer. <em>See Dillard v. Hertz Claim Mgmt., </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>448, 650 A.2d 1 (App.Div.1994), <em>aff'd </em>o.b., 144 <em>N.J. </em>326, 676 A.2d 1065 (1996); <em>Mannion v. Bell, </em>380 <em>N.J.Super. </em>259, 262-63, 881 A.2d 810 (Law Div.2005); <em>Fisher v. N.J. Auto. Full Ins. Underwriting Ass\u2019n., </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>552, 556, 540 A.2d 1344 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The trial judge, relying on this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Lovett v. Alan Lazaroff &amp; Company, </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>510, 513, 582 A.2d 1274 (App.Div.1990), and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Palisades, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 147-48, 814 A.2d 619, determined that Chrissy was not an innocent third party and could not recover PIP benefits under her father\u2019s policy. The court declared the policy void ab initio and entered judgment in Rutgers\u2019 favor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">In <em>Lovett, supra, </em>the son of the owner of a personal automobile insurance policy was injured while a passenger in an uninsured vehicle involved in an accident in New York. The son sought to obtain PIP benefits as an additional insured under the policy issued to his mother. The son\u2019s accident occurred after his mother\u2019s initial premium check was dishonored because the account on which the check had been written was closed, and after the insurer\u2019s representative notified the mother that the check was dishonored and demanded payment (which was never made), but before the date on which the notice of cancellation ab initio was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>provided by the insurance company to the mother. This court affirmed the trial judge\u2019s finding that the insurance policy was void ab initio. We determined that the son\u2019s claim was not that of an innocent third party injured as a result of the operation of the insured vehicle, but rather that of an additional insured seeking to recover under the terms of a void contract. <em>Id. </em>at 511-14, 582 A.2d 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Relevant to our decision was the fact that the mother\u2019s insurance policy was a New Jersey Automobile Full Insurance Underwriting Association (JUA) policy issued by its servicing insurance carrier, Continental Insurance Company. We pointed out that \u201c[t]he statute creating JUA preconditioned coverage on a timely payment of the initial premium.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512, 582 A.2d 1274. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30E-3(m) provided: \u201cNo person shall ... be deemed a qualified applicant ... if timely payment of premium is not tendered.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We further noted: \u201cIn accordance with this statutory directive, the application, which [the mother] signed provided: \u2018(6) I agree that no coverage will be in effect if my premium remittance, which accompanies this application and is forwarded to the servicing carrier, is justifiably dishonored by the financial institution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We are satisfied that the unique law pertaining to JUA policies as applied to the facts in <em>Lovett </em>distinguishes <em>Lovett </em>from this case. <em>See </em>Megan K. Gajewski, Comment, <em>Automobile Insurance Reform in New Jersey: Could a Pure No-Fault System Provide a Final Solution, </em>25 <em>Seton Hall L.Rev. </em>1219 (1995) (stating that the Legislature enacted the JUA specifically to counter the economic burden high-risk drivers placed on insurance companies and prevent these companies from leaving the State).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In <em>Palisades, supra, </em>a husband, who resided with his wife, intentionally failed to name her on an application for automobile liability insurance. The insurance application required him to state his marital status and to list all household residents of driving age. The husband falsely represented that he was single and the sole driver of the vehicle he sought to insure. Based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>the husband\u2019s misrepresentations, the insurance company (Palisades) issued a policy for a lesser annual premium. The husband thereafter continued the misrepresentation he made at the time of his initial application. He twice submitted documents that indicated he was the sole licensed driver and household resident over the age of sixteen and added a third car to his policy premised on the same misinformation. <em>Palisades, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 146, 814 A.2d 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">During the policy period, the wife and her mother were in an accident while driving the husband\u2019s car, which was insured under the policy. <em>Id. </em>at 147, 814 A.2d 619. Each filed a claim for PIP benefits under the policy. <em>Ibid. </em>Palisades thereafter filed a declaratory judgment action to have the policy declared void ab initio and to negate any liability for PIP benefits to the wife, as an additional insured under the policy. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The Court concluded that there was no question that the husband had made material misrepresentations beginning with his application and continuing throughout the insurer/insured relationship, which affected Palisades\u2019 assessment of the risks and the premium charged. <em>Id. </em>at 149, 814 A.2d 619. As a result, the Court determined that Palisades was entitled to an order declaring the policy void. <em>Ibid. </em>The court made clear, however, that although the company may rescind the policy, \u201cthereby disentit-ling [the husband] to any PIP coverage as the named insured, that does not mean that [the insurance company] escapes liability to innocent, third-party members of the public, whose protection is a paramount concern of the PIP, no-fault system.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The Court thus framed the issue as \u201chow to treat a resident spouse ... under her household\u2019s voided automobile insurance policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150, 814 A.2d 619. In making its determination, the Court assumed that the wife was unaware of her husband\u2019s intentional misrepresentation. <em>Ibid. </em>The court noted that the wife met the requirement of an additional \u201cnamed insured\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-2(g) reads in applicable part: \u201cNamed insured means the person ... identified as the insured in the policy and, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>an individual, his ... spouse, if the spouse is named as a resident of the same household.\u201d Based on this statutory definition of \u201cnamed insured\u201d and the husband\u2019s misrepresentation of his marital status, the Court noted that Palisades was unable to assess the additional first-party risk of a second driver in the household, in insuring the household\u2019s vehicles. <em>Palisades, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 150, 814 A.2d 619. The Court thus concluded that the husband\u2019s failure to identify his wife, either as his spouse or as another person of driving age residing in the household, should not elevate the wife to a different status than she would have had under the law had the application been honestly answered. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court identified her status as a first party, additional named insured claimant. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In this case, Robert\u2019s personal automobile policy in the PIP coverage endorsement defines \u201cnamed insured\u201d as the person named in the declarations and that person\u2019s spouse if a resident of the household.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the insuring agreement in paragraph 2 provides: \u2018With respect to Principal Personal Injury Protection Coverage, insured means ... [t]he named insured or any family member who sustains bodily injury while ... [occupying or using an auto.\u201d \u201cFamily Member\u201d is defined in the \u201cDefinitions\u201d section as \u201ca person related to you by blood ... who is a resident of your household.\u201d Thus, unlike the wife in <em>Palisades, </em>Chrissy is not a named insured under the policy. Instead, she occupies the lesser status of a first-party, additional insured under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">In <em>Palisades, supra, </em>the wife argued that notwithstanding her status as a first-party additional named insured claimant, she should \u201cbe treated as an [innocent] third-party claimant because she did not know that her husband had lied to Palisades about her, thereby causing their policy of auto insurance to be voided.\u201d <em>Palisades, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 150, 814 A.2d 619. The Court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>that the wife should not be given third-party claimant status. The Court determined that, in the case of a spouse, it was not appropriate, notwithstanding the policies underlying PIP protection that it had previously described and the wife\u2019s lack of knowledge of her husband\u2019s misrepresentations, to treat her differently from her husband under the void policy. <em>Id. </em>at 151, 814 A.2d 619. The Court explained its rationale for not treating the wife differently from her husband:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">A spouse, licensed to drive and living in the same household as the other spouse, is in a <em>unique position </em>to be aware of the other spouse\u2019s interactions with the insurer of the household\u2019s vehicles. Responsible adults should inform themselves in respect of important insurance-related matters pertinent to their household, and should be encouraged to do so. The strong public policy against the proliferation of insurance fraud favors treating a resident spouse in [wife\u2019s] position in the same manner as her husband, that is, entitled to first-party coverage only, when available. The facts here are distinguishable from those cases involving true third parties who were allowed to recover under a void policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\"><em>[Ibid </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">The Court then stated: \u201cWe hold that the public policy that requires an insurer to pay innocent third parties injured in automobile accidents minimum PIP benefits available under our compulsory insurance requirement does not apply to a resident spouse in [the wife\u2019s] position.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152, 814 A.2d 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">We must determine whether Chrissy should have the status of an innocent party for purposes of availability of PIP coverage or be denied that status as an extension of the <em>Palisades </em>holding. Our analysis requires consideration of the policy underlying the allowance of recovery by innocent third parties weighed against the competing public policy of discouraging and deterring insurance fraud by the insured applicant. Our determination also requires consideration of the relationship between a parent and adult child residing in the same household as compared to the relationship between husband and wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">In <em>Fisher, supra, </em>we discussed the policy underpinnings for permitting recovery by innocent third-parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-11\">One of the purposes of the No-Fault Law is to afford reparation for objectively provable economic losses resulting from automobile accidents\u2014 This is social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>legislation designed to give the broadest protection to automobile accident victims consistent with the language of its pertinent provisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">It is abundantly clear that the beneficiaries of our No-Fault Law and the insurance policies issued in compliance therewith ... are members of the public who, like plaintiff, may be injured in an automobile accident. The insurance carrier\u2019s liability to its assured who may be guilty of some act or conduct which renders a policy void <em>ab initio </em>is therefore distinct from its liability to an injured third person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\"><em>[Fisher, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 557, 540 A.2d 1344 (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">We are satisfied that the \u201cunique position\u201d of a spouse, which the Court identified in <em>Palisades, </em>does not apply to adult children residing in their parent\u2019s household. See Craig &amp; Pomeroy, <em>New Jersey Auto Insurance Law, </em>\u00a7 2:5-3b at 47 \u2014 18 (2007), (\u201c[t]he Court [in <em>Palisades </em>] did not address the potential application of innocent third party status to unnamed children, or unnamed unlicensed spouses\u201d). The duty imposed by the Court on a spouse, to inform herself in respect of important insurance related matters, arises from the marital relationship. The unique relationship of husband and wife places them on an equal footing with each other with respect to the economic affairs of their marriage. <em>See Konzelman v. Konzelman, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>185, 204, 729 A.2d 7 (1999) (O\u2019Hern, J., dissenting) (\u201c[i]n a long series of cases, we have come to recognize that marriage is both an affair of the heart and a form of economic partnership\u201d). However, children occupy a lesser position in the family structure, particularly with regard to the economic decisions of their parents and the family household. They are not on an equal economic footing with their parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">We are convinced, therefore, that <em>Palisades, supra, </em>does not impose an obligation on a resident child of an insured parent to cheek the automobile insurance application completed by his or her parent to determine if the parent named him or her as a resident licensed driver. It is simply unrealistic to expect a resident child to do so. Further, there is no corresponding duty on a parent to notify his or her child of the contents of the automobile insurance applications they have completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">We view Chrissy\u2019s claim for PIP benefits to be analogous to the claim of a person driving an insured\u2019s car with permission. In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>case, the Rutgers insuring agreement includes in its definition of \u201cinsured,\u201d in addition to the named insured or any family member, \u201cany other person who sustains bodily injury while occupying or using your covered auto with the express permission of the named insured.\u201d <em>Palisades </em>clearly would not impose a duty to inform oneself on persons occupying the \u201cany other person\u201d status.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\"><em>Palisades </em>makes clear the equally strong public policy of deterring insurance fraud. <em>Palisades, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 152, 814 A.2d 619. Indeed, the Court stated that to have allowed the wife to have recovered under the circumstances of her husband\u2019s intentional misrepresentation would result in a disincentive to a married insurance applicant to tell the truth. <em>Ibid. </em>Clearly, an insurance company, by virtue of such material misrepresentations as existed in <em>Palisades, </em>and here, is a victim of unfair risk assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">We are of the view, however, that insureds such as Robert will potentially suffer sufficient repercussions from their actions to create a disincentive to making misrepresentations such as Robert made here. Robert\u2019s policy is rescinded. Additionally, Robert is potentially liable to Rutgers under the provisions of the New Jersey Fraud Prevention Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:33A-1 to -30. Further, Robert may be liable for causes of action under legal and equitable fraud principles. Rutgers\u2019 complaint seeks, as compensatory damages, reimbursement of the amount of any money it is required to pay Chrissy, the right to retain any unearned premium, and the award of any additional premium, which would have been charged had Robert disclosed the true facts existing at the time the application was submitted. Additionally, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 17:33A-5, the Commissioner of Insurance may bring a civil action against an insurance fraud violator, levy a civil administrative penalty and order restitution, and in an appropriate case request the Attorney General to bring a criminal action under applicable criminal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">We hold that Chrissy, although a first-party additional insured under her father\u2019s policy with Rutgers, was an innocent party entitled to the protections afforded by the compulsory PIP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>coverage provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4. The public policy that requires an insurer to pay innocent third parties injured in automobile accidents minimum PIP benefits under our compulsory insurance requirements, <em>Fisher, supra, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 558, 540 A.2d 1344, likewise applies to an innocent child of an insured, unaware of her parent\u2019s material misrepresentations in his insurance application, residing in the insured\u2019s household, and who is a licensed driver injured in an automobile accident while driving her insured parent\u2019s car with permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the provision of the Law Division\u2019s order of March 1, 2006, which denied Chrissy statutorily mandated PIP benefits. We afBrm the order\u2019s provisions voiding the policy ab initio as to Robert, reducing the PIP benefits available to Chrissy to the minimum benefits mandated by statute and denying Chrissy UIM benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We remand this matter to the trial court to conduct such proceedings as it deems appropriate consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\"> Chrissy\u2019s counterclaim also sought under-insured motorist (UIM) benefits under Robert\u2019s policy. At oral argument, Chrissy\u2019s counsel conceded that established law precludes Chrissy\u2019s right to obtain UIM benefits and withdrew Chrissy\u2019s appeal of the portion of the court's order denying her UIM benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"> Based on our request at oral argument, plaintiff's counsel has supplied to this panel and defendant's counsel a sample Rutgers' policy effective as of the relevant dates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b318-6\"> Chrissy agrees that her PIP recovery is limited by our cases to the minimum coverage mandated by statute. <em>See Dillard, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>at 327, 676 A.2d 1065; <em>Marotta v.
