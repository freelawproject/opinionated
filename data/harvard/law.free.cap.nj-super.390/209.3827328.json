Smith was hired on March 24, 2003 by the Department of Human Services to work as a nurse at Trenton Psychiatric Hospital. On May 29, 2003, while a temporary employee, Smith was struck on the head by a patient and placed on sick leave. On April 3, 2004, as her second year of employment commenced and while still on sick leave, Smith enrolled in PERS. She then requested and, in July 2004, was permitted to purchase her year of temporary service for the period from March 24, 2003 through April 3,2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">A few months later, Smith applied for accidental disability pension benefits, alleging a permanent and total disability resulting from the event that occurred on May 29, 2003. Without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>considering whether Smith was \u201cpermanently and totally disabled as a direct result of a traumatic event,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-43, the PERS Board determined that Smith was not eligible for such benefits because she was not, at the time of the injury, a PERS member. In appealing that final agency determination, Smith contends that eligibility for accidental disability pension benefits is governed not by her PERS membership status at the time of the traumatic event but by her employment status at the time of the application for benefits. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-43 contains the guidelines for the conferring of such a pension and states that \u201ca member\u201d shall, upon application, \u201cbe retired by the board of trustees, if said employee is permanently and totally disabled as a direct result of a traumatic event occurring during and as a result of the performance of his regular or assigned duties, on an accidental disability allowance.\u201d The word \u201cmember\u201d in this context obviously means a \u201cPERS member,\u201d and this defining of the eligible class of persons, in our view, reflects the legislative intent to preclude a temporary employee from obtaining accidental disability pension benefits. Smith does not argue to the contrary, but instead claims that, because she later became a PERS member and sought accidental disability pension benefits after she became a member, the plain language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-43 permits the relief she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Smith has also invoked Justice Francis\u2019s oft-cited comment that, because they are \u201cremedial in character,\u201d pension statutes \u201cshould be liberally construed and administered in favor of the persons intended to be benefited thereby.\u201d <em>Getter v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>591, 597-98, 252 A.2d 393 (1969). <em>See also Steinmann v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>564, 572, 562 A.2d 791 (1989); <em>Harris v. Bd. of Trs., P.E.R.S., </em>378 <em>N.J.Super. </em>459, 465, 876 A.2d 305 (App.Div.2005); <em>Estate of Hagel v. Bd. of Trs., P.E.R.S., </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>182, 186, 543 A.2d 1010 (App.Div.1988); <em>Fiola v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, 347, 474 A.2d 23 (App.Div.1984). That policy argument, however, only begs the question posed here, because the present controversy centers on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>whether Smith is a \u201cperson intended to be benefited\u201d by the pension statute in question. That is, an employee is entitled to the liberality spoken of in <em>Getter </em>when eligible for benefits, but eligibility is not to be liberally permitted. Instead, in determining a person\u2019s eligibility to a pension, the applicable guidelines must be carefully interpreted so as not to \u201cobscure or override considerations of ... a potential adverse impact on the financial integrity of the [f]und.\u201d <em>Chaleff v. Teachers\u2019 Pension &amp; Annuity Fund Trustees, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>194, 197, 457 A.2d 33 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>573, 468 A.2d 215 (1983). <em>See also McKenzie v. Bd. of Trs., P.E.R.S., </em>389 <em>N.J.Super. </em>456, 460, 913 A.2d 810 (App.Div.2006); <em>Kramer v. Bd. of Trs., P.E.R.S., </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>46, 676 A.2d 1117 (App.Div.1996), <em>certif. denied, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>458, 690 A.2d 606 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Despite the parties\u2019 expressions of certitude as to the validity of their respective interpretations, we recognize that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-43 does not explicitly reject or embrace either position. It does unambiguously mandate that only a PERS member may apply for an accidental disability retirement, but it does not expressly permit or preclude the conferring of accidental disability pension benefits when the member\u2019s application is based upon a traumatic event that occurred prior to the member\u2019s enrollment. Smith recognizes that if she is at all eligible it is because the Legislature implicitly intended that result and not because the language of the statute unambiguously confers that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">In urging this result, Smith initially acknowledges, as she must, that prior legislative amendments to this statutory scheme have sought to raise the bar of eligibility for an accidental disability pension. However, Smith also correctly argues that those amendments have focused on the extent of the employee\u2019s injury or the nature of the triggering event and not on the member\u2019s employment status at the time of the disabling injury. For example, in the mid-1960\u2019s the statutes governing the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-7, the Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-39, and PERS, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>43 \u2014 all of wMch are similarly worded and similarly interpreted\u2014 were amended to replace \u201caccident\u201d with \u201ctraumatic event\u201d as the triggering circumstance for the conferring of accidental disability pension benefits. These amendments have been understood as revealing the Legislature\u2019s intent \u201cto make the granting of an accidental disability pension more difficult.\u201d <em>Kane v. Bd. of Trs., Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>651, 661, 498 A.2d 1252 (1985) (quoting <em>Cattani v. Bd. of Trs., Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>578, 584, 355 A.2d 625 (1976)); <em>see also Fairweather v. P.E.R.S., </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>288, 294-95, 861 A.2d 186 (App.Div.2004).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each successive legislative amendment to the statutory schemes that govern public pension rights has been understood as making it more difficult to qualify for an accidental disability pension than before.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See generally </em>Solomon <em>A. </em>Metzger, <em>Public Sector Accidental Disability Pensions in New Jersey: The Law of Dramatic Events, </em>31 <em>Rutgers L.J. </em>491 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>This legislative trend in favor of rendering more difficult the conferring of accidental disability pension benefits militates against the liberal approach forcefully championed by Smith in this matter. If adopted, Smith\u2019s interpretation would expand the class of persons eligible for the significantly greater monetary benefits permitted when an allowance pursuant to N.J.S.A. 43:15A-43 is made,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and would have a tendency to place a greater strain on the financial integrity of the fund in question and its future availability for those persons who are truly eligible for such benefits. <em>See Mount v. Trustees of P.E.R.S., </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>72, 86, 335 A.2d 559 (App.Div.1975) (recognizing that the members of \u201c[t]he board of trustees are fiduciaries and therefore have a duty to protect the fund and the interests of all beneficiaries thereof,\u201d which duty must be exercised \u201cwith due care, diligence and skill in administering the trust.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In rejecting Smith\u2019s argument, we conclude that implicit in the Legislature\u2019s utilization of the word \u201cmember\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-7 \u2014 in defining the class of persons who may seek an accidental disability pension \u2014 is the Legislature\u2019s intent to preclude the granting of such relief to a member when the traumatic event occurred prior to that member\u2019s enrollment in PERS. When Smith was injured, she was a temporary employee who was not eligible to be enrolled in PERS. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-7(b). Although we acknowledge that the wording of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-43, in this context, is subject to more than one interpretation, we agree with the PERS board that an employee must be a PERS member at the time of the alleged traumatic event and not merely when the application for the accidental disability pension is filed. We reject the logic of the argument that the Legislature implicitly created as large a class of eligible employees as urged by Smith and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>decline the invitation to expansively view the scope of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-43 to cover a public employee based on events that occurred before the employee became a PERS member. <em>See Cha-leff, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 198, 457 A.2d 33 (holding that an expansive view of the public pension statutes is undesirable because it \u201cmay threaten the fiscal soundness of the fund,\u201d and declaring that the availability of benefits \u201cshould be undertaken by the Legislature and not by the courts under the guise of liberal construction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We also reject Smith\u2019s argument that she became eligible by purchasing credit for her temporary service, which included the date upon which she was injured, after she became a PERS member. In a strikingly similar matter, a person employed as a nurse at the Trenton Psychiatric Hospital was injured by a patient within two weeks of his hiring. After the passage of one year from his hiring, the employee enrolled in PERS, purchased credit for his one year of temporary service, and applied for an accidental disability pension. The PERS board concluded that the purchase of credit does not change the effective date of membership in PERS. <em>Donovan v. Bd. of Trs., P.E.R.S., </em>94 <em>N.J.A.R.2d </em>(Vol.17) 33 (Div. of Pensions). We likewise agree that a credit purchase has no bearing on an employee\u2019s eligibility for accidental disability pension benefits. Smith\u2019s membership in PERS was predicated on her one-year temporary term of continuous service. This circumstance was not met at the time of the injury and the purchase of credit, absent some clear indication from the Legislature to the contrary, cannot alter the date the employee became a PERS member.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Not only do we agree with the logic of <em>Donovan\u2019s </em>approach, but we adhere to that determination because we also find that the PERS board\u2019s interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-43, as reflected in <em>Donovan </em>and in the present case, is not plainly unreasonable and, thus, entitled to our deference. Recently, we observed that \u201c[ajlthough an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute it administers is not binding upon us, the agency\u2019s interpretation is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\u2018substantial deference\u2019 \u2018provided it is not plainly unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>McKenzie, supra, </em>389 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 461, 913 A.2d 810 (quoting <em>Merin v. Maglaki </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>430, 436-37, 599 A.2d 1256 (1992)). As we have observed, the Legislature has continually narrowed eligibility for an accidental disability pension out of concern for the fund\u2019s financial integrity. Where once such benefits could be conferred when a disability resulted from an \u201caccident,\u201d there is now a requirement that the disability be directly brought about by a \u201ctraumatic event,\u201d which the courts have further limited through the adoption and application of the <em>Kane </em>test. The trend represented by this evolution in the statutory scheme, coupled with what we deem to be the more sensible reading of <em>N.J.S. </em>A 43:15A-43, convinces us that the interpretation of this statute originally adopted by the PERS board in <em>Donovan, </em>and applied by the PERS board here, is deserving of our deference because it is certainly not \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Merin, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>at 436-37, 599 A.2d 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">We conclude that N.J.S.A. 43:15A-43 does not permit the awarding of accidental disability pension benefits to an employee who was not a PERS member at the time of the alleged traumatic event. The employee\u2019s purchase of prior service covering the period of time during which the traumatic event occurred does not alter the employee\u2019s status at the time of the traumatic event nor does it alter the date upon which the employee became a PERS member.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-5\"> Our Supreme Court undertook to \"bring clarification\u201d to what constitutes a \"traumatic event\u201d in <em>Kane </em>by requiring that an employee \"must demonstrate (1) that his injuries were not induced by the stress or strain of the normal work effort; (2) that he met involuntarily with the object or matter that was the source of the harm; and (3) that the source of the injury itself was a great rush of force or uncontrollable power.\u201d 100 <em>N.J. </em>at 663, 498 A.2d 1252. The <em>Kane </em>test has generated a considerable amount of additional litigation, <em>see, e.g., Maynard v. Bd. of Trs., Teachers' Pension and Annuity Fund, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>169, 549 A.2d 1213 (1988); <em>Ciecwisz v. Bd. of Trs., Police &amp; Firemen's Ret.
