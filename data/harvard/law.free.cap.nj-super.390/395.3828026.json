Suther and Theresa Suther appeal from a judgment entered following a jury trial, awarding damages to plaintiff Halina Jablonowska in an action arising from an automobile accident in which plaintiffs mother Jadwiga Baczewska (Bac-zewska) was killed. Plaintiff cross-appeals from the dismissal of her claim for the negligent infliction of emotional distress. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">On October 14, 2000, plaintiff was driving in her vehicle and Baczewska was her passenger. At the time, defendant David P. Suther was driving a vehicle owned by defendant Theresa Suther. Suther\u2019s vehicle collided with plaintiffs car. Baczewska sustained personal injuries in the accident which resulted in her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">On October 9, 2002, plaintiff filed a complaint naming the Suthers as defendants. Plaintiff alleged that David P. Suther drove the vehicle negligently and, as a result, plaintiff and Bac-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>zewska sustained personal injuries, which resulted in pain and suffering and Baczewska\u2019s death. Plaintiff claimed that she suffered emotional distress as a result of witnessing Baczewska\u2019s injuries and death. Plaintiff asserted claims on behalf of Baczews-ka\u2019s survivors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In February 2004, defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs individual claims for emotional distress and pain and suffering because she had not furnished a physician\u2019s certification within sixty days of the filing of the answer. According to defendants, the physician\u2019s certification was required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a, as amended by the Automobile Insurance Cost Reduction Act (AI-CRA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-1.1 to -35.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">In response to the motion, plaintiff stated that she had not filed the physician\u2019s certification because her soft tissue injuries did not rise to the level required by the limitation on lawsuits in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a. Furthermore, plaintiff argued that she was asserting an emotional distress claim pursuant to <em>Portee v. Jaffee, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>88, 417 A.2d 521 (1980), and the threshold did not apply to such a claim. Plaintiff submitted two reports to substantiate her emotional distress claim: a report by Irena Bartman-Fila (Bartman-Fila), a clinical social worker; and a report by Dr. David Brozyna (Brozyna), a psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">On April 2, 2004, the judge entered an order granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. The judge found that plaintiffs <em>Portee </em>claim is subject to the threshold in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a. The judge determined that dismissal of the claim was warranted because plaintiff had not furnished the physician\u2019s certification required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a, and because plaintiff had not presented objective evidence of a permanent injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">On or about April 14, 2004, plaintiff moved for reconsideration of the April 2, 2004, order. The judge entered an order on May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>14, 2004, denying the motion. The matter was scheduled for trial on March 7, 2005. On or about January 31, 2005, plaintiff again moved for reconsideration of the April 2, 2004 order, and to adjourn the trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In support of her motion for reconsideration, plaintiff relied upon <em>Casinelli v. Manglapus, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>354, 858 A.2d 1113 (2004), which was decided on September 22, 2004. In <em>Casinelli, </em>the Court held that a physician\u2019s certification under AICRA \u201cis neither a fundamental element of the AICRA cause of action nor analogous to a pleading and therefore, that neither dismissal with nor without prejudice is compelled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355-56, 858 A.2d 1113. In further support of her motion, plaintiff submitted a physician\u2019s certification from Brozyna, dated January 14, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The trial judge entered an order on February 18, 2005, denying the motion. The judge wrote on the order that the <em>Casinelli </em>decision was not meant to encourage the re-opening of a matter which had been dismissed ten months before, under the guise of reconsideration. The judge again found that plaintiffs claim did not meet the statutory threshold because she had not presented objective evidence of a permanent injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Defendants conceded liability and a trial was held on July 12 to July 14, 2005, limited to the issue of damages. Plaintiff testified that she was born in Poland and came to the United States in 1997. Baczewska came to the United States a year later, and lived for a brief period of time with plaintiff and her family. According to plaintiff, she and her mother were \u201cbest friends.\u201d They saw each other twice during each week, for about seven to eight hours a day. They also were together for about twenty hours every weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Plaintiff further testified that she and Baczewska cooked dinner, went on walks, shopped, and gardened together. Baczewska also gave plaintiff advice on family and health matters. Plaintiff said that from time-to-time she had marital problems, but Baczewska <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>urged her to keep the family together. Plaintiff credited her mother with keeping her marriage intact.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Plaintiff also described the car accident in which her mother was killed. Plaintiff was driving and her mother was a passenger in the car. Plaintiff stated that, when her car was struck by the other vehicle, she hit her head and was unconscious for a period of time. When she regained consciousness, plaintiff heard Baczews-ka calling her name, calling for help, and moaning. Plaintiff got out of the car and waited for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Rosalyn Stahl (Stahl), who is board-certified in anatomic pathology, clinical pathology, and cytopathology, testified as an expert for plaintiff. Stahl stated that in the accident Baczewska suffered a mild blunt trauma to her head; however, there was no indication that she suffered a concussion or lost consciousness. Baczewska also sustained multiple fractures to the ribs and vertebrae, and a partial transection of the aorta, which was a major factor contributing to her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Stahl concluded that the injury to Baczewska\u2019s aorta resulted in bleeding and an accumulation of blood in the thoracic cavity, which caused the lung to collapse. As a consequence, Baczewska was prevented from breathing. Stahl explained that the transection of the aorta did not cause Baczewska\u2019s immediate death. She testified that it would take a few minutes before the blood accumulated in the thoracic cavity.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Stahl further testified that an accumulation of blood in the thoracic cavity would cause pain. There would be considerable discomfort due to respiratory distress. Because many of Bac-zewska\u2019s ribs had been broken and misaligned, any attempt to take a deep breath would be painful. The multiple fractures of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>the vertebrae also would be painful. Stahl stated that Baczewska probably went into shock several minutes after the injuries were sustained. She did not know if Baczewska lost consciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The jury awarded plaintiff $200,000 on the wrongful death claim, and $350,000 on the survivorship claim. Defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial was denied and judgment was entered in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">In their appeal, defendants argue that: 1) plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence to support the wrongful death claim; 2) the judge erred in charging the jury on \u201ccompanionship\u201d and \u201cpain and suffering\u201d damages; 3) the jury awards were excessive; and 4) the conduct of plaintiffs attorney throughout the trial requires a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">We are satisfied that plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s award of damages on the wrongful death claim. The claim is governed by the Wrongful Death Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:31-1 to -6. In a wrongful death action, damages may be awarded for the pecuniary loss sustained by the decedent\u2019s survivors as a result of the tortious conduct of others. <em>Smith v. Whitaker, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>221, 231, 734 A.2d 243 (1999). Recovery is based on the monetary contributions that the decedent probably would have provided to the survivors. <em>Curtis v. Finneran, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>563, 570, 417 A.2d 15 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Damages may be awarded for the pecuniary value of the loss of companionship, as well as the loss of guidance, advice and counsel \u201cwhich all of us need from time to time in particular situations, for specific purposes, perhaps as an aid in making a business decision, or a decision affecting our lives generally, or even advice and guidance needed to relieve us from unremitting depression.\u201d <em>Green v. Bittner, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>1, 14, 424 A.2d 210 (1980). The advice and guidance must be of the type that \u201ccould be purchased from a business adviser, a therapist, or a trained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>counselor.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Expert testimony is not required to place a value on the loss of these services but may be \u201chelpful to avoid leaving the jury to conjecture on those values.\u201d <em>Brown v. Kennedy Mem\u2019l. Hosp., </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>579, 593-94, 711 A.2d 1370 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>426, 719 A.2d 1024, 1025 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">In our view, plaintiffs testimony was sufficient to support her claim for the loss of her mother\u2019s companionship, advice and guidance. Indeed, the testimony presented in this case was similar to the plaintiffs allegations in <em>Gangemi v. Nat\u2019l Health Lab., Inc., </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>569, 677 A.2d 1163 (App.Div.1996), where the plaintiff sought recovery for companionship losses arising from her sister\u2019s wrongful death. The plaintiff stated that she considered her sister to be a \u201cconfidani/advisor.\u201d The plaintiff relied upon her sister for counsel regarding her troubled marriage, her subsequent divorce, and her relationship with her former husband. <em>Id. </em>at 572, 677 A.2d 1163. The plaintiff also relied upon her sister for career advice. We held that the plaintiffs assertions were sufficient to allow consideration of the claim by a jury. <em>Id. </em>at 576-77, 677 A.2d 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">We also are convinced that the trial judge did not err in denying defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the award of $200,000 on the wrongful death claim. The judge found that the jury\u2019s verdict was not a miscarriage of justice under the law. <em>R. </em>4:49 \u2014 1(a); <em>Fertile v. St. Michael\u2019s Med. Ctr., </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>43, 56, 756 A.2d 1037 (App.Div.2000), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>481, 779 A.2d 1078 (2001). The judge further found that the award was not excessive. There is ample support in the record for the judge\u2019s findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">In addition, we are satisfied that plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to support the award of $350,000 on the survivorship claim. The claim is governed by the Survivor\u2019s Act, N.J.S.A. 2A:15-3. In an action brought under the Survivor\u2019s Act, damages may be awarded for the decedent\u2019s conscious pain and suffering between the time of injury and death. <em>Whitaker, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 236, 734 A.2d 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Here, the trial judge found that sufficient evidence had been presented from which the jury reasonably could infer that Baczewska was conscious and in pain in the time between the injury and her death. The judge determined that the award of $350,000 for Baczewska\u2019s conscious pain and suffering was not excessive. In our view, the judge properly determined that the award was not a miscarriage of justice under the law. <em>Fertile, supra, </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 56, 756 A.2d 1037.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">We have considered defendants\u2019 other contentions and find them to be of insufficient merit to warrant discussion in this opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(l)(E). We accordingly affirm the judgment for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">In the cross-appeal, plaintiff argues that the judge erred by dismissing her <em>Portee </em>claim. Plaintiff contends that the claim is not subject to the limitation on lawsuit threshold in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a. Plaintiff also contends that the judge erred by concluding that she failed to present sufficient evidence to support her claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">In our view, plaintiffs <em>Portee </em>claim is subject to the threshold in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a. The statute provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS7\">Every owner, registrant, operator or occupant of an automobile to which <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4], personal injury protection coverage, <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-3.1], medical expense benefits coverage, or <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-3.3] regardless of fault, applies, and every person or organization legally responsible for his acts or omissions, is hereby exempted from tort liability for noneconomic loss to a person who is subject to this subjection and who is either a person who is required to maintain personal injury protection coverage ... [or] medical expense benefits ... as a result of bodily injury, arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of such automobile in this State, unless that person has sustained a bodily injury which results in death; dismemberment; significant disfigurement or significant scarring; displaced fractures; loss of a fetus; or a permanent injury within a reasonable degree of medical probability, other than scarring or disfigurement. An injury shall be considered permanent when the body part or organ, or both, has not healed to function normally and will not heal to function normally with further medical treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Thus, according to the plain language of the statute, a lawsuit seeking damages for \u201cnoneconomic\u201d loss resulting from a \u201cbodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>injury\u201d that arises from the \u201cownership, operation, maintenance or use\u201d of an automobile in this State,\u201d may not be maintained unless the claimant has sustained a \u201cbodily injury\u201d that results in an injury as defined in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Plaintiff is asserting a claim under <em>Portee </em>for non-economic loss, specifically emotional distress damages. Plaintiffs loss is the result of a \u201cbodily injury\u201d arising from an automobile accident, suffered in these circumstances not by plaintiff but rather by her mother, who is a person with whom plaintiff had an \u201cintimate, familial relationship.\u201d <em>Portee, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 101, 417 A.2d 521. The claim therefore comes within the purview of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Our decision in <em>Srebnik v. State, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>344, 585 A.2d 950 (App.Div.1991), supports this conclusion. In <em>Srebnik, </em>we held that <em>Portee </em>claims are subject to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2d, a provision of the Tort Claims Act which bars the award of damages against a public entity for pain and suffering except in cases involving a permanent loss of a bodily function; permanent disfigurement or dismemberment; or medical expenses that exceed a specified monetary threshold. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">In applying the Tort Claims Act, we perceive no difference between a direct claim for an emotional injury and a derivative claim for emotional distress under <em>Portee. </em>Indeed the underlying policy of barring \u201cnon-objective types of damages\u201d applies to both direct and derivative claims. We recognize the policy considerations implicated in <em>Portee </em>which allow recovery for the emotional trauma resulting from the \u201capprehension of the death or serious injury of one whose very existence is a precious treasure. <em>Portee v. Jaffee, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 97, 417 A.2d 521. However, <em>Portee </em>was not decided in the context of the Act. As stated, N.J.S.A. 59:9-2d bars <em>any </em>claim for emotional distress (pain and suffering) short of the aggravating circumstances set forth in the statute. It does not expressly or impliedly exempt <em>Portee </em>claims, notwithstanding the laudable policy underpinnings of the <em>Portee </em>decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 352-53, 585 A.2d 950.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">In applying the limitation on lawsuit threshold in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a to plaintiffs <em>Portee </em>claim, we also discern no valid distinction between a direct claim for emotional injury and a claim under <em>Portee </em>for emotional distress. The legislative policy to limit actions for non-economic damages that is reflected in the Tort Claims Act, also is reflected in the limitation on lawsuit threshold. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>In addition, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a does not expressly or impliedly exempt <em>Portee </em>claims from the threshold. Accordingly, we conclude that plaintiffs <em>Portee </em>claim is subject to the threshold in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Because the threshold applies in this matter, plaintiff was required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a to produce a physician\u2019s certification within sixty days of the filing of defendants\u2019 answer. The statute requires that the certification be furnished by a licensed treating physician, or a board-certified licensed physician to whom the plaintiff has been referred. The certification must state that plaintiff sustained an injury as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a. Furthermore:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">The certification shall be based on and refer to objective clinical evidence, which may include medical testing, except that any such testing shall be performed in accordance with medical protocols pursuant to <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4] and the use of valid diagnostic tests administered in accordance with <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.7]. Such testing may not be experimental in nature or dependent entirely upon subjective patient response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">In this case, the judge dismissed plaintiffs <em>Portee </em>claim because she had not furnished the physician\u2019s certification in a timely manner, and because plaintiff did not present objective evidence to support her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">In our view, the judge erred in stating that the Supreme Court in <em>Casinelli </em>did not contemplate the re-opening of a claim that had been dismissed several months before its decision. Indeed, we are convinced that the Court in <em>Casinelli </em>fully expected that the trial courts would adhere to its interpretation of AICRA, particularly in a matter that had not yet been tried. Nevertheless, we are satisfied that the judge correctly denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration because plaintiff had not presented objective evidence that she had sustained an injury as defined in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">Plaintiff alleges that she sustained a permanent injury, specifically post-traumatic stress disorder. To vault the threshold, plaintiff must show that she sustained a \u201cpermanent injury within a reasonable degree of medical probability.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>An <em>injury is </em>\u201cconsidered permanent when the body part or organ, or both, has not healed to function normally ... with further medical treatment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Emotional distress alone is not sufficient to carry plaintiff across the threshold. Plaintiff must establish that her post-traumatic stress disorder has resulted in a permanent injury to a \u201cbody part or organ.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Our conclusion that plaintiffs emotional distress claim must have a permanent physical component also is supported by our decision in <em>Srebnik, supra. </em>There, we held that the plaintiff could not be awarded damages on her <em>Portee </em>claim unless the emotional distress was the result of some \u201cpermanent debilitating or disfiguring physical injury\u201d <em>or </em>resulted in a \u201cpermanent loss of a bodily function\u201d such as \u201cdisabling tremors, paralysis or loss of eyesight.\u201d <em>Srebnik, supra, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 351, 585 A.2d 950. We held that, \u201cDamages resulting from subjective symptoms of depression and anxiety, without the requisite indicia of permanent physical infirmity, are not recoverable under <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2d].\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">In this matter, plaintiff submitted two reports that address her claim. Bartman-Fila stated in her report that she had weekly psychotherapy sessions with plaintiff from November 7, 2000, to March 5, 2002. Bartman-Fila found that plaintiff was suffering from chronic post-traumatic stress disorder with major depressive disorder. She said that plaintiff was afraid of driving, being a passenger in a car, and being in a closed room. Plaintiffs other symptoms included disturbed sleep and flashbacks of the accident. Bartman-Fila opined that plaintiffs psychological disorder was permanent; however, she did not identify any permanent physical injury to a \u201cbody part or organ\u201d resulting from the disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">In his report, Brozyna also diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder. Brozyna noted that initially plaintiffs illness included frequent crying, headaches, palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea with vomiting, dizziness, tingling and numbness in the extremities, and other symptoms. Plaintiff reported that she experienced nightmares and frequent flashbacks of the accident. Brozyna stated that plaintiffs condition had improved \u201cto a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>degree.\u201d He found that plaintiffs prognosis was \u201cguarded\u201d and he opined that plaintiff would probably need a \u201clong course of medication and supportive psychotherapy.\u201d However, Brozyna did not diagnosis any permanent physical injury to a \u201cbody part or organ\u201d resulting from plaintiffs post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Moreover, neither Bartman-Fila nor Brozyna based their reports on any \u201cobjective clinical evidence,\u201d as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a. <em>See DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 501, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005); and <em>Serrano v. Serrano, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>508, 518, 874 A.2d 1058 (2005). As their reports indicate, both Bartman-Fila and Brozyna relied on subjective patient response in formulating their opinions. Such evidence is insufficient to meet the threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">We therefore conclude that the judge correctly determined that plaintiff had not shown by \u201cobjective clinical evidence\u201d a permanent injury as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a. Although plaintiff presented reports which state that she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, that condition without an accompanying permanent physical injury to a \u201cbody part or organ,\u201d is insufficient to carry plaintiff across the threshold established by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a. Accordingly, plaintiffs <em>Portee </em>claim failed as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Affirmed on the appeal and the cross-appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-10\"> The complaint also included a claim by plaintiffs husband for the loss of his wife\u2019s services, society and consortium. On defendants' motion, the judge dismissed the claim. That order is not challenged on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b431-10\"> Plaintiff stated that she has two sisters but neither sister testified at trial. Plaintiff\u2019s son testified about his relationship with his grandmother. Before the case was submitted to the jury, the judge ruled that plaintiff was the only survivor who could be awarded damages for Baczewska\u2019s wrongful death. That determination is not challenged in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
