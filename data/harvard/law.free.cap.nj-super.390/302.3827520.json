Following the denial of his appeal, defendant entered a guilty plea to count one and, pursuant to a plea agreement, was sentenced to a three-year probationary term with a condition of restitution in the amount of $7619.78. If defendant completed the restitution before three years, his probation would be terminated after two years. Appropriate penalties and assessments were also imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">On appeal, defendant argues that the State\u2019s rejection of his PTI application, in the face of a recommendation for admission by the Criminal Division Manager, constituted a gross abuse of discretion. We reverse and remand for reconsideration of defendant\u2019s application in light of the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">The facts leading to defendant\u2019s indictment were set forth in the State\u2019s rejection letter of April 19,2004:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">These charges are based on misrepresentations that Mr. Watkins made to the New Jersey Department of Labor (DOL) in order to receive unemployment benefits to which he was not entitled. Mr. Watkins began receiving unemployment benefits in May 1998 when he was temporarily laid-off from Trenton Psychiatric Hospital. Mr. Watkins\u2019 unemployment benefits were extended in 1999 under the \u201cAdditional Benefits During Training Program\u201d (ABT) whereby certain \u201celigible\u201d claimants may obtain an extension of unemployment insurance benefits while pursing [sic] education and job training skills to enhance their employment opportunities. Mr. Watkins pursued a degree at the community college while receiving UI benefits under the ABT program but knowingly failed to report his re-employment with the Trenton Psychiatric Hospital to the Department of Labor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Between January 23, 1999 through May 22, 1999, Mr. Watkins cashed nine unemployment checks, all of which required him to certify that he was unemployed, collecting $5,670 in unemployment benefits. Based upon his earnings at Trenton Psychiatric Hospital during this time period, Mr. Watkins was not entitled to any of this money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Apparently efforts were made to resolve the matter civilly but to no avail. The indictment followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In denying defendant\u2019s appeal, the judge wrote as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">During the hearings on the appeal, the State initially asserted three bases for PTI denial: the fact that the defendant was a state employee and the policy of the Attorney General\u2019s Office was to hold state employees to a higher standard of conduct and deny them PTI entry; the fact that the offense occurred over a five-month period of time and involved nine separate unemployment cheeks; and the defendant\u2019s prior criminal behavior, which involved a 1990 disorderly persons conviction for receiving stolen property. At a subsequent hearing conducted on November 19, 2004, the State withdrew the defendant\u2019s employment with the State as a basis for rejection and relied upon the two other aforementioned bases. After considering those bases for rejection, the Court finds that the State\u2019s denial was not arbitrary or capricious and, therefore, denies the defendant\u2019s appeal of his PTI rejection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">At the outset, we note our limited scope of review. Due to the close relationship between the PTI Program and the prosecutor\u2019s charging authority, \u201ccourts allow prosecutors wide latitude in deciding whom to divert into the PTI Program and whom to prosecute through a traditional trial. The deference has been categorized as \u2018enhanced\u2019 or \u2018extra\u2019 in nature.\u201d <em>State v. Negran, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>73, 82, 835 A.2d 301 (2003) (quoting <em>State v. Baynes, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>434, 443-44, 690 A.2d 594 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Thus, a prosecutor\u2019s decision rejecting a PTI application \u201crarely will be overturned.\u201d <em>State v. Kraft, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>106, 111, 625 A.2d 579 (App.Div.1993) (quoting <em>State v. Leonardis (II), </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>360, 380 n. 10, 375 A.2d 607 (1977)). We review \u201cto check only the most egregious examples of injustice and unfairness.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>State v. DeMarco, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>562, 566, 527 A.2d 417 (1987)); <em>see also Negran, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 82, 835 A.2d 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">To overturn a prosecutor\u2019s rejection, a defendant must clearly and convincingly establish that the prosecutor\u2019s decision constitutes a patent and gross abuse of discretion. <em>Negran, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number><em>supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 82, 835 A.2d 301; <em>State v. Nwobu, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>236, 246, 652 A.2d 1209 (1995); <em>State v. Motley, </em>369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>314, 321, 848 A.2d 875 (App.Div.2004). A patent and gross abuse of discretion has been defined as \u201cmore than just an abuse of discretion as traditionally conceived; it is a prosecutorial decision that \u2018has gone so wide of the mark sought to be accomplished by PTI that fundamental fairness and justice require judicial intervention.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Wallace, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>576, 582-83, 684 A.2d 1355 (1996) (quoting <em>State v. Ridgway, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>118, 130, 504 A.2d 1241 (Law Div.1985) (citations omitted)). Defendant must show that the prosecutor\u2019s decision \u201c \u2018(a) was not premised upon a consideration of all relevant factors, (b) was based upon a consideration of irrelevant or inappropriate factors, or (e) amounted to a clear error in judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Negran, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 83, 835 A.2d 301 (quoting <em>State v. Bender, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>84, 94, 402 A.2d 217 (1979)). Because we conclude that the Prosecutor, and the judge, misinterpreted a critical factor, we remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The bases for defendant\u2019s rejection were also set forth in the prosecutor\u2019s rejection letter of April 19, 2004. Immediately following the statement of facts quoted above, the Deputy Attorney General (DAG) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">The facts of this case indicate that the fraud continued from January to May 1999, a five-month period of t\u00edme, involving nine separate instances where Mr. Watkins lied about his employment status in order to cash unemployment checks. Accordingly it is the State\u2019s position that the defendant\u2019s crime falls within the ambit of Guideline 3(i)(2) of <em>Rule </em>3:28 as a continuing criminal enterprise justifying his rejection from PTI. Mr. Watkins committed a substantial fraud over a lengthy period of time. The circumstances surrounding this case coupled with his status as a public employee clearly demonstrates that he is not amenable to a rehabilitative process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">Finally, although there are no explicit per se rules excluding offenders from PTI eligibility, the statute provides that <em>\u201csupervisory treatment should ordinarily be limited to persons who have not previously been convicted of any criminal </em>[offense]____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12a. According to NCIC, Charles Watkins has a 1990 municipal court conviction for receiving stolen property. Obviously, Mr. Watkins [sic] prior experience with the criminal justice system has not had a significant deterrent effect on him and further indicating that he is not a suitable candidate for PTI.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Thus, a key element in the rejection determination was the DAG\u2019s conclusion that defendant\u2019s crime fell within Guideline 3(i)(2) as a \u201ccontinuing criminal enterprise.\u201d Such a conclusion \u201cgenerally constitutes sufficient justification for rejection from pretrial intervention.\u201d <em>State v. Imbriani, </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>304, 317, 654 A.2d 1381 (Law Div.1994), <em>aff'd, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>171, 677 A.2d 211 (App.Div.1996). The Guideline reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">(i) Assessment of the Nature of the Offense:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">Any defendant charged with crime is eligible for enrollment in a PTI program, but the nature of the offense is a factor to be considered in reviewing the application. If the crime was (1) part of organized criminal activity; or (2) part of a continuing criminal business or enterprise; or (3) deliberately committed with violence or threat of violence against another person; or (4) a breach of the public trust where admission to a PTI program would deprecate the seriousness of defendant's crime, the defendant\u2019s application should generally be rejected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">While Guideline 3(i)(2) does not define its terms, the concept has been addressed in a number of cases, not always consistently.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">In a comprehensive discussion in <em>State v. Marie, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>424, 491 A.2d 784 (Law Div.1984), Judge Haines concluded, after examining numerous cases, that a \u201ccontinuing criminal enterprise\u201d consists \u201cof a course of conduct involving a series of transactions continuing over a period of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429, 491 A.2d 784. \u201cIt is a defendant\u2019s repetitive criminal activities which provide a negative implication when rehabilitation is considered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429-30, 491 A.2d 784. In <em>Marie, </em>the defendant was arrested based on the discovery of eighty-five pounds of marijuana in a vehicle in which he was a passenger. <em>Id. </em>at 426, 491 A.2d 784. He was thereafter indicted <em>for </em>possession and possession with intent to distribute narcotics. <em>Ibid. </em>While recognizing that defendant\u2019s activity, although a single transaction, \u201cmay well be a link in a chain of further activities dealing with the disposition of marijuana,\u201d the judge concluded that it was \u201cnot, however, the kind of continuing criminal activity which requires the defendant to face the high barrier created by Guideline 3(i). There is no showing of any repetitive criminal activity. Guideline 3(i) should not be applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430, 491 A.2d 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>In the course of his opinion, Judge Haines catalogued the cases that had, to that date, addressed Guideline 3(i), beginning with <em>State v. Bender, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>84, 402 A.2d 217 (1979), in which defendant, a licensed pharmacist, diverted narcotics from his employer\u2019s inventory over a four-year period to feed his cocaine addiction. The Court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">We agree with the State that in order for a series of criminal acts to constitute a continuing enterprise, it is not necessary that a \u201cprofit\u201d be realized in the sense that the fruits of those crimes be sold to third persons and hence be converted into cash. Nonetheless, the defendant\u2019s course of conduct must ordinarily involve commercial overtones. That is, the crimes perpetrated must be undertaken for the purpose of enriching defendant in some material way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">As such, the crimes here engaged in by defendant cannot be characterized as a continuing criminal business or enterprise in the sense of being undertaken for commercial purposes. Although defendant systematically diverted cocaine from his employer\u2019s stocks over a four-year period, his course of conduct was not motivated by a desire to, nor did it, add to his worldly possessions or in any other manner result in financial gain. Rather, his crimes were merely undertaken in order to satisfy his need for drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">Support for this construction of \u201ccontinuing criminal business or enterprise\u201d can be gleaned from the language of the Guidelines themselves. One of the main purposes of PTI is \u201c[t]o provide a mechanism for permitting the least burdensome form of prosecution possible for defendants charged with \u201cvictimless\u2019 offenses.\u201d Guideline 1(c). Clearly, this purpose would be entirely frustrated were persons who unlawfully consume controlled dangerous substances over a prolonged time span to be deemed engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise and hence \u201cgenerally\u201d to be rejected pursuant to Guideline 3(i)(2). Although in the present case defendant\u2019s crime was not truly \u201cvictimless\u201d \u2014 inasmuch as his cocaine diversions harmed his employer as well as himself \u2014 the underlying rationale of Guideline 1(c) is nevertheless applicable. Defendant\u2019s later thefts, being precipitated in large part by his drug dependence, cannot be characterized as part of a continuing business or enterprise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aso\"><em>lid. </em>at 95-96,402 A.2d 217.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">In a companion case, <em>State v. Sutton, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>110, 402 A.2d 230 (1979), the defendant had obtained public assistance funds and food stamps over a four and one-half year period, while failing to report that she had obtained work as a part-time school bus driver. If the earnings had been reported, defendant\u2019s welfare benefits would have been reduced. <em>Id. </em>at 114, 402 A.2d 230. The Court held that defendant\u2019s PTI application was properly rejected because her conduct constituted a continuing criminal enterprise. <em>Id. </em>at 118, 402 A.2d 230. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Defendant did not merely fail to report one or a few sporadic accessions to her income. Bather, over a four and one half year period, she regularly received compensation deriving from her employment as a part-time school bus driver. She was thus guilty of a series of \u201cfail[ures] to disclose a material fact which it [was her] duty to reveal,\u201d and these non-disclosures allowed her to \u201cobtain * * * from [an] agency of the county * * * money, property, [and] other thing[s] of value * * *.\u201d <em>N.J.SA </em>2A:111-2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In <em>State v. Masucci, </em>156 <em>N.J.Super. </em>272, 383 A.2d 781 (Law Div.1978), the defendant admitted that he sold marijuana \u201con the street,\u201d for profit. <em>Id. </em>at 276, 280, 383 A.2d 781. The judge upheld defendant\u2019s PTI rejection, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">It is everywhere recognized that the street sale of marijuana is part of a larger drug traffic which has its genesis outside of this country. His participation in this insidious venture is clear evidence of his involvement in a continuing criminal business or enterprise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">\n<em>[Ibid]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">In <em>State v. Barrett, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>96, 384 A.2d <em>558 </em>(App.Div. 1978), defendant engaged in a scheme over a period of three years to sell unregistered securities to the public through a company of which he was President. <em>Id. </em>at 98-99, 384 A.2d 558. We reversed a Law Division order that had overturned the Attorney General\u2019s rejection of defendant\u2019s PTI application, on the basis that the activity fell within Guidelines 3(i)(l) and (2). <em>Id. </em>at 102, 384 A.2d 558. Defendant was \u201cpart of an organized and continuous criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103, 384 A.2d 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">Several of the other cases cited in <em>Marie </em>did not touch on Guideline 3(i)(2). Thus, <em>State v. Markt, </em>156 <em>N.J.Super. </em>486, 384 A.2d 162 (App.Div.1978), turned on defendant, treasurer of the Joint Free Public Library of Morristown and Morris Township, having engaged in a breach of public trust by virtue of a series of six embezzlements and forgeries over a six-month period, <em>Id. </em>at 489, 493, 384 A.2d 162, in violation of Guideline 3(i)(4). <em>Id. </em>at 492, 384 A.2d 162. And, in <em>State v. Smith, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>143, 455 A.2d 1117 (1983), defendant\u2019s premises were allegedly being used for a large scale gambling operation which, based on records seized, had been ongoing for about eight years. <em>Id. </em>at 144, 455 A.2d 1117. The Court upheld the prosecutor\u2019s rejection of defendant\u2019s PTI appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>cation on the ground that his conduct was \u201cpart of organized criminal activity\u201d in violation of Guideline 3(i)(l). <em>Id. </em>at 145-47, 455 A.2d 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Subsequent to <em>Marie, </em>we confronted a single mother of three young children who wrongfully received public assistance benefits during four periods totaling twenty-seven months over a four-year time span. <em>State v. Mickens, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>272, 273, 565 A.2d 720 (App.Div.1989). Defendant was rejected for PTI enrollment based on Guideline 3(i). <em>Id. </em>at 273, 565 A.2d 720. We assumed that the Guideline applied to her conduct, but nevertheless concluded that her reasons for committing the offense and her prospects for rehabilitation compelled her admission to the program. <em>Id. </em>at 278-80, 565 A.2d 720. Significantly, we made no mention of <em>State v. Sutton, supra, </em>a remarkably similar case with an opposite outcome. Indeed, the court in <em>Mickens, id. </em>at 279, 565 A.2d 720, made only passing reference to <em>State v. Burger, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>336, 536 A.2d 1295 (App.Div.1988), in which we concluded that obtaining welfare benefits and food stamps over a six-year period while continuously \u2014 and falsely \u2014 certifying to no outside income, <em>id. </em>at 339, 536 A.2d 1295, \u201cfell within the ambit of Guideline 3(i)(2) as a continuing criminal enterprise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341, 536 A.2d 1295 (citing <em>Sutton, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 117-18, 402 A.2d 230).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, in <em>Imbriani, supra, </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 316, 318, 654 A.2d 1381, defendant, a Superior Court judge, diverted over $173,000 to his own use over a period of five years from a private real estate partnership, using a variety of fraudulent schemes. It was in that context that the Law Division found defendant\u2019s offense to constitute a continuing criminal enterprise, applying the definition of that term in <em>State v. Marie, </em>quoted above. <em>Id. </em>at 317-18, 654 A.2d 1381. We agreed with that conclusion, noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>that \u201cthe criminal activity here was not of such a nature that it had to continue except for defendant\u2019s intent and purpose to continue to offend.\u201d <em>Imbriani, supra, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 182, 677 A.2d 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">With this background, we return to the present case. To repeat, defendant received $5670 in unemployment benefits in the form of nine checks over a four-month period; to continue receiving benefits, defendant was required to certify bi-weekly that he was unemployed. Defendant admitted that he knew of his obligation to report his renewed employment to the DOL. The question is whether Ms conduct constituted a continuing criminal enterprise, as that term is used in Guideline 3(i)(2). While one could parse the phrase into its components, i.e., \u201ccontinuing,\u201d \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201centerprise,\u201d we believe a proper analysis requires the words to be read as a uMt. Thus, while defendant\u2019s actions were certainly criminal, did they amount to a \u201ccontinuing ... enterprise\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">As noted earlier, <em>Bender, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 95, 402 A.2d 217, held that the \u201ccourse of conduct must ordinarily involve commercial overtones,\u201d although it is not necessary that there be third parties, such as buyers of illegally obtained goods, involved. Yet, the Court went on to clarify its statement by observing that the crimes \u201cmust be undertaken for the purpose of enriching the defendant in some material way.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>If that statement were taken literally, defendant would clearly fit witMn the Guideline since he was enriched in a material way by receiving the checks to wMch he was not entitled. However, we believe that the Court\u2019s statement cannot be understood without reference to its factual context, particularly the length of time involved \u2014 four years. In that case, of course, the Court ultimately held that the Guideline did not apply since defendant\u2019s thefts were for the sole purpose of supporting Ms addiction, and not for pecumary gain. In <em>Sutton, supra, </em>the defendant\u2019s conduct, wMch was clearly undertaken for personal financial gain, took place over a four and one-half year period. 80 <em>N.J. </em>at 118, 402 A.2d 230. Other cases discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>earlier have likewise involved criminality over an extended period of time. <em>Barrett, supra, </em>(three years); <em>Burger, supra, </em>(six years); <em>Imbriani, supra, </em>(five years).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The dictionary defines \u201centerprise\u201d as <em>inter alia, </em>an undertaking of \u201cgreat scope, complication or risk,\u201d a \u201cbusiness organization,\u201d or a \u201csystematic and industrious activity.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary </em>375 (1995).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The reference to a \u201cbusiness organization\u201d is significant because, in seeking the meaning to be accorded the term \u201centerprise\u201d in Guideline 3(i)(2), we also note that the entire phrase speaks of a continuing <em>\u201cbusiness </em>or enterprise\u201d (emphasis added). <em>See State v. Sisler, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>199, 206-07, 827 A.2d 274 (2003) (quoting <em>Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co. v. State Bd. of Tax Appeals, </em>131 <em>N.J.L. </em>565, 567, 37 A.2d 111 (E. &amp; A.1944)) (\u201cThe coupling of words denotes an intention that they shall be understood in the same general sense\u201d). \u201cContinuing\u201d is defined, insofar as relevant here, as existing \u201cover an extended period.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Dictionary, supra, </em>at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Whatever may be the limits of a continuing enterprise, defendant\u2019s actions did not fit that concept as it has been developed and applied by the decisions referenced earlier. Whether his conduct could be viewed as an enterprise, because of its systematic nature, need not be resolved since it was not a \u201ccontinuing\u201d enterprise, due to the relatively brief length of time it persisted. A series of unlawful acts intended to profit the criminal do not translate into a \u201cbusiness\u201d or \u201centerprise\u201d simply because they took place over a number of months. Such was the ease here.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Our conclusion does not mean that defendant is automatically entitled to PTI admission. The nature of his offense may still be considered. The fact that it is not a continuing criminal business or enterprise only means that it does not bring the offense within those that \u201cshould generally be rejected.\u201d In addition, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>did have a prior, albeit old, brush with the law, as reflected in a disorderly persons conviction. <em>See Negran, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 84, 835 A.2d 301 (quoting <em>State v.

If a new determination is unfavorable to defendant, he will have his right to appeal to the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Reversed and remanded. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-6\"> Other cases cited by defendant in which PTI rejections have been overturned do not deal with the continuing criminal enterprise Guideline. <em>State v.
