Upon defendant\u2019s arrest, the police discovered in his apartment diskettes containing pornographic images of alleged children. Defendant claimed that he had committed no crime as he was fantasy role-playing with women he thought to be over the age of sixteen, and that any possession of pornographic images was inadvertent. Despite these defenses, a jury convicted defendant of several counts of attempting to endanger the welfare of a child, endangering the welfare of a child, and attempted sexual assault. Judge Chaiet imposed a seven-year aggregate prison sentence and defendant appealed, raising numerous arguments, including, among others, the need for severance and the improper use of other-crimes or bad-acts evidence. We reject all of defendant\u2019s arguments and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Defendant came to the attention of the San Diego Police Department, the Morris County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, and the FBI as someone who appeared to be sexually pursuing children on the internet. The Monmouth County Prosecutor\u2019s Office began an undercover investigation of defendant after receiving reports from the other authorities regarding defendant\u2019s sexual activities, and after V.P., who was sixteen years old at the time, told the Parsippany Police Department that she had had a sexual relationship with defendant between September and October of 2000. Because defendant began his relationship with V.P. before she became sixteen, the Monmouth County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, from January 2001 to March 2002, surveilled defendant, monitored his computer chatroom conversations, and conversed over the internet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>and telephone with defendant under the guise of a fourteen-year-old girl named Krissy.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Two officers played the part of Krissy during internet and telephone conversations, and in a picture sent to defendant. Before conversing with defendant over the internet, one of the officers posing as Krissy also created a \u201cprofile,\u201d an accessible description of the person linked to the person\u2019s screen name, describing her as a freshman in high school and revealing age appropriate interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">On March 22, 2001, Krissy initiated an instant message conversation with defendant. During the various internet conversations relevant to this case, defendant used either MisterRight2 or NJRoboCopI as his screen name.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Krissy began the first conversation by talking about the New Jersey Devils. That apparently interested defendant, as he asked: \u201cWhy are all the great women all so young?\u201d Presumably he had accessed her profile. Krissy answered with question marks. Although this conversation ended shortly thereafter, at Krissy\u2019s request, defendant e-mailed his picture to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">From that date until April 19th, defendant had several conversations with Krissy. These conversations included discussions about hockey, music, and sex, focusing mostly on masturbation, and how steps could be taken to prevent Krissy\u2019s mother from learning of their conversations. At one point, Krissy agreed to send defendant her picture, although the picture sent was actually of a twenty-three year old police officer sitting in a tree, wearing a Devil\u2019s jersey and backwards baseball hat. Defendant thought she was \u201cvery pretty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">During their second conversation on March 24, 2001, defendant asked Krissy if she was a \u201cphysical person,\u201d as in \u201cromantic stuff.\u201d Defendant asked her whether she pleased herself and Krissy answered \u201c[m]y buds talk about it but I\u2019ve tried. Never, sorry, tried I mean.\u201d Defendant told her having sex was \u201cthe most intense feeling you will ever feel with the right person that is. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>You can make yourself feel that way too just not as intense.\u201d Although defendant offered to teach her over the phone, Krissy refused claiming that her mother was home. Krissy asked: \u201cHow?\u201d and defendant answered: \u201cWant me to tell you how? Like teach you?\u201d Krissy answered: \u201cOkay.\u201d Nothing more was said about it at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">On March 31, 2001, while defendant was at work, he sent Krissy an e-mail apologizing for not telephoning her as he had said he would.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">During their third conversation on April 2, defendant asked Krissy if she had \u201cmasturbated or tried\u201d lately. Krissy answered that she had but that she was not sure if she had done it right. Defendant asked if she had talked to her friends about how they do it and she said that she would not feel comfortable doing that. Defendant encouraged her to discuss masturbation with her Mends, and to ask them to show her how they do it. He again offered to teach her, over the phone, how to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">On April 16,2001, they had their fifth instant message conversation. Once again, defendant told Krissy that he wanted to call her and asked whether she had talked to her Mends about masturbating. He then told her that he likes to tease, \u201cnot have sex just tease.\u201d When Krissy asked \u201chow do you tease,\u201d he replied \u201c[w]e watch each other\u201d and he helps her \u201clearn how to play.\u201d He explained that he was \u201ca great kisser, very soft and yet masculine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">On April 17, 2001, Krissy e-mailed defendant her cellular telephone number and asked him to call at a particular time. Defendant opened the e-mail while at work and called Krissy. During this brief conversation, defendant told Krissy that he had a nine-year-old son. Defendant did not, in fact, have a son, but he had a daughter who was in her late teens. Later that day, they had another brief conversation talking about hockey, music and defendant\u2019s son. The tenor of their subsequent April 18 conversation, while defendant was at work, was largely the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>It was not until April 19 when the defendant initiated the most explicit dialogue. On that day, defendant explained to Krissy that when he was her age his sister told him that she and her friends masturbated together and that it was natural for them to do so. He used this as a segway to again offer to teach her how to masturbate. At that point Krissy accepted his offer, and defendant proceeded to tell her, step-by-step, how to touch her abdomen, inner thighs, and the outside of her vagina. He then explained that some girls like \u201cto put something inside of them, ... like a dildo, a vibrator,\u201d or their fingers.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Later on that same day, in an instant message, defendant asked Krissy if she liked the way touching herself felt and if she \u201c[w]ant[ed] to try in person to,\u201d as he \u201ccould show [her] more that way.\u201d Krissy said she wanted to meet him in person and asked where they should meet. Defendant suggested a park, saying \u201cwe\u2019re not going to do much. If you want, we won\u2019t do anything at all.\u201d He then asked: \u201cCan you wear like a skirt when we meet? ... Be easier to help you when you\u2019re wearing a skirt.\u201d Krissy said that she could and that they should meet at the Belmar Marina tomorrow at about 3:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Defendant then asked her if she shaved \u201ceverything,\u201d what size bra she wore and whether she \u201cwant[ed] to do more than that[,] what we talked about.\u201d Krissy told defendant, \u201cI\u2019ve never done it before, does it hurt?\u201d Defendant said it depends on how excited you are and promised that he would never hurt her. Krissy told defendant that she did not want to get pregnant, and he explained that he had undergone a vasectomy. At that point, defendant urged Krissy to tell him what she wanted when they met. She said that she felt stupid telling him because she was inexperienced. Defendant told her to never feel stupid and that he would \u201clove to hear what you want.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The next day, on April 20, the officer who had supplied the picture of herself waited for defendant at the Marina. He never arrived. Shortly before 3:30, he called her cellular phone and told her that he had been in a car accident. That was not true, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>however, as police knew from their surveillance that he was at his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The next conversation Krissy and defendant had was not until May 1, by instant message, when defendant apologized again for not meeting her. On May 2, defendant called again. During that conversation Krissy told defendant that she had masturbated since the last time they talked but she was still not sure she was doing it right. After Krissy claimed to be too embarrassed to explain what she had done, defendant again instructed Krissy on how to masturbate. He told her how to fondle her breasts, rub her \u201cfinger across your clit,\u201d and \u201cpush your fingers, [inside your vagina] ... towards your stomach.\u201d Krissy pretended to be doing as defendant instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The next conversation occurred on May 15 where they again discussed a meeting time. On May 21, defendant told her he had told a thirty-two-year-old female friend about Krissy, and that she would like to help teach Krissy how to masturbate. He said he would be there with the two of them if Krissy wanted him to.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The next conversation was on June 5, when defendant said his friend was scared because of Krissy\u2019s age. On June 20, defendant again contacted Krissy after she sent defendant an e-mail announcing that the last day of school had passed. He asked if she was still interested in meeting with him and his friend. She answered yes, but thought that the friend was scared. Defendant said his friend wanted to talk to Krissy over the phone first. That night, defendant\u2019s friend sent Krissy an instant message. Shortly, thereafter, defendant sent Krissy an instant message, asking whether she had spoken to the friend and whether they discussed speaking on the phone. Krissy said that the friend did not mention calling her.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">On June 28, defendant and Krissy had their last conversation. Defendant said: \u201c[my friend] doesn\u2019t think you are real.\u201d Krissy said the friend did not say that. Defendant insisted that was the case. Soon thereafter, defendant went off-line. No further conversations occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>In February 2002, defendant cancelled his America Online account, which prompted the Prosecutor\u2019s Office to question him on March 26, 2002. When informed by Lieutenant Peter Short from the Monmouth County Prosecutor\u2019s Office that the Office had been investigating his internet activities with a police officer who had posed as a fourteen-year-old girl, defendant admitted \u201crole-playing\u201d with females online, but contended that he believed them to be eighteen years old, or older. He said he could determine the girls\u2019 ages by listening to their voices over the telephone. He said he cancelled his AOL account because he had a steady relationship and felt guilty about the secret relationships he had with other females.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Lt. Short also told defendant that the Prosecutor\u2019s Office was interested in whether he had ever accessed child pornography over the internet. Defendant said that if he had seen any child pornography on his computer he would have deleted it. Short then showed defendant a picture that was stored on a floppy diskette police had seized from defendant\u2019s apartment pursuant to a search warrant. The picture depicted \u201ca young female engaged in a sexual act with a female.\u201d Defendant said the picture wasn\u2019t his. He explained that he sometimes received e-mails from individuals and that he \u201csaves them to disks for the purpose of saving space on his hard drive.\u201d After reviewing the images, defendant would delete them from the disc. Short asked why he did not report receiving the image, as it was contraband, and defendant answered that it was an error in judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">In executing the search warrant in defendant\u2019s apartment, the police found two pornographic pictures of alleged children on a floppy diskette, one pornographic picture of an alleged child on defendant\u2019s hard drive, and \u201cseveral video flies\u201d on defendant\u2019s hard drive. Defendant\u2019s computer also had installed on it a program called \u201cEvidence Eliminator\u201d that \u201cerases the person\u2019s [computer\u2019s] information on previously deleted files and things that are looked at, viewed on the internet.\u201d The program was accessed and deleted on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Based largely upon these facts, the grand jury issued a multicount indictment charging defendant with ten crimes. The first eight counts related to defendant\u2019s conversations with Krissy between March 22, 2001 and June 28, 2001. Count one charged defendant, between March 24, 2001 and June 28, 2001, with third-degree attempting to endanger the welfare of a child. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-la(l). Count two charged defendant, between March 24, 2001 and June 28, 2001, with \u201c[Ijuring or [ejnticing a [cjhild by attempting, via electronic or any other means to lure or entice a child ... into a motor vehicle, structure, or isolated area, or to meet or appear at any other place, with a purpose to commit a criminal offense with or against the child.\u201d The third, fourth, and fifth counts charged second-degree official misconduct on March 31, 2001, April 17, 2001, and April 18, 2001, \u201cby committing an act relating to his office as a public servant but constituting an unauthorized exercise of his official functions.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-2(a). These charges related to the brief conversations defendant had with Krissy, by e-mail and phone, while he was at work. The sixth, seventh, and eighth counts charged defendant on April 19, 2001, the date defendant was to meet Krissy, and May 2, 2001, the date defendant taught Krissy by phone how to masturbate, with second-degree attempting \u201cto commit the crime of Sexual Assault by doing an act constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in the commission\u201d of sexual assault and by \u201cengaging in conduct which would constitute the crime of [sjexual [a]ssault if the attendant circumstances were as a reasonable person would believe them to be.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2c(4); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1a(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Finally, the last two counts related to the pornographic images found during the search of defendant\u2019s apartment. Counts nine and ten, respectively, charged defendant with second-degree official misconduct between November 3, 1999 and March 26, 2002, \u201cby knowingly refraining from performing a duty which is imposed upon him by law,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-2, and with fourth-degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>endangering the welfare of a child \u201cby knowingly possessing or viewing any photograph film, videotape, computer program or file, video game or any other reproduction or reconstruction which depicts a child engaging in a prohibited sexual act or in the simulation of such an act.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4(b)(5)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">At trial before Judge Chaiet and a jury, the State called a pediatrician who testified that sixteen of the images seized from defendant depicted children less than sixteen years old. Another expert testified that none of the pornographic images or videos had been altered or computer generated.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The State also admitted much other-crimes or bad-acts evidence against defendant. This evidence consisted of V.P.\u2019s testimony regarding how she was fifteen years old when she met defendant on the internet, how their conversations turned to sex, and how after she became sixteen they met personally and had sex. In addition, the State admitted evidence of four online discussions defendant had with undercover State and Federal police officers from San Diego, Los Angeles, Ocean County, and Bergen County, posing as underage children. All of the conversations were recorded, but none resulted in meetings between defendant and the undercover officers. Each conversation reflected defendant\u2019s interest in underage females, and two conversations involved the topic of masturbation. No indictment arose from any of these conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">The State also presented defendant\u2019s thirty-four-year-old female friend. She had met defendant on the internet in a daddy/daughter role-playing chat room. She testified that defendant was fascinated by her bisexuality and aggressively pursued his interest in participating in threesomes with a girl between the age of 14 and 17. According to the friend, defendant was interested in young girls who were \u201c15 or so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, the court denied defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal, but dismissed count two (luring), as unsupported by the evidence. Thereafter the jury returned a guilty verdict on all remaining charges. Subsequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Judge Chalet denied defendant\u2019s second motion for judgment of acquittal or, in the alternative, a new trial, and sentenced defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">At sentencing, the court denied defendant\u2019s third motion for a judgment of acquittal and new trial; merged counts one into six, seven, and eight; and imposed a seven year sentence on counts three through nine, to run concurrently with each other; and on count ten, the court imposed a concurrent sentence of nine months imprisonment. Judge Chaiet did not impose any period of parole ineligibility but did impose the strictures of Megan\u2019s law and forfeited defendant\u2019s public employment with the Holmdel Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">On appeal, defendant raises seven points for our consideration. First, he argues that the trial court improperly refused to \u201csever counts 9 and 10 for a separate trial from counts 1 through 8\u201d or \u201cat a minimum\u201d conduct \u201ca sequential trial before the same jury after it rendered its verdicts on counts 1 through 8.\u201d Second, defendant argues that the court \u201cimproperly admitted the State\u2019s <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) evidence.\u201d Third, the judge\u2019s instructions on 404(b) evidence and the defense of entrapment \u201cwere contradictory, confusing and had the clear capacity to mislead the jury.\u201d Fourth, the court improperly denied defendant\u2019s motions for dismissal of the indictment or certain counts of the indictment, judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or new trial. Fifth, the \u201ccourt should have dismissed this indictment or certain counts of the indictment under the concept of due process entrapment.\u201d Sixth, the court \u201cimproperly refused to charge certain lesser-included offenses and certain proposed defenses.\u201d And finally, seventh, \u201cthe sentence in this case was excessive.\u201d We reject arguments five, six, seven, and most of four as lacking sufficient merit to require discussion in this decision. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2). Although we also reject defendant\u2019s official misconduct, attempt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>severance, other-crimes, and entrapment arguments, each requires discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">We begin our legal analysis by noting our agreement with Judge Chaiet that defendant\u2019s use of public resources during business hours to further his illicit relationship with Krissy constituted official misconduct. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-2a. In our view, the evidence was adequate for the jury to convict defendant of this charge, even if the communications were neutral on their face, especially considering defendant\u2019s motive in maintaining his relationship with Krissy. <em>See State v. Gleitsmann, </em>62 <em>N.J.Super. </em>15, 21-23, 161 A.2d 747 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>386, 164 A.2d 849 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">To commit attempted sexual assault, defendant must take a \u201csubstantial step\u201d toward the commission of the crimes. <em>State v. Perez, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>540, 553, 832 A.2d 303 (2003). In this case, defendant argues that because he failed to appear at the planned April 19th meeting with Krissy, the State\u2019s proofs on count 6 were insufficient to establish attempt. Defendant is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">To qualify as a \u201csubstantial step,\u201d the alleged conduct must \u201cstrongly corroborate[ ] his or her alleged criminal purpose.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>There is no iron clad requirement in a sexual assault prosecution involving a child that defendant must arrive at a physical meeting with the targeted victim for preliminary \u201cgrooming\u201d actions to ripen into an attempted sexual assault. In defendant\u2019s previous communications with Krissy, which culminated in the April 19th discussion, he asked her if she masturbated, if she would like to masturbate with girls, and if she would like him to teach her how to masturbate. In the April 19th conversation, he not only \u201ctaught\u201d her how to masturbate, but subsequently asked her if she \u201c[w]ant[ed] to try in person,\u201d as he could \u201cshow [her] more that way.\u201d He then gave her instructions detailing how she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>should dress to facilitate the masturbation, explaining how he would dress so she could recognize him, and establishing a relatively isolated meeting location.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">This conversation, particularly within the context of the previous conversations, constituted a sufficient indication of his criminal purpose to constitute an attempt. <em>See State v. Jovanovic, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>435, 440-41, 416 A.2d 961 (1980) (Resentencing Panel), <em>aff'd, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>97, 436 A.2d 938 (App.Div.1981). Defendant\u2019s failure to complete the planned crime is inconsequential because the crime of attempt, in this appeal, rests in defendant\u2019s scheduling of the meeting. <em>State v. Fornino, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>531, 540, 539 A.2d 301 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>570, 546 A.2d 499, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>859, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>152, 102 L.Ed.2d 123 (1988) (\u201c[E]ven if further major steps are required before a crime can be completed, or the accused had ample opportunity to desist prior to completing the crime, a jury can still conclude that an attempt has been committed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Finally, the fact that the jury could have also determined from this evidence that defendant was fantasy role-playing and never had any intention to meet with defendant does not support defendant\u2019s argument, as the evidence was sufficient for the jury to reject this defense and accept, beyond a reasonable doubt, the State\u2019s contention regarding defendant\u2019s true motivations.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">In defense of the entire prosecution, defendant argued that he never knowingly or intentionally possessed pornographic images, and that his conversations with Krissy were mere fantasizing with another person he believed to be an adult. By advancing these defenses, defendant placed in issue his motive and intent in conversing with Krissy and possessing the pornographic images, <em>see State v. Covell, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>554, 565, 725 A.2d 675 (1999), which allowed the other bad-acts evidence to be admitted as probative of whether defendant intended to engage in sexual acts with Krissy, and whether he knowingly possessed the pornographic images. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number><em>See N.J.R.E. </em>404(b). More specifically, the evidence tended to illuminate defendant\u2019s intention to personally or with other adults \u201cteach\u201d underage girls how to masturbate and then later have sex with them himself. Because of this goal, the evidence also tended to disprove defendant\u2019s assertion that he only inadvertently possessed child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Accordingly, we agree with the trial court that the evidence of the other intemet/telephone relationships defendant cultivated with fictional underage females and his sexual relationship with V.P. met the four part admissibility test established by <em>State v. Cofield, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>328, 334, 605 A.2d 230 (1992). The other bad-acts evidence was relevant to a material issue, similar in kind and reasonably close in time to the charged offense, was clearly and convincingly established, and its probative value was not outweighed by the apparent prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 338, 605 A.2d 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Though defendant vigorously challenges V.P.\u2019s believability, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s credibility finding that the account of her sexual relationship with defendant was clear and convincing. <em>State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 471, 724 A.2d 234 (1999). In addition, we note that even though \u201cevidence is shrouded with unsavory implications\u201d, it should not be excluded where, as here, \u201cit is a significant part of the proof.\u201d <em>State v. West, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>327, 335, 149 A.2d 217 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Defendant challenges Judge Chaiet\u2019s refusal to sever the Krissy-related charges from the pornographic-image charges. A court\u2019s severance decision will be reversed only for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Chenique-Puey, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>334, 341, 678 A.2d 694 (1996). Central to deciding the motion is \u201cwhether, assuming the charges were tried separately, evidence of the offenses sought to be severed would be admissible under <em>[N.J.R.E. </em>404(b)] in the trial of the remaining charges.\u201d <em>State v. Pitts, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>580, 601-02, 562 A.2d 1320 (1989). The admissibility of the evidence in both trials renders inconsequential the need for severance. <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number><em>Coruzzi, </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>273, 299, 460 A.2d 120 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>531, 468 A.2d 185 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Defendant placed his intent directly at issue by claiming that he was merely role-playing during the conversations with Krissy and that he did not knowingly possess pornographic images of children. <em>State v. Rogers, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>218, 228, 116 A.2d 37 (1955)(rendering admissible proof of circumstances which \u201ctend to shed light\u201d on a defendant\u2019s motive and intent or \u201ctend to fairly explain [a defendant\u2019s] aetions[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The trial court excluded some of the pictures, holding that no reasonable juror could find them to be of children under the age of sixteen. The remaining pictures and videos admitted were clearly and convincingly established to be of under age children. In fact, the State produced proof that the images were of children, some as young as under five years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Therefore, the pornographic images, though graphic, established defendant\u2019s purpose and intent in conversing with Krissy. The conversations and images revealed the basis of defendant\u2019s interest in children in general, and because he possessed the images around the same time he conversed with Krissy, with her in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Thus, had the pornography charges been severed from the Krissy-conversation charges, the pornography found on defendant\u2019s computer would have been admissible as other-crimes or bad-acts evidence in the Krissy-conversation prosecution. Accordingly, there is no basis to reverse the court\u2019s severance decision. <em>Coruzzi, supra, </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 299, 460 A.2d 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Defendant also contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss counts one through eight of the indictment on the ground that the State entrapped him, contrary to the Due Process Clause of the New Jersey Constitution. The due process entrapment defense is based on an objective theory of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>entrapment. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>458, 470, 606 A.2d 315 (1992). \u201cThe defense arises when conduct of government is patently wrongful in that it constitutes an abuse of lawful power, perverts the proper role of government, and offends principles of fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473, 606 A.2d 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Once a defendant presents \u201csome evidence of due process entrapment,\u201d the State bears the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that it did not entrap defendant. <em>State v. Florez, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>570, 590, 636 A.2d 1040 (1994). Whether the State has satisfied that burden is a question of law for the trial court to decide. <em>Id. </em>at 584, 636 A.2d 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Here, the trial court rejected defendant\u2019s due process entrapment defense, explaining that there was \u201cabsolutely no government entrapment.\u201d We agree with the trial court. Nothing prohibits the police from creating characters to conduct undercover investigations. Rather, \u201cdecoys, traps, and deceptions properly may be used to apprehend those engaged in crime or to obtain evidence of the commission of crime.\u201d <em>State v. Rockholt, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>570, 575, 476 A.2d 1236 (1984). Here, the police did just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Besides their initial conversation, defendant had initiated almost all contact with Krissy. He was the first person to mention sex and masturbation; and, indeed, he repeatedly encouraged Krissy to masturbate on her own and with her girlfriends. He also offered to \u201cteach\u201d her how to do so, and proceeded to explain in sordid detail. Krissy merely agreed to his suggestions. She never \u201ccontrolled [or] directed the commission of the crime,\u201d <em>Johnson, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 474, 606 A.2d 315, and did not \u201cresort to excessive inducements\u201d to lure defendant. Id. at 479, 606 A.2d 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">Defendant also argues that his convictions should be reversed because the court\u2019s jury instructions on the 404(b) evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>the statutory entrapment defense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-12, had the capacity to mislead the jury as contradictory and confusing.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Proper jury instructions are essential to a fair trial. <em>State v. Green, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>281, 287, 430 A.2d 914 (1981). The court must give the jury a \u201ccomprehensible explanation of the questions [they] must determine, including the law of the case applicable to the facts that the jury may find.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The jury charge should include instruction on all \u201cessential and fundamental issues and those dealing with substantially material points.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290, 430 A.2d 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Here, the court instructed the jury four times on the permissible use of the bad-acts evidence pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b). The court gave the first instruction, which was essentially the same as the Model Jury Charge, just before the first 404(b) witness testified. The court gave the second instruction after a juror asked to have the 404(b) instruction in writing. The court refused to do so at that point in the trial, but gave the jury a summarized version of the foregoing instruction. After the State introduced the last of the 404(b) evidence, Judge Chaiet again gave the 404(b) instruction in its entirety. This instruction essentially repeated the guidance given the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The court gave the last 404(b) instruction during the final jury charge. The court described the 404(b) evidence as coming from several \u201cwitnesses who testified about other contacts they had with defendant which do not concern any of the charges in the indictment. These contacts occurred in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002.\u201d The court explained the \u201ccontacts fell into two categories.\u201d The first included undercover officers \u201cposing as a child who either contacted or were contacted by the defendant on the Internet and by telephone who were then engaged by him in sexual discussion.\u201d The second category included \u201ca young woman who alleges she met the defendant online and subsequently had sexual intercourse with him in a motel in Northern New Jersey shortly after she \u25a1turned 16 years of age.\u201d The court then explained that the State claimed this evidence \u201cdemonstrates his state of mind, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>intent as to the charges against him.\u201d But, the court emphasized that \u201c[bjefore you can give any weight to this evidence, you must be satisfied that the defendant committed these other acts. If you are not so satisfied, you may not consider it for any purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The charge then tracked the Model Charge, emphasizing that these other acts may not prove that defendant was \u201ca bad person or that he had a general purpose to commit a crime or engage in the particular type of criminal contact alleged.\u201d Judge Chaiet further emphasized that \u201c[i]n other words, this type of evidence could wrongly lead juries to conclude that because a defendant charged with a crime committed another similar act in the past, he also committed the offense or offenses he is charged within the indictment. The law simply does not allow this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The court then utilized the specific claims of both parties and the specific evidence to show the jury how 404(b) evidence must be applied within the actual circumstances of this case. The court told the jury directly that they could use the 404(b) evidence to determine whether \u201cdefendant had an intent to interact with underage children and tends to prove he believed \u2018Krissy\u2019 to be a 14 year old child. On the other hand, you can consider whether the evidence supports defendant\u2019s position that he was role-playing and had no intent to interact with underage children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">The court also told the jury they could use the evidence to determine whether \u201cdefendant knowingly possessed the images and videos in question, rather than came upon them by mistake or accident.\u201d The court concluded by reemphasizing that the jury could not use the evidence to establish that \u201cbecause defendant may have committed these acts in the past, he is a bad person or had a general tendency to commit crimes and therefore committed any of these crimes charged in the indictment. You may only use it for the purpose I have outlined for you.\u201d In short, our review of the 404(b) aspect of the charge leads us to conclude that it was flawless.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">The court followed its 404(b) charge with an instruction on the entrapment defense, and it is this juxtaposition that is somewhat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>troubling. The court began by stating there was an \u201cexception to\u201d the 404(b) instruction. It explained that if the jury found defendant guilty of one or more of \u201cCounts 1,3,4,5,6,7 and 8 of the indictment,\u201d the Krissy charges, \u201cthe defense asks you to consider the affirmative defense of entrapment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The court told the jury that in considering the entrapment defense, the jury \u201cmay consider the evidence produced by the undercover officers and [V.P.] ... on the issue of whether the defendant had a predisposition to commit the crimes and thus was not entrapped.\u201d The court explained that \u201cthe law does not authorize a law enforcement officer to trap another person or by inducing or encouraging him to commit an offense and then as a direct result of that inducement or encouragement, cause that other person to commit an offense.\u201d In further explanation, the court stated that \u201cdefendant must prove that the police conduct, in fact, caused him to commit the crime. In other words, that the crime was a direct result of the police action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The judge emphasized that if the jury found that the State had proven the elements of one or all of the Krissy charges beyond a reasonable doubt, then the jury must consider defendant\u2019s entrapment defense on any counts they have found defendant guilty. For this purpose, the jury could consider whether the 404(b) \u201cevidence along with other facts and circumstances, [that] shows a predisposition on the part of the defendant to commit the of-fense____If [the jury finds] the defendant had been predisposed to commit the offense even without the law enforcement officer\u2019s participation or inducement, then a defendant\u2019s participation was not the direct result of the officer\u2019s activity and the defense of entrapment hadn\u2019t been proven and is unavailable to [defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">We are concerned with the jury\u2019s ability to abide by the two conflicting uses for the 404(b) evidence in light of the entrapment defense. <em>See </em>Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 16 on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404 (2006). The other-crimes or bad-acts evidence is not admissible to show predisposition to commit the crime charged. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b). There is an exception, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>when defendant raises an entrapment defense, which requires proof that his criminal conduct was caused by police conduct and not by his own mental state. <em>State v. Gibbons, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>67, 76, 519 A.2d 350 (1987). When a defendant seeks to establish entrapment, the State may rebut that proof with evidence of predisposition, of which similar bad-acts are probative. <em>Id. </em>at 74, 519 A.2d 350. Normally, in such cases, a defendant raises entrapment through cross-examining the State\u2019s law enforcement personnel, or by offering direct evidence of his own. <em>Id. </em>at 74-77, 519 A.2d 350. When that occurs, the state\u2019s 404(b) evidence is presented in rebuttal and not in its case-in-chief. <em>State v. White, </em>86 <em>N.J.Super. </em>410, 421, 207 A.2d 178 (App.Div.1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Here, the 404(b) evidence was presented in the State\u2019s case-in-chief, for two reasons. First, it was relevant to defendant\u2019s general defense that he lacked criminal intent for all of the charges. Second, defendant had indicated prior to trial that entrapment would be pursued, though the issue was not clearly raised in the opening statement. <em>R. </em>3:10-2(c), <em>R. </em>3:12-1. We have previously found no error in presenting 404(b) evidence in the State\u2019s case-in-chief when the \u201cdefense of entrapment had been raised in defendant\u2019s opening.\u201d <em>White, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 421, 207 A.2d 178. In addition, our Supreme Court, in dicta, has noted that a defendant\u2019s opening statement may be sufficient to place entrapment in issue, even before defendant had presented proofs on the issue. <em>State v. Dolce, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>422, 434, 197 A.2d 185 (1964). Because the 404(b) evidence was relevant to the general defense and defendant indicated before trial that an entrapment defense would be pursued, we cannot fault the prosecutor for presenting the 404(b) evidence in the State\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Although we cannot fault the timing of the 404(b) evidence under the circumstances of this case, we believe the better practice, to ensure proper application of the 404(b) evidence, would have been accomplished through a sequential trial with the same jury. <em>See, e.g., State v. Ragland, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>189, 194, 519 A.2d 1361 (1986) (finding same jury should have decided possession of weap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>on by a convicted felon in a new trial after the jury found the defendant guilty of unlawful possession); <em>State v. Ingenito, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>204, 217, 432 A.2d 912 (1981) (reaching the same conclusion but requiring a different jury on the second issue). If a sequential trial were utilized, the same jury would have first been instructed solely on the 404(b) evidence and its proper use in determining whether the State proved its case against defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. If there was a conviction, then the entrapment defense would be separately instructed and considered by the same jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In this case, however, defendant did not object to the charging of both entrapment and other-crimes or bad-acts before the same jury. Thus, we may reverse only if we find plain error. <em>State v. R.B., </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>308, 321, 873 A.2d 511 (2005). Here, the charges were clear and accurate, and we generally must assume that the jury followed such a charge. <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>23, 52, 678 A.2d 164 (1996); <em>State v. Manley, 54 N.J. </em>259, 270, 255 A.2d 193 (1969). The court not only correctly stated the law, but it adequately explained that the jury could only consider the 404(b) evidence as proof of defendant\u2019s predisposition if it first found that defendant met his burden of showing that the State employed improper tactics to induce him to commit the crimes. In addition, the court clearly limited the jury\u2019s use of the \u201cexception\u201d permitting the consideration of the evidence as predisposition, only if the jury convicted defendant of the Krissy charges. The court precisely and clearly limited the use of the 404(b) evidence on the main charges to considering defendant\u2019s intent or motive. Thus, the jury knew that to convict defendant it could not use the 404(b) evidence as proof that defendant acted in conformity with his prior conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Furthermore, there was no indication by any subsequent questions from the jury that there was any confusion about this part of the ease. In addition, unlike the situation in <em>Chenique-Puey, supra, 145 N.J. </em>at 343, 678 A.2d 694, where evidence inadmissible against one of the conjoined charges was presented to the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>here the 404(b) evidence was admissible to establish defendant\u2019s intent as well as his predisposition under the entrapment defense. <em>But see State v. Lozada, </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>468, 472-73, 815 A.2d 1002 (App.Div.2003)(requiring sequential trials even though the challenged evidence was admissible against both conjoined charges). Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the instructions on 404(b) and entrapment were sufficiently clear and complementary to withstand defendant\u2019s challenge on appeal. <em>See State v. LaBrutto, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>187, 203-04, 553 A.2d 335 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Consequently, while better practice might have utilized sequential trials and eliminated any possibility of misuse of the evidence, we cannot say that the failure to try the case sequentially was \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2. We cannot conclude that the possibility of the misuse of the evidence was \u201csufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the error led the jury to a result it might otherwise not have reached.\u201d <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 336, 273 A.2d 1 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Accordingly, we find each of defendant\u2019s arguments wanting and affirm his conviction and sentence. To the extent we have not specifically discussed any of defendant\u2019s numerous arguments, we emphasize that they have nevertheless been carefully considered and rejected upon our review of the argument in light of the record and pertinent law.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
