We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">On January 22, 2006, J.R. was initially admitted to Ancora. On February 3, 2006, J.R. was conditionally released and remained on conditional release (CR) until his readmission to Ancora on March 24,2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">At the re-commitment hearing held on March 31, 2006, the only witness called by the State was Dr. M. Rozmyslowicz, J.R.\u2019s treating psychiatrist. Dr. Rozmyslowicz\u2019s report dated March 28, 2006 was also admitted into evidence by stipulation. The report states: \u201c[J.R.] returned from CR [because he] did not take his medications [and] decompensated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">The doctor testified that she made an Axis 1 diagnosis of J.R. of \u201cbi-polar disorder. Most recent episode mixed and for substance dependent.\u201d When Dr. Rozmyslowicz was asked her recommendation for further hospitalization and treatment, the doctor testified that \u201con Monday, I felt that it\u2019s too early to put [J.R.] on CEPP (Conditional Extension Pending Placement) status.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> So I would like to ask the court to have more days.\u201d However, when asked if J.R. were released into the community, whether J.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>would \u201cpresent a danger to himself or others,\u201d Dr. Rozmyslowicz replied: \u201cThe only danger that [J.R.] <em>may </em>present is that he may stop taking his medication as happened last time.\u201d (emphasis added). When asked the basis for her opinion that \u201c[J.R.] might present a danger to others,\u201d the doctor stated: \u201cActually, Monday, when I examined that patient, I knew that over the weekend before, the patient was verbally assaultive to the staff and he presented with careless smoking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In response to the judge\u2019s questioning as to what kind of conduct or symptoms [J.R.] exhibited as a result of his failure to take his medication, which precipitated J.R.\u2019s readmission to An-cora, the doctor responded: \u201cPatient\u2019s manic symptoms exacerbated. He was aggressive verbally.\u201d However, the doctor stated that she did not know of any incidents during J.R.\u2019s release, between February 3 and March 24, 2006, where he assaulted anyone in the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The judge then conducted most of the remainder of the hearing. The judge directed the doctor to the screening documents that supported J.R.\u2019s rehospitalization. The records had not been admitted into evidence and were never placed in evidence during the remainder of the hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge referred the doctor to references in the documents that indicated J.R. \u201cwasn\u2019t taking his medications, he decompensated and became aggressive.\u201d However, Dr. Rozmyslowicz testified that J.R. had not been aggressive toward anyone at the hospital in the last four days and that his condition had improved. He remained on level one observation because of his cigarette smoking and because of intrusive behavior. The doctor added: \u201cBut this behavior is drastically reduced right now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">On cross-examination, the doctor opined that if J.R. continued on his medications, he would be able to be satisfactorily dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>charged into the community. She reiterated that she had no indication that J.R. had acted to harm himself or others.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The judge then asked J.R. if there was anything he wanted to tell him. J.R. told the judge that he understood the need for him to take prescribed medications, but that he had ran out of medication because he had only been given a month\u2019s supply. The judge challenged J.R.\u2019s assertion by referencing the screening documents, which the judge suggested indicated J.R. told the screener that he did not feel he needed medication. J.R. explained to the judge that he now had the ability to maintain his medication regimen. J.R. stated: \u201cThe stuff they got me on now, I\u2019m pretty stable and happy with it and I can continue with Ocean Mental Health 12 hours a week. You know, you sit, you eat dinner there, you\u2019ve got groups, classes[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">J.R.\u2019s counsel next called S.W., J.R.\u2019s girlfriend, as a witness. S.W. testified that she had daily contact with J.R., was aware of his psychiatric needs, and that she and he had discovered, with the aid of his social worker, alternative sources for obtaining J.R.\u2019s medication to enable him to maintain his supply. One of those sources was Ocean County Mental Health. She testified that J.R. had not acted out to harm himself or others. S.W. confirmed that she drove J.R. to his daily activities, which included going to see his probation officer, going to his programs in the evening, and going to church. S.W. testified that J.R. took his medications until they ran out, something she claimed both his probation officer and social worker also knew.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">S.W. informed the judge that the symptoms J.R. displayed when he ran out of his medications were that he became tired and la2y, and did not want to shower. She also said that he becomes manic, \u201che just [concentrates] on [the] same thought over and over again. He\u2019s never harmful to society or harmful to himself, ever. You know, he\u2019s never done anything ill-fated, ever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">S.W. testified that the reason she brought J.R. to the Kimball Medical Center about a month after he was released from Ancora was because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>He wasn\u2019t feeling well. He said to me, I\u2019m not feeling well, my medications have run out, I need assistance. And, that is why we went back to the PAD center, not because of any altercation within the community or with any individuals or anything, he simply ran out of medicine. And, although I don\u2019t live with him, I have to tell you that I watch him take his medicine. He was taking it religiously.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The judge, without providing counsel with the opportunity for closing arguments, rendered his commitment decision. The judge read from the screening documents and recited the narrative allegations in the documents as background to J.R.\u2019s rehospitalization. The judge then made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">We have had the testimony of Dr. Rozmyslowicz, who I accept her opinion that [J.R.] suffers from bi-polar disorder. He, since returning here on March 24th, has been disruptive. He seems to not be able to follow the rules and directions of the institution. As a result, he has been placed on level one. He is currently on precautions for assault and for violating other conditions. And, this conduct is troubling to me in the fact that [J.R.] in the past was released with conditions that he would take his medication and he decompensated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">And, we have two different versions of why he decompensated. I find that the credible version and the clear and convincing facts convince me that the reason that [J.R.] returned here was due to his own voluntary cessation of taking medication. I conclude that based on his conduct since he\u2019s been here, which has not been in compliance with directions of the staff and the doctors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">I\u2019m encouraged by the fact that [J.R.] has not had any incidents in the last four days. I\u2019m encouraged by the fact that he\u2019s taking his medication and seems very good here today. I, however, am satisfied by clear and convincing evidence that as of today, March 31st, patient suffers from mental illness and does remain a danger to himself and to others based on the fact that I don\u2019t believe he\u2019ll take his medication, will rapidly decompensate and will be right back here as we\u2019ve already seen by the facts that led to his return from the conditional release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">I do find that he\u2019s not only dangerous to himself but to others. I find both are as the result of his non-compliance issues when he is released as he has demonstrated by his non-compliance on the conditional release earlier this year. And, if he does not take his medication as [S.W.] indicated, he becomes very agitated, he becomes very manic and we have seen assaultive behavior. And, that can lead to someone responding to him and assaulting him also. So that\u2019s why I conclude that he is both dangerous to himself and to others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">J.R. presents the following arguments for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-11\">\n<em>POINT i.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-12\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING J.R. WOULD BE DANGEROUS IN RELIANCE ON HEARSAY EVIDENCE AND ITS OWN SPECULATION, CONTRADICTED BY THE COMPETENT EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT THE HEARING.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\n<em>POINT II.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">J.R.\u2019S APPEAL IS NOT MOOT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">\n<em>POINT III.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ITS AGGRESSIVE EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES AND IN SOLICITING AND RELYING ON HEARSAY ASSERTIONS TO SUPPORT ITS CONCLUSION; THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY CARRIED THE CASE FOR COMMITMENT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">The civil commitment procedure is governed by New Jersey\u2019s screening and commitment statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27. For a court to order involuntary commitment, the court must find by clear and convincing evidence that a patient is \u201cin need of continued involuntary commitment----\u201d <em>R. </em>4:74-7(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">The Legislature has defined the following terms for purposes of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-12\">\u201cIn need of involuntary commitment\u201d means that an adult with mental illness, whose mental illness causes the person to be dangerous to self or dangerous to others or property and who is unwilling to be admitted to a facility voluntarily for care, and who needs care at a short-term care, psychiatric facility or special psychiatric hospital because other services are not appropriate or available to meet the person\u2019s mental health care needs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-13\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.2m.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-14\">\u201cDangerous to self\u2019 means that by reason of mental illness the person has threatened or attempted suicide or serious bodily harm, or has behaved in such a manner as to indicate that the person is unable to satisfy his need for nourishment, essential medical care or shelter, so that it is probable that substantial bodily injury, serious physical debilitation or death will result within the reasonably foreseeable future; however, no person shall be deemed to be unable to satisfy his need for nourishment, essential medical care or shelter if he is able to satisfy such needs with the supervision and assistance of others who are willing and available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZz\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.2h.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-15\">\u201cDangerous to others or property\u201d means that by reason of mental illness there is a substantial likelihood that the person will inflict serious bodily harm upon another person or cause serious property damage within the reasonably foreseeable future. This determination shall take into account a person\u2019s history, recent behavior and any recent act or threat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-16\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>30:4 \u2014 27.2i]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-17\">The State bears the burden of proving the grounds for commitment by clear and convincing evidence. <em>In re Commit-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number><em>merit of Raymond S., </em>263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>428, 431, 623 A.2d 249 (App.Div.1993); N.J.S.A. 30:4-27.12. \u201cThe burden should not be placed on the civilly committed patient to justify his right to liberty.\u201d <em>State v. Fields, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>282, 300, 390 A.2d 574 (1978) (quoting <em>Fasulo v. Arafeh, </em>173 <em>Conn. </em>473, 378 A.2d 553, 557 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">To justify an involuntary commitment, it is necessary to show more than the potential for dangerous conduct. <em>In re Commitment of R.B., </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>542, 547, 386 A.2d 893 (App.Div.1978). \u201c[Tjhe risk of dangerousness that will warrant involuntary commitment must be relatively immediate. . . .\u201d <em>In re Commitment of N.N., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>112, 130, 679 A.2d 1174 (1996). There must be, in fact, a \u201csubstantial risk of dangerous conduct within the reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d <em>In re S.L., </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>128, 138, 462 A.2d 1252 (1983) (quoting <em>State v. Krol, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>236, 260, 344 A.2d 289 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">This court has not hesitated to reverse involuntary commitments where the record failed to contain clear and convincing evidence of a substantial risk of dangerous conduct within the reasonably foreseeable future. <em>See Raymond S., supra, </em>263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 433-34, 623 A.2d 249 (finding insufficient evidence to support commitment despite testimony that patient was hallucinating, psychotic and depressed upon admission); <em>R.B., supra, </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 547, 386 A.2d 893 (holding evidence of mood swings alone insufficient to support conclusion that patient was dangerous to self); <em>In re Heukelekian, </em>24 <em>N.J.Super. </em>407, 411, 94 A.2d 501 (App.Div.1953) (holding commitment not warranted despite testimony that patient was disoriented and seemed to live in her own fantasy world).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">The judge\u2019s finding of dangerousness was based essentially on the judge\u2019s belief that if J.R. fails to take his medication, he can become agitated and manic \u201cand we have seen assaultive behavior.\u201d The judge stated that J.R.\u2019s behavior could lead to someone assaulting him, which could cause him to be dangerous to himself as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Although it is recognized that on appeal deference is given to the findings of the trial court, \u201ca reviewing court must consider the adequacy of the evidence. To be adequate, the evidence must be competent.\u201d <em>In re Commitment of M.M., </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>313, 334, 894 A.2d 1158 (App.Div.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">We are convinced that the evidence presented in J.R.\u2019s recommitment hearing was clearly inadequate to satisfy the State\u2019s burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that J.R. at the date of the March 31, 2006 hearing was dangerous to himself, others or property by reason of mental illness. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.15a; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.2m; <em>R. </em>4:74-7(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The only witness called by the State was Dr. Rozmyslowicz. Dr. Rozmyslowicz\u2019s testimony clearly does not support the court\u2019s finding of dangerousness. When questioned regarding the danger that could ensue should J.R. be released, Dr. Rozmyslowicz responded: \u201cThe only danger [J.R.] may present is that he may stop taking his medications ... [and] his mental status [may] exacerbate and he may return to the hospital.\u201d In her commitment report of May 28, 2006, the doctor indicated that J.R. was potentially dangerous to others because he had been \u201cverbally aggressive toward staff\u2019 in the past and had engaged in \u201ccareless smoking.\u201d However, the doctor offered no explanation as to how the general description of J.R. as \u201cmanic,\u201d \u201cvery agitated,\u201d \u201cverbally aggressive or assertive,\u201d or \u201ccareless smoking\u201d evidenced themselves so as to cause J.R. to pose a danger to himself, others, or property.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">While the language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.2i requires the infliction of \u201cserious bodily harm\u201d to either oneself or others, New Jersey does recognize the possibility that psychological harm, e.g., from a \u201cverbal assault,\u201d may suffice. In <em>In re Commitment </em>of A.A., 252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>170, 179, 599 A.2d 573 (App.Div.1991), this court held that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.2i could be satisfied if the \u201csubstantial likelihood of psychological harm to others [was] so severe as to inflict \u2018serious bodily harm upon another person.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>In this case, there was no evidence presented regarding the nature of the abusive statements made by J.R. to the staff, the context in which they were made, or even the demeanor and tone used by J.R. to convey these sentiments. Simply characterizing his statements as \u201caggressive\u201d is insufficient to satisfy the requirement of clear and convincing evidence of \u201cthe substantial likelihood of psychological harm to others so severe as to inflict \u2018serious bodily harm upon another person\u2019 within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.2i.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Similarly, there is no evidence presented regarding the nature of Dr. Rozmyslowicz\u2019s \u201ccareless smoking\u201d allegation to support the trial court\u2019s finding of dangerousness. Nothing in the record indicates whether \u201ccareless smoking\u201d referred to a relatively minor infraction, such as smoking after hospital curfew, or a more serious danger, such as lighting a cigarette next to an oxygen reserve.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Moreover, even if there were evidence to show J.R.\u2019s statements were sufficiently harmful to satisfy the \u201cserious bodily harm\u201d requirement, there was nevertheless insufficient evidence presented at the hearing to show there was a substantial likelihood the harm would recur. In <em>In re Commitment of W.H., </em>the State\u2019s expert testified that the likelihood the patient could pose a danger to himself or others was a possibility, but could not state that it was a probability. 324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>519, 522, 736 A.2d 529 (App. Div.1999). The court found the expert\u2019s testimony insufficient to constitute clear and convincing evidence of a \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d of future harm. <em>Id. </em>at 523, 736 A.2d 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Dr. Rozmyslowicz\u2019s testimony that there is a possibility J.R. may stop taking his medication is insufficient to constitute clear and convincing evidence of a substantial likelihood of future harm necessary for involuntary confinement. <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, there was substantial evidence presented by J.R. showing the failure to take his medication was unlikely to recur. Corroborating J.R.\u2019s own testimony, S.W. testified at length to the steps both she and J.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>have taken to ensure J.R. will not run out of medication in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\u201cThe civil commitment process must be narrowly circumscribed because of the extraordinary degree of state control it exerts over a citizen\u2019s autonomy.\u201d <em>S.L., supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 139, 462 A.2d 1252. Because commitment effects a serious deprivation of liberty, citizens are entitled to \u201cthe meticulous protection of both procedural and substantive due process.\u201d <em>R.B., supra, </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 547, 386 A.2d 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">After a thorough review of the hearing record, we are convinced that the State has failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that J.R. presented a danger to himself or others or property as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.15a, thereby requiring a reversal of the order of commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">[At the direction of the court, Points II and III have been omitted from the published version of the opinion.]</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-13\"> The hearing was held on Friday, March 31, 2006.
