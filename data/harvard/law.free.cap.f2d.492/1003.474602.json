On May 4, 1972, former Governor Ogilvie appointed plaintiff to a term expiring on February 1, 1978. In January 1973, plaintiff refused to resign his part-time position as requested by representatives of Governor Walker. On February 1, 1973, Governor Walker sent the following letter to plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-7\">\u201cPursuant to the constitutional powers vested in me as Governor of the State of Illinois, I hereby remove you, for cause and effective immediately, from your position as a member and as Chairman of the Illinois Liquor Control Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-8\">On the same date, Governor Walker sent plaintiff the following telegram:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATW\">I hereby remove you, effective immediately, from your position as a member and as chairman of the Illinois Liquor Control Commission for incompetence, neglect of duty and malfeasance in office and other cause pursuant to the constitutional and statutory powers vested in me as Governor of the State of Illinois.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-9\">On February 2, 1973, Governor Walker appointed Elroy Sandquist, Jr., to succeed plaintiff as a member of the Commission and subsequently designated Lawrence E. Johnson as its chairman. In March 1973, plaintiff filed this action against Governor Walker, seeking reinstatement as a member and chairman of the Commission. Plaintiff also sought damages allegedly incurred as a result of his dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-11\">On April 2, 1973, the district court entered a temporary restraining order in plaintiff\u2019s favor and five weeks thereafter <em>sua sponte </em>issued a preliminary injunction. On May 31, 1973, the district court entered an order requiring defendant to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for disobeying the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. On the following day, defendant appealed from the issuance of the preliminary injunction. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-13\">Article V, Section 10, of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, S.H.A. provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-14\">\u201cThe Governor may remove for incompetence, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office any officer who may be appointed by the Governor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8qr\">A virtually identical provision in the 1870 State Constitution was construed by the Illinois Supreme Court as making \u201cpower of removal from office by the Governor co-extensive with his power of appointment.\u201d Wilcox v. The People ex rel. Lipe, 90 Ill. 186, 198 (1878).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court expressly rejected the argument that notice and hearing were required, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-15\">\u201cUndoubtedly, the Governor can only remove for some one of the causes specified; but the removal here was for one of these causes \u2014 incompetency. The Governor ascertained the existence of the cause here, and made the removal on account of it. The constitution is silent as to who shall ascertain the cause of removal or the mode of its ascertainment. It simply gives to the Governor the power to remove any officer whom he may appoint, in case of incompetence, etc. It follows, then, that it is with the Governor, who is to act in the matter, to determine, himself, whether the cause of removal exists, from the best lights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>he can get, and no mode of inquiry being prescribed for him to pursue, it rests with him to adopt that method of inquiry and ascertainment as to the charge involved which his judgment may suggest as the proper one, acting under his official responsibility, and it is not for the courts to dictate to him in what manner he shall proceed in the performance of his duty, his action not being subject to their revision. The constitution of this State not only declares that the powers of the government of the state shall be divided into three distinct departments, but has expressly prohibited the exercise of any of the powers properly belonging to one by either of the others.\u201d 90 Ill. at 204-205.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s argument for an alternative interpretation of the Illinois constitutional provision is essentially that the Illinois Supreme Court did not mean what it said. That court said in <em>Wilcox, </em>\u201cWe think the intention [of the 1870 Convention] was to adopt the rule which had become established under the Constitution of the United States with respect to appointments made by the President, * * * namely\u201d the rule quoted above. Plaintiff contends that the true meaning of <em>Wilcox </em>is that Illinois will follow the federal rule, whatever it may be, and that the Illinois Supreme Court misunderstood the federal rule because it subsequently did not cite Shurtleff v. United States, 189 U.S. 311, 23 S.Ct. 535, 47 L.Ed. 828 (1903).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Of course, the 1870 Convention could not possibly have intended to adopt the rule of a 1903 decision. More fundamentally, the federal rule announced in <em>Shurtleff </em>was that in the absence of a contrary constitutional or statutory provision, \u201cthe President can, by virtue of his general power of appointment remove an officer, even though appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\u201d 189 U.S. at 314-315, 23 S.Ct. at 536. This rule was held to be so well established that a statutory provision specifying grounds for removal did not by implication forbid the President to remove on other grounds. Instead the President retained an \u201cunlimited power of removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317, 23 S.Ct. 535. Undoubtedly this was the federal rule cited by the Illinois court in <em>Wilcox. </em>The <em>Shurtleff </em>language relied on by plaintiff construed the Customs Administrative Act of 1890 as requiring notice and hearing if the President announced that he was removing appraisers for one of the grounds specified in the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 314, 23 S.Ct. 535. There is no indication that this construction was constitutionally compelled. Rather, the Court said that without a requirement of notice and hearing the statutory specification of grounds for removal would \u201cfulfill no function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317, 23 S.Ct. 535. As already noted, in <em>Wilcox </em>the Illinois Supreme Court has held squarely to the contrary in construing the Illinois Constitution, and its construction is binding on us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-8\"><em>Wilcox </em>construed the removal provision of the 1870 Constitution, but it also controls the meaning of the corresponding provision of the 1970 Constitution. The two Sections are nearly identical, and it is clear that the 1970 Convention intended no change in meaning. The entire committee report on this Section read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-9\">\u201cThe only alteration made as this section is carried forward from its existing counterpart is the deletion of clearly superfluous language.\u201d VI Rec. of Proceedings 6th Ill.Const.Conv. 387 (hereafter cited - Rec. -)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1069-12\">(Executive Comm. Proposal 1, p. 51). During debate at first reading on the floor of the 1970 Convention, the meaning of the Section was explained by reference to earlier Illinois Supreme Court decisions. III Rec. 1324-1327 (Verbatim Transcript). The Section as passed at first reading was amended without explanation by the Committee on Style, Drafting and Submission, VI Rec. 432 (Style, etc. Comm. Proposal 6, p. 18). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>That Committee\u2019s report indicated that some changes were submitted without explanation because the reasons were \u201cself-evident\u201d (VI Rec. 415 (Style, etc. Comm. Proposal 6, p. 1)), and it is clear that the changes were purely stylistic. The Section as proposed by the Committee on Style was adopted without further debate (V Rec. 4753 (Index to Verbatim Transcript)) and is the Section before us. See also VII Rec. 2709 (Official Text With Explanation, p. 29).</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\"> Whether plaintiff has a right to a due process hearing before he can be dismissed is a matter of federal law. He has such a right if his dismissal infringes his liberty, or if, as a matter of state law, he has a property interest in the job. Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548; Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570. The rule that plaintiff has no right to a hearing under state law is persuasive on the issue whether he has a property interest, but it cannot be conclusive. <em>Wilcox </em>was decided long before <em>Roth </em>and <em>Sindermann </em>and did not decide any question of property rights. Thus the law of Illinois could conceivably be that plaintiff has a property interest but no right to a hearing to protect that interest. Cf. Shirck v. Thomas, 486 F.2d 691, 692 (7th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">Plaintiff argues that since he was appointed for a six-year term, he has a property right to hold the job for six years. He relies on Ill.Rev.Stats. ch. 43, \u00a7 98, which provides that liquor commissioners shall be appointed for periods of six years, and on a letter from then Governor Ogilvie appointing him, subject to Senate confirmation, \u201cfor a term expiring February 1, 1978.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s commission makes no reference to a six-year term, but instead says that he is \u201cTo have and to hold the said office, with all the rights and emoluments thereto legally pertaining, until his successor shall be duly appointed and qualified to office.\u201d \u201cA term of employment set by contract has been recognized as a property interest which the state cannot extinguish without conforming to the dictates of procedural due process.\u201d Hostrop v. Board of Junior College District No. 515, 471 F.2d 488, 494 (7th Cir. 1972). The issue is whether the statute and letter referred to give rise to an implied contract for a six-year term, or to a \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement\u201d to such a term. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701. As we understand Illinois law, they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-8\">First, the provision for six-year terms must be read in light of the constitutional removal provision. It is reasonable to assume that had the legislature intended its provision for six-year terms to confer vested property rights on the office holder, it would have included specific language attempting to limit the Governor\u2019s power to remove without notice, hearing or right of review. This is particularly true since it is not at all clear that the legislature can, by statute, modify the constitutional removal provision, and the Illinois courts would construe an ambiguous statute so as to avoid constitutional doubt. Craig v. Peterson, 39 Ill.2d 191, 233 N.E.2d 345, 351 (1968). Second, although the legislature has enacted an elaborate Personnel Code giving civil service protection to many state employees (Ill.Rev.Stats. ch. 127, \u00a7 63b101 et seq. (1971)), it has specifically exempted \u201cmembers of boards and commissions, and all other positions appointed by the Governor by and with the consent of the Senate.\u201d \u00a7 63b104c(7). Third, there is no allegation that plaintiff was unfamiliar with the Governor\u2019s removal power. Freedom from gubernatorial removal could not have been a claim upon which plaintiff relied in his daily life, so that there was no \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement\u201d to a full term. See <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S., at 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-9\">Fourth, the trial court\u2019s finding that the Illinois Senate would probably confirm plaintiff\u2019s successor is not consistent with a legislative intent to create a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>property right not subject to the Governor\u2019s removal power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\">Fifth, members of the Illinois Liquor Control Commission have substantial quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial responsibilities; in a very real sense they are vested with part of the sovereignty of the state. See Ill.Rev.Stats., ch. 43, \u00a7 97 et seq. The statute provides for only three liquor control commissioners. \u00a7 97. Unlike teachers and junior college presidents, they have no supervisors to guide their work; subject only to judicial review or statutory amendment, these three commissioners hold ultimate regulatory authority over the liquor industry in Illinois. The Commission\u2019s powers and duties include the power to hold hearings to determine whether liquor licensees have violated the law and to suspend or revoke the licenses of those found guilty. \u00a7 108(1). The Commission has rule-making authority (\u00a7 108 (2)), which has been used to adopt substantive regulations. See Shoot v. Illinois Liquor Control Comm., 30 Ill.2d 570, 198 N.E.2d 497 (1964). In short, these commissioners do not merely implement policies formulated with reasonable specificity by others; they formulate the policy of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">While a state might give an individual property rights in such a sensitive position, it would be unusual if it did so. Even in the First Amendment area, we have recognized that political philosophy or affiliation may be relevant to the selection of policy-making officials. State Employees Council 34 v. Lewis, 473 F.2d 561, 574 (7th Cir. 1972); see also Gould v. Walker, 356 F.Supp. 421 (N.D.Ill.1973); cf. Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 570, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811. While the parameters of this exception to the normal protection given public employees have not been fully defined, and even though it would seem to be a small category (cf. Hostrop v. Board of Junior College Dist. No. 515, 471 F.2d 488 (7th Cir. 1972)), the considerations which justify the exception are certainly relevant here. Ultimate policy-making authority in Illinois is retained by the people. Before we could determine that an individual had been ceded a property right in a policy-making position, we would expect a clear statement by the legislature or the Illinois courts. For example, Section 98 might have included a sentence along the following lines: \u201cNo commissioner shall be removed from office before the expiration of his term, except on a finding of [list of grounds for removal] after due notice and hearing.\u201d The six-year term provisions relied on by plaintiff are not such clear statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-8\">This conclusion does not render the six-year term meaningless. The legislature could have provided six-year staggered terms so that subject only to the Governor\u2019s removal power, there would always be experienced members on the Commission. Further, the limitation to six-year terms requires that the Governor periodically review the performance of each commissioner and determine whether to reappoint or replace him. It is not necessary in this case to determine exactly what the legislators had in mind. It is sufficient to conclude that they did not intend to create a property right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-10\">Nor did the dismissal infringe any liberty interest. The use of the talismanic phrase \u201cincompetence, neglect of duty, and malfeasance in office\u201d in effecting plaintiff\u2019s discharge was plainly to satisfy the state constitutional provision and did not take liberty without due process of law. General characterizations of behavior must be read in context. In Jeffries v. Turkey Run Consolidated School District, 492 F.2d 1 (7th Cir. 1974), plaintiff was charged with \u201chighly unethical conduct.\u201d But the specification of that charge made clear that the School Board meant only that plaintiff had \u201copenly contradict [ed] the directives given to students\u201d by another teacher. We held that this statement did not deprive the plaintiff of liberty. Opinion at p. 2, n. 1. Similarly here, given the Governor\u2019s absolute dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>cretion to dismiss his appointees, coupled with the requirement that he invoke the constitutional language, his statement means nothing more than if he had said, \u201cI am dismissing you because I think I can find a better liquor commissioner.\u201d Proof that \u201cnonretention in one job, taken alone, might make him somewhat less attractive to some other employees would hardly establish the kind of foreclosure of opportunities amounting to a deprivation of \u2018liberty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 574, n. 13, 92 S.Ct. 2708.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">A careful reading of the passage in <em>Roth </em>under which plaintiff has attempted to plead a deprivation of liberty makes clear that the Court contemplated one of two quite different situations. The opinion suggests two distinct liberty interests which might be involved in a dismissal situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">First, the Court said that notice and hearing are essential \u201cwhere a person\u2019s good name, reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake\u201d (408 U.S. at 573, 92 S.Ct. at 2707). The examples mentioned by the Court are charges of dishonesty and immorality. The cases cited involve charges of alcoholism (Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433, 91 S.Ct. 507, 27 L.Ed.2d 515); disloyalty (Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183, 73 S.Ct. 215, 97 L.Ed. 216; Peters v. Hobby, 349 U.S. 331, 75 S.Ct. 790, 99 L.Ed. 1129); Communism (Joint Anti-Facist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 71 S.Ct. 624, 95 L.Ed. 817) and subversive activities (United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303, 66 S.Ct. 1073, 90 L.Ed. 1252). The Court concludes with a reference to Cafeteria Workers Local 473 v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230, where it was held that requiring surrender of an identification badge giving access to a Naval gun factory did not imply a charge of disloyalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">In the next paragraph, the Court said a hearing might also be required if the state imposed on Roth \u201ca stigma or other disability that foreclosed his freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities.\u201d 408 U.S. at 573, 92 S.Ct. at 2707. The use of the word \u201cstigma\u201d is clarified by examination of the cases cited. The Court quotes the statement of Justice Jackson, concurring in Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, that to be deprived \u201cnot only of present government employment but of future opportunity for it certainly is no small injury.\u201d 341 U.S. at 185, 71 S.Ct. at 655. The Court then cites a case striking down a statute limiting the percentage of aliens which any employer could hire. (Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 36 S.Ct. 7, 60 L.Ed. 131), and two cases in which states had denied petitioners admission to the bar, Sehware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U.S. 232, 77 S.Ct. 752, 1 L.Ed.2d 796; Willner v. Committee on Character and Fitness, 373 U.S. 96, 83 S.Ct. 1175, 10 L.Ed.2d 224. This paragraph also concludes with a reference to Cafeteria Workers Local 473 v. McElroy, in which plaintiff had not been precluded from jobs at any other government installation or anywhere in the private economy. 367 U.S. at 898, 81 S.Ct. 1743.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-8\">There is some overlap between these categories, because foreclosure of other opportunities is often accompanied by serious charges. Thus in Suarez v. Weaver, 484 F.2d 678 (7th Cir. 1973), where a doctor was charged with activities which gave rise to an inference that he was violating the narcotics laws, and this information was sent to the state licensing authorities, elements of both liberty interests were at stake, and we found it unnecessary to treat them independently. But in Shirck v. Thomas, 486 F.2d 691 (7th Cir. 1973), and Lipp v. Board of Education, 470 F.2d 802 (7th Cir. 1972), we analyzed these interests separately before concluding that neither was infringed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-9\">We are satisfied that plaintiff has failed to state a claim-under either branch of the <em>Roth </em>liberty test. An unelaborated charge of \u201cincompetence, neglect of duty and malfeasance in office\u201d is of a different order of magnitude than charges of dishonesty, immorality, disloyalty, Communism, subversive activities, alcoholism or narcotics viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>tions. The difference is especially significant in light of the interpretation which the Illinois Supreme Court has placed on those words in the removal provision of the Illinois Constitution. And nothing in the complaint even remotely suggests a legal barrier to future employment analogous to denial of admission to the bar, disqualification from all government employment, the alien limitation statute in Truax v. Raich, <em>supra, </em>or sending substantial adverse information to a professional licensing agency. The complaint does not allege any fear that this dismissal may lead to disbarment. In In re Lynch, 238 S.W.2d 118 (Ky.1951), where an attorney was disbarred for his misconduct as Alcoholic Beverage Administrator, the disbarment was based on a 250-page record showing embezzlement of public funds. Here, it is specifically alleged that there was no specification of \u201ccharges * * * acts, conduct or grounds\u201d supporting the Governor\u2019s invocation of the magic words.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">This case is before us on appeal from a preliminary injunction, and no motion to dismiss appears in the certified record. However, since the complaint fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted, the injunction should not have been entered.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">Reversed and remanded with directions to vacate the May 18, 1973, preliminary injunction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1068-10\">. This rule was reiterated in Ramsay v. VanMeter, 300 Ill. 193, 202, 133 N.E. 193, 196 (1921). Fiedler v. Eckfeldt, 335 Ill. 11, 23-24, 166 N.E. 504, 509 (1929) and People v. Deatherage, 401 Ill. 25, 31, 81 N.E.2d 581, 586 (1948), state in dicta that the Governor\u2019s decision to remove an officer is not subject to judicial review. See generally Braden and Colin, The Illinois Constitution : An Annotated and Comparative Analysis, 285-287 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1069-13\">. See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1073-9\">. The Governor\u2019s contemporaneous press statement that plaintiff was legally required to revoke eight liquor licenses of Western Concessions, Inc. instead of fining it for making political campaign contributions was clearly not libeloiis under New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1073-10\">. Because of our holding that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can he granted, it is unnecessary to decide other issues raised by defendant in this Court. It is also unnecessary to decide whether the rationale of New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686, requires that the right of public figures to a name-clearing hearing be substantially curtailed. Finally, we also leave open the question whether, if plaintiff\u2019s liberty had been infringed, he would be entitled to the relief granted below pending a name-clearing hearing. Cf. Garcia v. Daniel, 490 F.2d 290, at 292-293 (7th Cir. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1073-7\">STEVENS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AvT\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-8\">Since I was a member of the panel which, on June. 27, 1973, declined to vacate Judge Poos\u2019 preliminary injunction, and since, as Judge Pell correctly points out, the rationale of that decision is not consistent with our holding today, candor requires that I explain the change in my views.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-12\">Quite frankly, when the preliminary injunction question was first before us, I did not fully appreciate the impact of the Illinois Supreme Court decisions construing the scope of the Governor\u2019s removal power on the question whether a member of the Liquor Control Commission has a property interest in his job. I therefore incorrectly assumed that the legislative provision for a six-year term gave Adams such a property interest. On that premise, he could not have been removed without due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-13\">The question whether Adams had a property interest in his position as a member of the Liquor Control Commission is, of course, purely a question of Illinois law. It is not for us to appraise the wisdom of the State\u2019s choice between giving such a Commissioner fixed tenure, on the one hand, or making his employment terminable at the unfettered discretion of the Governor, on the other. It is simply our job to identify the choice that Illinois has made, and to respect that decision. As Judge Cummings has demonstrated, as a matter of Illinois law Adams could be removed whenever the Governor saw fit to recite the magic words, \u201cincompetence, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d Adams was therefore not deprived of an interest in property within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>The question whether the Governor has deprived Adams of his \u201cliberty\u201d within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment presents a different issue. I agree with Judge Cummings\u2019 analysis of that issue but would add two brief comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">First, whether a word such as \u201cmalfeasance\u201d creates the kind of stigma that concerned the Court in cases like <em>Constantineau</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>may depend largely upon the context in which the word is used. If, for example, a finding of \u201cmalfeasance\u201d disqualified a law school graduate from admission to practice, or resulted in the forfeiture of a prison inmate\u2019s good time credits, a liberty interest would be impaired. But if the term is used in a context in which important political figures routinely use uncomplimentary language about one another \u2014 a context in which First Amendment interests override a State\u2019s interest in enforcing its own law of defamation \u2014 it would be most anomalous to conclude that the subject of the robust comment has been deprived of an interest which at once is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution but which the First Amendment prohibits the State from protecting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">Second, the fact that a policy decision by the Governor of a sovereign State is involved raises particularly difficult questions about the kind of procedure that would be required if an interest in liberty were impaired. Quite obviously, if the Due Process Clause does require a hearing, the purpose of that hearing and the standards to be applied in testing the Governor\u2019s action must be defined.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> With respect to this kind of gubernatorial action, almost any form of hearing that I can envision either would be meaningless \u2014 nothing more than an opportunity to test the firmness of the Governor\u2019s prior decision \u2014 or else would involve an excessive invasion by the federal judiciary into the making of policy by the State.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These considerations buttress my conviction that Judge Cummings\u2019 analysis is not only sound legally, but also gives appropriate consideration to the respect which one sovereign owes to another in our federal system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-11\">In sum, I agree completely with Judge Cummings\u2019 cogent analysis of the legal issues which are presented, and I concur in his opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1073-15\">. The statutory provision of a six-year term certainly creates the impression that the Commissioner has a property interest in his position. The illusion is dispelled, however, by a federal analogy. The President might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>appoint, with the advice and consent of the \u2022Senate, an Attorney General, to serve for a, period of four years. Such a four-year appointment, however, would not limit in any respect the Executive\u2019s unqualified power to remove a member of his cabinet at will. In effect, as I now understand the Illinois Constitution and statutes, a member of the Liquor Control Commission is comparable to a member of the Executive\u2019s cabinet, and, although appointed for a specific term, is nevertheless removable at will by the Governor. He therefore has no greater \u201cproperty\u201d interest in his job than does the Attorney General of the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">. Wisconsin v.

I cannot agree with the reasoning or result of the majority opinion and therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">As an initial matter it is noted that what we have before us for decision is whether the district court properly granted a preliminary injunction. It is well established that in reviewing a preliminary injunction, the appellate court does not substitute its opinion for the trial court\u2019s decision as to whether the injunction should have been granted. The review is of the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion, not a retrial of the case. United States v. Corrick, 298 U.S. 435, 56 S.Ct. 829, 80 L.Ed. 1263 (1936).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-6\">\u201c[0]ur function in reviewing the entry of a preliminary injunction is a limited one .... The circumstances under which motions for preliminary injunction are made and heard illustrate the reasons for the narrow scope of review. The district judge is typically presented with an abbreviated set of facts, \u2018requiring a delicate balancing of the probabilities of ultimate success at the final hearing with the consequences of immediate irreparable injury which could possibly flow from the denial of preliminary relief\u2019 .... Absent a clear abuse of discretion, the normal course of wisely committing this balancing process to the district judge will not be disturbed.\u201d Scherr v. Volpe, 466 F.2d 1027, 1030 (7th Cir. 1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">The majority opinion, holding that the complaint as a matter of law fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, does not treat the appeal from the point of view of abuse of discretion. Yet, when the present case was before this court on the defendant\u2019s motion for a stay pending appeal, a panel of this court on the basis of the case as then presented unanimously denied the stay because Governor Walker had not made the requisite substantial showing of probable success on his appeal. Adams v. Walker, 488 F.2d 1064 (7th Cir. 1973). We stated there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-10\">\u201cWhile the appellant was entitled under Article 5, \u00a7 10 of the Illinois Constitution to remove the appellee for incompetence, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office, it has not been demonstrated to us thus far in the case of appellee who held his office for a six year term pursuant to Chap. 43, \u00a7 98, Ill.Rev.Stat., that he was not entitled to due process of law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution as a part of the removal. Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 573, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed. 548 (1972). Fiat does not meet the standard and thus far nothing has been demonstrated to us regarding even a pretext of due process. The conclusory language of the discharge telegram merely repeating the wording of the Illinois constitutional provision with the added ambiguous \u2018and other cause\u2019 is certainly not sufficient for due process requirements.\u201d <em>Id., </em>488 F.2d at 1065.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-11\">Notwithstanding the foregoing, we disclaimed expressing any opinion on the ultimate merits of the appeal. I turn then to those merits as presented on full briefing and oral argument and as discussed in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-12\">I deem it unnecessary to spend much attention on Wilcox v. People ex rel. Lipe, 90 Ill. 186 (1878), and its progeny as a complete bar to plaintiff\u2019s action since the majority opinion appears to concede that whether the plaintiff has a right to a due process hearing before he can be dismissed is a matter of federal law and that he does have such a right if his dismissal infringed his liberty, or if, as a matter of state law, he has a property interest in the job, citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed. 548 (1972), and Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">In my opinion, there was such a substantial infringement of liberty here without a vestige of due process that we need look no further than this prong to affirm the grant of a preliminary injunction. Nevertheless, because it also appears to me that Adams did have a property interest in his position, I will advert to that aspect of the case also.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">The only significant obstacle to the appellee\u2019s claim of a property right lies in the <em>Wilcox </em>line of cases, which the appellant in effect contends establishes a virtual gubernatorial velleity for removing appointed officials. I read something other than constitutional approval of whim as a basis for removal in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">First of all, if we treat the Illinois cases as establishing that the power of removal is co-\u00e9xtensive with the power of appointment, the appointment power under the statute was not at will but for a specified period of six years. A power of removal at will would not be co-extensive with the power to appoint for a six year term but would seem to be a substantially greater power. On the other hand, if the controlling statute had been in terms of an appointment without specifying the term of the office, removal at will would appear to equate with or be co-extensive with the power of appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">Secondly, the <em>Wilcox </em>court recognized that \u201c [undoubtedly, the Governor can only remove for some one of the causes specified [in the state constitution].\u201d In the present case, the Governor not only threw the whole constitutional book at the appellee but for good measure tossed in an unspecified \u201cother cause.\u201d To the extent that the \u201cother cause\u201d was the basis for the discharge, it, of course, goes beyond the <em>Wilcox </em>authorization for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-8\"><em>Wilcox </em>can be read, as apparently the majority opinion does, as concluding that once the magic words \u201cincompetence, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office\u201d are uttered that ends the matter. I find this a flimsy bootstrap for saying that the legislature of the state of Illinois cannot provide a specific term of office, thereby creating a property interest, for any official who is appointed to office by the executive department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-10\">As the majority opinion in the present case notes, the appellant relies, and justifiably so in my opinion, on Shurtleff v. United States, 189 U.S. 311, 23 S.Ct. 535, 47 L.Ed. 828 (1903), in which the Supreme Court enunciated what the majority opinion apparently deems to be only a federal rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-11\">\u201cThere is, of course, no doubt of the power of Congress to create such an office as is provided for in the above section. Under the provision that the officer might be removed from office at any time for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office, we are of opinion that if the removal is sought to be made for those causes, or either of them, the officer is entitled to notice and a hearing. Reagan v. United States, 182 U.S. 419, 425, 21 S.Ct. 845, 46 L.Ed. 1162, 1164. In speaking of causes of removal, Mr. Chief Justice Fuller said in that case:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aqj-dedup-1\">\u2018The inquiry is, therefore, whether there were any causes of removal prescribed by law .March 1, 1895, or at the time of the removal. If there were, then the rule would apply that where causes of removal are specified by constitution or statute, as <em>also where the term, of office is for a fixed period, </em>notice and hearing are essential. If there were not, the appointing power could remove at pleasure or for such cause as it deemed sufficient.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-12\">\u201cVarious state courts have also held that, where an officer may be removed for certain causes, he is entitled to notice and a hearing. See Dullam v. Willson, 53 Mich. 392, 401, 19 N.W. 112, 51 Am.Rep. 128; Page v. Hardin (8 B.Mon.) 47 Ky. 668, 672; Willard\u2019s Appeal, 4 R.I. 597; Com. ex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>rel. Bowman v. Slifer, 25 Pa. 23, 28, 64 Am.Dec. 680; State ex rel. Atty. Gen. v. Hawkins, 44 Ohio St. 98, 114, 5 N.E. 228; Biggs v. McBride, 17 Or. 640, 650, 21 P. 878, 5 L.R.A. 115; Ham v. Boston Bd. of Police, 142 Mass. 90, 7 N.E. 540.\u201d 189 U.S. at 313-14, 23 S.Ct. at 536 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\"><em>Shurtleff </em>has a several pronged applicability to the present case. The statute there did not require notice and hearing. That seems clearly to have been read in as a matter of due process where one of the specified grounds for removal was utilized. Recognition is afforded in the quoted portion from the <em>Reagan </em>case of the essentiality of notice and hearing where a fixed period term is involved, again presumably because of due process requirements. Finally, <em>Shurtleff. </em>makes it clear that the <em>Wilcox </em>rationale that the power of the Illinois Governor to remove is the same as that of the Presb dent of the United States is a misconception of the power of the latter executive. In <em>Shurtleff, </em>the Court held that while due process notice and hearing were required where one of the constitutional or statutory grounds for removal was utilized, the President\u2019s power was not limited to the grounds specified, and notice and hearing were not required so long as the President did not purport to premise the removal upon one of the specified grounds. In the present case, Governor Walker did squarely rest the removal upon all three of the specified grounds as well as the unspecified \u201cother cause.\u201d I am unaware of any difference in this context between federal due process and that which is applicable under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">I recognize that I have been speaking in terms of due process while addressing myself to the matter of property rights and that the majority opinion appears to recognize due process requirements would flow from the existence of property rights, but I do not believe the two can be separated. The pertinent sections of the Illinois statutes read as follows;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-7\"><em>\u201c97. Illinois Liquor Control Commission </em>created.] \u00a7 1. There is hereby created an Illinois Liquor Control Commission consisting of three (3) members to be appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate, no more than two (2) of whom shall be members of the same political party. As amended [by act approved] June 6, Laws 1951. L. 1951, p. 263.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-8\"><em>\u201c98. Appointment </em>\u2014 <em>Terms </em>\u2014 <em>Vacancies]. </em>\u00a7 2. Immediately, or soon as may be after the effective date of this Act [1934], the Goevmor shall appoint three (3) members of the commission, one of whom shall be designated as \u2018Chairman\u2019, one to hold office for a period of two (2) years, one to hold office for a period of four (4) years, one to hold office for a period of six (6) years, and at the expiration of the term of any such commissioner the Governor shall reappoint said commissioner or appoint a successor of said commissioner for a period of six (6) years. The Governor shall have power to fill vacancies in the office of any commissioner.\u201d Ill.Rev.Stats. ch. 43.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-9\">The statutory words \u201cto hold office for a period of six (6) years\u201d are meaningless if an appointee can be removed at will, which, of course, is the situation if, <em>sans </em>notice and hearing, the uttering of the incantatory, and apparently im-precatory, words is all that is required to immolate the balance of a term of office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-10\">Turning to the analysis of the property issue in the majority opinion, I can scarcely conceive that the legislature would have needed to buttress the plain meaning of \u00a7 98 that a six-year term was meant. No rule of statutory construction requires the additional statement \u201cand furthermore we mean what we just said\u201d when the meaning of the words is clear. The majority opinion suggests wording that the legislature might have used to make it even clearer that they meant what they had said. The vast extent of litigation in this area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>arises from the fact that the constitutional requirement of notice and hearing was not in statutes but had to be read in by the courts. Of course, in any event, as the majority opinion reads <em>Wilcox </em>the additionally suggested words would have had no more efficacy than the present constitutional provision. The fact remains that the legislature purported to create a fixed period of six years, in which case \u201cnotice and hearing are essential,\u201d <em>Shurtleff, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">Also, there is no contention in this litigation that the position is any type of civil service job, and very properly it would not be included in the ramifications of the Personnel Code, dealing as that does with career employees selected and tenured on the basis of merit and fitness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are not concerned here with what the subjective thoughts of the ap-pellee may have been at the time of the acceptance of the appointment but rather with what in law the Governor\u2019s power of removal was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">Further, I find no significance in the trial judge\u2019s finding that the Illinois Senate would probably confirm plaintiff\u2019s successor. As I read this, all that was meant was that because of the time element under the Illinois Constitution a nomination sent to the Senate automatically is deemed to have been confirmed upon the lapse of a specified number of days. Even if the Senate by affirmative vote had confirmed a successor, this at most would have implied that the members of that body thought the position was vacant. In the absence of some showing that the Senators were aware of the circumstances of the purported removal, we do not even have the 1973 Senate rendering an advisory interpretation of a statute passed by a different General Assembly. With the addition of the negative factor of nonaetion involved in automatic confirmation by lapse of time, I fail to see how this reference to the trial judge\u2019s finding throws any discernible illumination on the intention of the legislature in enacting \u00a7\u00a7 97 and 98 of chapter 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-8\">Finally, the majority opinion indicates that because of the importance of the position it would be unusual for the legislature to accord property rights therein. This seems to be a policy argument which the legislature chose not to follow. If we were involved in determining policy, which we are not, we would want to note that the Commission is a bipartisan one, and it may well be that the legislature in its wisdom preferred that the Commissioners not necessarily be the handmaidens of the incumbent Governor. In sum, I cannot agree that the legislature did not intend to create a property right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-9\">Whether or not a property right was involved, I can see no basis whatsoever on the facts of the present case for characterizing the peremptory removal of the appellee as being other than an unconstitutional invasion of protected liberty under the standard recognized in <em>Roth, supra, </em>that where a person\u2019s good name, reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to him, notice and an opportunity to be heard are essential. 408 U.S. at 573, 92 S.Ct. at 2701.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-10\">It would not seem necessary to determine whether the charges of incompetency or neglect of duty are such stigmas as to invoke <em>Roth\u2019s </em>liberty protection; the charge of malfeasance in office is sufficient. This term has not lacked judicial fleshing. A few examples should suffice to demonstrate that this characterization is indeed one of op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>probrium. This, and perhaps it needs not saying, is particularly true in today\u2019s climate of fading credibility in which the legal profession often seems to find itself.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-5\">\u201cMalfeasance consists of the doing of an act which is wholly wrongful and unlawful; it involves an act which the officer has no authority to do. Malfeasance in office cannot be charged except for breach of a positive statutory duty or for the performance of a discretionary act with an improper or corrupt motive.\u201d People v. Schneider, 292 P.2d 982, 985, 133 Colo. 173 (1956).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-6\">\u201cMalfeasance has reference to evil conduct or an illegal deed, the doing of that which one ought not to do, the performance of an act by an officer in his official capacity that is wholly illegal and wrongful, which he has no right to perform or which he has contracted not to do.\u201d State ex rel.

Wallace, 214 A.2d 886, 890 (Del.1963).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1079-11\">Earlier, reference was made to today\u2019s climate of lawyer credibility. Bar associations not unmindful of this situation have sought to strengthen their own housekeeping practices. Thus, in recent years the American Bar Association and many local bar associations have adopted codes of professional responsibility. A. B.A. Disciplinary Rule 1-102(A)(6) provides that a lawyer shall not \u201c[e]ngage in any other conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-13\">If the contention should here be made that the appellee was not practicing law at the time he was serving as a member of the Liquor Control Commission, aside from the fact that many lawyers as a part of their professional careers have engaged in public office service, it seems clear that conduct adversely reflecting on fitness to practice is not confined to practice per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-14\">Thus, in the case of In re Wilson, 391 S.W.2d 914 (Mo.1965), the Supreme Court of Missouri, after observing that the right and power to discipline an attorney is inherent in the court, noted, at 918:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-15\">\u201cThis power is not limited to those instances of misconduct wherein he has been employed, or has acted, in a professional capacity; but, on the contrary, this power may be exercised where his misconduct outside the scope of his professional relations shows him to be an unfit person to practice law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1079-16\">In the same case, the court quoted approvingly from an earlier Missouri case in which the respondent had been disciplined for charges of misconduct relating to his duties as a county official to the effect that just as proof of a good moral character is an indispensable requisite for admission to the bar, the continued possession thereof is equally essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-17\">The following passage would afford small comfort to a person who has been the subject of removal from office based in part at least on a charge of malfeasance in office:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-18\">\u201cWhile a conviction provides, perhaps, the clearest grounds for disbar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>ment, many actions for which society has not imposed criminal sanctions may indicate the attorney's unfitness to practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-4\">\u201cIt makes no difference in determining fitness for continued practice that an act involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, or corruption was not committed while serving as an attorney. That at the time of the questioned act a member of the bar was serving as a trustee, sheriff, liquor commissioner, judge, broker, notary or detective in a coroner\u2019s office is no defense to a disbarment proceeding. It is not enough to be honest in practice; the attorney must exhibit good character in every form of activity and in any capacity in which he may be acting.\u201d Note, 43 Cornell L.Q. 489, 491-92 (1958) (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">The text reference to a liquor commissioner was based on In re Lynch, 238 S.W.2d 118 (Ky.1951). In that case, the court rejected the necessity of a practice nexus stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-6\">\u201cIt is lastly argued that Lynch\u2019s conduct was not connected with his professional duties, and he did not plead guilty to a criminal offense in confessing a fine for misfeasance in office, which facts should be taken into consideration in fixing the punishment. It is not necessary that the misconduct of an attorney be connected with his professional acts to bring about his disbarment. 5 Am.Jur. \u2018Attorney at Law\u2019, \u00a7 276, p. 426. As was said in Underwood v. Com., 105 S.W. 151, 32 Ky.Law Rep. 32, a certificate of good character is a prerequisite for admission to the Bar and the continuous possession of a good character is essential to continue as a member thereof. The Underwood opinion further' states it is not necessary that an attorney\u2019s conduct be such as would render him liable to a criminal prosecution in order to disbar him. If his conduct, although outside his professional dealings, shows him to be unworthy of confidence, he may be disbarred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-9\">It seems clear to me on the basis of the foregoing authorities concerning the legal impact of a charge of malfeasance in office combined with today\u2019s emphasis on ethical propriety on the part of lawyers that the possibility of disciplinary proceedings directed toward a person who has been removed from public office on a charge of malfeasance in that office is no vague or idle threat but is a real and distinct potentiality. It may well be that Adams, if subjected to disciplinary proceedings, could successfully defend against charges based on the malfeasance accusation even though it is strengthened here by actual removal. The simple answer to this is he should not be exposed to this possibility in the absence of a due process determination of the validity of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-10\">Nor is it any answer to say that the complaint does not allege fear of disbarment. The seriousness of the charge of malfeasance in office as established by a legion of eases, only a few of which have been cited herein, is such that the exact potential impact of the stigma on a lawyer\u2019s professional career scarcely needs spelling out. Adams, of couse, did not even have the consolation afforded Lynch (In re Lynch, <em>supra) </em>of knowledge of specificity of acts going to make up the stigmatic cloud.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> More importantly, those having to do with disciplinary matters would not here have the benefit of that knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-11\">The words of Mr. Justice Douglas in Wisconsin v. Constantineau, <em>supra, </em>are particularly apt. \u201cThis appellee was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>afforded a chance to defend [himself. He] may have been the victim of an official\u2019s caprice. Only when the whole proceedings leading to the pinning of an unsavory label on a person are aired can oppressive results be prevented.\u201d 400 U.S. at 437, 91 S.Ct. at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">I do not conceive it to be necessary to determine the order or magnitude or the relative stigmatic impact of the charge of malfeasance in office as contrasted with being dishonest, alcoholic, immoral, disloyal, Communistic, et cetera. Each \u201cunsavory label\u201d carries its own brand of stigma and, as the cases cited above indicate, the mark made by \u201cmalfeasance in office\u201d is not inconsiderable. Nor do I think as a practical matter that the sting is lessened by the <em>Wilcox </em>line of cases, which basically does not hold that these terms are not stigmatic but merely that the courts will not disturb nor examine the gubernatorial decision that the status exists. However, and to repeat, the majority opinion does not disagree that if a property right or an invasion of liberty exists the federal courts will examine to see if there has been due process. I am inclined to think that the Illinois courts would also.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">One other aspect of this type of case to which no reference was made in the majority opinion but which should not be ignored is whether the stigmatic charge was made in such a manner as to have a public impact upon the one charged. In the present case we do not have a confidential communication known only to the parties to this lawsuit. The complaint alleges that the general public was informed of the charges through press conferences and news releases. Attached to the complaint is one example of the result of the alleged publicity. In an article in the Chicago Tribune of February 2, 1973, reporting the removal of Adams, the following appeared: \u201cAsked whether Adams was removed for incompetence, neglect, or malfeasance, Walker\u2019s press secretary, Norton Kay, replied: \u2018All three.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">The record shows that Governor Walker had purported to name a successor to the position in question and that this purported appointment could arguably become effective under Illinois law automatically by lapse of time without the necessity of legislative confirmation. Loss of salary and position amply supports a claim of irreparable harm. I do not find that the granting of a preliminary injunction, and that is what we are concerned with here, to be an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-10\">Other points are raised by the appellant. Because of the disposition reached by the majority opinion these points were not treated. I find no merit, however, in the other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-11\">The principal additional contentions are that suit is barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 is not available to the plaintiff because the Governor\u2019s action was. taken pursuant to the state constitution which is not statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-12\">As to the first of these contentions, while Adams did seek monetary damages, we are here concerned only with the injunctive phase of the litigation. This was not a suit against the state of Illinois but against an individual officer of that state. In my opinion the applicable law was correctly stated by Judge Holloway in the Tenth Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-13\">\u201cInsofar as the claims for injunc-tive and declaratory relief are concerned, the principles are well established. \u2018It is the settled doctrine of this court that a suit against individuals for the purpose of preventing them as officers of a state from enforcing an unconstitutional enactment to the injury of the rights of the plaintiff, is not a suit against the state within the meaning of that amendment.\u2019 Smyth v. Ames, 18 S.Ct. 418, 422, 169 U.S. 466, 518, 42 L.Ed. 819; see also Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 155-156, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714; Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Corporation, 337 U.S. 682, 690, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 93 L.Ed. 1628; McCoy v. Louisiana State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>Board of Education, 332 F.2d 915 (5th Cir.); and School Board of City of Charlottesville, Va. v. Allen, 240 F.2d 59, 62-63 (4th Cir.). And if the plaintiffs establish a violation of Federal constitutional rights and entitlement to relief under the Federal civil rights acts, the Wyoming Constitution may not immunize the defendants and override the Federal constitutional principles in view of the Supremacy Clause. Therefore, if a violation of Federal constitutional rights is established by plaintiffs, the immunity under the Eleventh Amendment and the Wyoming Constitution would not bar injunctive or declaratory relief against the defendants other than the State of Wyoming. McCoy v. Louisiana State Board of Education, supra, and Dorsey v. State Athletic Commission, 168 F.Supp. 149 (E.D.La.), aff\u2019d 359 U.S. 533, 79 S.Ct. 1137, 3 L.Ed.2d 1028. And the Federal Court would have jurisdiction to grant such relief, even though the claim for money damages is barred by the immunity, as we discuss below. See Hopkins v. Clemson Agricultural College, 221 U.S. 636, 649, 31 S.Ct. 654, 55 L.Ed. 890.\u201d Williams v. Eaton, 443 F.2d 422, 428-429 (10th Cir. 1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">I express no opinion as to whether Adams can recover monetary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">As to the applicability of \u00a7 1983, as long ago as 1903, Mr. Justice Holmes, while conceding that a forceful argument might be made that \u201cstatute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage\u201d did not extend to a deprivation of rights under color of a state constitution, nevertheless assumed in disposing of a case that the statute did so extend.

This obviously is not intended to suggest that persons holding positions exempted from the Personnel Code coverage are not possessed of merit or fitness. Many of the exempted positions are for definite terms which renders questionable the conclusion that being exempt from the Personnel Code indicates that the person holding the position is removable at will. Thus, for example, the Governor as an elected officer is also exempt from the Personnel Code. The same is true of some fifteen categories of positions involved in the operation of the state governmental processes.
