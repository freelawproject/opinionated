Horace Lowder was convicted in January, 1973, in a trial by jury, of one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States by obstructing the Internal Revenue Service in its task of computing and collecting revenue (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371) and two counts of knowingly filing false corporate income tax returns (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1)). Lowder was sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment on each count and was fined $10,000 on the conspiracy count and $5,000 on each of the other two counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">The government\u2019s case was based on the theory that Lowder utilized his intimate connection with six family-owned corporations to foster an intricate scheme whereby their tax liability would be obscured and evaded, in the years 1961-65. The basic facts as to those years for each corporation follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-7\">(1) <em>All Star Mills, Inc. (Mills): </em>The original family corporation, founded in 1932 by Lowder\u2019s father; principal business was sale of flour and animal feed; Lowder\u2019s ownership 11%;%. There were 26 other stockholders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-8\">(2) <em>Lowder Farms, Inc. (Farms): </em>A second family-owned corporation, founded in 1950 by Lowder\u2019s father and uncle; principal business of beef cattle and farming; Lowder\u2019s ownership 11% <em>%. </em>There were 24 other stockholders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-9\">(3) <em>All Star Hatcheries, Inc. (Hatcheries): </em>Founded in 1959 by Low-der for the business of hatching and growing poultry (broilers); Lowder and wife owned 100% of stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-10\">(4) <em>All Star Foods, Inc. (Foods): </em>Founded in 1959 by Lowder to raise layers and produce and market eggs; Lowder owned 51% through stock held by him and Hatcheries. Mills owned 49%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-11\">(5) , (6) <em>All Star Industries, Inc., </em>and <em>Consolidated Industries, Inc., </em>were both named as co-conspirators but their activities did not play any significant role. The former was formed in 1961 to hold a mortgage on property owned by Foods; the latter was formed to be the legal owner of a farm. Lowder owned 100% of the former, 33%% of the latter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-14\">Lowder throughout the relevant years was the active manager of the affairs of each corporation. He held, among others, the position of secretary-treasurer in each, was in charge of the overall business and financial operations for all, including bookkeeping, and signed each of the corporate tax returns. That Low-der was responsible for the practices alleged to have constituted a scheme to cover up tax liability was not disputed by him; the other shareholders and officers apparently gave him a free hand in decision-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-15\">The four active corporations were Mills, Farms, Foods, and Hatcheries, all of whose books and records were kept in the offices of the original company, Mills. Almost all of the paper work\u2014 handling sales invoices, posting accounts, etc. \u2014 was handled by Mills\u2019 employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-16\">In addition to regular business with third parties, these four corporations, along with the two inactive ones, engaged in a substantial number of inter-corporate transactions. Their records over the four-year period showed that some $17 million was transferred by checks running from each corporation to the five others; that some $5 million of this amount was attributable to loans extended or loans repaid; and that the remaining $12 million was reflected as expenses on the books of the paying corporations. The nature and validity of these expensed transfers \u2014 whether the amounts represented transactions in real goods and services or whether they were mere transfers of money fraudulently treated as \u201cexpenses\u201d to avoid a showing of profits \u2014 was the crux of the case before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>The major contentions advanced by Lowder are: (1) conviction on the first count was barred by the statute of limitations, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282; (2) the employment of a net worth method in count two was erroneous; (3) the convictions on each count rested on insufficient evidence. For the major portion of the proceedings in the district court and before us, Lowder represented himself. There is no claim that his lack of counsel was the result of indigency. In January, 1972, three months after his indictment and one year before the trial, Lowder discharged his retained attorney over a fee dispute. The legal and factual complexity of the charges have made his chosen course hazardous, but we have endeavored to scrutinize the record and give the assigned errors full consideration. We decline, however, to hear argument pro <em>se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">COUNT I</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">The conspiracy conviction is assailed as barred by the applicable statute of limitations. We do not agree and, therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">Lowder and the six corporations were charged with conspiring, from January, 1961, up through the date of the indictment, October 8, 1971, to defraud the United States \u201cby impeding, impairing and obstructing the lawful functions of the Internal Revenue Service, in the ascertainment, computation, assessment and collection of revenue\u201d from the four active corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">As alleged and proved the essence of the government\u2019s case was that: (1) each corporation had a different accounting year \u2014 Mills was on a calendar year basis and the other five were each on different fiscal years; (2) the transfers of money, ostensibly paid for supplies such as feed, would usually occur in large amounts towards the close of the fiscal year for the transferor/\u201cpur-chaser\u201d; (3) these transfers, treated as expenses, would in virtually every instance wipe out then-existing profits which had been accumulating to the transferor during its taxable year; (4) the \u201cseller\u201d/transferee would in turn eliminate the effect these amounts had on its books as receipts (and potential profits) when its taxable year closed a few months later by another transfer similarly expensed, and so on, in a process denoted as \u201crolling\u201d by the investigating agent; (5) the transfers of money, in the aggregate, overstated the value of the goods actually changing hands, i. e., Mills did sell feed to Hatcheries, but not nearly in the quantities which would justify the amounts expensed on the books; (6) the fact that Mills and Farms were on an accrual basis method of accounting and Hatcheries and Foods were on a cash basis method was utilized by Lowder to obscure the real transactions; and (7) the underlying documents \u2014 invoices, ledger cards, etc. \u2014 against which the validity of these transfers could have been cheeked were deliberately destroyed or concealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-14\">Of the eighteen alleged overt acts, all of which were corporate income tax filings for the years in question, the latest occurred on <em>March lb, 1966, </em>the date of the filing of Mills\u2019 return for the previous calendar year. The date of the indictment is <em>October 8, 1971, </em>approximately five years and seven months after the date of the last overt act alleged therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-15\">Before the trial, the court ruled that the six-year statute of limitations specified in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6531(1) applied to the conspiracy count as well as to the fraudulent filing charges. Lowder asserts that the first count, charging a conspiracy to defraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, was governed by the general five-year limitation period specified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but we think the six-year limitation period in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6531 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>governs. The general conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, contains no period of limitations. Limitations, for indictments under \u00a7 371, are those supplied by other provisions of law, or where there are none, by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282 which is a general statute of limitations applicable \u201c[e]xeept as otherwise expressly provided by law.\u201d Thus, \u00a7 3282 applies where no other statute is applicable, and, stated conversely, its application is ousted when there is a special limitation period prescribed for a specific offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">In the case of prosecutions of violations of the tax laws, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6531 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-5\">No person shall be prosecuted for any of the various offenses arising under the internal revenue laws unless the indictment is found or the information instituted within 3 years next after the commission of the offense, except that <em>the period of limitation shall be 6 </em>years\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"apy-dedup-0\">(1) <em>for offenses involving the defrauding or </em>attempting to defraud <em>the United States </em>or any agency thereof, <em>whether by conspiracy or not, </em>and in any manner .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">It thus appears that for a conspiracy to defraud the United States by filing false and fraudulent tax returns \u2014 the crime charged against Lowder, \u00a7 6531 prescribes a six-year period of limitations and, as part of the overall statutory scheme, \u00a7 3282, by its terms, is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">Two authorities do apparently stand opposed to what seems to be this fairly obvious statutory scheme: Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 391, 77 S.Ct. 963, 1 L.Ed.2d 931 (1957); and United States v. Klein, 247 F.2d 908 (2 Cir. 1957), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 924, 78 S.Ct. 365, 2 L.Ed.2d 354 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">In <em>Klein, </em>on an indictment charging a \u00a7 371 conspiracy to defraud in language virtually identical to that contained in count one here, the court, as a prelude to its discussion of the evidence showing the period that the conspiracy continued, stated that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282 was applicable. In <em>Grunewald, </em>on an indictment charging a conspiracy \u201c \u2018to defraud the United States in the exercise of its governmental functions of administering the internal revenue laws\u2019 \u201d the Court stated that the \u201cfirst question before us is whether [the \u00a7 371 count] was barred by the applicable three-year statute of limitations.8 \u201d 353 U.S. at 396, 77 S.Ct. at 969. The footnote was to \u00a7 3282 (amended in 1954 to provide for the present five-year period).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-11\">The government argues that the language in both cases represents not holding, but dicta, since the precise issue here was not contested by the parties. Especially in Gr\u00fcnewald, we do not think that the language was dicta. On the other hand, the language was not part of the main holdings in either case; it was not with respect to any issue which was fully briefed and pressed; and it seems nothing more than mere inadvertence on the part of both courts that the specific language of \u00a7 6351, and its predecessors, was overlooked. We, therefore, conclude to follow the specific statutory language, rather than the contrary statements in <em>Gr\u00fcnewald </em>and <em>Klein </em>and hold that the applicable limitation period was six years. The prosecution against Lowder on count one was not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-12\">COUNT II</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-13\">Lowder was convicted on count two of knowingly subscribing to a false income tax return. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1). The corporate tax return for Hatcheries for the fiscal year ending May 31, 1965, reported taxable income, before net operating loss deduction and special deductions, of $39,815.44. The government charged that the figure was deliberately and substantially understated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-14\">The government offered a computation showing the increased net worth of Hatcheries for that fiscal year in order to establish the substantiality of the understatement. The computation for Hatcheries for that year was derived from a more extensive net worth computation which embraced all six corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>tions over the 1961-65 four-year period on a calendar year basis. The latter showed a total unreported taxable income in excess of $1.5 million for all corporations over the period, with a resulting estimated unreported tax liability of over $400,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">From the four-year (calendar-year basis) net worth computation, the government\u2019s expert witness extracted the computation of net worth increases over that period for Hatcheries alone. Since the increases for Hatcheries were still on a calendar-year basis, they were then converted by monthly pro-ration to reflect fiscal year increases as of each May 31st, Hatcheries\u2019 closing date. Thus, for the fiscal year ending May 31, 1965, 7/12ths of the 1964 net worth increase was added to 5/12ths of the 1965 net worth increase to arrive at a 12-month fiscal year net worth increase of $151,372.44. Since Hatcheries\u2019 return reported taxable income of $39,815.44, the computation reflected additional taxable income for the fiscal year ending May 31, 1965, of $111,557.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">Having examined the exhibits and retraced the computations, we cannot accept Lowder\u2019s claim that this derivation should not have been admissible as proof of understatement. As we understand his brief, his objection amounts to a claim that the government cannot cut through the complexity of the apparent scheme to the substance of corporations\u2019 financial activities. The net worth method was most appropriate in this case where the gross figures appearing on the books and transferred to the tax returns were suspect and the underlying documentation was unavailable. See Johnson v. United States, 325 F.2d 709 (1 Cir. 1963). More specifically, since utilization of the different fiscal year dates was apparently an integral part of the scheme to \u201croll\u201d income to avoid taxation, we think the government was properly allowed to pierce the surface by its pro-rata derivation. Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 131, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Lowder also attacks the conviction on count two on the additional ground of insufficient evidence. That the taxable income was properly shown to have been understated is already settled. Lowder signed the return. As to the requisite criminal intent, the jury may of course infer that from circumstantial evidence. United States v. Barnes, 313 F.2d 325 (6 Cir. 1963). Such a basis existed, to cite but one example, in Lowder\u2019s failure to produce verifying documents for large expense items on Hatcheries\u2019 books for the instant year, at times in 1966 when, according to other testimony, the documents should have been in the corporate offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">Construing the evidence most favorably for the government, we find it was sufficient to permit the jury to adjudge Lowder guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Bell v. United States, 185 F.2d 302 (4 Cir. 1950), cert. denied, 340 U.S. 930, 71 S.Ct. 492, 95 L.Ed. 671 (1951). The conviction on count two must therefore stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">COUNT III</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">The conviction on count three was also for knowingly filing a false return under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1). The government charged that, as to Hatcheries\u2019 tax return for the fiscal year ending May 31, 1966, Lowder deliberately failed to report $33,704.28 of taxable income as represented by three checks: (1) two checks from Foods to Hatcheries, dated December 30, 1965, totaling $32,519.28, which amount the government showed was expensed at that time on Foods\u2019 books; (2) one check from Farms to Hatcheries dated November 29, 1965, in the amount of $1,185.00, which amount-was expensed at that time on Farms\u2019 books.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-12\">The only objection raised by Lowder is that the evidence -was insufficient. He claims that the government failed to show any actual loss of revenue since, by his version, the Foods cheeks had been mislaid from the dates of making until February, 1967, at which time they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>recorded on Hatcheries\u2019 books and computed in the income for that next fiscal year. But what Lowder might have done in subsequent years was irrelevant to whether he filed the return for the instant fiscal year knowing that those checks should have been reported as income to Hatcheries. The jury evidently did not believe his story, and we cannot say that they were unwarranted in so doing. That checks totaling over $33,000 \u2014money which at least could have been earning interest \u2014 were mislaid for fourteen months, and turned up after the IRS agent had begun his investigation, was sufficient to support the verdict on the element of intent. Bell v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">Lowder\u2019s miscellaneous assignments of error, which he merely listed without discussion in his brief, have been considered. They do not warrant discussion and are devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">For the reasons stated, the convictions on each count are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">.
