(Blue Bird), against defendant-carrier, Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company (B&amp;O), for alleged damage to four carloads of fresh hams shipped by midwest meat packers via defendant to plaintiff in Philadelphia. The action is brought under the Car-mack Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20(11). The issue presented is whether the introduction of a bill of lading with the notation,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"amm-dedup-0\">Received, subject to the classifications and tariffs in effect on the date of the issue of this Bill of Lading, the property described below, in apparent good order, except as noted (contents and condition of contents of packages unknown) ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"atd-dedup-0\">is sufficient to establish the good condition of the lading at the time it was delivered by the shipper to the carrier. The district court, both in its initial opinion and on remand, held that it was not. Having considered the contentions of the parties, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-4\">The facts necessary to our decision are as follows.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The four carloads at issue were shipped from the midwest to the Philadelphia destination point pursuant to a \u201cpiggy-back\u201d transportation operation where trailers are hauled to the destination on railroad flatcars. As developed in testimony before the district court on remand, the mode of shipment designated by the shipper in these cases required the shipper to load a trailer furnished by the carrier. The district court found as facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-5\">1. When the shipper was ready to load the trailer, it contacted a \u201cspotter\u201d (a railroad agent who is on the shipper\u2019s premises) who backs the trailer to the shipper\u2019s loading dock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-8\">2. The hams were individually loaded by the shipper, one piled upon the other, so that when loading was completed, the hams extended from the front to the rear of the trailer to a height of approximately three to four feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-9\">3. Subsequent to loading but prior to the doors of the trailer being sealed, only the rear portion of the contents of the trailer were \u201copen and visible\u201d and the subject of a reasonable inspection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-10\">4. When loading is completed the trailer is pulled away from the loading dock, the rear doors are closed and the shipper places its seal upon the doors of the trailer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-11\">5. The seal affixed by the shipper is a small, thin metal band which locks when one end of the band is snapped into the other end.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-12\">6. The trailer is then driven to a location upon the shipper\u2019s premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-13\">7. Upon notification that the plaintiff was ready to ship the load, \"the railroad\u2019s drayman was dispatched to the plant site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-14\">8. Upon his arrival, the drayman hooks his cab to the trailer, inspects the seal, refrigeration system and the outside of the trailer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-15\">9. This inspection revealed no evidence of visible damage to the refrigeration system or the outside of the trailer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-16\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>11. The trailer was then driven from the plaint [sic] site to the piggyback train for cross country transit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1396-4\">12. The seals applied at origin were not broken until their arrival at the Bluebird plant in Philadelphia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1396-5\">13. The tariff applicable to the shipments involved in the instant cases is Tariff 450 D of Western Trunk Lines, and the Plan under which the shipments were sent is commonly known as Plan 2]4-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1396-6\">14. Under Plan 2<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>/4 it is the obligation of the shipper to load the trailer \u201csubject to carrier\u2019s supervision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1396-7\">As more fully set forth in our opinion in the original appeal, the lawful holder of a bill of lading makes out a prima facie case of liability for damaged goods against a carrier by proving delivery of goods in good condition, arrival of goods in damaged condition and the amount of damages. 474 F.2d at 104. In the present case, Blue Bird produced no direct evidence of the condition of the hams on delivery to the carrier. Instead, Blue Bird introduced the bills of lading under which the goods were shipped and, relying on our decision in Tuschman v. Pennsylvania Railroad, 230 F.2d 787 (3d Cir. 1956),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> contended that the carrier\u2019s representation of receipt \u201cin apparent good order\u201d created a prima facie case of delivery of the goods in good condition. The district court, in its initial opinion, rejected this argument. It determined that when merchandise is delivered to a carrier in a sealed trailer, it is not \u201copen and visible.\u201d It held that in these circumstances the consignee who sues the carrier for damages to the goods cannot establish a prima facie case by means of the \u201capparent good order\u201d representation in the bill of lading but instead must \u201cestablish by direct evidence that the goods were delivered to the carrier in good order.\u201d 329 F.Supp. at 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-11\">On the initial appeal, we held that the ' district court\u2019s implicit finding that the trailer was \u201csealed\u201d was clearly erroneous and remanded for further findings on that issue. In addition, we requested that the court supplement the record with findings of fact and conclusions of law on issues including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1396-12\">A. Was any part of the contents of the trailer \u201copen and visible\u201d in light of the time and condition of its being sealed and the party responsible for such sealing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1396-13\">B. Is there a custom governing the sealing of such trailers shipped under Plan 2% . . . ?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1396-15\">474 F.2d at 107, n. 16. On remand the district court made additional findings of fact as noted above and again concluded that Blue Bird \u201chas failed to prove that the cargo was delivered to the [carrier] in good order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-16\">On this appeal, Blue Bird makes two contentions. First, it argues that the shipper\u2019s delivery of a trailer sealed with a \u201csmall thin metal band\u201d to the carrier\u2019s drayman does not preclude an internal inspection of the container. Second, it argues that the carrier had an opportunity to inspect the lading prior to the sealing of the trailer, either as the goods were being loaded or after loading but before the seals were affixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-17\">The district court rejected Blue Bird\u2019s first contention on the basis \u201cthat a shipper who uses any device to seal a trailer indicates to a carrier that the cargo was properly loaded; that the goods are in good order and the carrier is not obligated to inspect the cargo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-18\">We have carefully reviewed the record in this case and we find no error in the district court\u2019s ruling. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>record shows that the seal serves as a type of security device providing the shipper\u2019s assurance to the consignee that the load has not been tampered with from the time it left the shipper\u2019s premises. The practice of carriers to break the seal in case of an emergency, when requested by the shipper, or when there is a history of recurring loss with the shipper, does not, in the absence of specific shipper\u2019s instructions, impose upon the carrier the duty to also break the seal for purposes of inspecting the contents of the trailer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1397-5\"> We are unable to agree with Blue Bird\u2019s second contention. Under Plan 2\u00bc the shipper loads the trailer at its plant site. After loading and sealing, the railroad\u2019s drayman is notified by the shipper to pick up the trailer. The carrier receives the trailer and assumes responsibility for the goods only after the trailer is loaded, sealed andreleased to the shipper. Any obligation of the carrier to inspect, in the absence of specific arrangements otherwise, would not commence until it takes possession of the goods.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1397-6\">In order that a railroad have the status and absolute liability of a common carrier with respect to a shipment, the shipper must have delivered the freight into its possession, the delivery must be for immediate transportation, and the shipper must give the carrier appropriate shipping instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1397-7\">Republic Carloading and Distributing Co. v. Missouri Pacific R.R. Co., 302 F. 2d 381, 385 (8th Cir. 1962); see, Dugdale Packing Co. v. Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Ry. Co., 347 F.Supp. 1276 (W.D.Mo.1972). As heretofore noted, such inspection would not include, absent specific instructions from the shipper, breaking the seal for an interior examination of the cargo. Under the circumstances, we are unable to conclude that the carrier had any duty to inspect the cargo<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on the shipper\u2019s premises prior to notification that the cargo was ready for shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-12\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1395-6\">. This case was first before this court on Blue Bird\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s entry of judgment, after a three day non-jury trial, for B&amp;O. The district court\u2019s original opinion is reported at 329 F.Supp. 1116 (E.D.Pa.1971). Our opinion on Blue Bird\u2019s first appeal is reported at 474 F.2d 102 (3d Cir. 1973). The district court\u2019s \u201cAdditional Findings of Fact, Discussion and Conclusions of Law\u201d and subsequent \u201cMemorandum Opinion and Addendum\u201d on remand are unreported. Blue Bird Food Products Co. v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Ry., Nos. 70-1699, 1744, 1880, 2661 (E.D.Pa., filed June 5, June 22, 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1395-18\">. The cases were tried in a single proceeding and were consolidated for the purposes of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1395-19\">. The facts appear in greater elaboration in our opinion on Blue Bird\u2019s first appeal. <em>See </em>note 1 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1396-8\">. In <em>Tuschman </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1396-9\">The acknowledgment by the bill of lading of the crane\u2019s apparent good order was prima facie evidence that, as to all parts which were open to inspection and visible, the crane was in good order at the point of origin. This did not preclude the railroad from showing that the alleged damage in whole or part proceeded from some cause or causes which existed, but were not apparent when it received the crane.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1396-20\">230 F.2d at 791.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1397-8\">. B&amp;O argues that even if the seal were required to be broken, and the doors opened, the manner of loading and the possible existence of a nondetectable microorganism precluded the lading from being \u201copen to inspection and visible.\u201d Because of our disposition of this case on other grounds, we need not rule on this contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1397-9\">. Blue Bird argues that the tariff provides for an inspection, citing the following provision, stipulated by the parties to be relevant to the shipments under consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1397-10\">Where rates are provided in tariff that do not include loading or unloading, or which provide that shipper is to load or consignee to unload, such rates will be applied . . . only when shipper or consignee, as the tariff item may provide, performs the entire physical or mechanical service of such loading or unloading, <em>subject to carrier\u2019s supervision. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1397-23\">We do not find this language inconsistent with our decision. It would appear that this clause <em>permits </em>supervision by the carrier over the shipper\u2019s loading practices to assure safety in transportation and avoid damage to the carrier\u2019s property. It does not <em>require </em>an inspection of the condition of the goods.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
