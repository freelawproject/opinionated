Caspar W. Weinberger, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, <em>Defendant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-14\">Civ. A. No. 72-381</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-15\">MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-16\">CARL B. RUBIN, District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-17\">This is an action under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), for review of a final decision of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare that plaintiff is not entitled to social security disability insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-18\">This matter is before the Court on defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and plaintiff\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-19\">Plaintiff filed an application for social security disability insurance benefits on November 10, 1969 alleging that she had become unable to work as of October 28, 1969. The application was denied on the ground that she lacked the necessary \u201cdisability insured status\u201d in that she had only 14 of the required 20 quarters of coverage in the 40 quarter period preceding the alleged onset of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-21\">Plaintiff filed her present application for disability insurance benefits on July 6, 1970 alleging that she became disabled as of June 13, 1970. The application was denied on the ground that plaintiff had accumulated only 19 of the required 20 quarters of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-22\">A woman who applies for social security disability insurance benefits before she attains the age of 62 is eligible for coverage if she has \u201cnot less than twenty quarters of coverage during the forty-quarter period which ends\u201d with the quarter in which the application is filed. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(i)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-23\">It is undisputed that plaintiff has accumulated 19 of these 20 required quarters of coverage. Plaintiff asserts that she earned the twentieth quarter of coverage when she worked as a babysitter for her daughter from September to October, 1970. During this period plaintiff\u2019s daughter and son-in-law were both employed. Plaintiff babysat in her own home for her daughter\u2019s two minor children. For purposes of decision only, the Secretary assumed that plaintiff did not perform any services in her daughter\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-24\">\u201cEmployment\u201d is defined in the Social Security Act to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-25\">any service . . . performed . by an employee for the person employing him . . . except that . . . such term shall not include\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-29\">(3) (B) service not in the course of the employer\u2019s trade or business, or domestic service in the private home of the employer, performed by an individual in the employ of his son or daughter. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8qE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>The hearing examiner held that the services plaintiff performed for her daughter during the third quarter of 1970 \u201cwere services not in the course of the employer\u2019s trade or business and, since they were performed for her daughter, are specifically excluded from coverage . . under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(a)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">Plaintiff argues that her employment by her daughter is not excluded by the trade or business requirement of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(a)(3)(A) because \u201cthe first and most important \u2018trade or business\u2019 of plaintiff\u2019s daughter . was to care for her minor children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">The term \u201ctrade or business\u201d is not defined by the Social Security Act or the regulations adopted by the Secretary pursuant to the Act. There are no reported cases construing the exclusion. In such circumstance, the Court must resort to common usage to determine the meaning of the phrase \u201ctrade or business.\u201d \u201cTrade\u201d is defined in the dictionary as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-8\">The business one practices or the work in which one engaged regularly: one\u2019s calling: gainful employment: means of livelihood: OCCUPATION. WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY (3d ed. 1967).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1357-10\">A \u201cbusiness\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-11\">A usual commercial or mercantile activity customarily engaged in as a means of livelihood and typically involving some independence of judgment and power of decision and sometimes contrasted with the arts ... or professions . or sports . . .or other activity considered less practical, serious, respectable, or mundane: OCCUPATION, POSITION, TRADE, LINE. WEBSTER\u2019S TPIIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY (3d ed. 1967).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1357-16\">Child rearing is not normally considered to be a mother\u2019s employment or means of livelihood. Neither is it considered a commercial or mercantile activity. It is true that child rearing has an economic value that can be computed; and that persons do perform the service of child care for economic gain. Nonetheless, at the present time, the economic value of a mother\u2019s services in caring for her children are not generally recognized as compensible or as a trade or business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-17\">In today\u2019s society, a mother often has employment outside the home. When such employment requires that provisions be made for the care of minor children, the mother naturally seeks the most qualified care available. Needless to say, her own mother is often the ideal babysitter because she is able to render not only competent child care services but to add the love, affection and concern for the child\u2019s welfare which is engendered by the familial relationship. But Congress has chosen to exclude from coverage under the Social Security Act certain employment by reason of family relationship. Prior to 1960 this exclusion was absolute when a parent was employed by one of his children. Today a parent may work for his child in the course of the child\u2019s trade or business, but still may not perform domestic services, whether inside or outside the home, for his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-18\">Upon consideration, and for the reasons set out above, the Court holds that defendant\u2019s motion is meritorious, and therefore it is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-19\">The decision of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-20\">This action is hereby dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
