Under 16 V.I.C. \u00a7 109(3) the district court, upon dissolving a marriage, may provide for the recovery \u2018from the party in fault such an amount of money, in gross or in installments, as may be just and proper for such party to contribute to the maintenance of the other.\u2019 \u201d Barrows v. Barrows, 489 F.2d 661, (3d Cir., 1974). Our review will therefore follow the parameters outlined by statute and the appropriate procedural rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-22\">Distilled to its essence, appellant\u2019s first point suggests that the court erred somehow by not requiring the joinder of his brother, Morris Cohen, and his sister, Rebecca Knapp, as indispensable parties to his divorce action. Although we confess to a lack of certainty as to how a joinder of a husband\u2019s brother and sister could be effected in a divorce proceeding,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we have decided to meet the merits of the contention. Chief Judge Christian has described the background of this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzG\">The chasm which divides the litigants in their prayers for relief is the sig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>nificance of certain assets, primarily securities, held in the names of Rebecca Knapp, plaintiff\u2019s sister, Morris Cohen, his brother, and the children of the parties, Stacie and Sari (or in plaintiff\u2019s name on their behalf). As to the extensive holdings in the names of Knapp and Cohen, Mrs. Coman charges that they are in actuality the property of her husband, who has always managed, possessed, and received the dividends from these shares to the total exclusion of the record title holders. The evidence adduced tends to bear her out in this respect. Plaintiff, on the other hand, denies ownership, characterizing himself as a mere representative or manager for his siblings, entirely without beneficial interest in such securities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The court heard testimony from plaintiff and defendant and had the depositions of plaintiff\u2019s brother Joseph and his sister Rebecca, and concluded that plaintiff \u201cexhibited every incident of ownership which the law recognizes over the securities, except paper title, 42 Am.Jur. \u00a7 40, 41. In this respect, Knapp and Cohen were totally ignorant of the securities, in what they consisted, their number or value, and neither received any income from them.\u201d It found \u201cthat plaintiff [was] the beneficial owner of the securities held under the names of Rebecca Knapp and Morris Cohen,\u201d concluding that this finding \u201c[did] not, of course, bind them,\u201d but that it was \u201cjustified in proceeding [upon the finding] for purposes of fixing alimony and child support.\u201d Because the court found appellant to be the beneficial owner of the securities, he argues that his brother and sister, holders of the legal title, should have been named as indispensable parties to the divorce proceedings under the provisions of F.R.Civ.P. 19; 5 V.I.C. App. I R 19 (1966).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Although appellant frames this first issue . in terms of indispensability, he seeks not to have the absent persons joined but rather to have the district court\u2019s decree modified to include provisions protective of him and those absent persons. Appellant fails to understand the meaning of \u201cindispensable.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>\u201cWhether a person is \u2018indispensable,\u2019 <em>that is, whether a particular lawsuit must be dismissed in the absence of that person, </em>can only be determined in the context of a particular litigation.\u201d Provident Tradesmens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Patterson, <em>supra, </em>390 U.S. at 118, 88 S.Ct. at 742 (Emphasis supplied) (Footnote omitted). Therefore, if we conclude that appellant\u2019s brother and sister are indispensable parties, then the alimony claim must be dismissed. If, however, modification of the court's decree is appropriate, we need not remand but can \u201crequire suitable modification as a condition of affirmance.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>at 112, 88 S.Ct. at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Haas v. Jefferson National Bank, 442 F.2d 394, 398-399 (5th Cir. 1971), set forth the distinction between 19(a) <em>Persons to be Joined if Feasible, </em>and 19(b) <em>Determination by Court Whenever Join-der not Feasible. </em>Strictly speaking, we may not consider the criteria of Rule 19(a) because neither Cohen nor Knapp are persons \u201csubject to service of process.\u201d They reside in New York, more than 100 miles from the place where the action was commenced, and are therefore not amenable to service of process. F.R.Civ.P. 4f; 5 V.I.C. App. I. R. 4f (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">This, however, does not end the matter. As in <em>Haas </em>where the action proceeded in the district court in Florida and the person sought to be joined lived in Cleveland, Ohio, it becomes necessary to apply the provisions of Rule 19(b) and the specific factors enumerated therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">First, we must consider \u201cto what extent a judgment rendered in the person\u2019s absence might be prejudicial to him or those already parties. . . .\u201d The district court specifically stated that \u201cany decision by this Court on the ownership of these securities would not be res judicata as to the non-parties. . \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We are mindful that this does not end our inquiry into the potential prejudice to absent persons, Haas v. Jefferson National Bank, <em>supra, </em>442 F. 2d at 399, n. 6. Nevertheless, there are sound reasons for concluding that any prejudice to appellant\u2019s brother and sister is trivial. The district court\u2019s finding of beneficial ownership was merely one \u201cupon which ... [if felt] justified in proceeding <em>for the purposes of fixing alimony and child support.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied). Mrs. Coman was not declared the owner of any interest in the securities nor was Mr. Coman ordered to convey any or all of the securities to her. Rather, the court was simply determining appellant\u2019s assets for the purpose of establishing his ability to pay alimony and child support. We fail to perceive how such a limited finding \u2014limited as to effect and purpose\u2014 prejudices the rights of appellant\u2019s brother and sister. Indeed, the attorney for Rebecca Knapp, in proceedings before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>filed an affidavit in support of a motion to dismiss in which he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">12. The complaint shows that Mrs. Coman has a great deal of knowledge with respect to the securities, as can be seen from the schedule attached to the complaint. Such knowledge was secured through the discovery proceedings held in the Virgin Islands divorce suit. Mr. Coman was examined, as was Mrs. Knapp, and I am informed, Mr. Cohen, brother of Mr. Co-man. <em>Obviously, the sole purpose of such discovery proceedings would be </em>to' <em>establish Mr. Coman\u2019s capacity to pay alimony, if the District Court in the Virgin Islands should decide to award any.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Post-Trial Brief of Defendant with Attachments, filed April 27, 1972, in Coman v. Coman, Civil No. 326-1969 (Div St. Croix, April 30, 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Moreover, a review of the proceedings in the Virgin Islands persuades us that appellant was unable to construct a convincing case that he was not the beneficial owner of the securities. Rejected by the Virgin Islands court was appellant\u2019s argument that the securities in the names of Knapp and Cohen were derived in one of two ways: by gift from their parents or by purchase from re-invested dividends from the original gift shares. Rebecca\u2019s testimony received by deposition was summarized by the fact finder: \u201cRebecca Knapp testified in her deposition that she had no knowledge as to what she may have inherited from either parent, and she particularly indicated that she knew nothing of any stocks' in her father\u2019s estate. . . . She was aware of stocks held in her name which were in Coman\u2019s custody but she testified she had never had any such certificates in her own possession. .\u201d Plaintiff testified that his brother Morris Cohen knew nothing about the stocks in his (Cohen\u2019s) name because Morris was \u201cwholly incapable of handling money matters and therefore [their brother Joseph Cohen] was the one who handled everything for him.\u201d However, Joseph testified by deposition that he knew of no stock dealings on Morris\u2019 part beyond one unsuccessful effort to follow a neighbor\u2019s \u201ctip.\u201d Joseph further testified that he believed his mother died intestate, that he received nothing from her estate, and that he and Morris Cohen received the proceeds of a $2,000 life insurance policy, and nothing more, from his father\u2019s estate. Morris Cohen\u2019s annual income approximates $5,200.00; Mrs. Knapp is unemployed. By deposition her husband reported that his earnings have never been invested in securities. The district court\u2019s finding that neither Knapp nor Cohen could have bought the securities is well-supported and uncontested on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">In sum, after an independent examination of the record, we are not persuaded that the beneficial ownership conclusion reached by the district court, rendered in the absence of Coman\u2019s brother and sister as parties, amounted to an overriding prejudice to Mr. Coman or to his brother and sister. Although not parties, Mrs. Knapp testified by deposition and Morris Cohen\u2019s observations were introduced through the plaintiff\u2019s testimony and that of the brother Joseph Cohen. Although we cannot be certain, we are hard put to contemplate what evidence would have been produced in any court which was not presented in the Virgin Islands. At best, we can say that appellant is exposed to a remote potential for prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">We turn now to the second factor, \u201cthe extent to which, by protective pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>visions in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, or other measures, the prejudice can be lessened or avoided.\u201d It would seem that appellant can persuasively argue that any potential prejudice to him was not lessened or avoided in the alimony decree. However, as we have pointed out, any potential prejudice to appellant or his sister and brother is so trivial we are unwilling to condition affirmance upon the addition of \u201cprotective\u201d provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The third factor to be considered is whether a judgment rendered in the person\u2019s absence will be adequate.\u201d In this case, the alimony and support decree was adequate without joinder of appellant's sister and brother. The fourth and final factor we deem to be very critical to our decision: \u201cwhether . [Mrs. Coman] will have an adequate remedy if the [alimony] action is dismissed for nonjoinder.\u201d The brute fact is that the Virgin Islands is the only jurisdiction where the wife may proceed for alimony <em>qua </em>alimony. The Virgin Islands divorce decree itself has not been challenged by either party. It was the husband-appellant who chose the Virgin Islands forum to obtain the divorce. Having chosen this forum to obtain his divorce, he may not deprive his wife of the opportunity of obtaining the benefits allowed by that forum. He cannot have the best of two worlds. He may not invoke Virgin Islands jurisdiction to shed himself of his wife and deny to her the rights and privileges afforded by that jurisdiction. We hold that Mrs. Coman would not have an adequate remedy if the alimony claim were dismissed for nonjoinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Evaluating the four factors in Rule 19(b) we cannot hold the brother and sister to be indispensable parties under Rule 19(b). To so consider them as indispensable parties would require a dismissal of the alimony claim. Under the \u201cequity and good conscience\u201d test, Provident Tradesmens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Patterson, <em>supra, </em>390 U.S. at 109, 88 S.Ct. 733, we will not deny appellee a forum to present her alimony claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">We now consider whether the district court abused its discretion in awarding the alimony in gross, 16 V.I.C. \u00a7 109(3), instead of appointing a trustee to make installment payments as directed by the court. 16 V.I.C. \u00a7 109(5). We have previously formulated standards for awarding alimony: \u201cWhether an award of alimony shall be made, as well as the amount to be awarded, is within the discretion of the court, having regard to the conduct of both parties, the amount of property of each, and all the other circumstances of the case.\u201d Burch v. Burch, 195 F.2d 799, 812 (3d Cir. 1952) (Footnote omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cIt is the circumstances surrounding the parties, the wife\u2019s necessities, and the husband\u2019s financial ability, the physical condition of the parties, the nature of their life together, and in these' modern times the wife\u2019s independence and ability to earn her own way, which must all be considered by the court in the exercise of its discretion in awarding or denying alimony.\u201d Poe v. Poe, 409 F.2d 40, 43 (3d Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">Ostensibly, at issue here is not the amount of the $200,000.00 award. Appellant states: \u201cFor purposes of this argument the husband does not dispute the amount of the alimony award. .\u201d Rather, he contends that using the device of a \u201cgross\u201d amount instead of a trust is \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d citing Del Peschio v. Del Peschio, <em>supra, </em>356 F.2d at 404.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellant mistakes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the appropriate standard of review. Having stated in <em>Burch </em>that \u201cthe amount to be awarded, is within the discretion of the court,\u201d we have set forth the standard for the trial court. The responsibility of the reviewing court is to affirm the amount and terms of the award unless an abuse of discretion is found.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">It would seem that appellant wants to have it both ways. Initially, he argues that the amount of alimony is not in issue, then he contends that a reversion-ary trust<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> should have been imposed so that in the event appellee remarried or died, the corpus or the balance thereof would revert to him.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This trust alternative clearly affects the ultimate amount of the award. Indeed, we conclude that the thrust of appellant\u2019s trustee argument, stripped of persiflage, is an attempt to bring about a reduction in the sum upon the happening of a condition subsequent, her remarriage or death. While appellant intones solemnly that he does not quarrel with the amount of the award, the reality is that precisely what he seeks is a device which may in fact reduce the amount of this award.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">We think it clear that the court intended to bestow upon the wife a lump sum amount for alimony \u2014 whether she remarried or stayed single. The court had the choice of ordering installment payments, but reasoned that a gross award was indicated because \u201cthere is evidence that the husband may be inclined to obscure or dissipate his estate.\u201d Appellant does not dispute the district court\u2019s reasoning; he merely asserts that the appointment of a trustee would be more appropriate. We are not convinced that the district court abused its discretion in awarding alimony in gross.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">We have considered all of appellant\u2019s contentions and find them to be without merit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">The judgment and decree of the District Court of the Virgin Islands will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-14\">. Under tlie Virgin Islands Code the court may decree an amount \u201cin gross or in installments . . . for such party to contribute to the maintenance of the other,\u201d 16 V.I.C. \u00a7 109(3), or may appoint a trustee or \u201ctrustees to collect, receive, expand, manage, or invest . . . any sum of money adjudged for the maintenance of the wife. ...\u201d 16 V.I.C. \u00a7 109(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b338-23\">.
