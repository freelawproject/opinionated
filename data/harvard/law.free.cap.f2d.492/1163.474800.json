We fail to find merit in any ground of the appeal and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-19\">Error by the trial judge is asserted in the following respects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-20\">(a) Refusal to permit appellant\u2019s counsel to conduct a separate voir dire examination of the prospective jurors;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-21\">(b) Failure to exclude the testimony of certain government witnesses, motel employees and others, as to prostitution activities of the \u201cvictim\u201d and other alleged prostitutes as being unnecessarily redundant and prejudicial corroboration of the \u201cvictim\u2019s\u201d testimony regarding her activities and those of the appellant as a \u201cpimp\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-22\">(c) Rulings limiting cross-examination of the claimed \u201cvictim\u201d as unduly restrictive, and violative of the Sixth Amendment Right of Confrontation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-23\">(d) Permitting the rehabilitation of a government witness who was allowed to change his testimony on redirect examination to reflect that an event occurred in 1971 rather than 1970 as originally stated by the witness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-24\">(e) The trial court\u2019s unwarranted statement, in overruling defense objections to a question by the prosecuting attorney \u201cWe want the facts, the truth, that is what we are searching for,\u201d and in explaining his ruling \u201cI want to get to the truth\u201d, as inferring that the defendant on trial was trying to hide the truth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-25\">(f) Refusal to charge the jury that\u2019 the defendant\u2019s wife could testify against him, even though the wife was not present at the trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-26\">(g) Denials of motions to dismiss the indictment and for judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence, on the ground of lack of proof of motive and intent in causing the interstate transportation involved;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>(h) Permitting certain rebuttal evidence to be received;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-5\">(i) Permitting a reference to the statute involved as the \u201cSlavery Statute\u201d by the prosecution\u2019s opening statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-6\">(j) Permitting references to grand jury testimony by an F.B.I. witness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-7\">(k) Permitting the investigating F.B.I. special agent to sit at counsel table during the trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-8\">(l) Variance between the allegation in the indictment of interstate transportation \u201cfrom Alexandria, Louisiana to Longview, Texas\u201d and the proof of a journey between the same places broken by intermediate stops at Eunice, Louisiana and at Midland and Wichita Falls, Texas;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-9\">(m) And finally, error by the jury in \u201crendering a verdict of guilty in that the verdict is not supported by the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1229-10\">As to a number of the claimed errors, no objection was made when they occurred, so as to permit the trial judge to remedy the asserted prejudice, and further so as to permit our review. None rise to the level of \u201cplain error\u201d. F.R.Crim.P. Rule 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-11\"> As to others, typically the conduct of the voir dire examination of potential jurors, the extent of cross-examination and the like, we think that they involve matters clearly within the trial court\u2019s wide discretion in the conduct of a criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-12\">As to the remaining assignments we make these brief comments. There was no variance. The trial was conducted in an atmosphere of patience, impartiality and strict fairness with any rare admonition to counsel that \u201cWe want the facts\u201d or \u201cWe want the truth\u201d and the like evoked by the nature and the tenor of defense counsel\u2019s objections. The case was submitted to the jury under ample and fair instructions. Finally the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, Glasser v. United States, 1942, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680, 704, amply supported the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-14\">The judgment appealed from is right.</p>\n<p id=\"A3H\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1228-27\">. Directed by the sentencing trial judge to be served concurrently with a prior two year sentence imposed by another judge for a separate federal felony in the same district.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Am_\">.
