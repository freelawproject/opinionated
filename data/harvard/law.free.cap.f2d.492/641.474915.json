The advice was that the staff, for reasons stated, would not recommend action by the Commission respecting the contemplated exclusion from management\u2019s proxy materials of a stockholder\u2019s proposals for action at a stockholders\u2019 meeting. The Commission has refused either to examine the staff\u2019s view of the matter or to express a view of its own; it now asserts that we lack jurisdiction to consider the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>tion for review and urges dismissal. We grant the motion and dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">On November 19, 1.971, petitioner, a Class B stockholder<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Washington Post Company, informed the company\u2019s general counsel of his intention to submit three proposals relating to general business matters<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for consideration at the 1972 annual meeting of stockholders. He requested that his propositions and supporting statements, which he set out in a letter to the company, be incorporated into management\u2019s proxy materials as allegedly required by proxy rules adopted by the Commission pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Rule 14a-8(a) of the proxy rules<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> requires the issuer of proxy materials to include any proposals (not otherwise ex-cludable under provisions of the rules)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> submitted by \u201cany security holder entitled to vote at a meeting of security holders of the issuer.\u201d The company, following the procedure established by the rules,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> informed the Commission\u2019s Division of Corporate Finance of its intent-ion to omit petitioner\u2019s proposals from its 1972 proxy statements,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and sought confirmation that the Division would not urge action by the Commission on that account. Petitioner filed memoranda and supporting materials in opposition to the request for a no-action decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-18\">The Division issued a letter opinion on March 8, 1972, stating that it would not recommend that the Commission take enforcement action, and expressing the ground for that decision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Petitioner then asked the Commission to reexamine the Division\u2019s ruling; but was later informed that the Commission \u201cdeclined to review the staff\u2019s position or hold an oral hearing . . . [or] to issue an informal statement on the matter.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-20\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b707-21\">Our authority to directly review Commission action springs solely from Section 25(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which confines our jurisdiction to \u201corder[s] issued by the Commission. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>members of the Commission\u2019s staff, like staff personnel of other agencies, \u201chave no authority individually or collectively to make \u2018orders,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that, on the contrary, \u201c[o]nly the Commission makes orders.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Here the Commission made no order on the merits of petitioner\u2019s claim; rather, it emphatically \u201cdeclined to review the staff\u2019s position.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It follows that what petitioner seeks to have reviewed in this court is not an \u201corder issued by the Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Petitioner relies heavily on Medical Committee for Human Rights v. Securities and Exchange Commission,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> wherein we reviewed on the merits the Commission\u2019s approval of a no-action ruling by its staff.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We think, however, that very different jurisdictional consequences flow from the antithetical roles which the Commission played in <em>Medical Committee </em>and here. There, after the staff announced that it would not recommend action respecting a company\u2019s omission of a stockholder\u2019s proposal from its proxy materials, the Commission examined the staff\u2019s no-action determination and accepted it. As our opinion in <em>Medical Committee </em>recounted, the Commission, \u201cafter reviewing the petitioner\u2019s proxy claim,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cexercised its discretion to review [the] controversy,\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and \u201capproved the recommendation of the [staff] that no objection be raised. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In sum, <em>Medical Committee </em>involved a no-action ruling by the staff which was sanctioned by the Commission, and that, we held, constituted administrative action subject to judicial review.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">In sharp contrast to that decision is the Commission\u2019s refusal here to in any way probe or pass on the staff\u2019s no-action position. The distinction is between the Commission\u2019s reexamination and affirmance of the staff\u2019s conclusion on the one hand, and the Commission\u2019s declension of any review or adjudi\u00f3ation on the other. We recognized the vitality of that distinction when in <em>Medical Committee </em>we admonished that the availability of judicial review of a staff no-action decision respecting proxy proposals \u201cdepends upon the Commission\u2019s initial determination to review the staff decision.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> That precondition is not met here.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b708-15\"> We are mindful that administrative inaction may become judicially cognizable,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and that yet another question here is whether the Commission erred in flatly refusing to deal with petitioner\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> But assuming, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>out deciding, that the refusal is otherwise encompassed by Section 25(a),<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> we are not at liberty to override it.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"> The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides that \u201cthe Commission may, in its discretion, make such investigations as it deems necessary,\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and that \u201cit may in its discretion bring an action\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> in court. An agency\u2019s decision to refrain from an investigation or an enforcement action is generally unreviewable<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and, as to the agency before us, the specifications of the Act leave no doubt on that score.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The Commission, by regulation, has served notice that its informal procedures are ordinarily to be matters of staff activity, and will involve the Commission only when special circumstances so warrant.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We discern nothing arbitrary or abusive in this policy as applied in the case at bar. In <em>Medical Committee </em>\u201cwe recognize[d] that there is a legitimate domain of administrative discretion in the proxy area,\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> carved out by the necessity that the Commission \u201cprocess a formidable number of proxy statements in limited time and with insufficient manpower.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> \u201cObviously,\u201d we said, \u201cnot all proxy proposals can or should be given detailed consideration by the full Commission<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and we hastened to add that \u201ceven the boldest advocates of judicial review recognize that the agencies\u2019 internal management decisions and allocations of priorities are not a proper subject of inquiry by the courts.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-18\">The Commission offers informal advice by its staff on a vast number of proxy solicitations.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Sheer volume of this wholesome activity belies Commission review in every such instance.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> It must be remembered that a dissatisfied stockholder is free to litigate proxy-so<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>licitation questions judicially, with or without prior administrative resort to the staff or the Commission.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> It is for the Commission to initially draw the line on administrative review of staff decisions in this area,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> and, we cannot say that its regulation<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> has done so unreasonably. And finding no legal fault in the Commission\u2019s discretionary exercise here, we are powerless to upset it.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Motion to dismiss granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\">.
