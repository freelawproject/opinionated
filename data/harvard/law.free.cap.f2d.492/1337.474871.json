The District of Columbia court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to transfer the action to the Southern District of Indiana inasmuch as plaintiff was confined as a prisoner in the United States Penitentiary at Terre Haute, Indiana. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a); Young v. United States Bureau of Prisons, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 105, 367 F.2d 331 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-6\">In his <em>pro se </em>complaint, plaintiff alleged that he was sentenced to 15 years in the custody of the Attorney General on November 7, 1969; that he \u201cappeared before the U.S. Board of Parole and was sent off for 2 years without cause or reason\u201d; and prayed that the court \u201cissue a show cause order to the U.S. Board of Parole to show why at this time\u201d he cannot be released on parole and otherwise to declare his. rights. He added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1402-7\">\u201cOne cannot improve or correct the reason for denial if he is not aware of that reason. What sureness is there, that one year or one month from this time he will be any different. Why he was denied, there is all the cause in the world for him to become bitter when one is being denied justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1402-8\">The defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court dismissed the complaint, noting that the plaintiff \u201cseeks a mandate from this Court ordering the respondents to show cause why petitioner was denied a parole\u201d and concluding that \u201cthis Court will not review the decision of the Parole Board, nor will it repass on the credibility of reports and information received by the Board in making its determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-13\">In his complaint and in his response to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss in the district court, the plaintiff stressed that his claim was based on failure of the Parole Board to give reasons for its denial of his application for parole. He cited the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act as giving him a right to have reasons expressed. A reasonably creditable but discursive brief was filed as plaintiff\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-14\">We subsequently granted leave to Professor Patrick L. Baude of Indiana University Law School as <em>amicus curiae </em>to file a brief and present oral argument on behalf of the plaintiff. Professor Baude has argued that (1) the Fifth Amendment forbids denial of parole without a stated reason and (2) the Administrative Procedure Act requires the Parole Board to state its reasons for denying parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-16\">The district court relied upon Brest v. Ciccone, 371 F.2d 981, 983 (8th Cir. 1967) where the conclusion was that \u201c[t]he courts have no jurisdiction and no power to . review or control the discretion of the Board of Parole in the exercise of its duties under \u00a7 4203.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>Two public bodies have taken diverse views on the question of the re-viewability of the Parole Board\u2019s discretion. The Task Force on Corrections for the President\u2019s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice recommended that reasons for the board\u2019s decision be given so that meaningful judicial review could be undertaken.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1403-5\">On the other hand, the Proposed New Federal Criminal Code of the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws sets forth that \u201cdiscretionary action of the Board of Parole is an administrative decision not subject to judicial review on its merits.\u201d Section 3406 of the proposed code reads:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1403-6\">\u201cThe federal courts shall not have jurisdiction to review or set aside, <em>except for the denial of constitutional rights or procedural rights conferred by statute, regulation or rule, </em>the discretionary action of the Board of Parole regarding but not limited to the release or deferment of release of a prisoner whose maximum term has not expired, the imposition or modification of conditions of a first or subsequent parole, and the reimprisonment of parolee for violation of parole conditions during the parole period.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1403-7\">We need not directly confront the problems of discretion or its abuse because the plaintiff has carefully limited his quest for reasons to the exceptions noted in the proposed code of \u201cdenial of constitutional rights or procedural rights conferred by statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-15\">Even if we agree that the district court has no jurisdiction to review the Parole Board\u2019s discretion under \u00a7 4203, it does have jurisdiction to consider at least the plaintiff\u2019s statutory claim that the Board has disobeyed a nondiscretionary command that it provide reasons for its determination after exercising its discretion. Christian v. New York State Dept. of Labor, 414 U.S. 614, 617, n. 3, 94 S.Ct. 747, 39 L.Ed.2d 38 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-16\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1403-17\">\u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1403-18\">Whether the district court .has jurisdiction to consider the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional claim in view of plaintiff\u2019s argument that the requisite amount in controversy (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331) is established by the possibility of his gaining earlier freedom, need not be addressed by us in view of our disposition of plaintiff\u2019s constitutional claim (Part IV hereof).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1403-19\">Before considering plaintiff\u2019s constitutional and statutory claims, it may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>helpful to review some recent administrative developments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-5\">The Administrative Conference of the United States, created by the Administrative Conference Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 571), consisting in part of all of the heads of independent regulatory agencies, executive departments and other administrative agencies (\u00a7 573(b)) and empowered to \u201cadopt such recommendations as it considers appropriate for approving administrative procedure\u201d (\u00a7 575(a)(1)), adopted the following recommendation on June 9, 1972:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1404-6\">\u201cA statement of reasons for the deferral or denial of parole should in all instances be given the prisoner. In some eases the Board can simply adopt as its own decision the examiner\u2019s recommendation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The cases where this is not appropriate may well be so voluminous<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as to require the use of a check-list form, such as that with which the Board is now experimenting,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but there should in each such case be added at least a sentence or two of individualized explanation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1404-17\">The Conference further recommended that the Parole Board \u201cshould develop a body of fully reasoned decisions \u2014 whether granting, denying or deferring parole \u2014in typical or recurrent fact situations\u201d in order to \u201cserve as time-saving precedents and as the raw material for the subsequent formulation of standards.\u201d Finally, in this area, the Conference recommended that the Board\u2019s decision should be open to public inspection.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1404-18\">In the preparation leading up to the Conference\u2019s recommendations, it developed the advantages inherent in giving reasons,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as well as the \u201cpitfalls to be avoided.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>The Parole Board has taken the position that it will experiment with giving reasons on a limited basis if doing so does not cause \u201cextensive delays in the delivery of parole decisions to inmates, resulting in rehabilitative damage outweighing any advantages.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Board has published a list of 27 unweighted factors which guide its decision whether to grant or deny parole,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but the Administrative Conference believes that \u201ca more specific formulation of the stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>ards of decision should be possible after the development of a body of reasoned decisions.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-4\">The Administrative Conference recommendations relating to the giving of reasons are the culmination of a long period of dissatisfaction with Parole Board procedure in this regard. Professor Kenneth Culp Davis has said:<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-5\">\u201cBecause no one ever knows the reason for any decision of the board, no prisoner is ever told why the board has denied parole. . . . Even the most flagrant abuse of discretion is likely to go uncorrected. Withholding reasons is likely to harm the rehabilitation process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1406-7\">Several states have instituted judicially or legislatively inspired requirements of reasons for the denial of parole.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-8\">The administrative trend is toward greater procedural safeguards in the parole release hearing, including the stating of reasons for denial, but the plaintiff can succeed only if such statement is constitutionally or statutorily mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-10\">It is no longer necessary to draw a hard and fast line between affording the full panoply of procedural due process or giving none. Categorization of \u201crights\u201d as opposed to privileges or acts of grace or clemency has ceased being a touchstone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-11\">Full procedural due process is required during a criminal prosecution; some but not full due process must be accorded thereafter during parole revocation proceedings. Parole release proceedings have not been as clearly identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-15\">Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 480-482, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) has established the benchmarks for parole revocation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-16\">\u201c. . ' . [T] he revocation of parole is not part of a criminal prosecution and thus the full panoply of rights due a defendant in such a proceeding does not apply to parole revocations. . Revocation deprives an individual, not of the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled, but only to the conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special parole restrictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-19\">\u201c. . . [D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-21\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-22\">\u201cWe see, therefore, that the liberty of a parolee, although indeterminate, includes many of the core values of unqualified liberty and its termination inflicts a \u2018grievous loss\u2019 on the parolee and often on others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1406-23\">The Court then determined the minimum requirements of due process, which included \u201ca written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on and the reasons for revoking parole.\u201d 408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. at 2604. Subsequently, the Court held that parole revocation hearings could be conducted without the participation of counsel. Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>The district court and circuit courts are now entering the area of what, if any, due process is required in parole release hearings.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Second Circuit Court of Appeals held in the <em>pre-Morrissey </em>case of Menechino v. Oswald, 430 F.2d 403, 404, 412 (2nd Cir. 1970) that a parole release interview \u201crepresents an aspect of state prison discipline, not an adjudication of rights in an adversary proceeding,\u201d and does not entitle a prisoner to notice, hearing or \u201cspecification of the grounds and underlying facts upon which the determination was based.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-5\">A panel of the Fifth Circuit also in a pr <em>e-Morrissey </em>decision in Scarpa v. United States Board of Parole, 468 F.2d 31 (5th Cir. 1972) held in effect that the interest of the prisoner is the same in a release hearing as in a revocation hearing. The panel decision was overturned by the court <em>en banc </em>which held that \u201c [i] f the Board refuses to grant parole, Scarpa has suffered no deprivations.\u201d 477 F.2d 278, 282 (5th Cir. 1973).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The <em>Scarpa </em>judgment was vacated by the Supreme Court and remanded for consideration of mootness. 414 U.S. 809, 94 S.Ct. 79, 38 L.Ed.2d 44 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-6\">A district court has held that due process requires the Board of Parole to disclose to the prisoner the grounds on which parole is denied. United States ex rel. Johnson v. Chairman of New York State Board of Parole, 363 F.Supp. 416 (E.D.N.Y.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-7\">We have held that in-prison disciplinary proceedings leading' to the revocation of good-time credits require some \u201cwritten statement of the disposition of the charge.\u201d United States ex rel. Miller v. Twomey, 479 F.2d 701, 716 (7th Cir. 1973). On the other hand, in Farries v. United States Board of Parole, 484 F.2d 948, 949 (7th Cir. 1973), we cited Menechino v. Oswald, <em>supra, </em>for the proposition that \u201ca prisoner need not be accorded a hearing on his application [for parole] or provided with a statement of reasons.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Petitioner argues that <em>Menechino </em>is no longer acceptable authority because it was decided before <em>Morrissey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1407-12\">Although a substantial argument can be made that some modicum of due process should attend the denial of the expectation of conditional freedom on parole inasmuch as its termination after having been granted inflicts a \u201cgrievous loss\u201d of a \u201cvaluable liberty\u201d (Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 482, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972)), we need not meet the constitutional challenge in view of the construction we place upon the Administrative Procedure Act in Part Y hereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-13\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-14\">The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) applies to each \u201cagency\u201d which means \u201ceach authority of the Government of the United States.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(1). Congress created the United States Parole Board in the Department of Justice, consisting of eight members to be appointed by the President by and with the consent of the Senate. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4201. There is no language in the APA exempting the Parole Board from its application.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>In Hyser v. Reed, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 254, 318 F.2d 225, 236-237 (1963) Mr. Chief Justice (then Judge) Burger wrote the <em>en banc </em>opinion holding that \u00a7 554 of the APA did not apply to parole revocation proceedings inasmuch as that section applies by its terms \"in every case of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(a). The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1408-4\">\u201cThese words limit coverage of the Administrative Procedure Act to agencies which are required by their own statute of creation to <em>adjudicate, </em>after <em>hearing. </em>Our conception of the functions of the Board, discussed in this opinion, leads us to the conclusion that the Board does not adjudicate, nor is it required to hold hearings, in the sense that those words are employed in the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1408-5\">The <em>Hyser </em>court did not consider \u00a7 555(e) which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1408-6\">\u201cPrompt notice shall be given of the denial in whole or in part of a written application, petition, or other request of an interested person made in connection with any agency proceeding.

Adjudication is defined as \u201cagency process for the formulation of an order.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7551(5), (7), (9), (12).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1408-15\">A parole release hearing or interview is an \u201cagency proceeding\u201d within the Congressional intent:<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"azx-dedup-0\">\u201cThis subsection affords the parties in any- agency proceeding, <em>whether or not formal or upon hearing, </em>the right to prompt action upon their requests, immediate notice of such action, and a statement of the actual grounds therefore.

When the nature of his crime is such that early parole is not likely in any event, he should be protected from unrealistic hopes that can only lead to disappointment and bitterness. All this is the job of a prison counselor in any case, but the Parole Board can make that job much easier by formally stating its reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-22\">\u201cProm the legal standpoint, requiring a statement of reasons makes it possible to check abuse or error.

First, it would be disastrous to introduce any further delay into parole decision-making. One of the most frequent criticisms of the Board today is that it keeps prisoners in suspense for too long. It would be better not to give reasons at all than to give them and spend weeks or months drafting them. Second, it is vital that <em>the </em>reasons be written <em>to </em>give the prisoner a fair and candid statement of why he is not being paroled, and not merely to satisfy the courts. Nothing would be gained by giving reasons if the Board retained a legal staff to draft them with an eye to justifying the decision in the event of litigation. The Board must state why it is denying parole, and not necessarily how it feels the denial might be most persuasively justified in court. Third, the reasons must be reasonably specific. It does no good to tell a prisoner he is being denied parole because he is a danger to society unless he is told why he is so regarded, and whether there is anything he can do to convince the Board otherwise.\u201d 25 Ad.L.Rev. 459, 485 (Fall, 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1405-7\">.
