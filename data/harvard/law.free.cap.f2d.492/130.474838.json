Accordingly, this case has been rendered moot and is remanded to the district court with directions to vacate its judgment and dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint. <em>See </em>Armendariz v. Hershey, 413 F.2d 1006 (5th Cir. 1969); Taylor v. United States, 410 F.2d 392 (5th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-12\">. Appellant did not bring a class action nor did he seek damages for the alleged inadequate medical services dispensed within the Dallas County Jail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-13\">. This court was informed by counsel for both parties that appellant was transferred from the Dallas County Jail pursuant to a recent Texas law which directs the transfer of convicted defendants to state prisons pending their appeal to the state appellate courts. Article 42.09 of the Vernon\u2019s Ann.Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-24\">If a defendant is convicted of a felony and sentenced to death, life, or a term of more than fifteen years in the Department of Corrections and he gives notice of appeal, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>shall be transferred to the Department of Corrections on a commitment pending a mandate from the Court of Criminal Appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-25\">It is our understanding that this legislation was enacted to eliminate the extreme overcrowded conditions of the county jails. Appellant along with many other prisoners in the same status was transferred to the state prison to alleviate the crowded conditions in the Dallas County Jail. There is no showing here that the county authorities had appellant transferred to moot this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
