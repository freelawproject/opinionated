At that time, the jury was polled and each juror stated that the verdict \u201cwas and is\u2019\u2019 his or her verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">At the prosecutor\u2019s request, the attorneys were permitted to speak to the jurors about the case. As a result of such conversations, defense counsel\u2019s post trial motions included a motion for a hearing on inquiries made by the jury in the course of their deliberations (hearing on inquiries) \u201cin order to determine the number and substance of inquiries made by the jury to the Court in the course of their deliberations . . .\u201d Attached to the motion was defense counsel\u2019s affidavit stating that in telephone conversations with the forelady and two other jurors he had learned that \u201cthree inquiries made of the Court by the jury never reached the Court.\u2019\u2019 The inquiries all concerned the possibility of reaching a nonunanimous verdict. The responses were to the effect that the jury must keep deliberating and reach a unanimous verdict.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-19\">In ruling on the motion for a hearing on inquiries, the trial judge questioned the bailiff, Thomas Goe, under oath who testified that he knew of only one inquiry made by the jury and that inquiry was answered by the court. The trial judge added that his notes showed only one inquiry was directed to him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court denied the motion for a hearing on inquiries on the basis that assuming <em>ar-guendo </em>that the communications between the bailiff and the jury occurred, they were not prejudicial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-20\">On April 7, 1970, defense counsel filed a motion to reconsider the original motion for a hearing on inquiries. The motion was supported by the affidavits of seven jurors and two bailiffs. Subsequently, the affidavit of a deputy sheriff was filed. The affidavits of the jurors indicated that three or four inquiries concerning the alternatives to a unanimous verdict had been made<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>about 3% hours into deliberations when the jury stood nine for acquittal, two for guilty of voluntary manslaughter and one for guilty of murder. Some of the jurors indicated that these communications had influenced the verdict. The affidavit of Bailiff Domitila Rodriquez stated that the buzzer had been rung at least two or three times and Thomas Goe had responded on these occasions. The affidavit of the deputy sheriff Grover Weiss, stated that two or three times during the course of deliberations \u201cthe jury made inquiries to the effect: \u2018What happens if we cannot reach a verdict? \u2019 \u201d and that the bailiff \u201cToni\u201d (Bailiff Rodriquez) had answered that \u201cthey should keep deliberating until they reached a decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">At the April 15, 1970 hearing, defense counsel cross examined Bailiff Goe who reaffirmed his prior testimony but also admitted that it was possible that another bailiff could have answered a jury call. The State did not present any evidence contrary to the affidavits but argued that portions of the affidavits were attempts to impeach the jury\u2019s verdict. The court then announced that it was considering the proceedings on the motion for a hearing on inquiries as a hearing itself for the purpose of determining whether defendant was entitled to a new trial. Indicating that it had considered the trial court record, all the affidavits filed by the defense except those portions which referred to the effect of the alleged communications on the jury deliberations, the testimony of Bailiff Goe, the written instructions given to the jury,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> arguments of counsel, the polling of the jury, and the court\u2019s own knowledge of certain events during deliberations,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the court denied the motion for a new trial. The court specifically found that the evidence clearly established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, that Goe\u2019s communication with the jurors was not intended to influence the deliberations, that the polling of the jury conclusively established that the communication did not affect the verdict, and that the defendant had not been prejudiced. In response to a question from defense counsel, the court additionally stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-21\">\u201cThe Court finds that the only evidence of any communication established here is the communication testified to by Mr. Goe in the manner and form as stated by Mr. Goe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>On direct appeal, the Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed the conviction. People v. Tobe, 49 Ill.2d 538, 276 N.E.2d 294 (1971). The court in pertinent part found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">\u201cThe trial court did not err in not setting aside the verdict because the defendant was not present at the time of the communication, as the defendant says was necessary. As was stated in <em>Mills, </em>[People v. Mills, 40 Ill.2d 4, 237 N.E.2d 697 (1968)] if there was a communication to the jury by the court outside the presence of the defendant and it is apparent that no prejudice resulted, the verdict will not be set aside. We do not judge that the communication between the jurors and the bailiffs was coercive and prejudicial as the defendant claims. Considering the length of the trial [5 days] and the time the jury spent in deliberating [approximately 7 hours], we do not believe it can be reasonably said that the statements of the bailiffs, that the jurors should continue to deliberate until they reached a verdict can be regarded as coercive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">People v. Tobe, 49 Ill.2d at 543-544, 276 N.E.2d at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">On June 9, 1972, defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court together with a supporting memorandum seeking issuance of the writ or alternatively an evi-dentiary hearing on the ground that the alleged jury communications violated his sixth amendment right to a fair and impartial jury. On September 26, 1972, respondents filed a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) (6) motion to dismiss. By Memorandum Opinion and Order on December 18, 1972, 352 F.Supp. 218, the district court denied the motion to dismiss on the grounds that the state trial court\u2019s finding of a single communication was not supported by the record<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that although the Illinois Supreme Court considered all the alleged communications in determining the question of prejudice, it failed to evaluate them in light of the principles set forth in \u201cAllen charge\u201d cases. The court allowed the parties time to submit any additional documentary evidence or to request a hearing for the presentation of testimonial evidence. Based on the trial record and the only additional evidence submitted, a further affidavit of the forelady of the jury, the district court issued a second Memorandum Opinion and Order granting the petition for writ of habeas corpus (February 22, 1973). The court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-10\">\u201c(1) on more than one occasion, a bailiff or bailiffs responded, without the trial judge\u2019s knowledge, to inquiries from the deliberating jury as to what they should do if they were deadlocked ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-11\">(2) the essence of these responses was that the jury had to keep deliberating and reach a verdict;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-12\">(3) none of the responses contained the admonition that no juror should relinquish his conscien<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>tiously held convictions to join in a majority verdict;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">(4) respondents have failed to show that the responses were not coercive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">(5) the nature of the responses involved such a probability of prejudice that they must be deemed to have caused an inherent lack of due process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\"> In Illinois, a jury verdict will not be set aside upon the occurrence of a communication between the jury and the court or some third person outside the presence of the defendant where it is apparent that no prejudice has resulted. People v. Mills, 40 Ill.2d 4, 14-15, 237 N.E.2d 697, 702-703 (1968); People v. Tilley, 411 Ill. 473, 477-478, 104 N.E.2d 499, 501-502 (1952); People v. Brothers, 347 Ill. 530, 548, 180 N.E. 442, 447-448 (1932). In an attempt to make a showing of prejudice based on the affidavits of jury members, actual evidence of the nature of outside influences exerted on the jury during deliberations will be considered, but evidence relating to the effect of such influences on the mental processes of jury members is inadmissible. People v. Pulaski, 15 Ill.2d 291, 300, 155 N.E.2d 29, 34 (1958). Because the actual effect of the conduct on the minds of the jury cannot be proved, the Illinois Supreme Court has held that the standard to be applied is whether the \u201cconduct involved \u2018such a probability that prejudice will result, that it is [to be] deemed inherently lacking in due process.\u2019 Estes v. State of Texas, 381 U.S. 532, 542-543, 85 S.Ct. 1628, 1633, 14 L.Ed.2d 543.\u201d People v. Tobe, 49 Ill.2d at 544, 276 N.E.2d at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">In Parker v. Gladden, 385 U.S. 363, 87 S.Ct. 468, 17 L.Ed.2d 420 (1966), the Supreme Court of the United States reversed the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s approval of the defendant\u2019s conviction where the trial court bailiff told one juror that the \u201cwicked fellow was guilty\u201d and told another, juror that the Supreme Court would correct an erroneous guilty verdict. There one of the jurors testified that she was prejudiced by the statements. In the present case, one juror said that \u201cshe signed a verdict in which she didn\u2019t believe\u201d and another juror said he knew that the bailiffs statements \u201cinfluenced others [of the jurors] to reach the verdict.\u201d People v. Tobe, 49 Ill.2d 538, 542, 276 N.E.2d 294, 297 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">In <em>Parker, </em>the Supreme Court said, 385 U.S. at 364 and 366, 87 S.Ct. at 470, 471:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-12\">\u201cWe believe that the statements of the bailiff to the jurors are controlled by the command of the Sixth Amendment, made applicable to the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It guarantees that \u2018the accused shall enjoy the right to a . . . trial, by an impartial jury . . . \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-14\">. . In any event, petitioner was entitled to be tried by 12, not 9 or even 10, impartial and unprejudiced jurors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-16\">The <em>Parker </em>court further pointed out \u201cthat the official character of the bailiff \u2014as' an officer of the court as well as the State \u2014 beyond question carries great weight with a jury . . . .\u201d (385 U.S. at 365, 87 S.Ct. at 470).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-18\">In Jenkins v. United States, 380 U.S. 445, 85 S.Ct. 1059, 13 L.Ed.2d 957 (1965), the defendant\u2019s conviction was reversed because the jury after two hours sent a note to the trial judge that it was unable to agree upon a verdict whereupon the judge recalled the jury to the courtroom and said that \u201cyou have got to reach a decision in this case.\u201d The Supreme Court said, 380 U.S. at page 446, 85 S.Ct. at page 1060:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-19\">. . [W]e conclude that in its context and under all the circumstances the judge\u2019s statement had the coercive effect attributed to it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>In the present case, it is immaterial whether the jurors believed that the bailiffs were or, as is more probable, the judge through the bailiffs was telling them over and over again in one form or another that \u201cYou must reach a decision.\u201d In either ease the statements were not only probably but were presumptively coercive and prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Evidence of communications during deliberations concerning the case on trial outside the presence of defendant and his counsel are presumptively prejudicial. This presumption must be rebutted by evidence showing that the communications were harmless or lacked prejudice. Remmer v. United States, 347 U.S. 227, 229, 74 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed. 654 (1954) (citing Mattox v. United States, 146 U.S. 140, 148-150, 13 S.Ct. 50, 36 L.Ed. 917 (1892); Wheaton v. United States, 133 F.2d 522, 527 (8th Cir. 1943)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\"> In the instant case, the question of whether the alleged communications were harmless was never confronted by the state trial judge inasmuch as he denied the occurrence of all inquiries except the one that actually reached the court. This determination in the face of uncontradicted affidavits was erroneous. The Supreme Court of Illinois, while not directly commenting on this erroneous finding, nevertheless considered the question of lack of prejudice in light of all the alleged occurrences. This assumption that all the alleged inquiries took place is inconsistent with its determination that the defendant was given a meaningful hearing on this point. A hearing cannot be \u201cmeaningful\u201d when the judge ignores uncontradicted evidence. By denying that other inquiries took place, the judge did not \u201cdetermine whether the bailiffs prejudiced the defendant\u2019s right . , .\u201d People v. Tobe, 49 Ill.2d at 542, 276 N.E.2d at 297.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consequently, this error resulted in the question of prejudice never having been adequately determined and the presumption that prejudice did exist was never rebutted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">Finally, the answers to the . jury\u2019s questions were all, as the district judge found, \u201cakin to an \u2018Allen charge\u2019 instruction, without the admonition that no juror should relinquish his conscientiously held convictions to join in a majority verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> These statements have a coercive effect resulting in prejudice to the defendant where they are void of such an admonition.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-15\"> The peculiar circumstances of this case do not expunge these communications of the coercive effects of variations of the Allen charge of this ilk. The fact that the answers came from bailiffs rather than a judge is irrelevant (see discussion of Parker v. Gladden, supra).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The fact that the majority\u2019s view of the case was not reinforced by the responses does not show, as the pros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>ecution argued, that Allen-type coercion was lacking. Although the Allen charge cases generally have been concerned with pressure exerted on the minority, any influence which emphasizes the importance of agreement to the exclusion of the dictates of conscience is coercive and prejudicial. <em>See </em>United States v. Thomas, 146 U.S.App.D.C. 101, 449 F.2d 1177, 1187 (1971) (enbanc).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Finally, although the jury was polled, we do not think that circumstance by itself established a lack of prejudice foreclosing further inquiry. United States v. Grosso, 358 F.2d 154, 160 (3rd Cir. 1966). In eases where the coercion is not obvious, such as a bribe or threat, this approach would leave the question of coercion to the jury members and they are not empowered to determine what amounts to legal coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Under all the circumstances of this case, the district court\u2019s grant of the petition for writ of habeas corpus was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-6\">.

Although Goe testified that he did not know of and had not been told of any further communications, he also testified that he was not present outside of the jury room at all times during the deliberations. And although the judge recalled only one inquiry, he could not be expected to know of others made after the jury knocked on the door.
