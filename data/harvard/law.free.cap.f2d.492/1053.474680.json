His right of recovery is predicated on Section 5595(b), 5 U.S.C., and jurisdiction rests on Section 1346, 28 U.S.C. The District Court granted the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment against plaintiff. The plaintiff has appealed. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>Plaintiff was a career employee of the Soil Conservation Service in the Department of Agriculture. He was notified on July 17, 1968 that he was to be transferred to a new duty station, some 250 miles from his then current station, and promoted to a higher pay grade, effective August 12, 1968. Citing financial, personal, and family reasons, the validity of which are not contested, he informed his superiors of his inability to change his residence and to accept the administrative transfer. He, however, expressed his willingness to accept an assignment to any duty station within a reasonable commuting distance from his residence, even at a reduction in pay grade. Following failure to report to his new duty station as ordered, he was discharged. Appeals from the order of discharge to both the Department of Agriculture and the Civil Service Commission proved fruitless. He then filed for severance pay, as provided for in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5595(b). The claim was disallowed on the ground that his discharge was \u201cfor cause\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">The sole issue on appeal is whether or not, as a matter of law, plaintiff\u2019s discharge was \u201cvoluntary\u201d or \u201cfor cause\u201d, so that he is excluded from the coverage of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5595(b) and thus not entitled to severance pay. Section 5595(b) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1118-5\">\u201cUnder regulations prescribed by the President or such officer or agency as he may designate, an employee whog \u2014 (1) has been employed currently for a continuous period of at least 12 months; and (2) is involuntarily separated from the service, not by removal for cause on charges of misconduct, delinquency, or inefficiency; is entitled to be paid severance pay in regular pay periods by the agency from which separated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">The terms \u201cinvoluntarily separated\u201d and \u201cremoval for cause\u201d, as used in the statute, are not defined by the regulations promulgated pursuant to such statute by the Civil Service Commission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, the regulations in effect at the time of plaintiff\u2019s discharge did not state whether or not an employee who refuses to accept an administrative transfer and is separated from the Service is entitled to severance pay. In such regulations, however, it was recognized that Section 5595(b), 5 U.S.C. was to be given a liberal and generous construction. Thus, Section 550.705 of the Regulations provided expressly that, \u201c[T]he separation of an employee by a department when the employee declines to accompany his position when it is moved to another commuting area because of a transfer of function is deemed to be an involuntary separation not by removal for cause on charges of misconduct, delinquency, or inefficiency, for purposes of entitlement to severance pay.\u201d It is conceded by both parties that this regulation did not, at the time of the termination of plaintiff\u2019s services, explicitly apply to an administrative transfer such as involved in this case. The Government contends that the absence of any specific reference to administrative tranfers as a basis for an \u201cinvoluntary separation\u201d is decisive and that the \u201ctransfer of function\u201d situation constituted, in 1968, the only exception to the general rule that all similar separations were voluntary. Plaintiff argues, on the other hand, that Section 550.705 of the Regulations, expressive as it was of a liberal construction of what was plainly intended by Congress as a generous provision for Government employees whose services were terminated, was not intended by its reference to terminations of employment resulting from \u201ctransfer of function\u201d to limit or restrict the operation of the statute exclusively to that single type of termination. As the plaintiff points out, there is no rational basis for any distinction between separations resulting from \u201ctransfer of function\u201d and those resulting from administrative transfer, nor did either the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>statute or Regulations indicate any reason or intent to make such a distinction. Clearly, the rationale for construing a \u201ctransfer of function\u201d as involuntary is no greater than that for construing an \u201cadministrative transfer\u201d as involuntary. And the Commission apparently recognized this, for in 1971 it amended its regulation so as to make clear that both administrative transfers and transfers of function 'were to be treated as involuntary separations entitling the employee to severance pay.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">The Government argues, however, that the 1971 amendment indicates a reversal, and not simply a clarification, of the Regulation as it had previously existed. To support such argument, the Government, as did the District Court, relies upon a so-called \u201cinterpretation\u201d of the Regulation contained in the Federal Personnel Manual Supplement 990-2, compiled and published by the Civil Service Commission. Under the general heading, \u201cFailure to Accompany Activity,\u201d which would appear to refer to transfers of function and not administrative transfers, the Commission listed two situations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-6\">\u201c(i) <em>Regulation. </em>\u2018The separation of an employee by a department when the employee declines to accompany his position when it is moved to another commuting area because of a transfer of function is deemed to be an involuntary separation not by removal for cause on charges of misconduct, delinquency, or inefficiency, for purposes of entitlement to severance pay.\u2019 (Section 550.705)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-7\">\u201c(ii) <em>Administrative reassignment. </em>Separation for failure to report for duty upon reassignment to a different position at another location outside the commuting area after having been directed to do so constitutes removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency. (See Comp. Gen. decision B-159029 of June 17, 1966).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1119-11\">The first statement is obviously a direct quotation from the version of Section 550.705 of the Regulations then in force, a regulation whose authority is not contested. But the second statement, which the Government argues represented a departmental interpretation, does not flow from any regulation and finds no basis in any regulation issued by the Civil Service Commission itself, which, by delegation,' is the sole authority to issue valid regulations under Section 5595(b), 5 U.S.C. It cites as its sole authority a 1966 decision of the Comptroller General. The Comptroller General was given no authority under the Act to issue regulations thereunder or to issue what in this case would represent pre-is-suance interpretations by one governmental agency of regulations thereafter issued by another governmental agency. It was never issued as an official interpretation by the Commission and it was incorporated in the Personnel Manual with no basis in either the Statute or in any regulation issued by the agency which was alone authorized to issue such regulations. Contrary as it is to the liberal intent and purposes of Section 5595(b), the opinion of the Comptroller General, which purported to interpret no outstanding regulation of the Commission and which was incorporated in the Personnel Manual as stating an opinion of the Comptroller General and not as an official interpretation by the Commission of the scope of the Statute, will not support a denial of severance pay in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-12\">Reversed and remanded with directions to grant plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1118-8\">.

Section 550.705, 5 C.F.R now provides that \u201cWhen an employee is separated because he declines to accept assignment to another commuting area, the separation is an involuntary separation not by removal for cause on charges of misconduct, delinquency, or inefficiency for purpose of entitlement to severance pay, unless his position description or other written agreement or understanding provides for these assignments.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
