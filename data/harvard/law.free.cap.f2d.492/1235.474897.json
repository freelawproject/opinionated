Y. CHURCH STREET STA. 78 JAN 25 P M.\u201d There is no showing that the date of actual receipt was earlier than the stamped date, and petitioner does not contend otherwise. Inasmuch as the final order of the Customs Court from which the appeal is taken was entered November 29, 1973,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the filing of the notice of appeal appears to be one day later than the sixty-day period provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-20\">The motion is accompanied by an affidavit setting forth that the notice of appeal was placed in the U. S. mail depository at 401 Broadway, New York, New York 10013 at approximately 1:30 P.M. on Friday, January 25, 1974, and that in the affiant\u2019s experience normal mail delivery from said depository to points in the Washington, D. C., area is almost al-. ways overnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-21\">In its memorandum in support of the motion, petitioner cites 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601(a) and Rule 3.1(a) of this court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>support its proposition that \u201cFiling within sixty days ... is not a requirement of the applicable statute or rule.\u201d However, petitioner apparently has overlooked section 2601(b), which provides: \u201cAn appeal is made by filing in the office of the clerk of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals a notice of appeal . . . .\u201d Rule 3.1(a) of this court, which provides that any party dissatisfied with any appealable decision of the Customs Court may have a review thereof \u201cby filing a notice of appeal, in duplicate, in the office of the clerk of this court,\u201d could hardly enlarge the statutory sixty-day period. Rule 26(b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure specifies that \u201cthe court may not enlarge the time for filing a notice of appeal . ...\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">The above-referred-to affidavit, citing signed certified mail receipts, shows that the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, Customs Section, the Assistant Chief Counsel for Customs Court Litigation, and the Customs Court received copies of the notice of appeal on January 28, 1974. Therefore, petitioner argues that \u201cthe government\u201d has not been prejudiced and (in substance) that it should not object to using the date of mailing rather than the date of filing, which was delayed \u201cbecause of the inordinately long period of time taken by the U. S. Postal Service to deliver the appeal.\u201d However, \u201cthe government\u201d to which petitioner refers is the Department of Justice, which is part of the executive branch of our federal government. Being charged with execution of the laws, it must object if it perceives that the law enacted by the legislative branch would be violated by using anything other than the filing date of the notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-9\">Finally, if there should be any doubt over the meaning of \u201cfiling,\u201d Rule 25(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that \u201cfiling shall not be timely unless the papers are <em>received by the clerk </em>within the time fixed for filing . . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072, these rules, after promulgation by the Supreme Court, were reported to the Congress at or after the beginning of a regular session thereof and became effective more than ninety days after they had been thus reported. No action having been taken by the Congress with respect to Rule 25(a), Congressional approval thereof and of its interpretation of what constitutes \u201cfiling\u201d is to be presumed. Accordingly, any relief from the interpretation of \u201cfiling\u201d provided by this rule must be sought by way of general or special legislation of the Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-11\">It is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-12\">Ordered that petitioner\u2019s motion be, and hereby is, denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1299-11\">.
