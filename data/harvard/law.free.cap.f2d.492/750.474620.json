We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-23\">As is normal to appeals at the pleading stage, the factual background is skeletal, and the principal source of the following recital is taken from the record developed in connection with the motion for injunctive relief. Leeds Shoes, Inc. (Leeds) is a Florida corporation engaged in the retail sale of shoes and related items, which has its principal office in Tampa. Leeds is the corporate successor to a partnership created by Frank Garcia and another individual. From Leeds\u2019 inception until December 1967, Garcia apparently was its driving force as president of the company, major common stockholder, and a member of the Board of Directors. Leeds became publicly owned in 1963, although Garcia continued to hold approximately 26% of the outstanding common stock through at least August 1967. At the fiscal year end April 30, 1967, Leeds\u2019 fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>nancial prospects on paper appeared optimistic. In August 1967, ostensibly to provide more working capital, Leeds issued and sold to the public 1.5 million dollars in convertible 6% subordinated debentures due August 1, 1987. This offering was registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and pursuant to that Act a registration statement and prospectus were filed with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Later in 1967 it became apparent that the glam-our of Leeds\u2019 financial reports was cosmetic. Leeds\u2019 audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended April 30, 1966 and 1967 contained overstatements of such items as cash, inventories, fixed assets, total assets, retained earnings, and earnings per common share. These overstatements were repeated in the prospectus published for the August 1967 registered sale of debentures. Additionally, Leeds\u2019 annual reports to shareholders, SEC filings and press releases apparently contained misstatements. On December 12, 1967 the SEC suspended trading in Leeds\u2019 securities pending clarification of Leeds\u2019 financial condition. Subsequently, Garcia pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with wilful misstatements in the debenture prospectus and resigned his positions as officer and director of Leeds, and two individual members of the accounting firm serving as Leeds\u2019 auditors pleaded guilty to wilful obstruction of justice and of an SEC investigation by burning important records and ledgers relevant to the company\u2019s financial condition for the five year period ending April 30, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">After it became apparent that the August 1967 debenture prospectus contained substantial material misstatements of Leeds\u2019 financial condition, Leeds\u2019 management, the underwriters who participated in the debenture offering, Genesco (Leeds\u2019 principal supplier of shoes and only preferred shareholder), and Prudential Insurance Company of America (the major creditor of Leeds<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) agreed upon a \u201crefinancing plan\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In summary, this plan involved the following steps: (1) an increase in the conversion value of the debentures by Leeds; <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (2) an agreement to purchase more preferred shares by Genesco; (3) a two year moratorium on annual principal payments for its outstanding loan and a commitment to loan more money by Prudential; (4) a commitment by the underwriters to purchase any of the outstanding debentures which were tendered and convert them to common stock at the reduced conversion rate; (5) the release, waiver, and assignment by selling debenture holders of all claims against Leeds and its directors and officers other than Garcia; and (6) a purchase of an amount of authorized but unissued Leeds\u2019 common stock by A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons, Inc., one of the underwriters. The plan obligations of Ge-nesco, Prudential, A. G. Edwards and the other underwriters were contingent upon acceptance of the plan (by sale or conversion) of 80% of the debenture holders. Debenture conversion was to be into authorized but unissued Leeds\u2019 common shares at the increased rate. Conversion did not release, waive or assign any claim, but debenture holders were warned that such conversion could have adverse effects on any claims they had.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">On September 18, 1968 a letter was mailed to Leeds\u2019 shareholders and debenture holders briefly explaining the catas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>trophic events which had befallen the company, outlining its financial condition and summarizing the terms of the refinancing plan. The letter also stated that, if full effectuation of the plan occurred, the book value of Leeds\u2019 common stock would ultimately be increased \u2014 the company would obtain needed working capital; and it would be helped in avoiding potential defaults on its existing indebtedness. The tenor of the letter is informational, and it does not expressly call for the common shareholders to vote on the plan. Although the letter mentions that certain of Leeds\u2019 SEC filings and the debenture prospectus appear to be \u201cinaccurate,\u201d it does not specifically describe any potential liabilities incurred as a result of the debenture offering.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the date of the letter\u2019s mailing, the 1968 annual stockholders meeting, required by Leeds\u2019 bylaws to be held on September 14 of each year, had not been held, and no such meeting was held until August, 1969. The requisite number of debenture holders accepted '.the plan. Shortly after the September 18 letter was mailed, the SEC resumed trading in Leeds\u2019 securities, and the refinancing plan became a reality. Leeds continues to be an operating company, although the selling price of its stock is well below pre-1968 levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">This action originally was brought in the Southern District of New York in</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">May 1970. In April 1971 it was transferred to the Middle District of Florida<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and in October 1971 the plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint, an extensive document, the sufficiency of which is the major subject of this appeal. The individual named plaintiffs are nine common shareholders <em>? </em>of Leeds. They sue for themselves and'' on behalf of a class consisting of the. \u201cbeneficial owners of Leeds\u2019 common stock at the close of business on December 12, 1967.\u201d They seek damages both individually, and derivatively on behalf of Leeds, for alleged past Exchange Act violations and mandatory and prohibitive injunctive relief to rectify certain continuing practices of Leeds\u2019 management. Damages are alleged to be 20,000,000 dollars. The defendants are Genesco, Inc. and Genesco Financial, Inc.;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the underwriters involved in the debenture offering and the refinancing plan;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> past and present directors and officers of Leeds;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and members of the accounting firm of Buchman, Endsley and McCormick which \u201cacted as Leeds\u2019 independent accountants at the time of the acts in question.\u201d The second amended complaint contains four counts. Count I alleges various misstatements as to Leeds\u2019 financial condition published in Leeds\u2019 annual report, financial statements, the debenture prospectus, SEC filings, and the financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>media. It seeks direct relief in the form of damages. Count II complains generally of the 1968 \u201crefinancing plan\u201d, but its major thrust is directed at alleged misstatements and omissions in the September 18, 1968 letter to Leeds\u2019 security holders. The relief sought in Count II is both direct and derivative in nature. Count III seeks mandatory and prohibitive injunctive relief against Leeds\u2019 present management based upon asserted continuing violations of the securities laws. Count IV is framed as a state claim based on pendent jurisdiction seeking damages for the same activities as Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">After hearing evidence on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, the district court found that the requisite probability of success on the merits and threatened irreparable harm were lacking and denied preliminary relief under Count III.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the same opinion the court granted the motions to dismiss the remainder of the complaint filed by all defendants but Garcia. Counts I and II were apparently dismissed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. With these counts out of the way, the district court concluded that Count III by itself could not support permanent injunctive relief and dismissed that count also. Count IV was dismissed for plaintiffs\u2019 failure to post a bond required by state law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The dismissal of Count I, portions of Count II, and Count III was initially without prejudice and with leave to amend and plead in accordance with the requirements set forth in the district court\u2019s order of dismissal. No amendment having been made, the court directed the entry of final judgment as to all counts in favor of all defendants but Garcia, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). The plaintiffs bring this appeal from the final judgment on Counts I, II, and III and from the district court\u2019s failure to grant a preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">COUNT I</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">Count I is based on section 10b of the Exchange Act and rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5. This count alleges that during 1966 and 1967 the defendant officers and directors of Leeds \u201cunlawfully, willfully and knowingly or having reason to know\u201d published or caused to be published untrue statements about the financial condition of Leeds for the fiscal year ending April 30, 1967, which misstatements included gross overstatement of earnings and assets. It alleges that Leeds\u2019 accountants \u201cknew or had reason to know of the false statements anil omissions.\u201d Similarly, it asserts that the defendants claimed to be controlling persons of Leeds \u201cknew or had reason to know of the false statements and induced them in bad faith\u201d; and that the defendant underwriters \u201cknew or had reason to know by reason of their confidential relationship to Leeds of the false statements and omissions\u201d, but nevertheless consented to republication of the false information. Finally, Count I sets out that plaintiffs relied upon these false statements and omissions in purchasing Leeds\u2019 stock in 1967 and \u201cpurchased such stock in a market artificially inflated by the false statements and omissions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">Considering privity, <em>i. e., </em>a direct purchaser-seller relationship between plaintiffs and defendants to be an essential allegation which plaintiffs would not or could not allege, the district court dismissed Count I. On this appeal all defendants urge not only that the privity requirement was correctly applied below but that the district court erred in ruling that the cause of action was not barred by the statute of limitations. The defendant \u201cunderwriters\u201d additionally argue that the complaint was prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>erly dismissed as to them, because its allegations, are insufficient to support the elements of scienter and causation required by 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The federal securities laws contain no limitation period that is expressly applicable to claims under section 10(b) and rule 10b-5, nor does federal law prescribe any general statute of limitations for civil actions. Consequently, the limitation period which the forum state applies to the state remedy which bears the closest substantive resemblance to rule 10b-5 and which best effectuates its purpose is to be applied. <em>See e. g., </em>Azalea Meats v. Muscat, 386 F.2d 5 (5th Cir. 1967); Vanderboom v. Sexton, 422 F.2d 1233 (8th Cir.), cert. denied 400 U.S. 852, 91 S.Ct. 47, 27 L.Ed.2d 90 (1970); and International Union, United Auto., etc., Workers v. Hoosier Cardinal Corp., 383 U.S. 696, 86 S.Ct. 1107, 16 L.Ed.2d 192 (1966). However, the date when a claim accrues so as to trigger the state law limitation period is a matter of federal law, and our court-fashioned rule is that a 10b-5 claim accrues when the plaintiff actually discovers the alleged fraud. <em>See, e. g., </em>Hooper v. Mountain States Securities Corp., 282 F.2d 195, 200 (5th Cir.) cert. denied, 365 U.S. 814, 81 S.Ct. 695, 5 L.Ed.2d 693 (1960); and Azalea Meats v. Muscat, <em>supra, </em>386 F.2d at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The defendants argue that notwithstanding this court\u2019s decision in Azalea Meats v. Muscat, <em>supra, </em>which applied Florida\u2019s three year limitation period for common law fraud to a 10b-5 action, the limitation period that should be applied is the two-year statute applicable to the Florida blue sky laws, Fla.Stat. \u00a7 517.21, F.S.A. They assert that the plaintiffs\u2019 discovery of the alleged fraudulent misstatements could have oe-curred no later than December 12, 1967 when the SEC suspended trading in Leeds\u2019 stock and, since this action was originally filed on May 4, 1970, it is barred under the two-year blue sky limitation period. To support this position that the blue sky limitation period is applicable', defendants rely mainly on Vanderboom v. Sexton, <em>supra, </em>and Parrent v. Midwest Rug Mills, 455 F.2d 123 (7th Cir. 1972);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>but see, e. g., </em>Charney v. Thomas, 372 F.2d 97 (6th Cir. 1967). Our resolution of a preliminary issue makes it unnecessary to decide this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">This suit was originally filed in the Southern District of New York and transferred to the Middle District of Florida. If there had been no transfer to Florida, the six year statute of limitations held applicable to New York forum 10b-5 suits would have applied, Klein v. Auchincloss, Parker &amp; Redpath, 436 F.2d 339 (2d Cir. 1971), and Count I, of course, would not be barred. The defendants moved to transfer this case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and in transferring the case, the New York district judge noted that he was doing so on the basis of 1404(a). Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 84 S.Ct. 805, 11 L.Ed.2d 945 (1964) holds that when a case is transferred under Section 1404(a), such a transfer should be merely a \u201cchange of courtrooms\u201d, and the transferee forum must apply the state law which would have been applied by the transferor court. Under this principle, the case brought New York\u2019s six year statute to Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">Some of the defendants, however, seek to avoid this result by arguing that, as to them, venue in New York was improperly laid and as a result the transfer was necessarily a change to a proper venue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>1406(a)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to which <em>Van Dusen </em>does not apply. If we were to accept this argument, a Florida limitation period would be the appropriate one, Geehan v. Monahan, 382 F.2d 111 (7th Cir. 1967); and Dubin v. United States, 380 F.2d 813 (5th Cir. 1967). However, this argument founders upon twin reefs. First, the broad venue provision of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa, which provides for venue, among other places, in the district \u201cwherein any act or transaction constituting the violation occurred.\u201d Second, at the pleadings stage the complaint controls, and here it alleges that \u201cnumerous acts or transactions constituting violations which are the basis of this complaint occurred in the Southern District of New York.\u201d Under 78aa venue is proper in any district where any act or transaction by <em>any </em>defendant in furtherance of an allegedly fraudulent scheme occurred. <em>See </em>Wyndham Associates v. Bintliff, 398 F.2d 614 (2d Cir.) cert. denied 393 U.S. 977, 89 S.Ct. 444, 21 L.Ed.2d 438 (1968); Texas Gulf Sulphur v. Ritter, 371 F.2d 145 (10th Cir. 1967); and Hooper v. Mountain States Securities Corp., <em>supra. </em>Given the propriety of New York venue, 1404(a) provides the only basis upon which this case could have been transferred to Florida. It brought the New York statute of limitations with it under <em>Van Dusen, </em>and the district court was correct in rejecting defendant\u2019s statute of limitations argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">PRIVITY</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">As recognized by the district court, there are three basic elements to be pled and proved in 10b-5 actions: (1) conduct by the defendants proscribed by the rule; (2) a purchase or sale of securities by the plaintiffs \u201cin connection with\u201d such proscribed conduct;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and (3) resultant damages to the plaintiffs. However, that court held that the requisite \u201cconnection\u201d between a defendant\u2019s proscribed conduct and a plaintiff\u2019s securities transaction can only be supplied by privity. This idea springs from Joseph v. Farnsworth Radio and TV Corp., 99 F.Supp. 701 (S.D.N.Y.1951) aff\u2019d 198 F.2d 883 (2d Cir. 1952). In <em>Joseph </em>the court noted in dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint that \u201ca semblance of privity between the vendor and purchaser of the security in connection with which the improper act, practice or course of business was invoked seems to be a requisite and it is entirely lacking here.\u201d 99 F.Supp. at 706. If <em>Joseph </em>ever stood for the proposition that an allegation of privity is a <em>sine qua non </em>of 10b-5 pleading, <em>see </em>Fischman v. Raytheon Mfg. Co., 188 F.2d 783 (2d Cir. 1951), it was first undermined, <em>see, e. g., </em>Cochran v. Channing Corp., 211 F.Supp. 239 (S.D.N.Y.1962); and Brown v. Bullock, 194 F.Supp. 207, 229 (S.D.N. Y.) aff\u2019d 294 F.2d 415 (2d Cir. 1961); and ultimately overruled by the Second Circuit both as to injunction actions brought by the SEC, see SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d 833 (2d Cir. 1968) cert. denied, 394 U.S. 976, 89 S.Ct. 1454, 22 L.Ed.2d 756 (1969); and private suits for damages <em>see </em>Heit v. Weitzen, 402 F.2d 909 (2d Cir. 1968) cert. denied 395 U.S. 903, 89 S.Ct. 1740, 23 L.Ed.2d 217 (1969). Similarly, other circuits have expressly declined to make an allegation of privity a precondition to a private action for damages. <em>See </em>Mitchell v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 446 F.2d 90, 100 (10th Cir.) cert. denied 404 U.S. 1004, 92 S.Ct. 564, 30 L.Ed.2d 558 (1971), rehearing denied, 404 U.S. 1064, 92 S.Ct. 734, 30 L.Ed.2d 754 (1972); and Texas Continental Life Insurance Co. v. Bankers Bond Co., 307 F.2d 242, 249 (6th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">In Herpich v. Wallace, 430 F.2d 792 (5th Cir. 1970) this court took note of the privity requirement by pointing out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>that it had been at first \u201csuggested\u201d and then abandoned in the second circuit, but did not reach the issue. However, the court in <em>Herpich </em>did state that \u201cCongress, when it used the quoted language [of 10(b)], did not intend necessarily to require a purchase or sale of securities by the alleged violator as a precondition to the establishment of a violation of the section and the rule. .\u201d 430 F.2d at 806. No other cases in this circuit have expressly decided the privity issue. <em>See e. g., </em>Kuehnert v. Texstar Corp., 412 F.2d 700, 702 (5th Cir. 1969). However, if the issuance of stock by the corporation represented derivatively by the plaintiff in Hooper v. Mountain States Securities Corp., <em>supra; </em>is interpreted as a sale to the corporation created by the defendants rather than to the individual defendants themselves, then this court ruled there <em>sub silentio </em>that privity is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Using the guidance of our note in <em>Herpich </em>and the policy behind section 10(b) and rule 10b-5, we hold that a 10b-5 plaintiff does not have to allege privity or any contemporaneous market trading by the plaintiff and defendant to state a claim for relief. Initially, we would observe that a rule re-, quiring privity in all cases would be contrary to the quoted language from <em>Herpich. </em>Furthermore, there are sound policy reasons for rejecting an absolute requirement of privity. The basic intent of section 10(b) and rule 10b-5 and indeed, of the Exchange Act, is to protect investors and instill confidence in the securities markets by penalizing unfair dealings. \u201c[A] corporation\u2019s misleading material statement may injure an investor irrespective of whether the corporation itself, or those individuals managing it, are contemporaneously buying or selling the stock of the corporation.\u201d SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., <em>supra, </em>401 F.2d at 861. Implementation of rule 10b-5 is dependent on private enforcement, and a requirement of privity in every instance would narrow the focus of section 10(b) and its implementing rule from the broad protection of investors to the punishment of direct buyers or sellers whose acts violated the statute and rule. The rule would be rendered useless in situations like that alleged in the instant ease in which the wrongful gain from plaintiffs\u2019 purchase was incidentally derived by someone other than the wrongdoer.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">The defendants also argue that even if this court rejects privity as an absolute limitation, it should be applied on a case by case basis. In this they rely on Brown v. Bullock, <em>supra, </em>in which the court stated that \u201cprivity is not an ultimate or operative fact. It is an evidentiary fact to be considered in conjunction with other material facts,\u201d 194 F.Supp. at 230. <em>See also </em>Financial Industrial Fund v. McDonald Douglas Corp., CCH Fed.Sec.Law Rep. \u00b6 93,004 (D.Col.1971); Cochran v. Channing Corp. <em>supra; </em>and VI Loss, Securities Regulation, 3895-96 (1969 Supp.). They urge that this is an appropriate case to require privity and call our attention to the fact that any judgment against Leeds in favor of the plaintiff shareholders may bankrupt the corporation at the expense of innocent common shareholders who purchased or converted into common after December 12, 1967, remaining debenture holders, and creditors. <em>See e. g., </em>SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur, <em>supra, </em>401 F.2d at 870 (Moore, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">Assuming arguendo that such a rule may be adopted after a full hearing in this or another appropriate case, its application at the pleading stage would be inappropriate. We agree with the court\u2019s conclusion in Shapiro v. Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith, 353 F.Supp. 264, 274 (S.D.N.Y.1972): \u201cIt is clear, therefore, that a lack of privity between plaintiff and defendant is not sufficient to warrant dismissal of the complaint and that causation is an independent element capable of establishment notwithstanding such lack of privity. While privity <em>may </em>be an indication of the required \u2018connection\u2019 ... it is certainly not determinative of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>requirement, and an absence of privity will not defeat an otherwise properly pleaded 10b-5 complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Privity may be a factor in the establishment of a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct which assertedly violates rule 10b-5 and the plaintiff\u2019s injury, and it may determine the availability to the plaintiff of a remedy such as recision or restitution, see Janigan v. Taylor, 344 F.2d 781 (1st Cir.) cert. denied 382 U.S. 879, 86 S.Ct. 163, 15 L.Ed.2d 120 (1965). However, the requisite causal connection can also be established by pleading and proving a nexus between plaintiff and defendant other than through privity.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">In the instant case the plaintiffs have alleged actual reliance upon the defendants\u2019 assertedly fraudulent misstatements and omissions. They have also alleged that the effect of these misstatements and omissions was to inflate artifically the market in which plaintiffs purchased Leeds\u2019 stock. These pleadings are sufficient to withstand a 12(b)(6) motion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Count I must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">SCIENTER AND CAUSATION AS TO UNDERWRITERS</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">Since the only relationship of the underwriters to Count I rests upon their acting as brokers in selling Leeds\u2019 stock during the time that the alleged misstatements in Count I were published, they argue that a higher standard of scienter is required to hold them liable. They further argue that the complaint fails to state a sufficient causal relationship between their alleged misconduct and plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\"> The second claim is clearly without merit. The allegation that the underwriters \u201cconsented\u201d to the republishing of the false financial information and that the plaintiffs relied upon this is sufficient to plead causation. In support of their first argument the underwriters rely on Shemtob v. Shearson, Hammill &amp; Co., 448 F.2d 442 (2d Cir. 1971); Segal v. Gordon, 467 F.2d 602 (2d Cir. 1972); Kohn v. American Metal Climax, Inc., 458 F.2d 255 (3d Cir. 1972); and Weber v. C.M.P. Corporation, 242 F.Supp. 321, 324 (S.D.N.Y. 1965). In <em>Shemtob </em>the court noted that \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 claim is nothing more than a garden-variety customer\u2019s suit against a broker for breach of contract, which cannot be bootstrapped into an alleged violation of \u00a7 10(b) . . ., in the absence of allegation of facts amounting to scienter, intent to defraud, reckless disregard for the truth, or knowing use of a device scheme or artifice to defraud. It is insufficient to allege mere negligence.\u201d 448 F.2d at 445. Something more than ordinary negligence is required to hold anyone liable under rule 10b-5, <em>see e. g., </em>Globus v. Law Research Service, Inc., 418 F.2d 1276, 1290-1291 (2d Cir. 1969),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and <em>a fortiori </em>to hold a broker who acts only as broker. Nevertheless, the complaint in the instant case which states that the defendant brokers-underwriters <em>\u201cknew or </em>should have known\u201d of the misstatements in Count I even though phrased in the disjuncture, is sufficient to state a claim for 10b-5 relief. In Heit v. Weitzen, <em>supra, </em>the plaintiffs made the same allegation, and the court stated: \u201c[i]f some form of scienter test is to be applied we think that the alternative allegation of actual knowledge of falsity is amply sufficient as a matter of pleading.\u201d 402 F.2d at 914. Because we cannot say that \u201cthe plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief,\u201d Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Ed.2d 80 (1957); we reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">COUNT II</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Assertedly constituting the second tier in a layered scheme of frauds, Count II is principally based upon events occurring subsequent to those complained of in Count I. Plaintiffs allege that the 1968 refinancing plan was agreed upon by its participants for the purpose of using corporate assets to compromise their individual Securities Act liabilities resulting from their involvement with the false and misleading statements in the debenture offering. This allegedly was a wrongful attempt to conceal and avoid liability for the fraudulent conduct complained of in Count I. The \u201crefinancing plan and the acts of the defendants in carrying it out\u201d are asserted to violate rule 10b-5 because adequate disclosure of the purposes and nature of the plan was not made to the common shareholders either in the September 18, 1968 letter or otherwise. Although plaintiffs allegedly \u201cheld\u201d their Leeds\u2019 stock in reliance upon the \u201cmisstatements and omissions\u201d connected with the plan, no plaintiff is alleged to have sold stock contemporaneously with it or as a part of it. Furthermore, the refinancing plan resulted in such a dilution of the plaintiffs\u2019 equity interest that their shares are now so deflated in value as to be almost worthless. The 10b-5 attack on the refinancing plan is also pleaded as a derivative claim, and Leeds is alleged to be a seller in carrying out the plan, but no corporate injury is pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Additionally, Count II avers that the September 18, 1968 letter was a solicitation of a \u201cproxy or consent or authorization\u201d within the meaning of section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and that this letter violated the disclosure requirements of that section. The plaintiffs \u201crelied on the false or misleading statements in the Leeds\u2019 solicitation (letter) and gave their consent and authorization to the refinancing plan by failing to object, dissent or to otherwise interpose any shareholder right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Finally, Count II states that the September 18, 1968 letter amounted to a solicitation of security holders \u201cin favor of a tender offer\u201d under section 14(e) of the Exchange Act. It is asserted that the letter did not fully disclose the purpose and terms of the refinancing plan and thus violated 14(e)\u2019s tender offer disclosure requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">The district court dismissed Count II\u2019s 10(b) claim on the basis that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue under section 10(b) and rule 10b-5 since they were not \u201cpurchasers or sellers\u201d in connection with the events alleged as violations of 10b-5 in Count II. The derivative claim was dismissed on the basis that the relief sought by the plaintiffs was direct and not derivative in nature, and no injury to the corporation was alleged. Finally, the 14(a) and 14(e) claims were dismissed because the September 18 letter neither required nor called upon the common shareholders to do anything and thus the solicitation proscribed by the terms of 14(a) and 14(e) was lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">10b-5 DIRECT CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">The plaintiffs argue that they have standing to sue for damages under rule 10b-5 even though none of the individual plaintiffs is alleged to have been involved in an actual purchase or sale of stock in connection with the conduct which Count II alleges violated rule 10b-5. They proceed upon two theories. First, Superintendent of Insurance v. Bankers Life and Casualty Company, 404 U.S. 6, 92 S.Ct. 165, 30 L.Ed.2d 128 (1971) and Affiliated Ute Citizens v. United States, 406 U.S. 128, 92 S.Ct. 1456, 31 L.Ed.2d 741 (1972) have in effect eliminated the requirement originally announced in Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Corp., 193 F.2d 461 (2d Cir.) cert. denied 343 U.S. 956, 72 S.Ct. 1051, 96 L.Ed. 1356 (1952) that only purchasers or sellers can bring a private action for damages under rule 10b-5, and have accorded standing to plaintiffs who hold stock in reliance on conduct proscribed by the statute and rule. Second, even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number><em>Birnbaum\u2019s </em>purchaser-seller requirement withstands these cases, the issuance of new common shares in the 1968 refinancing plan diluted plaintiffs\u2019 existing equity interest in Leeds, thereby constituting plaintiffs as \u201cforced sellers\u201d of a part of their equity interest entitled to 10b-5 standing, <em>see </em>Vine v. Beneficial Finance Co., 374 F.2d 627 (2d Cir.) cert. denied 389 U.S. 970, 88 S.Ct. 463, 19 L.Ed.2d 460 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">We reject the first argument. The terms \u201cpurchaser\u201d and \u201cseller\u201d have been broadly construed, see, <em>e. g., </em>Herpieh v. Wallace, <em>supra, </em>and Hooper v. Mountain State Securities Corp., <em>supra, </em>but before <em>Bankers Life </em>and <em>Affiliated Ute </em>this circuit\u2019s rule had always been that only a purchaser or seller of securities \u201cin connection with\u201d the alleged fraud had standing to sue directly for damages under section 10(b) and rule 10b-5;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>see, e. g., </em>Herpich v. Wallace, <em>supra; </em>Rekant v. Desser, 425 F.2d 872 (5th Cir. 1970); and Cooper v. Garza, 431 F.2d 578 (5th Cir. 1970). Moreover, such standing has been required by most other circuits, <em>see </em>Mount Clemens Industries, Inc. v. Bell, 464 F.2d 339 (9th Cir. 1972) and cases collected therein; although recently, it was rejected by the Seventh Circuit, <em>see </em>Eason v. General Motors Acceptance Corporation, 490 F.2d 654 (7th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\"><em>Bankers Life </em>and <em>Affiliated Ute </em>both involved plaintiffs who were sellers of securities. In <em>Bankers Life, </em>Manhattan, the corporation represented by the plaintiff,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> actually sold its treasury bonds, and the use of the sale proceeds was an integral part of the fraudulent scheme perpetrated on Manhattan by the defendants even though there was no misrepresentation or fraud involved in the bond sale itself. Immediately before stating that Manhattan was protected by section 10(b) and rule 10b-5, Mr. Justice Douglas expressly noted that Manhattan was the seller of treasury bonds. In fact, throughout its opinion the Court takes care to point out that Manhattan was a seller. Moreover, in a footnote the question of whether a 10b-5 claim would have been stated without the sale of treasury bonds was expressly left open, <em>see </em>404 U.S. at 13, 92 S.Ct. at 169, 30 L.Ed.2d at 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">The plaintiffs support their position with this quotation from <em>Bankers Life:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-10\">Section 10(b) must be read flexibly, not technically and restrictively. Since there was a \u2018sale\u2019 of a security and since fraud was used \u2018in connection with\u2019 it, there is redress under 10(b), whatever might be available as a remedy under state law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">Of course, if we were to accept the broadest meaning of this language out of context, the underwriters offer to repurchase the debentures, or Leeds\u2019 issuance of shares in exchange for the debentures might be sufficient to allow standing for the plaintiffs. However, this language must be considered in its subject matter structure. <em>Bankers Life </em>focuses on the meaning of the \u201cin connection with\u201d clause in section 10(b) and is exclusively concerned with the relationship between Manhattan\u2019s sale and the defendant\u2019s alleged fraudulent scheme. It establishes that the defendant\u2019s fraudulent conduct need not specifically relate to the plaintiff\u2019s securities transaction as in a misrepresentation involving the value of securities purchased or sold by the plaintiff. Instead, the requisite nexus exists if such conduct merely touches upon the plaintiffs\u2019 purchase or sale. <em>See </em>Smallwood v. Pearl Brewing Co., 489 F.2d 579 (5th Cir. 1974). We are persuaded by this specific holding, by the Court\u2019s careful limitation of what it was deciding, and by its express footnote caveat that the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>chaser-seller requirement of <em>Birnbaum </em>remains intact. <em>See </em>Mount Clemens Industries, Inc. v. Bell, <em>supra; </em>Landy v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 486 F.2d 139 (3d Cir. 1973); James v. Gerber Products Co., 483 F.2d 944 (6th Cir. 1973); Haberman v. Murchison, 468 F.2d 1305 (2d Cir. 1972); <em>but see, </em>Eason v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">We now move to the other authority relied upon. In <em>Affiliated Ute </em>the Court was not directly concerned with the purchaser-seller requirement, since there the plaintiffs were sellers of stock. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs rely heavily upon the Court\u2019s citation to a page of SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., <em>supra, </em>upon which the following quotation is found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-5\">Thus, material facts include not only information disclosing the earnings and distributions of a company but also those facts which affect the probable future of the company and those which may affect the desire of investors to buy, sell, or <em>hold </em>the company\u2019s securities. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">401 F.2d at 849. The basic holding of <em>Affiliated Ute </em>was that in a ease involving nondisclosure, the plaintiffs had only to plead and prove that the facts withheld by the defendant were material and did not have to prove specific reliance on the part of each individual plaintiff. The citation to <em>Texas Gulf Sulphur </em>was not only supportive of the policy behind this principle but illustrative of the meaning of materiality. It is inapposite to single it out and suggest that it implies that a mere <em>holder </em>of securities could, from that time on, sue for damages under section 10(b) and rule 10b-5. Surely, a principle so widely accepted as the purchaser-seller requirement was not to be dispatched to an unmarked grave. We refuse to take this citation as implicitly rejecting the <em>Birn-baum </em>doctrine, especially since subsequent decisions of the Second Circuit have held that <em>Texas Gulf Sulphur </em>left <em>Birnbaum </em>intact. <em>See, e. g., </em>Iroquois Industries, Inc. v. Syracuse China Corp., 417 F.2d 963, 968 (2d Cir. 1969) cert. denied, 399 U.S. 909, 90 S.Ct. 2199, 26 L.Ed.2d 561 (1970). To eliminate any doubt, we expressly reaffirm the vitality of the purchaser-seller requirement in this circuit, <em>cf. </em>Smallwood v. Pearl Brewing Co., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">We also reject plaintiffs\u2019 second argument \u2014 that the refinancing plan\u2019s issuance of new shares so diluted their position as to give them 10b-5 standing as \u201cforced sellers.\u201d The forced seller doctrine originated in Vine v. Beneficial Finance Corp., <em>supra. </em>In <em>Vine </em>the second circuit held that a minority shareholder who, following a short form merger was faced with the choice of either holding stock in a nonexistent corporation or exchanging his shares for value, under the terms of the merger agreement or pursuant to state law appraisal rights, was a seller for purposes of 10b-5 standing. <em>See also, </em>Crane v. Westinghouse Air Brake Co., 419 F.2d 787 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 822, 91 S.Ct. 41, 27 L.Ed.2d 50 (1970). That a forced seller has 10(b) standing has been recognized in this circuit. Smallwood v. Pearl Brewing Co., <em>supra; </em>Coffee v. Permian Corp., 434 F.2d 383 (5th Cir. 1970); and Dudley v. Southeastern Factor and Finance Corp., 446 F.2d 303 (5th Cir.) cert. denied, 404 U.S. 858, 92 S.Ct. 109, 30 L.Ed.2d 101 (1971). In both <em>Coffee </em>and <em>Dudley </em>the plaintiff was a shareholder in a corporation about to be liquidated. Since the plaintiff in each of these eases had no choice but \u201cto surrender his interest in the corporation and to exchange his shares for cash,\u201d <em>Coffee, supra, </em>434 F.2d at 386, each was held to have 10b-5 standing as a forced seller. The dicta in <em>Coffee </em>that plaintiff, as holder of common shares when the Knight family\u2019s stock was repurchased by the company, was \u201cperhaps a purchaser\u201d, would lend support to the claim in the instant case that the consequent dilution of plaintiff\u2019s equity caused by Leeds\u2019 issuance of new shares under the refinancing plan made them forced sellers. However, any such argument is now foreclosed by Wolf v. Frank, 477 F.2d 467 (5th Cir. 1973). In <em>Wolf </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>court noted that the \u201cplaintiffs do not have standing to seek individual damages for the dilution of equity interests caused by the NIB-IGB stock exchange because plaintiffs were neither purchasers nor sellers in connection with that transaction.\u201d Thus, although dilution of equity may be an appropriate measure of damages, such dilution does not confer standing. Even though <em>Wolf </em>does not expressly discuss the issue in terms of the forced seller doctrine, it puts an end to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument. Moreover, this forced seller argument must be dismissed upon another basis. In Smallwood v. Pearl Brewing Company, <em>supra, </em>this court denied direct standing to a shareholder of a merged company who had the right to exchange his shares for shares of the surviving company. <em>Pearl Brewing </em>quotes the following from Dudley v. Southeastern Factor and Finance Co., <em>supra: \u2018\u201cVine\u2019s </em>informing principle carried forward in <em>Crane, </em>is that a shareholder should be treated as a seller when the nature of his investment has been fundamentally changed from an interest in a going enterprise to a right solely for payment of money for his shares.\u2019\" 446 F.2d at 307. Since Smallwood was still entitled to an interest in a \u201cgoing concern\u201d and was not forced to liquidate his interest for value, he was held not to be a forced seller for purposes of 10b-5 standing. Similarly, in the instant case the plaintiffs still hold shares in a continuing business operation. In these circumstances it would be sophistic to stretch the forced seller doctrine to allow plaintiffs 10b-5 standing. Such an expansion would carry with it the seeds for sacrificing whatever integrity the forced seller doctrine might have. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the 10b-5 direct claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">10b-5 DERIVATIVE CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">It is generally recognized that the issuance of stock is a sale of securities for 10b-5 purposes and that an individual shareholder although not a purchaser or seller can bring a derivative claim on behalf of a corporation which has been fraudulently induced to issue its stock. <em>See, e. g., </em>Herpich v. Wallace, <em>supra; </em>Rekant v. Desser, <em>supra; </em>and Hooper v. Mountain States Securities Corp., <em>supra. </em>However, assuming Leeds\u2019 exchange of stock for debentures, pursuant to the refinancing plan, makes it a seller, the complaint still fails to state a claim for derivative relief, since no injury or damage to Leeds is alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">The district court dismissed the derivative claim without prejudice because of the absence of an allegation of injury to Leeds. The plaintiffs assert that injury is alleged in Count II in that the value of Leeds\u2019 common stock held by the plaintiffs is claimed to have become worthless. Of course, a low selling price for Leeds\u2019 stock might incidentally make it difficult for the company to obtain equity capital in the future, but a depressed price is, without more, a shareholder injury. Although a principal premise of plaintiffs argument is that the refinancing plan was intended to compromise the Securities Act liabilities of certain individual defendants, two things must be recalled; first, Leeds itself had a potential liability as to the entire 1,500,000 dollars outstanding in debentures, and second, a major option extended to the debenture holders by the plan \u2014 conversion into increased numbers of shares of Leeds\u2019 common stock \u2014 did not effect a release of claims.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Additionally, Leeds had agreed to indemnify the underwriters for any liabilities resulting from the debenture offering.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In the face of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>facts, we refuse to imply an injury to Leeds as a corporation when the plaintiffs have failed to specify any such injury. Since the plaintiffs chose not to amend to make such an allegation after being given the chance, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the derivative claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">SECTION 14(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0F\">It shall be unlawful for any person, by the use of the mails or by any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of any facility of a national securities exchange or otherwise, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, to solicit or to permit the use of his name to solicit any proxy or consent or authorization in respect of any security (other than an exempted security) registered pursuant to section 12 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">' The plaintiffs assert that the September 18, 1968 letter was covered by 14(a) because it was a solicitation to the common shareholders \u201cto obtain their consent and authorization to the refinancing plan.\u201d It is alleged that because of the personal interests of Leeds\u2019 management in the plan as a vehicle to eliminate their individual liabilities and the failure to hold the 1968 annual meeting, shareholder approval of the plan was required. This being so, they say that the letter\u2019s, purpose was to \u201clull\u201d these holders into inaction so they would not unhorse the refinancing plan by forcing the overdue annual meeting and electing new directors, or otherwise attacking it through corporate or judicial channels. The plaintiffs then go on to argue that treating the letter as a proxy solicitation, it failed to meet the disclosure requirements of rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a-9. The defendants\u2019 main reply, which was accepted by the district court, is that the September 18 letter on its face did not solicit the common shareholders to do anything, since the letter was purely informational and called for no action on their part.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">It is undisputed that Leeds\u2019 common shares are registered under section 12 of the Exchange Act, that the authors of the letter were \u201cpersons\u201d within the meaning of that term in 14(a), and that the letter was actually mailed to the common shareholders. Thus, we must resolve two threshold issues: (1) was the September 18, 1968 letter a solicitation; and, if so, (2) was <em>it </em>a solicitation of a \u201cproxy or consent or authorization?\u201d If we cannot answer one of these two questions negatively as a matter of law, we must vacate the district court\u2019s decision and remand this case for proof on these issues and for a determination of whether plaintiffs can meet the other requirements of a private action for damages under section 14(a), including proof of a substantive violation, <em>see </em>rule 14a-9; causation, <em>see </em>J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 84 S.Ct. 1555, 12 L.Ed.2d 423 (1964); and Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., 396 U.S. 375, 90 S.Ct. 616, 24 L.Ed.2d 593 (1970); the requisite standard of culpability for each defendant; and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">SEC rule 14a-1, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a-1, defines a solicitation under 14(a) to encompass:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-10\">. the furnishing of a form of proxy or <em>other communication </em>to security holders under circumstances reasonably calculated to result in the procurement, withholding or revocation of a proxy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">Rule 14a-l contains the following definition of proxy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-12\">The term \u201cproxy\u201d includes any proxy, consent, or authorization within the meaning of Section 14(a) of the Act. The consent or authorization may take the form of a failure to object or to dissent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">As used in the SEC\u2019s rules, proxy is a generic term which includes the broader statutory terms \u201cconsent\u201d and \u201cauthorization\u201d. <em>See </em>L. Loss, Securities Regulation at page 871 (2d ed. 1961). To fit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>within the language of 14(a) and the SEC rules, plaintiffs argue that the September 18 letter was a \u201ccommunication\u201d to Leeds\u2019 security holders \u201cunder circumstances reasonably calculated to result in the procurement\u201d of a \u201cfailure to object or to dissent\u201d to the refinancing plan from the plaintiff common shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">It is readily apparent from the complaint that this case is different from the usual proxy solicitation case, because no shareholder vote on the plan was ever sought, and there was no attempt to obtain any proxy in the narrow or common usage sense of that term. Indeed, since debenture conversion under the plan was to be into previously authorized but unissued stock, we can find no Florida statute which under normal circumstances would require shareholder approval or which would accord appraisal rights to the common shareholders. Likewise, since no stock was issued for cash, the common shareholders had no preemptive rights.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> From this premise defendants argue that \u201cin the absence of some allegation of infringement upon corporate suffrage rights or some corporate action taken as a result of such infringement, no cause of action under section 14(a) has been made out.\u201d Hoover v. Allen, 241 F.Supp. 213, 230 (S.D.N.Y.1965); <em>see also </em>Entel v. Allen, 270 F.Supp. 60 (S.D.N.Y.1967). This is too narrow a reading of the statute and the rules. Under Conley v. Gibson, <em>supra, </em>standards, we cannot say as a matter of law that the allegations of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint taken as true fail to state a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Whether or not a particular communication is a solicitation within the meaning of 14(a) is a question of fact dependent upon the nature of the communication and the circumstances under which it is transmitted. Securities Exchange Act, Release No. 7208, 29 Fed.Reg. 341 (1964). Although the September 18 letter by its terms did not specifically ask for any action or inaction on the part of its recipients, the plaintiffs have alleged that its purpose was to forestall the common shareholders from interposing obstacles in the path of the refinancing plan through the exercise of their rights as shareholders. The defendants, of course, dispute that this was the purpose of the letter. However, the letter was sent at a time coinciding with the usual proxy solicitation period when certain members of Leeds\u2019 management were allegedly not only engaged in self-dealing but also were acting in a manner that conflicted with Leeds\u2019 common shareholders\u2019 best interest. At the time of its mailing, the September 14 annual meeting required by express provision of Leeds\u2019 bylaws had not been held and was not in fact held until sometime in 1969, after the plan had gone into effect. To rely exclusively upon the informational tone of the letter itself, ignoring the circumstances surrounding its transmittal, and hold as a matter of law at the pleading stage that the September 18 letter was not a solicitation, would be to ignore our duty to interpret the securities laws according to their remedial purposes, see Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 88 S.Ct. 548, 19 L.Ed.2d 564 (1967), and to allow defendants to do indirectly (by refusing to hold a required meeting and mollifying shareholders\u2019 reaction with a letter) what they allegedly would not do directly (hold the meeting required by Leeds\u2019 bylaws and vote on new officers, thereby subjecting the proposed plan to their scrutiny).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Certainly, not every communication from management is a solicitation, <em>see </em>Brown v. Chicago Rock Island and Pacific Railroad Co., 328 F.2d 122 (7th Cir. 1964), and the development of proof may demonstrate that this letter was, as defendants contend, purely informational. Our holding here is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>more than that Conley v. Gibson, section 14(a) and rule 14a-1 preclude an adjudication at this stage that this letter could not be a solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Similarly, we cannot hold that the inaction which the letter allegedly \u201csolicits\u201d is not as a matter of law at least a \u201cconsent\u201d. The word \u201cconsent\u201d in section 14(a) is not limited by the preceding word \u201cproxy\u201d. Dunning v. Rafton, CCH Fed.Sec.L.Rep. \u00b6 91660 at 95437 (N.D.Cal.1965) and Greater Iowa Corp. v. McLendon, 378 F.2d 783 (8th Cir. 1967). \u201cThe solicitation of consent would, according to common usage, include any circularizations requesting or urging a security holder to concur in or go along with the solicitors\u2019 proposals,\u201d Dunning, <em>supra </em>at 95437. Because of the inclusion of \u201ca failure to object or dissent\u201d as a form of authorization or consent in rule 14a-1, promulgated pursuant to the express statutory authorization in section 14(a), we hold that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that defendants solicited nonassertion of plaintiffs\u2019 rights to block the refinancing plan through corporate or judicial action, is sufficient under Conley v. Gibson standards to plead a solicitation of an authorization or consent. Thus, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of this issue and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion. Of course, in so doing we intimate no view on the ultimate merits of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">SECTION 14(e) CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-7\">It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or to engage in any fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices, in connection with any tender offer or request or invitation for tenders, or any solicitation of security holders in opposition to or in favor of any such offer, request, or invitation.' The Commission shall, for the purposes of this subsection, by rules and regulations define, and prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent, such acts and practices as are fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Plaintiffs argue that the September 18, 1968 letter was a \u201csolicitation of security holders ... in favor of\u201d a tender offer and that as such it violated 14(e) in failing to disclose to the shareholders <em>inter alia </em>the conflicting interests of the participants in the refinancing plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">In reasoning our refusal to agree, we initially note that the letter stands on a different footing from the actual debenture offer, since the plaintiffs do not complain of misrepresentations or omissions in the actual offer to the debenture holders. Indeed, that offer discloses directly that certain of its participants may be liable under the Securities Act to the debenture holders because of misstatements in the August 1967 debenture prospectus, rather than containing, as the letter does, a reference to other documents where liabilities are discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">The process of analysis we follow makes it unnecessary to reach two important but unsettled issues in this field. Neither the Exchange Act nor the rules promulgated under it define the term \u201ctender offer\u201d as used in section 14(e). The underwriters\u2019 offer to repurchase debentures as part of the refinancing plan was registered as a tender offer under section 14(d)(1), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n, rule 14d-1, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14d-1, and schedule 13D, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.13d-101. Moreover, the offer\u2019s limited duration<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and the requirement of acceptance by 80% of the debenture holders before its covenants became effective liken it to a conventional tender offer. <em>See </em>Note, The Developing Meaning of \u201cTender Offer\u201d under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 86 Harv.L.Rev. 1250 (1972); and Smallwood v. Pearl Brewing Co., <em>supra. </em>However, we intimate no ruling on this proposition since our ultimate disposition of this issue allows us to assume without actually deciding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>\u201crefinancing plan\u201d involved a tender offer within section 14(e). Similarly, neither section 14(e) nor the SEC rules contain a definition of the term \u201csolicitation\u201d in 14(e). Whether the meaning of \u201csolicitation\u201d in 14(e) is as broad as the meaning of \u201csolicit\u201d in 14(a) is an open question. The district court seemed to equate the two when it held in the same paragraph that the September 18 letter was not a solicitation under either 14(a) or 14(e). Again, for purposes of this decision, we will assume, without deciding, that the letter was a 14(e) solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Section 14(e) was enacted as part of the Williams Act of 1968. It was prompted by the increased use of cash tender offers as a means of obtaining corporate control and was designed to fill a gap in the securities laws which left \u201cthe cash tender offer exempt from disclosure provisions.\u201d See H.Rep.No. 1711, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. U.S.Code Cong, and Adm.News, p. 2811 at p. 2813. Such a gap existed because pre-Williams Act coverage of the securities laws depended upon the method used to obtain control.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The Act\u2019s remedy is. to add to former regulatory methods as additional approach which requires \u201cfull and fair disclosure for the benefit of investors while at the .same time providing the offeror and management equal opportunity to fairly present their case.\u201d H.Rep. No.1711, supra at p. 2813. The focus of the legislative history of section 14(e) is on adequate disclosure to those investors whose tenders are being solicited so that an informed meaningful consideration of the alternatives can be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Although section 14(e) does not expressly provide for a private right of action, courts have uniformly implied one. See Smallwood v. Pearl Brewing Co., supra, 489 F.2d at 596, n. 20. In determining who has standing to sue under 14(e), the quest has been for what will best further the objective of the statute. Consequently, the right to bring suit has not been limited to tendering offerees only but has been extended to numerous other parties who claimed to be victims of 14(e) violations. See Chris-Craft Industries, Inc. v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 480 F.2d 341 (2d Cir. 1973) (tender offeror had standing to sue target company\u2019s management and competing offer- or); Electronic Specialty Company v. International Controls Corp., 409 F.2d 937 (2d Cir. 1969), (target company and target company\u2019s nontendering shareholders had standing to sue for injunctive relief); H. K. Porter, Inc. v. Nicholson File Co., 482 F.2d 421 (1st Cir. 1971) (tender offeror had standing to sue target company\u2019s management); see also Gulf and Western Industries, Inc. v. Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, 476 F.2d 687 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>but see </em>Washburn v. Madison Square Garden Corp., 340 F.Supp. 504 (S.D.N.Y.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Assuming the September 18 letter was a solicitation, the abstract language of section 14(e) might be broad enough to encompass the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Nevertheless, the policy behind the statute, as revealed by the legislative history, compels us to read the term \u201csecurity holders\u201d in 14(e) as those security holders to whom the offer is addressed. The evil to be remedied was inadequate disclosure to tendering security holders. Congress made it clear that the investor protection sought by 14(e) was disclosure to those who had to make the hold or sell decision. See U.S. Code Cong. and Admin.News, <em>supra, </em>at p. 2811 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">No violation of 14(e) could be shown where the class sought to be protected has riot been harmed. In the instant case the plaintiffs have not alleged any inadequacy of disclosure in the offer to the debenture holders. Plaintiffs stand in no better position than would the shareholders of a tender offeror complaining of misleading statements in a proxy solicitation involving a completely valid tender offer that required shareholder approval. Such a shareholder should not be allowed to sue under 14(e) (in addition to 14(a)) because he argues that the proxy solicitation was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>solicitation of security holders in favor of a tender offer.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of this claim albeit on a different basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">COUNT III</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">INJUNCTIVE RELIEF</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The complaint alleges various continuing violations of the securities laws by Leeds\u2019 management and mandatory and prohibitive injunctive relief was sought. After taking proof the district court found that plaintiffs had failed to show that the present Leeds\u2019 management had committed or threatened to commit any of the securities law violations alleged in Count III, or to demonstrate that any harm, let alone irreparable harm, would accrue to them, and no preliminary in-junctive relief was granted. Additionally, in line with its rulings on Counts I and II and its dismissal of Count IV, the district court concluded that Count III standing alone contained insufficient allegations to support permanent injunc-tive relief. It, accordingly, dismissed that count also.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\"> Our review of the exercise of discretion b,y the trial court in refusing preliminary injunctive relief must be closely circumscribed. It comes to us on an abbreviated development of facts. It requires a balancing of the probabilities of ultimate success on the merits with the consequences of court intervention at a preliminary stage. The prerogative to weigh the nice distinctions involved belongs to the district court, not this court. Bayless v. Martine, 430 F.2d 873 (5th Cir. 1970); Exhibitors Poster Exchange v. National Screen Service Corp., 441 F.2d 560 (5th Cir. 1971); Eli Lilly and Co. v. Generix Drug Sales, Inc., 460 F.2d 1096 (5th Cir. 1972). <em>See also </em>C. Wright and A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2962, p. 633-36. Nothing in the record before us demonstrates that the district court abused its discretion here. That court\u2019s determination that plaintiffs had not demonstrated the requisite probability of success appears to relate to the merits. Thus, our partial reversal of the district court\u2019s disposition of defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss would not taint its denial of preliminary injunctive relief. However, caution indicates that upon remand the district court should reconsider its denial of preliminary relief in light of the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">Since the district court\u2019s refusal of permanent injunctive relief is predicated in part upon dismissal of Counts I and II, which we have in part reversed, we vacate the dismissal of Count III and remand the issue of plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to permanent injunctive relief for further consideration not inconsistent with this opinion. Finally, we also remit to the district court\u2019s discretion the question of whether interim attorneys\u2019 fees at this stage of the proceedings are proper. For emphasis, we again expressly disclaim all intent to indicate or intimate what the result of the exercise of that court\u2019s discretion should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-13\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-14\">.
