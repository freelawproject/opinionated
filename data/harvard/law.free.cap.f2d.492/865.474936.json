GOODWIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b929-22\">Hawaiian Express Service, Inc., a freight forwarder authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission to operate in the San Francisco-Hawaii trade, sued under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1017(b)(2) to enjoin Pacific Hawaiian Terminals, Inc., from offering transportation services which Hawaiian Express contends amount to \u201cfreight forwarding\u201d under the Interstate Commerce Act \u00a7 402(a)(5), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(a)(5). The district court denied relief, and Hawaiian Express appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-23\">With the exception of the degree of Pacific\u2019s utilization of motor common carriers, most of the material facts are covered by stipulation. The crucial question is one of law. We have conclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>ed that the relevant legislative history requires an interpretation of the statutes which brings the activities complained of within the regulatory scope of the I.C.C., and accordingly reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Pacific operates pursuant to a tariff on file with the Federal Maritime Commission. As a \u201cnon-vessel-operating\u201d common carrier by water, Pacific contends that its services are not subject to I.C.C. regulation. Because some of Pacific\u2019s activities are competitive with those of Hawaiian Express, and because a resolution of the dispute involves the drawing of lines within the grey area between transportation activities which clearly are subject to I.C.C. regulation and those which clearly are not, we believe it will be helpful to set out the facts in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Shippers wishing to employ Pacific\u2019s services from the San Francisco Bay Area to Hawaii either bring their freight to Pacific\u2019s San Francisco terminal or call Pacific and request that the freight be picked up. In the latter case, the shipper is advised that freight can be brought to Pacific\u2019s terminal by a carrier of the shipper\u2019s choice, or it can be brought to the terminal by a motor carrier arranged for by Pacific. When Pacific arranges the pickups, it calls one of several motor common carriers, which operate under certificates issued under Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">After shipments are received at Pacific\u2019s San Francisco terminal, they are sorted and loaded into container boxes (trailers) furnished by Matson Navigation Company (Matson) or Seatrain Lines California (Seatrain). Pacific then prepares a cargo manifest showing the 30 to 50 individual shipments loaded into each container. Pacific also prepares ocean bills of lading naming Pacific as both consignor and consignee, and listing Pacific\u2019s San Francisco terminal as origin and the Hawaiian address of a Hawaiian motor carrier as destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">When the containers are loaded and ready to be shipped to Hawaii, Pacific calls either Matson or Seatrain and requests that it pick up the containers and deliver them to the appropriate pier. If the containers are to be transported to the Matson pier, the pickup and delivery service is provided by Encinal Terminals, operating under a Part II motor common carrier certificate filed with the I.C.C. If the containers are to be transported to the Seatrain pier, Walkup\u2019s Merchant Express, also a Part II motor carrier, provides the transportation. Rates charged for the latter service are published as part of Seatrain\u2019s joint freight tariff filed with the I.C.C. Mat-son and Seatrain pay Encinal Terminals and Walkup\u2019s Merchant Express for local ground transportation. Charges assessed Pacific for the delivery and pickup of containers and shipment to Hawaii are set forth in Matson Navigation Company Westbound Container Freight Tariff No. 14-A, FMC No. 137, filed with the Maritime Commission, and Sea-train Lines California Joint and Proportional Freight Tariff No. 500, I.C.C. No. 1, filed with the I.C.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">At the Matson or Seatrain piers in Hawaii, containers are unloaded by the water carrier and picked up by Pacific\u2019s Honolulu agents, who transport them to their terminal, break bulk, and unload the containers. These agents are motor carriers which have certificates of exemption from I.C.C. regulation, Ex Parte MC-59, Motor Carrier Operations in the State of Hawaii, 84 M.C.C. 5 (1960), and whose rates are filed with the Public Utilities Commission of Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">Pacific advertises its services as \u201cFreight Forwarding,\u201d and bills of consignors either from the point of origin or from Pacific\u2019s San Francisco terminal to Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">It was also stipulated that Pacific provided identical service to that which was rendered by Hawaiian Express and other authorized freight forwarders, at least to the extent of consolidating shipments, turning the containers over to Matson or Seatrain, and breaking bulk in Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number> I.C.C. jurisdiction to regulate freight forwarders is undisputed. See Interstate Commerce Act, Part IV, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1022. It is equally undisputed that the Federal Maritime Commission has jurisdiction to regulate non-vessel-operating common carriers by water (NVO\u2019s). See Shipping Act of 1916, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-842; Intercoastal Shipping Act of 1933, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 843-848. Hawaiian Express argues that Pacific\u2019s activities, while admittedly those of an NVO, also bring Pacific within the definition of a freight forwarder, and, hence, in light of the conflict-of-jurisdiction provision of Section 33 of the Shipping Act of 1916, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 832,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pacific\u2019s business falls within the I.C.C.\u2019s jurisdiction. The purpose of Section 33 is to obviate a conflict of jurisdiction if any substantive provision of the Shipping Act of 1916 should overlap a corresponding provision of the Interstate Commerce Act. H.R.Rep. No. 569, 64th Cong., 1st Sess. (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">As a result of a belief that integrated regulation of freight forwarders was in the public interest, Congress in 1942 passed, and in 1950 amended, Part IV of the Interstate Commerce Act regulating freight forwarders. Section 402(a)(5), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(a)(5) defines the term \u201cfreight forwarder\u201d as any person, other than certain carriers, who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-5\">\u201c* * * [H]olds itself out to the general public as a common carrier * * * in interstate commerce, and which, in the ordinary course of its undertaking, (A) assembles and consolidates or provides for assembling and consolidating shipments of such property, and performs or provides for the performance of break-bulk and distributing operations with respect to such consolidated shipments, and (B) assumes responsibility for the transportation of such property from point of receipt to point of destination, and (C) utilizes, for the whole or any part of the transportation of such shipments, the services of a carrier or carriers subject to chapters 1, 8, or 12 of this title [hereinafter referred to as \u2018Part II carriers\u2019].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1010(a)(1) provides that it shall be illegal for any person to engage in the business of freight forwarding without first obtaining a permit from the I.C.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">On the stipulated facts, Pacific\u2019s activities fall within subdivisions (A) and (B) of the definition of a freight forwarder. The crucial question is whether Pacific\u2019s activities also fall within subdivision (C), <em>i. e., </em>whether Pacific sufficiently \u201cutilizes\u201d the services of a Part II motor carrier. The district court, relying primarily upon IML SeaTransit v. United States, 343 F.Supp. 32 (N.D.Cal.) aff\u2019d, 409 U.S. 1002, 93 S.Ct. 433, 34 L.Ed.2d 295 (1972), concluded that Pacific had not \u201cutilized\u201d a motor carrier within the meaning of Section 402(a) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">Contacts between Pacific and motor carriers occur at three stages of the shipment process: first, carriage from the point of origin to Pacific\u2019s terminal; second, carriage from the terminal to the piers of the vessel-operating water carrier; and third, carriage from the piers and terminals in Hawaii to the ultimate destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">The third contact can be dismissed quickly by noting that local Hawaiian motor carriers are exempt from the Interstate Commerce Act. Ex Parte MC-59, Motor Carrier Operations in the State of Hawaii, <em>supra. </em>Consequently, such carriers are not subject to Part II of the Act, and utilization of such a carrier could not of itself bring Pacific within subdivision (C) of the freight-forwarder definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">At the second stage of contact with motor carriers, there is a difference between Pacific\u2019s arrangements with Mat-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>son and its arrangements with Seatrain. When Matson is the ocean carrier, Pacific\u2019s contact must be described as a mere incident to the performance of services pursuant to Matson\u2019s all-water tariff filed with the Maritime Commission, and, under the <em>IML Sea Transit </em>case, does not amount to a sufficiently \u201csubstantial\u201d commercial connection between Pacific and the Matson-designated motor carrier to support a finding of \u201cutilization\u201d by Pacific. IML Sea Transit v. United States, 343 F.Supp. at 42. However, when Seatrain is the ocean carrier, the charges are assessed pursuant to a joint tariff filed with the 1. C.C. The court in <em>IML Sea Transit </em>refrained from deciding whether Sea-Transit would have \u201cutilized\u201d a Part II motor carrier had Matson and the motor carrier Matson employed entered into through-route and joint-rate agreements pursuant to an appropriate I.C.C. tariff. We need not grapple with that question, for in this case there is another basis for holding that Pacific \u201cutilizes\u201d a Part II motor carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">The parties stipulated that at least part of the time Pacific arranges for the transportation of freight by motor carrier from a point of origin to the Pacific terminal. In such a situation, Pacific, not Matson or Seatrain, called a motor carrier, arranged for the pickup, and, in some cases, invoiced the through charges from the initial origin to the Hawaiian destination. This activity amounts to a sufficiently substantial commercial connection with a motor carrier to be included within the reach of Section 402(a) (5). It was precisely this relationship between long-distance transportation by water or rail and local motor-carrier collection or distribution with which Congress was concerned when it amended Sections 402 and 409 of the Interstate Commerce Act in 1950. 1950 U.S.Code Cong.Serv., pp. 4216-4220. The purpose of the amendments was to authorize the I.C.C. to prescribe terms and conditions allowing local Part II motor carriers to charge freight forwarders less for consolidation and distribution pickup service than the motor carriers charged the shipping public generally for such local shipments, and thus enable freight forwarders to secure the profit margin necessary to support their assembly and break-bulk services.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Congress explicitly recognized that, as a result of using motor carriers to gather and distribute shipments in wide areas around their consolidation and distribution stations, freight forwarders were able to expand their services beyond terminal-to-terminal movements between large cities to provide a coordinated nation-wide service. It is only by calling on motor common carriers to pick up the freight from the shipper and deliver it to Pacific\u2019s terminal for consolidation and assembly that Pacific is able to provide its advertised through, door-to-door service.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">In light of the statutory purpose, we conclude that Pacific utilizes a motor carrier within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(a)(5), and that it is therefore a freight forwarder subject to I.C.C. regulation. Inasmuch as Pacific does not have an I.C.C. permit authorizing it to engage in freight forwarding between the San Francisco Bay Area and Hawaii, the requested injunction should have been granted. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1017(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">Reversed and remanded, with instructions to enter an appropriate order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-7\">. \u201cThis chapter shall not be construed to affect the power or jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, nor to confer upon the Federal Maritime Board concurrent power or jurisdiction over any matter within the power or jurisdiction of such Interstate Commerce Commission * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b932-6\">.
