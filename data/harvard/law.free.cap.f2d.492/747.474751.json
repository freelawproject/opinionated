There was no objection whatever to the admission of evidence which he now claims was the product of an illegal search of an automobile by the border patrol. We pretermit questions of standing arid whether the search took place at a permanent as distinguished from a temporary check point. In essence, appellant is seeking relief under Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 1973, 413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596. The search here was prior to the date of that decision and thus it is of no avail to appellant. See Miller v. United States, 5 Cir., 1974, 492 F.2d 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-20\">There is likewise no merit in the other assignments of error, which are also based on the admission of evidence. This evidence, seized during an arrest pursuant to an arrest warrant, was not proscribed for any of the reasons claimed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
