Yablon-ski and other members of the United Mine Workers of America<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against its president, W. A. Boyle, and two other officers, George J. Titler and John Owens, for alleged violation of their fiduciary duties to the UMWA and its members. On two prior occasions we considered motions to disqualify UMWA\u2019s counsel in the action and held that neither the UMWA\u2019s retained counsel nor its house counsel could be permitted to represent its interests in the controversy because of their previous and continuing affiliations with the defendant officials in this and other UMWA litigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since those decisions, the leadership of the UMWA has changed and the issue of representation is again before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-19\">Our previous opinions delineate the legal principles which govern this issue. However, in view of the different con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>text in which the question is now presented, and because additional issues are raised concerning the realignment of the UMWA as party-plaintiff and the mootness of the underlying appeal, we believe it helpful to recount the salient facts and to state the reasons for the action we take.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Yablonski and other UMWA members brought suit under Section 501(b) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for damages and for an accounting and restitution of UMWA funds allegedly misappropriated and misspent by the defendant officers. The UMWA was also made a party-defendant and was represented originally by retained counsel who simultaneously represented Boyle in other cases in which he was charged with misconduct in office. We reversed the District Court\u2019s refusal to disqualify the UMWA\u2019s retained counsel because of the potential conflict of interest we found present.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">After remand to the District Court, the UMWA\u2019s general counsel and his staff entered their appearance on behalf of the UMWA. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to disqualify these attorneys as well was denied by the District Court. We held that the UMWA\u2019s general counsel and his associates were similarly precluded from representing the UMWA because of their close association with and representation of individual defendants in other litigation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In response to these decisions, the UMWA engaged counsel who are unaffiliated with any other party to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-14\">Yablonski was murdered in December 1969. Of the plaintiffs, only Yablonski had requested the UMWA to sue the officers before he instituted the derivative suit as required by Section 501(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For this reason, the individual defendants and the UMWA moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the remaining plaintiffs, by failing to comply with Section 501(b), lacked standing to maintain the action. The instant interlocutory appeals were granted to review the District Court\u2019s denial of these motions to dismiss.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-15\">Subsequent to the filing of UMWA\u2019s brief on appeal, new UMWA elections were held<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and a slate of officers led by Arnold Miller replaced the incumbents. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Mike Trbovich and Harry Patrick, two of the plaintiffs, were elected vice-president and secretary-treasurer, respectively. Plaintiff Yablonski\u2019s son and his staff, who formerly were counsel to plaintiffs Trbovich and Patrick, became general counsel and associate counsel of the UMWA and withdrew from representation of Trbovich and Patrick. Independent counsel for the UMWA were then advised that the new general counsel would pursue the litigation for the UMWA and were requested to withdraw their appearances.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">At a status call', the District Court was informed of UMWA\u2019s wish to realign as party-plaintiff in the action and to be represented by its general counsel. Independent counsel contended that representation of UMWA by the general counsel\u2019s staff would entail the same difficulty presented in the earlier appeals because of their earlier appearance on behalf of Trbovich and Patrick. The District Court concluded that since an interlocutory appeal brought by the UMWA was pending, motions for leave to realign the UMWA as plaintiff and for leave of Yablonski\u2019s staff to appear on the UMWA\u2019s behalf should be directed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In response to the District Court\u2019s ruling, the present motions were filed. The UMWA seeks (1) leave to withdraw the appeal it brought; (2) to intervene as appellee in the appeal brought by the officer-defendants; (3) leave for its new general counsel and staff to appear on its behalf; and (4) to dismiss the appeal brought by the officer-defendants as moot in view of the UMWA\u2019s presence as plaintiff-appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">We consider first the UMWA\u2019s motion for leave of its general and associate counsel to represent the UMWA in this litigation. The officer-appellants contend that only objective counsel-\u2014 counsel without bias toward either the plaintiffs or the defendant officers \u2014 can satisfy the standards established by our earlier decisions in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As the UMWA emphasizes, however, our earlier decisions, concerned situations wherein the UMWA had selected as its counsel close affiliates of the very officers who were the targets of derivative actions charging breach of their fiduciary duties to the UMWA and its members.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We deemed \u201ccritical\u201d the fact that counsel in each case were representing or had \u201crepresented to some extent union officers who are accused of wrongdoing in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> What primarily concerned us was the strong possibility of a conflict of interest created by those affiliations,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and it was in that context that we imposed on the UMWA the requirement of retaining \u201cunquestionably independent counsel\u201d:<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-12\">Where, as here, union officials are charged with breach of fiduciary duty, the organization is entitled to an evaluation and representation of its institutional interests by independent counsel, <em>unencumbered by potentially conflicting obligations to any defendant officer.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>The potential for a conflict existed because of the possibility that in defending the UMWA\u2019s interests, counsel might have had to assert positions antagonistic to those dutifully urged or to be urged in defense of the individual officers. Conversely, counsel might have been deterred from aggressively representing the interests of the UMWA and its members because of a lingering allegiance to these officers.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The latter obstacle would have directly frustrated a primary purpose of the LMRDA to insure that labor unions be guided by the highest standards of ethical conduct.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">It is essential to emphasize, however, as we did in our first opinion, that \u201cseparate counsel is required <em>only </em>in a situation where there is a potential conflict between the interests of the union and those of its officers.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Our previous decisions were not intended to bar the UMWA from being represented by counsel of its own choice if that representation does not generate the possibility of discordant obligations.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We perceive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>no chance of such a conflict in the present effort of UMWA\u2019s new general counsel to appear on the UMWA\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Counsel\u2019s former clients, Trbovich and Patrick, together with other UMWA members, initiated this litigation as a derivative action for the benefit of the UMWA, not for the benefit of themselves individually. The UMWA possesses exclusively the financial interest at stake because any recovery in the action belongs to it. Thus, although under its former leadership the UMWA was aligned as a defendant in the controversy, the litigation since its commencement has in reality been its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The UMWA now seeks to reverse its stance and to align itself as plaintiff-appellee. We see no reason whatever to doubt that in view of the change occasioned by the recent UMWA elections, the UMWA\u2019s position will in fact remain consistent with that which the original plaintiff-appellees have assumed from the beginning.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Since the two positions coincide, counsel will undoubtedly be able to represent the UMWA without impinging on interests or confidences of their former clients.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Furthermore, unlike the officer clients of the counsel we earlier disqualified, Trbovich and Patrick have never been accused of misconduct in union matters. Consequently, the risk of conflict which existed in the earlier cases \u2014 where counsel may have been duty bound to shield the officers to the detriment of the UMWA whose interests they were also obligated to protect \u2014 simply does not exist in the circumstances presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-15\">Because we find no potential conflict of interest in the representation of the UMWA by its present general counsel in this litigation,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> there is no ground for a denial of UMWA\u2019s request. Permitting the UMWA to select its own counsel in this matter, where no likelihood of conflict is apparent, advances the policy of the LMRDA to accord unions as much independence as possible in Section 501(b) actions.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We accordingly grant the motion by appellant UMWA for leave of its general counsel and his staff to appear on its behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-16\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b649-17\"> The District Court declined to rule on the UMWA\u2019s motion to realign from party-defendant to party-plaintiff because these appeals were pending. The UMWA now moves this court for leave to withdraw its own appeal, to intervene in the appeal brought by the in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>dividual defendants, and to dismiss the latter appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">At the commencement of this litigation, the UMWA, under the former regime, chose to assume a defensive role. Since that time, by virtue of the elections held earlier this year, the leadership of the UMWA has changed and the newly elected officers now wish the UMWA to assume prosecution of the cause.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The UMWA has taken this position in the belief that the action can legally be continued in the District Court by the surviving plaintiffs and that, in the alternative, the UMWA itself may assume the litigation as party-plaintiff, thereby mooting the only issue which these appeals seek to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Clearly, the UMWA, like any labor organization, \u201chas an interest in formulating its own policies, making its own decisions,' and conducting its own affairs.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> It \u201cis free to say which side of a controversy involving a legitimate institutional interest it will take\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> because the UMWA, like a corporation in a shareholder\u2019s derivative action,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> retains the primary interest in the litigation. The mere fact that individual members have initiated the action does not prohibit the UMWA from reversing its position and taking the offensive in its prosecution.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">Although this decision is clearly within the newly-elected officers\u2019 authority,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the officer-appellants would have us compel the UMWA to maintain a defensive role. It simply is not the court\u2019s function to make that decision for the UMWA.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> No less in the prosecution of litigation than in the pursuit of other affairs is a union at liberty to shape its own destiny within the boundaries set by law. Moreover, in conditioning the availability of a derivative action under Section 501 on the refusal of a union to bring the action itself,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Congress expressed its preference that the union prosecute a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against union officials. Allowing the UMWA to assume the prosecution of this cause would further that legislative preference. Since UMWA\u2019s present position is to prosecute vigorously the action brought for its benefit, it must be accorded that right.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\"> Absent the potential for a conflict of interest or a showing of bad faith in the Union\u2019s effort to withdraw its appeal and to realign as party-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>plaintiff,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> neither of which is apparent in this case, there is no reason for not allowing it to do so.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Accordingly, we grant UMWA\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw its appeal and remand the cause to the District Court with instructions to permit the UMWA to realign as party-plaintiff.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Because we are directing the District Court to permit the realignment, the issue tendered by the defendant officers\u2019 appeal \u2014 whether the action survived the death of the only plaintiff who complied with the prerequisite to a Section 501(b) suit \u2014 has become academic. Consequently, we dismiss that appeal as moot and, in accordance with United States v. Munsingwear, Inc.,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> vacate the order of the District Court from which the appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-12\">.

This is all the more apparent in light of International Bhd. of Teamsters v.

Independent counsel suggest that realignment of the UMWA as party-plaintiff may be barred by the staute of limitations. We reject this proposition in view of the clear weight of authority to the contrary. <em>See </em>Annot., 69 A.L.R.2d 562, 578-579 (1960); 13 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations \u00a7 6001 at 465 (1970); 3 J. Moore, Federal Practice jf 15.15 [4.-1] (1972); 3A <em>id. </em>\u00b6 21.03 [2] (1970). Furthermore, the doctrine of laches would not preclude realignment. That defense is carefully scrutinized in actions based on breach of fiduciary duties. Libby v. L. J. Corp., 101 U.S.App.D.C. 87, 247 F.2d 78 (1957). It requires a finding of unreasonable delay which will cause prejudice to the defendant. Powell v. Zuckert, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 55, 366 F.2d 634 (1966). The officer-appellants have not urged this defense in response to the motions made to this court by the UMWA and we find that such a defense would be untenable. The delay in the realignment is due solely to the fact that until the recent UMWA elections, the UMWA was controlled by the individual defendants who chose to have the UMWA defend the action. Moreover, since the individual appellants have defended the action since its commencement and no additional burden would be imposed in defending against the UMWA in lieu of the \u25a0 individual plaintiffs, realignment would not appear to cause the defendant officers any prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b651-19\">. In view of the realignment of the UMWA as party-plaintiff, and with particular regard to the withdrawal by the UMWA\u2019s house counsel of their appearance on behalf of the plaintiff-appellees and counsel\u2019s current representation of the UMWA in the action, it is our understanding that the plaintiff-appellees will move the District Court for leave to be dropped as party-plaintiffs. <em>See </em>Lazar v. Merchants\u2019 Nat\u2019l Properties, Inc., 22 A.D.2d 253, 254 N.Y.S.2d 712 (Sup.Ct.1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b651-20\">. 340 U.S. 36, 71 S.Ct. 104, 95 L.Ed. 36 (1950). This court has long adhered to the <em>Munsingwear </em>doctrine requiring the appellate court to vacate a judgment of the district court from which an appeal is taken if that appeal is dismissed on the ground of mootness. <em>E. g., </em>Cadillac Publishing Co. v. Summerfield, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 343, 267 F.2d 620 (1958); Dulles v. Nathan, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 190, 225 F.2d 29 (1955); Acheson v. Droesse, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 143, 197 F.2d 574 (1952); <em>see </em>Schoop v. Mitchell, 143 U.S.App.D.C. 405, 444 F.2d 863, cert. denied, 402 U.S. 988, 91 S.Ct. 1663, 29 L.Ed.2d 154 (1971); Anderson v.

In this case, although the UMWA did not request that we vacate the judgment of the District Court, a vacatur may be entered by this court sua sponte to preserve the rights of the parties.
