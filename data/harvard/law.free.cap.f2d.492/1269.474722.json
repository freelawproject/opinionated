We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-20\">In considering defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, the district court was required to take as true all the allegations of the complaint. Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>322, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 (1972); Gibson v. United States, 457 F.2d 1391, 1393 (3d Cir. 1972). Plaintiff\u2019s complaint avers that he was employed for approximately eight years, ending in December, 1969, as an agent and employee of the defendants, first as a special agent for the Federal Bureau of Drug Abuse Control and ultimately as a special agent for the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs; that during his tenure as a federal employee, he received several grade promotions, commendations and awards for the performance of his duties in a manner which was substantially satisfactory or better; that in December, 1969, he resigned from his Federal employment, while stationed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, rather than accept a transfer to Minneapolis, Minnesota; that his resignation was caused by reasons of personal illness, illness in his family, and other personal hardships which rendered impossible plaintiff\u2019s relocation to Minneapolis, Minnesota; that subsequent to terminating his employment with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, he made application for new employment with numerous public and private law enforcement agencies and with educational institutions, seeking employment both in law enforcement and in law enforcement education; that he made application with Federal law enforcement agencies in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and in New York City, New York, with Pennsylvania state law enforcement agencies, and with community law enforcement agencies and Western Pennsylvania universities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-4\">In his amended complaint he specifically averred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1336-5\">9(a). In each instance involving a particular prospective employer, his application for employment was refused by that prospective employer because of adverse statements and comments made to said employer by the defendants herein, and their agents and employees, to the effect that plaintiff is not a fit or competent law enforcement officer, or that plaintiff\u2019s performance with the Federal government was substandard, or that plaintiff was the subject of disciplinary action before his termination with the government agency, or that plaintiff was, in effect, discharged by the Federal agency for misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1336-9\">9(b). Having undertaken and accepted the status of plaintiff\u2019s employer, the defendants herein assumed the duty and obligation to plaintiff to maintain accurate records of plaintiff\u2019s performance and employment history and to maintain such information concerning plaintiff available to all government employees and other persons having a reasonable and justifiable interest therein. Defendants breached that duty and obligation to plaintiff by their negligent, wrongful, tortious conduct in failing to maintain complete, comprehensive, adequate, and accurate records of plaintiff\u2019s professional performance and employment history, of plaintiff\u2019s exceptional performance of his duties and receipt of commendations and awards in particular circumstances, and of the true circumstances of plaintiff's termination of employment with the federal agencies involved. Defendants further breached their duty and obligation to plaintiff by their failure to maintain and make available to reasonably and justifiably interested persons, including federal agents and employees, of complete and accurate information regarding plaintiff\u2019s performance and employment history.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-5\">We take as our threshold inquiry whether plaintiff\u2019s averments set forth a claim upon which relief can be granted, \u201cin appraising the sufficiency of the complaint we follow, of course, the accepted rule that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). And to do substantial justice, reasonable factual inferences will be drawn to aid the pleader. F.R.C.P. 8(f); 5 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 1363 at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-6\">Section 1346(b) of the Federal Tort Claims Act commands that we look to \u201cthe law of the place where the [negligent or wrongful] act or omission occurred.\u201d Since the gravamen of plaintiff\u2019s complaint is the negligent maintenance of employment records, and since plaintiff averred that he was last stationed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, it is reasonable to infer that his records were maintained in that state. Thus, we must decide if the state of Pennsylvania would recognize a tort of negligently maintaining employment records as distinguished from the tort of defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-7\">Plaintiff argues that the law imposes a duty on an employer to use due care in maintaining an employee\u2019s work history once it has undertaken the task of such recordkeeping and that injury to the ex-employee\u2019s reputation is foreseeable when an employer disseminates such information to prospective employers. For its part, the government argues: \u201cIn the instant case, there is present no tort principle which makes an employer\u2019s failure to compile and maintain complete employment records actionable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-10\">Because there are no precise Pennsylvania precedents, we turn again, as we did in Boase v. Lee Rubber &amp; Tire Corporation, 437 F.2d 527, 531 (3d Cir. 1970), \u201cto the teaching of Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Estate of Bosch, 387 U.S. 456, 87 S.Ct. 1776, 18 L.Ed.2d 886 (1967): \u2018federal authorities must apply what they find to be the state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-11\">. . . In this.respect, it may be said to be, in effect, sitting as a state court.\u2019 \u201d \u201c[I]t is incumbent on us to make our own determination of what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would probably rule in a similar case.\u201d Gerr v. Emrick, 283 F.2d 293, 294 (3d Cir. 1960), cert. denied, 365 U.S. 817, 81 S.Ct. 698, 5 L.Ed.2d 695 (1961). In doing so, we perceive our analysis to require two determinations: whether the Pennsylvania law of libel and slander would pre-empt such a claim in negligence; if not, whether that state would recognize plaintiff\u2019s averments as constituting a recognized cause of action in negligence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have concluded that there would be no pre-emption and that, under the facts as alleged, Pennsylvania courts would be hospitable to a cause of action in negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-14\">It is essential to define and analyze the elements of the two torts as recognized by Pennsylvania, a common law state. Conduct is negligent \u201cif the harmful consequences could reasonably have been foreseen and prevented by the exercise of reasonable care.\u201d Lerro v. Thomas Wynne, Inc., 451 Pa. 37, 301 A.2d 705, 708 (1973). Restated, the act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>negligence consists of the existence of a legal duty and a breach thereof.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cLibel is the malicious publication of printed or written matter which tends to blacken a person\u2019s reputation and expose him to public hatred, contempt or ridicule.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The word \u201cslander\u201d is the general and original word for all kinds of defamation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, in modern usage it has been limited to defamation by words spoken rather than written, that is, to the speaking of base and defamatory words which tend to prejudice another\u2019s reputation, office, trade, business, or means of making a living.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Malice is essential to an action for defamation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1338-4\">It quickly becomes apparent that the root premises of negligence and defamation are conceptually distinct. Proceeding from this rudimentary analysis to a consideration of the two specific torts embraced by these concepts, we see differences in the causes of action as well. To state a cause of action for negligence the plaintiff must plead a legal duty, a breach of that duty, proximate or legal cause, and actual damage or injury. Boyce v. United States Steel Corporation, 446 Pa. 226, 285 A.2d 459 (1971); Whitner v. Von Hintz, 437 Pa. 448, 263 A.2d 889 (1970); Kirby v. Carlisle, 178 Pa.Super. 389, 116 A.2d 220 (1955). To state a cause of action for defamation generally the plaintiff must allege the defamatory character of the communication, publication, that the communication refers to the plaintiff, the third party\u2019s understanding of the communication\u2019s defamatory character and its reference to the plaintiff, and injury. Corabi v. Curtis Publishing Company, 441 Pa. 432, 273 A.2d 899 (1971); Cosgrove Studio and Camera Shop, Inc. v. Pane, 408 Pa. 314, 182 A.2d 751 (1962); Act of August 21, 1953, P.L. 1291, \u00a7 1, 12 Pa.Stat.Anno. \u00a7 1584a. As previously observed, malice is essential to an action for defamation in Pennsylvania; as a general rule, it is presumed or implied to exist from the unprivileged publication of defamatory words actionable per se. Corabi v. Curtis Publishing Company, <em>supra, </em>273 A.2d at 909. It is not necessary that the defendant harbor ill will against any particular person.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Le<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>gal malice alone is sufficient to support an action. Legal malice has been defined as \u201ca <em>wrongful </em>act done intentionally, without just cause or excuse. . .\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, it appears that Pennsylvania considers the defamation torts of libel and slander to be intentional in nature, rather than accidental or unintentional. Harper and James also list the law of defamation in \u201cPart One: Intended Torts\u201d; negligence is listed in \u201cPart Two: Accidents.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1339-6\">In, addition to the differences in the ingredients of these separate torts, the Pennsylvania legislature has seen fit to codify certain aspects of the law of defamation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There is no such counterpart in the general law of negligence. The legislature has prescribed a separate statute of limitations for defamation actions, which is shorter than those for injuries or property damage from acts of negligence generally.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1339-7\">Another distinction is the requirement of proof of injuries. Pennsylvania requires proof of actual damages in order to recover in an action for negligence'. Kirby v. Carlisle, <em>supra. </em>In defamation if the words in themselves are defamatory, defamatory <em>per se, </em>general damages for loss of personal or business reputation are recoverable and no averments or proof of special damages are necessary. Cosgrove Studio and Camera Shop, Inc. v. Pane, <em>supra, </em>182 A.2d at 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-14\">Notwithstanding these distinctions, it would seem that the interest sought to be protected in this case, whether by an action in negligence or in defamation, would appear to be the same: \u201cthe interest in reputation \u2014 the interest in acquiring, retaining, and enjoying a reputation as good as one\u2019s character and conduct warrant.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But this phenomenon is not unusual to the substantive law of torts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> For example, if one strikes another with his automobile, under certain circumstances, three separate torts could be pursued in Pennsylvania: trespass vi et armis, negligence and strict liability. Each protects the plaintiff\u2019s interest in freedom from bodily injury. In the case <em>sub judies </em>the plaintiff is merely protecting his interest in his reputation and is not restricted to the choice of one remedy. Similarly, in federal practice one civil remedy will not pre-empt another, and specifically, it has been held that one remedy will not pre-empt others under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Rogers v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>United States, 397 F.2d 12, 15 (4th Cir. 1968).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\">In sum, the essence of the tort of defamation is the publication of defamatory matter. The gravamen of plaintiff\u2019s complaint, as recognized by the district court, was the \u201cBNDD\u2019s alleged failure to maintain adequate employment records. . . . \u201d It is not the publication of the incorrect employment history and record that serves as the foundation of plaintiff\u2019s complaint; it is the method in which the defendant maintained the record of his employment that is being criticized. Accordingly, we are persuaded that the Pennsylvania courts would not view the defamatory torts as pre-empting a cause of action sounding in negligence and based on an employer\u2019s failure to use due care in the maintenance of an employee\u2019s employment records.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-7\">This brings us to the question whether Pennsylvania would recognize plaintiff\u2019s allegations as constituting a cause of action in negligence. We first must determine whether as set forth in the Restatement, Torts 2d, \u201cthe interest invaded is protected against unintentional invasion,\u201d \u00a7 281(a), or as more familiarly stated, whether his employer owed a legal duty to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-8\">Plaintiff must bring himself within the scope of a definite legal obligation, so that it might be regarded as personal to him. \u201cNegligence in the air, so to speak, will not do.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Professor Leon Green reminds us: \u201cThe scope of a defendant\u2019s duty depends on how far the law\u2019s protection will be extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-13\">The determination of the issue of duty and whether it includes the particular risk imposed on the victim ultimately rests upon broad policies which underlie the law.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1340-14\">Dean Erwin Griswold reminds us that Cardozo emphasized: \u201cThe judge . . . is to draw his inspiration from consecrated principles. He is not to yield to spasmodic sentiment, to vague and unregulated benevolence. He is to exercise a discretion informed by tradition, methodized by analogy, disciplined by system. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Mindful of these precepts we turn to elementary principles set forth in Section 285, Restatement, Torts 2d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-16\">The standard of conduct of a reasonable man may be</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-17\">(a) established by a legislative enactment or administrative regulation which so provides, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-18\">(b) adopted by the court from a legislative enactment or an administrative regulation which does not so provide, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-20\">(c) established by judicial decision, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-21\">(d) applied to the facts of the case by the trial judge or the jury, if there is no such enactment, regulation, or decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1340-22\">First, we note that federal administrative regulations govern the es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>tablishment, maintenance and disclosure of personnel records of executive department employees like plaintiff. Pursuant to Executive Order 10561, September 13, 1954, the Civil Service Commission issued regulations, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 293.201 et seq., and \u00a7 294.101 et seq., which require that \u201ceach agency [of the executive department] shall establish an Official Personnel Folder for each employee. .\u201d And, to \u201cmeet the need for quick identification of the many laws, rules, regulations, and instructions pertinent to personnel administration .\u201d the Civil Service Commission also designed an official publication, the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM). Basically, this comprehensive and detailed publication is the personnel \u201cbible\u201d of the Civil Service Commission. The manual explains that the personnel records \u201cin the folder vitally affect the rights and benefits of individual employees as well as the interests of the Government. It is therefore important that the instructions for the maintenance and disposition of folders be carried out with the <em>utmost care and that all necessary precautions be taken to safeguard the folder and its contents.\u201d </em>FPM 293-7, 8 (emphasis supplied). The regulations require the Official Personnel Folder to contain \u201creports of selection and other personnel actions . . . [as well as] permanent and temporary records affecting the employee\u2019s status and service. ...\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 293.204. Specific examples of the contents, \u201cperformance ratings, . admonishments, letters of caution, warning, reprimand, and similar disciplinary action papers,\u201d are set forth in FPM 2-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-14\">Moreover, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 294.702, mandates what information may be made available to a prospective employer of a Government employee or former Government employee.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Definite restrictions as to dissemination of employment information are imposed. A special procedure is mandated for \u201cDisclosure of disciplinary action information.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Since the regulations contemplate the dissemination of information to prospective employers and impose certain safeguards, a risk of injury to an employee\u2019s reputation is contemplated. Thus, it follows that there arises a corresponding duty to use reasonable care in maintaining the accuracy of the records. By finding that the United States does owe plaintiff a duty of reasonable care in the maintenance of his personnel folder, we do not indicate the precise bounds of the government\u2019s duty, nor intimate that the duty is breached merely by permitting inaccurate information to be filed or by failing to file pertinent information. Questions of breach of duty and causation, as well as possible defenses to the action in negligence, will be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>by the district court on remand in the processing of plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-4\">Alternatively, we have endeavored to ascertain whether a standard of conduct for the employer can be said to have been established by Pennsylvania judicial decision. While our research has uncovered no precise precedent covering the facts of this ease, we know, at least, that the employer would be required to confront the doctrine that one who gratuitously assumes to render a service obligates himself to proceed with due care.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201cIt is ancient learning that one who assumes to act, even though gratuitously, may thereby become subject to the duty of acting carefully, if he acts at all.\u201d Cardozo, J., Glanzer v. Shepard, 233 N.Y. 236, 239, 135 N.E. 275, 276 (1922). \u201c \u2018When an agency of the United States voluntarily undertakes a task, it can be held to have accepted the duty of performing that task with due care.\u2019 Rogers v. United States, 397 F.2d 12, 14 (4th Cir. 1968),\u201d Gibson v. United States, <em>supra, </em>457 F.2d at 1394.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-5\">Having due regard for those principles of tort law followed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, we are persuaded that the state courts would recognize a duty of the defendant personal to the plaintiff to use due care in keeping and maintaining employment records, and that for breach of that duty, plaintiff may have a cause of action if he is injured thereby and if the defendant\u2019s breach was the proximate cause of his injury. We do nothing more than continue \u201cin the tradition of spinning out applications of accepted precedents. . . . \u201d Keeton, Judicial Law Reform \u2014A Perspective in the Performance of Appellate Courts, 44 Texas L.Rev. 1254, 1254-1255 (1966). We find nothing in the recent history of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to the contrary.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u201cNew and nameless torts are being recognized constantly, and the progress of the common law is marked by many cases of first impression, in which the court has struck out boldly to create a new cause of action, where none had been recognized before. . . . When it becomes clear that the plaintiff\u2019s interests are entitled to legal protection against the conduct of the defendant, the mere fact that the claim is novel will not of itself operate as a bar to the remedy.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Although negligence law is generally associated with bodily or physical injuries, there is no conceptual impediment to the recovery' for non-traumatic injury. As a leading case expresses the scope of the law\u2019s protection: \u201c[W]e see no good reason why a wrongful invasion of a legal right, causing an injury to the body or mind . . should not give rise to a right of action. . \u2019. . \u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1342-16\">In recent years we have witnessed rapid, if not revolutionary, development in judge-made tort law by Pennsylvania courts. Some of the more dramatic changes in the law of torts made by Pennsylvania courts in recent years are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>noted that in each of these developments the Pennsylvania court was expanding and not contracting liability of defendants and increasing recoveries for plaintiffs. Thus there is nothing in principle, nor precedent, nor manifest in the contemporary jurisprudential philosophy of Pennsylvania courts which would tend to foreclose plaintiff\u2019s course of action in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-6\">Concluding that plaintiff has set forth a claim for relief recognizable by Pennsylvania courts does not end our inquiry, for we must also determine whether, as a matter of federal law, such a claim is one \u201carising out of . . . libel [or] slander . . .\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2680(h). If it does arise out of libel and slander, then the claim is simply not one for which relief may be had against the Government under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Our analysis of this question of interpretation is not without its precedential guideposts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-7\">When Congress passed the Federal Tort Claims Act it used neither intricate nor restrictive language in waiving the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity. United States v. Muniz, 374 U.S. 150, 152, 83 S.Ct. 1850, 10 L.Ed.2d 805 (1963). At the same time, Congress qualified this broad waiver of immunity in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680, \u201cfor certain specified torts of federal employees.\u201d Dalehite v. United States, 346 U.S. 15, 17, 73 S.Ct. 956, 958, 97 L.Ed. 1427 (1953). The reason for Congressional passage of the Act has been succinctly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1343-9\">It was the offspring of a feeling that the Government should assume the obligation to pay damages for the misfeasance of employees in carrying out its work. And the private bill device waA notoriously clumsy. Some simplified recovery procedure for the mass of claims was imperative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1343-10\"><em>Ibid., </em>346 U.S. at 24-25, 73 S.Ct. at 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-11\">Mindful that the Act must be interpreted in such a way that its legislative purposes are carried out, that we must look beyond the literal meaning of the language of the complaint, and that we must avoid drawing \u201cdistinctions so finespun and capricious as to be almost incapable of being held in the mind for adequate formulation,\u201d Indian Towing Co. v. United States, 350 U.S. 61, 68, 76 S.Ct. 122, 126, 100 L.Ed. 48 (1955), we are also acutely aware that \u201cthe Government\u2019s liability is no longer restricted to\u2019 circumstances in which government bodies have traditionally been responsible for misconduct of their employees. The Act extends to novel and unprecedented forms of liability as well.\u201d United States v. Muniz, <em>supra, </em>374 U.S. at 159, 83 S.Ct. at 1856; United States v. Neustadt, 366 U.S. 696, 703, 708, 81 S.Ct. 1294, 6 L.Ed.2d 614; Dalehite v. United States, <em>supra, </em>346 U.S. at 31, 73 S.Ct. 956, 97 L.Ed. 1427.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-12\">These governing principles persuade us'that Congress has relinquished its sovereign immunity under the factual complex of this case. Basically, the Government\u2019s argument before us parallels its contention in the district court: the essence of plaintiff\u2019s complaint is defamation; therefore, such action is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>barred by the express language of \u00a7 2680(h). It seeks to distinguish Gibson v. United States, <em>supra, </em>and places reliance on our earlier cases of Cenna v. United States, 402 F.2d 168 (3d Cir. 1968), and Dupree v. United States, 264 F.2d 140 (3d Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 823, 80 S.Ct. 69, 4 L.Ed.2d 67 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-4\">In <em>Gibson </em>we emphasized that \u201cSection 2680(h) addresses itself primarily to intentional torts for which Congress was unwilling to assume liability.\u201d 457 F.2d at 1395. We were careful to limit our statement with \u201cprimarily,\u201d for it has been held that \u201cmisrepresentation, deceit\u201d as embodied in the exclusionary statute, \u00a7 2680(h), embraces negligent as well as intentional misrepresentation; United States v. Neustadt, <em>supra, </em>366 U.S. at 702, 81 S.Ct. 1294, 6 L.Ed.2d 614; Cenna v. United States, <em>supra, </em>402 F.2d at 171. <em>Neustadt </em>recognized that in using both the terms \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d and \u201cdeceit,\u201d Congress recognized the basic distinctions between the two torts. Because misrepresentation may have a conceptual basis in negligence, the Court reasoned that \u201c \u2018deceit\u2019 alone would have been sufficient had Congress intended only to except deliberately false representations.\u201d 366 U.S. at 707, 81 S.Ct. at 1301 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-5\">As the tort of misrepresentation differs conceptually from the tort of deceit, the tort of negligently maintaining the personnel records of an employee differs from the defamatory torts of libel and slander. But here the resemblance between this case and the cases of <em>Neustadt, Cenna </em>and <em>Dupree </em>comes to an end. Here only \u201clibel, slander\u201d are specifically excluded; generic negligent claims are not. In <em>Neustadt </em>and <em>Cenna </em>there was a specific statutory exclusion of \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d; here there is no express exclusion of the remedy pursued. In <em>Dupree </em>there was a specific statutory exclusion of \u201cinterference with contract rights\u201d; again, here there is no express exclusion of the remedy pursued. To hold that a claim for negligent maintenance of employee records is excluded by the statutory language \u201clibel, slander\u201d would be to read into the Act an exclusion that does not exist by language or by implication. Moreover, to so interpret the statute would require an assumption that Congress was unaware of established tort definitions.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This we simply cannot and will not do. We hearken to the teachings of Chief Justice Warren in United States v. Muniz:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-8\">The Federal Tort Claims Act provides much-needed relief to those suffering injury from the negligence of government employees. We should not, at the same time that state courts are striving to mitigate the hardships caused by sovereign immunity, narrow the remedies provided by Congress. As we said in Rayonier, Inc. v. United States, . . . [352 U.S. 315 (1957)] at 320, 77 S.Ct. 374, 1 L.Ed.2d 354, \u201cThere is no justification for this Court to read exemptions into the Act beyond those provided by Congress. If the Act is to be altered that is a function for the same body that adopted it.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1344-10\">In excluding certain tort causes of'action from the Federal Tort Claims Act, Congress focused its attention upon the type of governmental activity that might cause harm, not upon the type of harm caused. In excluding actions in libel and slander, Congress, in our view, was not concerned with the difficulties involved in proof of injury to reputation, as the government here urges. Rather the concern was that government officials should not be hampered in their writing and speaking by the possibility that their actions would give rise to government liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-11\">The plaintiff alleges that two distinct duties were breached by the defendant: (1) the duty to maintain complete and accurate records of plaintiff\u2019s employment history, and (2) the duty to accu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>rately represent plaintiff\u2019s past employment history to prospective employers. The district court., considering these contentions together, held that they amounted to a complaint for damage from publication of false information, and that such a complaint was, in essence, one of libel or slander, which causes of action cannot be brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-4\">All that we decide here is that the first duty exists and that it can be enforced through an action based on a general negligence theory. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint states a claim here not only because negligence is conceptually distinct from defamation, but also because the negligence alleged here was distinct from the mere writing or speaking for which Congress did not provide liability. To the extent the complaint before us is based on allegations respecting this second alleged duty, i. e., the duty on the part of the government to disseminate accurate information, such a claim is barred by the libel and slander exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act, as conceded by appellant at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-5\">The judgment of the district court will be reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1335-11\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1335-12\">(b) [T]he district courts . . . , shall have exclusive jurisdiction, of civil actions on claims against the United States, for money damages, accruing on and after January 1, 1945, for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1335-22\">.
