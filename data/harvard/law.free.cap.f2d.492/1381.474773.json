Detroit Lions, Inc., Civil Action No. 37652 (E.D.Mich. Nov. 16, 1973).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1445-16\">LAY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AqqB\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-17\">I concur in the affirmance of the district court\u2019s judgment on the ground that plaintiff has demonstrated no anti-competitive effect flowing from the Minnesota Vikings Football Club\u2019s requirement that a season ticket holder purchase tickets to the exhibition games along with regular season games. The basis of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, i. e., that there existed no \u201ccoercive effect\u201d since there were available some regular tickets (approximately 2,500 to 4,000) for purchase by the general public for each game gives me concern. It is difficult for me to say as a matter of law that no coercion exists. Assuming the other elements of a \u201ctie-in\u201d could be proved, I would think whether coercion exists is a question of fact to be evaluated in light of all of the attendant circumstances.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
