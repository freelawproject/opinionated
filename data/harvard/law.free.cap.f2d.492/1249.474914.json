(Gulf) for the shipment of several thousand bags of flour from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Puerto Rico. The flour was transported aboai\u2019d Gulf\u2019s vessel SS MAIDEN CREEK, and arrived at its destination in December 1969 in partially damaged condition. The contract of carriage between the parties was set forth in a bill of lading issued by Gulf, which provided, in relevant part, that the agreement \u201cshall have effect subject to the provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act [COGSA. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1300, et seq. (1970) ].\u201d Pursuant to COGSA, no action for damages incurred during shipment may be maintained \u201cunless suit is brought within one year after delivery of the goods . . .\u201d46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303(6). Prior to shipment of the flour, however, the Gulf bill of lading was overstamped by government officials to provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-14\">\u201cThis shipment is made under all terms and conditions of the Standard Form Government Bill of Lading and subject to the terms and procedures set forth in the Comptroller General of the United States Circular Letter B-150556, dated June 16, 1967.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1314-15\">Among the provisions of the Standard Form is an explicit waiver by the carrier of all periods of limitation which would be otherwise applicable to commercial shipments. . '</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-16\">In July 1971, some eighteen months after delivery of the damaged goods, the United States brought suit against Gulf, which promptly moved for summary judgment on the ground that, under \u00a7 1303(6), the action was time-barred. In response to this motion, the government contended that (1) Gulf had effectively waived \u00a7 1303(6) by accepting the over-stamped bill of lading, and (2) that even without such a waiver, \u00a7 1303(6) could not bar actions brought by the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>States, since in order for statutes of limitation to apply to the federal government, there must be a clear manifestation of Congressional intent, not present in the legislative history of COGSA. The district court, finding a waiver of \u00a7 1303(6), denied Gulf\u2019s motion. This matter is here on interlocutory appeal, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-4\">We agree with the district court that Gulf\u2019s willingness to comply with the contract, despite the government\u2019s overstamp, operated to deprive it of any statutory defense of time limitation which might have been available under \u00a7 1303(6). We note that pursuant to 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305, a carrier \u201cshall be at liberty to surrender in whole or in part all or any of his rights and immunities\u201d under COGSA. Relying either explicitly or implicitly on this section, courts have consistently recognized the legality of a waiver of the \u00a7 1303(6) limitations period. <em>See </em>e. g., United Fruit Co. v. J. A. Folger &amp; Co., 270 F.2d 666 (5th Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 362 U.S. 911, 80 S.Ct. 682, 4 L.Ed.2d 619 (1960); Monarch Industries Corp. v. American Motorists Ins. Co., 276 F.Supp. 972 (S.D.N.Y.1967); The Argentino, 28 F.Supp. 440 (S.D.N.Y.1939); <em>cf. </em>United States v. Gydnia American Shipping Lines, 57 F.Supp. 369 (S.D.N.Y.1944). Although the above cited cases all involved post-contractual waivers, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that an effective waiver may not be similarly executed at the commencement of the parties\u2019 relationship. It is only where such a waiver is the \u201cresult of an undesirable exertion of superior bargaining power\u201d that a waiver in the original contract will be held invalid. United Fruit Co. v. J. A. Folger &amp; Co., <em>supra, </em>270 F.2d at 668 n. 1 (dictum). The record in the instant case with respect to Gulf\u2019s acceptance of the overstamp is totally devoid of any evidence of an improper use of \u201csuperior bargaining power\u201d by the government.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\">We also reject, for the reasons adequately stated by the district court, defendant\u2019s further assertion that to find a waiver under the circumstances of this case, would result in an impermissible discrimination in favor of the government in violation of 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1309. <em>See also </em>The Argentino, <em>supra, </em>28 F.Supp. at 442-443.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-8\">Additionally, we must recognize that under traditional rules the United States has not been subject to statutes of limitations under any circumstances. Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, 304 U.S. 126, 58 S.Ct. 785, 82 L.Ed. 1224 (1938). When Congress in 1966 prescribed such a limitations period for actions involving the United States, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415, it chose a period of six years (rather than the one year provided by COGSA) subject only to express contrary provision in other statutes. COGSA, which was enacted thirty years prior to \u00a7 2415, and which makes no mention of any limitations period for the United States, is an unlikely candidate for such a contraction of the rights of the United States. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Herron, 87 U.S. (20 Wall.) 251, 22 L.Ed. 275 (1873); United States Nav. Co. v. Cunard S.S. Co., 284 U.S. 474, 52 S.Ct. 247, 76 L.Ed. 408 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-9\">Even though the provisions of COGSA do not place a one-year limitations period on the United States, it is not without significance that the bill of lading was overstamped with a notice to refer to separate provisions applicable to the government. Certain officers of the government, invested by Congress with the power to make contracts for the government on the most advantageous terms and conditions available, might logically make concessions con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>cerning the period of limitations in order to obtain desirable terms on other elements of the transaction. The over-stamp clearly indicates that no such concession was made by the contracting officers in this case, and thus precludes the carrier from arguing that the <em>government </em>has waived <em>its </em>rights. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. The South Star, 210 F.2d 44 (2d Cir. 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">If the result of the totality of the transaction is that the government, by alert dealing, has obtained for itself a position superior to that of private shippers, the result is consistent with the preferential treatment the United States often allows itself in commercial dealings. <em>See, e. g., </em>Alcoa S. S. Co. v. United States, 338 U.S. 421, 422, 70 S.Ct. 190, 94 L.Ed. 225 (1949); Emergency Fleet Corp. v. Western Union Tel. Co., 275 U.S. 415, 48 S.Ct. 198, 72 L.Ed. 345 (1928); 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 22 (preferences under the Interstate Commerce Act). Accordingly, the United States should receive the benefit of the six year limitations period provided in its statute and carefully preserved by its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">. We recognize that the <em>potential </em>for such an improper exercise of bargaining power is particularly great where one of the parties is the federal government. However, we deem it unwise to conclude <em>per se </em>that every contractual waiver in favor of the government was obtained as the result of sucli undesirable governmental action. If such a waiver is sought to be deemed invalid, the shipper must produce actual evidence of inappropriate government bargaining conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
