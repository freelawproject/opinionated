The Board\u2019s Order was based upon its conclusion that the respondent had violated section 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act by refusing to bargain with the certified representative of the respondent\u2019s employees. The reason for the respondent\u2019s refusal was its view that the election of the bargaining representative was invalid and that the Board therefore acted improperly in certifying the particular union as the statutory bargaining representative. The respondent leveled six objections to the conduct of the election, all of which were overruled after having been considered by a Hearing Officer and the Board. We are not persuaded that the Board\u2019s resolution of the objections, which principally involved factual issues, were not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the Board\u2019s Order will be</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-19\">Enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
