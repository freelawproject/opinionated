A search of his ear and person revealed a supply of drugs and $2,200 in cash. The arrest resulted in the revocation of the appellee\u2019s probation arising from previous charges, for which he is currently serving a sentence in the Jefferson County Jail. However, he was not prosecuted on any charge relating to the arrest of April 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">On April 24, 1972, the District Director of Internal Revenue for the District of Kentucky wrote appellee, advising him that pursuant to Section 6851 of the Internal Revenue Code, his taxable period beginning January 1, 1972 was terminated as of April 24, 1972. An income tax of $28,446.88 was said to be immediately due and payable. The next day, on April 25, 1972, an assessment for income taxes in the above amount was made, and a notice of a federal tax lien was filed with the Jefferson County Court in Louisville. Simultaneously, notices of levy were served on appellee and his bank. Three automobiles were taken from the taxpayer while the bank turned over to the I.R.S. appellee\u2019s account, amounting to $12,661.25. Public sale of the automobiles was scheduled for September 14, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">On August 14, 1972, Rambo filed in the United States District Court a complaint seeking both a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting the sale of his cars and requiring that the seized property be returned to him. The court enjoined the public sale, and an interlocutory appeal was taken to this Court. Before the appeal could be heard, the district court entered summary judgment for appellee \u2014 thereby ordering the government to return all property and to refrain from further attempts to collect the tax assessed for the terminated period. Furthermore, the court ordered the I.R.S. to release all encumbrances from the taxpayer\u2019s property. However, during the pendency of this appeal that order was stayed, except that one automobile was released for the use of Rambo\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-10\">Because the issues in this case involve the interpretation and inter-relationship of a substantial number of sections of the Internal Revenue Code, we reproduce the principal ones in the appendix to this opinion rather than in footnotes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-11\">The I.R.S. decided that Rambo\u2019s tax was \u201cin jeopardy\u201d within the ambit of Sec. 6851. This section authorizes the Secretary to terminate the taxable period of a taxpayer and to demand payment of the tax due for such terminated period upon finding that the taxpayer designs to do \u201cany other act tending to prejudice or to render wholly or partly ineffectual\u201d collection of the tax for the current year. Acting pursuant to Sec. 6851, the Service terminated Rambo\u2019s taxable year; determined a tax for the year to date and proceeded to assess the tax. The Service concedes that Sec. 6851 does not contain any independent authority for making an assessment;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> instead, as authority for making the assessment it relies on the general provisions of Sec. 6201. That section generally authorizes the I.R.S. to make assessments of taxes but it makes no reference to a \u201cdeficiency notice.\u201d Once an assessment is made under that section, the I.R.S. could use its extensive statutory power to levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property and hold a public sale to satisfy the amount of the tax. See Sec. 6331 et seq. The taxpayer normally would have no recourse to the courts to halt these proceedings because of the provision in the code which generally prohibits suits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>that seek to restrain the assessment or collection of any tax. Sec. 7421(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">The taxpayer\u2019s only remedy would be to pay the tax; file a return at the end of the taxable year; then bring an action for a refund. See Secs. 6511, 6532 and 7422.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-5\">In the present case the district court rejected the position of the I.R.S. that the assessment was made under See. 6201 primarily because it found that the statutory authority for assessing a tax, which has been determined under Sec. 6851, is conferred by Sec. 6861, not Sec. 6201. Section 6861, which appears in the code under the heading, \u201cJeopardy Assessment,\u201d provides that once the I. R.S. determines that the collection of a \u201cdeficiency\u201d may be jeopardized by delay, it can immediately assess the deficiency and demand payment thereof. In so doing, it must give a deficiency notice to the taxpayer within 60 days after the assessment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is in contrast to the general \u201cdeficiency notice\u201d provision of See. 6212 which authorizes the secretary upon determination of a deficiency to send notice to the taxpayer of such deficiency without specifying the time within which the notice must be given. If the Service fails to issue a deficiency notice under Sec. 6861 after declaring a deficiency, within 60 days of the assessment, the taxpayer may seek an injunction against the collection of the tax and invalidation of any prior levy. Schreck v. United States, 301 F.Supp. 1265 (D.Md.1969); Lisner v. McCanless, 356 F. Supp. 398 (D.Ariz.1973). <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Ball, 326 F.2d 898, 902, 903 (4th Cir. 1964). That is exactly what happened in this case. Since the Internal Revenue Service did not send Rambo a deficiency notice, and since the district court held that authority for assessment was derived from Sec. 6861, the court enjoined collection of the tax and ordered his property returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-8\">The issuance of a deficiency notice is of substantial importance to the taxpayer. The receipt of the notice is a jurisdictional prerequisite to litigation in the Tax Court, 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6213(a); Mason v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 210 F.2d 388 (5th Cir. 1954), to contest the validity of the tax before it is paid. Otherwise, he must pay the full tax and then bring suit in a federal district court for refund. Flora v. United States, 362 U.S. 145, 80 S.Ct. 630, 4 L.Ed.2d 623 (1960) [decision on rehearing of 357 U.S. 63, 78 S.Ct. 1079, 2 L.Ed.2d 1165 (1958)]. Also, while awaiting the decision of the Tax Court, the jeopardy taxpayer may stall collection proceedings if he is able to post an adequate bond, Sec. 6863(a). If he cannot, the seized property cannot be sold absent certain limited exigent circumstances. Sec. 6863(b)(3)(A). The I.R.S. may abate the jeopardy assessment if it finds that jeopardy does not exist. Sec. 6861(g). Although the I.R.S. still has extensive power under the jeopardy assessment provisions of Sec. 6861, such as the power to make an assessment and to seize but not to sell property, the limited procedural safeguards to the taxpayer under that section are of unquestionable value to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-9\">The government argues that the crucial flaw in the opinion of the district court is that See. 6861 is only for the jeopardy assessment of a deficiency as defined in Sec. 6211. That section reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-10\">\u00a7 6211. Definition of a deficiency, (a) In general.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-11\">For purposes of this title in the case of income, estate gift, and excise taxes, imposed by subtitles A and B, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>and chapter 42, the term \u201cdeficiency\u201d means the amount by which the tax imposed by subtitle A or B or chapter 42 exceeds the excess of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-5\">(1) the sum of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-6\">(A) the amount shown as the tax by the taxpayer upon his return, if a return was made by the taxpayer and an amount was shown as the tax by the taxpayer thereon, plus</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-7\">(B) the amounts previously assessed (or collected without assessment) as a deficiency, over\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-8\">(2) the amount of rebates, as defined in subsection (b)(2), made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1127-9\">Therefore, the Service concludes that a deficiency can only exist after a taxpayer files a return showing a lesser amount of tax than is due or until the time for filing a return is past, and the taxpayer has not complied. On the other hand, Sec. 6851 says nothing about a deficiency, but merely that a taxable year may be terminated early whenever collection of the tax would be prejudiced or rendered ineffectual. By definition, the government argues, termination under Sec. 6851 cannot result in a deficiency because the taxable year is not at an end, and a return has not been filed. Instead of a deficiency, a Sec. 6851 termination results in a \u201cprovisional statement of the amount which must be presently paid as a protection against the impossibility of collection.\u201d Ludwig Littauer &amp; Co. v. Commissioner, 37 B.T. A. 840, 842 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-10\">Support of the position of the Internal Revenue Service comes also from a decision of the Tax Court and two recent Circuit Court decisions. In Puritan Church \u2014 Church of America v. Commissioner, 10 TCM 485 (1951), aff\u2019d per curiam on other grounds, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 129, 209 F.2d 306 (1953), cert. denied 347 U.S. 975, 74 S.Ct. 787, 98 L.Ed. 1115 (1953), the Tax Court implied that no deficiency notice was required when a tax year was terminated under the predecessor of Sec. 6851. Interestingly, the court seemed to believe that the assessment authority came from Sec. 6851 itself \u2014 a position which the I.R.S. now concedes is incorrect. Similarly, in Williamson v. United States, 31 A.F.T.R.2d 800 (7th Cir. 1973), the court held that no deficiency notice need be sent under Sec. 6851. The court appeared erroneously to have relied on Sec. 6851 for the assessment authority. The tax due after the taxable year was terminated, pursuant to the statute, was characterized as follows;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-12\">We believe, however, that the deficiency notice requirement cannot be read into \u00a7 6851 because the assessment made under that section is not a deficiency as defined in \u00a7 6211. That section defines a deficiency as the amount by which the \u201ctax imposed\u201d exceeds the amount shown on the tax return. The assessment in this case was not an imposed tax, but merely an amount which the I.R.S. believed justified the termination of the taxable year. Since no return had been filed at the date of the assessment, no deficiency was determinable. Ludwig Littauer &amp; Co., Inc. v. Com\u2019r of Int. Rev., 37 B.T.A. 840, 843 (1938).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1127-13\">Relying on this language, the Second Circuit also held that a deficiency was not created by the termination of the taxable year under Sec. 6851. Irving v. Gray, 479 F.2d 20 (2nd Cir. 1973). However, apparently accepting the new position of the I.R.S., the court found that authority for short year assessments came under Sec. 6201, not Sec. 6861.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-14\">In the current case the district court recognized these decisions but was persuaded by the reasoning of those courts which have found that the only assessment authority for Sec. 6851 is under Sec. 6861. It therefore was held that a deficiency notice was necessary as Sec. 6861 clearly mandates. Schreck v. United States, 301 F.Supp. 1265 (D.Md. 1969); Clark v. Campbell, 341 F.Supp. 171 (N.D.Tex.1972); Lisner v. McCanless, 356 F.Supp. 398 (D.Ariz.1973). We find this reasoning to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-16\">In order to approve this result it is critical to find that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>was correct in concluding that the short year tax declared under Sec. 6851 was a \u201cdeficiency\u201d within the meaning of 6211 and 6861. Under Sec. 6211(a), as we .have seen, a \u201cdeficiency\u201d is the amount by which the tax imposed exceeds the amount shown as the tax by the taxpayer on his return. Sec. 443(a)(3) of the 1954 code requires a return to be filed when the secretary terminates the taxable year under Sec. 6851. No such return was filed by the taxpayer in this case. And by its own regulations the Service has provided in case of a terminated year that if no return is filed or if a return is filed which lists no tax, \u201cthe deficiency is the amount of the tax imposed by subtitle A, chapter 11, or chapter 12.\u201d Revenue Regulations Sec. 301.6211-1 (a). The letter which Rambo received from the District Director of the Internal Revenue Service stated: \u201cI declare the taxable period 1-1-72 thru 4-24-72 immediately terminated and the income tax for such period immediately due and payable.\u201d The letter went on to state that any part of the $28,446.88 which was unpaid would be immediately assessed against Rambo, as it in fact was. Clearly, the I.R.S. has imposed a tax and just as clearly the taxpayer has denied that he owes that amount by refusing either to pay the imposed tax or to file a return. Consequently, the tax imposed, $28,446.88, became the deficiency. <em>See </em>Schreck v. United States, <em>supra. </em>The statute itself in no way limits the definition of a deficiency to a determination made only at the end of the taxable year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">Sections 6851 and 6861 both appear in Chapter 70, Subchapter A of the Internal Revenue Code under the heading \u201cJeopardy.\u201d Since Sec. 6851 does not authorize assessment for the tax which is found due for the terminated year, it is reasonable that Congress intended that the next succeeding section in the code (Sec. 6861), entitled \u201cJeopardy Assessments,\u201d should provide that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-5\">This reading of the code is further supported by its legislative history. Section 250(g) of the Revenue Act of 1918, the forerunner of \u00a7 6851, authorized the I.R.S. to terminate the taxpayer\u2019s taxable year; determine the taxes owed and declare them due and payable. Assessment authority for all taxes, with or without jeopardy, was contained in \u00a7 1317. Moreover, all taxpayers were required first to pay a disputed tax and later bring an action for a refund. In succeeding revenue acts \u2014 first in 1924, then in 1926 \u2014 the Congress sought to mitigate the harshness of the rule which required the taxpayer to pay the tax before he could have a hearing. See H.R. Rep.No.179, 68th Cong., 1st Sess. 7 (1924). Consequently, Congress established the Board of Tax Appeals, later the Tax Court, as a non-prepayment forum. Under the 1926 Revenue Act, the I.R.S. was given the authority to make jeopardy assessments; but it was required to give notice of the deficiency within 60 days after the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-7\">We interpret this development of the tax law as a movement away from the harsh, and often unjust, effects of a code which required the taxpayer to pay his tax before he could have a judicial hearing on the amount properly due. The nonjeopardy taxpayer was protected from assessment while his case was pending in the tax court. The jeopardy taxpayer, although his tax could be assessed, was guaranteed certain procedural safeguards \u2014 for example, as a general rule his property could not be sold during the pendency of the proceeding before the tax court. It is inconceivable to us that Congress could have intended to have given this minimal procedural protection to jeopardy taxpayers against whom a deficiency is assessed at the end of the taxable year but not to taxpayers whose year is terminated under Sec. 6851. Instead, we find that the procedural requirements of Secs. 6861 and 6863 are meant for \u201cjeopardy assessments,\u201d including those made following termination of the tax year under Sec. 6851.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-8\">Were the code to be interpreted as the I.R.S. suggests, significant constitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>al problems would arise. A system that permits the government to seize and sell property without affording the taxpayer any opportunity for a judicial determination of the validity of the tax prior to payment could very well raise a serious question of a denial to the taxpayer of his property without due process of law. <em>Cf. </em>Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 1999, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972), and Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., 395 U.S. 337, 89 S.Ct. 1820, 23 L.Ed.2d 349 (1969). Interestingly, in <em>Fuentes </em>the Court recognized that there are \u201c \u2018extraordinary situations\u2019 that justify postponing notice and opportunity for a hearing.\u201d 407 U.S. at 90, 92 S.Ct. at 1999. These situations all involve \u201c[an] important governmental or general public interest\u201d coupled with a \u201cspecial need for very prompt action.\u201d Id. at 92, 92 S.Ct. at 2000. In support the Court cited Phillips v. Commissioner, 283 U.S. 589, 51 S.Ct. 608, 75 L.Ed. 1289 (1931), a case in which the taxpayer challenged the collection of a deficiency that had been made under Sec. 280(a)(1) of the Revenue Code of 1926. The taxpayer argued that due process was violated because the taxes would be collected before he could have the proper amount determined by a federal district court. Justice Brand\u00e9is, speaking for the Court, disagreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-4\">The procedure provided in Section 280(a)(1) satisfies the requirements of due process because two alternate methods of eventual judicial review are available to the transferee. He may contest his liability by bringing an action, either against the United States or the collector, to recover the amount paid. ... Or the transferee may avail himself of the provisions for immediate redetermination of the liability by the Board of Tax Appeals. . . . 283 U.S. at 597-598, 51 S.Ct. at 612.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">Since we conclude that the taxpayer has been denied the procedural safeguards set forth herein, including access to the tax court for redetermination of the tax imposed, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-9\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-10\">Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C.):</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-11\">SEC. 6201.
