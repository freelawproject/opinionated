Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b854-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b854-22\">Barnett appeals his conviction entered upon a jury verdict of assaulting a federal officer in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 111. He complains that the district court refused to instruct the jury that the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the federal official\u2019s capacity is an essential element of the offense; that the court erred in refusing to instruct that the use of reasonable force in the protection of defendant\u2019s property from trespassers is a valid defense; and that the Government\u2019s evidence that Barnett had not filed tax returns for 1972 and prior years was irrelevant, immaterial and prejudicial. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-23\">Hutchinson, an Internal Revenue officer, went to Barnett\u2019s residence to interview him in connection with a levy which had been made on a Mr. Sikes\u2019 pay. It was thought by Hutchinson that Sikes might be working for Barnett. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Hutchinson introduced himself to Barnett, who was standing in the front yard of his home, and while opening his file, Hutchinson mentioned the name of Larry Sikes. Barnett exploded violently, using profanity, and knocked Hutchinson to the ground. Nine stitches were required to close Hutchinson\u2019s wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Barnett\u2019s argument that 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 111 requires <em>scienter </em>with respect to the federal officer\u2019s capacity to sustain a conviction gives us little pause under the circumstances of this case. We have consistently held to the contrary, beginning with Bennett v. United States, 5 Cir. 1960, 285 F.2d 567, cert. denied, 1961, 366 U.S. 911, 81 S.Ct. 1087, 6 L.Ed.2d 236. <em>See also, </em>United States v. Williamson, 5 Cir. 1973, 482 F.2d 508; United States v. Marcello, 5 Cir. 1970, 423 F.2d 993, cert. denied, 398 U.S. 959, 90 S.Ct. 2172, 26 L.Ed.2d 543; United States v. Davis, 5 Cir. 1970, 423 F.2d 974, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 836, 91 S.Ct. 74, 27 L.Ed.2d 69; Pipes v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 399 F.2d 471; <em>cf. </em>United States v. Young, 5 Cir. 1972, 464 F.2d 160, and Burke v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 400 F.2d 866, cert. denied, 1969, 395 U.S. 919, 89 S.Ct. 1771, 23 L.Ed.2d 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\"> Equally without merit is Barnett\u2019s contention that Hutchinson was a trespasser and that the force used to expel him was reasonable and thus not actionable. It is undisputed that Hutchinson entered the grounds in the line of duty to ask a few simple, official questions and that at all times he was immediately off the shoulder of the road and at a considerable distance from Barnett\u2019s house. Giving credence to Barnett\u2019s testimony that he asked Hutchinson to leave him alone, the bloody assault took place so quickly that Hutchinson was precluded from leaving immediately. In any event it was not error to refuse to give the requested trespass-reasonable force instruction since the \u201cengaged in the performance of [his] official duties\u201d instruction was given. <em>Davis, supra, </em>423 F.2d at 975; United States v. Pledger, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 1335; Foster v. United States, 5 Cir. 1961, 296 F.2d 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Finally, even if the question asked Barnett about his failure <em>vel non </em>to file tax returns was immaterial, the error was harmless. There is no fact-sufficiency contention on this appeal, and \u201c[t]he evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt is strong, clear and convincing beyond question.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Resnick, 5 Cir. 1974, 488 F.2d 1165.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
