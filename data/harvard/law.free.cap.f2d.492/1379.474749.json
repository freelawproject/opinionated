Tankersley, a bankrupt. The district court determined that the bankrupt\u2019s transfer of funds made within four months of a creditors\u2019 petition seeking to have Daniel Tankersley adjudicated a bankrupt was a preferential transfer and thus fell within the proscriptions of Section 60 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 96 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-12\">The evidence fully supports the lower court\u2019s resolution of the facts. The record demonstrates that within four months of the creditor\u2019s petition, the bankrupt permitted his property to be transferred to Credit Executives Sex-vice Cox-poration, a liquidator of insolvent estates. Under this liquidation, approximately one-half of the bankrupt\u2019s liquidated assets were received by appellant, an unsecured creditor. Both appellant and the bankrupt knew that liquidation would result in this transfer to appellant to the detriment of the bankrupt\u2019s other creditors. All the requirements of Section 60 have been established and a x-eci-tation of the facts here would serve no legitimate purpose. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
