Upon these facts, he moved at the special term for an injunction restraining the farther prosecution of the defendant\u2019s claim in the marine court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b744-11\"><em>Ashael S. </em>Levy, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b744-12\"><em>A.

If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>there are prior liens sufficient to absorb the funds remaining in the hands of the owner, it is a good defence to that suit. It was a defence under the former lien law, and must equally be a defence under the present act. If the existence of prior liens is set up as a bar to an action brought for the enforcement of a subsequent lien, the claimant in that action may deny their validity, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and if he succeeds in impeaching them, take judgment for the amount of his lien, if there is a sufficient fund in the owner\u2019s hands, or, if not, a judgment to the extent of that fund. In certain cases, it may be necessary to institute a suit in this court in the nature of a bill of inter-pleader to adjust the rights of the respective claimants; but such is not the nature of the present suit. It is brought for the purpose of obtaining an injunction to restrain the further prosecution of the suit below; and as the facts set up in the complaint are available as a defence in that suit, the application for the injunction must be denied, and the present action dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
