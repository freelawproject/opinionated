The notice, filed under the sixth section, claimed $139 89, with interest. The usual proceedings were taken to join issue ; a complaint and answer were served; but the latter was returned by the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, for the want of a verification, and judgment was entered for the amount alleged to be due in the complaint, which exceeded by some twenty dollars the claim stated in the notice filed to create the lien.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b751-14\">The defendant then obtained an order to show cause why the judgment should not be set aside.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b751-15\"><em>William Wordsworth, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number><em>William M. </em>Allen, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b752-5\">By the Court. Ingraham, First J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANf0\">It is not necessary to decide whether the plaintiffs\u2019 proceedings have been regular, because the defendant does not, in his order to show cause, specify any grounds of irregularity as required by the 25th rule of the supreme court.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The plaintiffs have taken judgment for more than is due them in this action. Where the proceeding is under the lien law, the plaintiffs can recover no more than they claimed when they filed the paper to create the lien. The subsequent notice is to enforce the lien so created. By the notice filed, the amount claimed was $139 89, and this, with interest, was the extent which the plaintiffs could recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">If the plaintiffs give notice in five days that they remit the amount of the judgment above $139 89, and interest, then this motion is denied, without costs, and without prejudice to a renewal of it, upon the merits, on such further affidavits as the defendant may think fit, showing a defence to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. If the plaintiffs do not remit, the judgment is set aside with costs, $10, to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
