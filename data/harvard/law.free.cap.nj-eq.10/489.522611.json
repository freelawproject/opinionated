And since the decease of the said George \"Woodruff, your orators and their brothers, herein before named, have, by themselves and their agents, frequently apjfiied to the said the Trenton Water Power Company, and have pointed out the place at which they wished the bridge from said farm across said main raceway to be erected, to wit, at the place opposite to the end of the lane running from the feeder of the Delaware and Raritan canal to the main raceway aforesaid, and have requested said company to perform said covenants and to erect and maintain said bridge, landing place, and fences, and also to pay them a compensation or damages for the injury sustained from the failure of said company to erect and maintain the same, as by said covenants they were bound to do; and the said company frequently promised them that they would do so, or if it would be equally satisfactory, that the company would pay your orators and their co-devisees aforesaid a sum of money in lieu of the performance of said covenants; but the said company have always failed to keep said promises, and have never erected any bridge, landing place, or fences upon said premises, nor in any manner performed the said covenants, or any part thereof; that from the time of the making of said main raceway until the present time, there has been no bridge or fences across said main raceway upon said farm erected or maintained by the said company, either under its former or its present name, and the said George Woodruff and* your orators, and all persons holding and using said farm under him or them, have in various ways suffered, and your orators do still suffer, much inconvenience and loss for the want of the same; that for the want of such bridge and landing place, they have not been able to cross said main raceway from said farm to said river with their cattle, horses, and wagons, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>they otherwise might have done, and which would have \"been of material service to them;

that the said company, having been frequently applied to, as aforesaid, to keep and perform the said covenants, and having promised to do so, but without in any manner keeping such promise, your orators, together with their brothers before named, who had not then parted with their interest in said farm, did, on or about the fifth day of December, in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and fifty-one, cause a notice and requirement in writing to be served upon the president of the said the Trenton Water Power Company, pointing out the place where they wished the said bridge to be built across said main raceway upon said farm, being the same place herein before in that respect mentioned, and calling upon said company to keep and perform the covenants in said deed contained, and to erect and maintain said bridge, landing place, and fences, and to pay unto them damages or compensation for the said company\u2019s past neglect to perform said covenants, and the said company thereupon 'promised to do so, but have wholly failed and neglected to do it; that the full and faithful performance of said covenants by said company, according to the true intent and meaning thereof, would afford your orators a direct access to said river with their cattle, horses, and wagons, and would give them many advantages in the use and enjoyment of their said farm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>of which, they are now deprived, and would save them from much annoyance and loss, which they have long suffered for the want thereof, and would also increase the market value of their farm, in case they wished to sell the same;

And also, that the said party of the second part shall erect, maintain, and keep in good repair a safe, convenient, and substantial bridge across said main raceway, at a place to be designated by the said George Woodruff; and also cause to he made and kept in order a convenient landing place on the side next the river Delaware, so that wagons may at all times safely pass over thereon, and shall also erect and maintain all necessary fences across the said main raceway, together with fences across the said premises, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>and shall also permit the said party of the first part to use the said raceway to give drink to his cattle, and also to take ice therefrom to fill his ice-house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The bill alleges that the grantees cut the main raceway, and that it has been, and is now used as such, and that it came into the possession of the defendants, as assignees of the grantees, by virtue of several acts of the legislature of the state; that by reason of the contracts and covenants contained in the deed aforesaid, the grantees therein named were bound to erect, maintain, and keep in good repair a safe, convenient, and substantial bridge across said main raceway, and a landing place, and to erect and maintain the fences, and that the defendants, as holding under them, are bound to perform their covenants and agreements; that although frequently applied to by the said Woodruff, in his lifetime, and by these complainants since his decease, both the said grantees and these defendants have always refused to perform their said covenants and agreements. The bill prays for a specific performance, and also compensation for the injury sustained by reason of the failure to perform and keep the covenants in time past.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The defendants answered the bill, and some evidence has been taken on both sides; but the case, as I have stated it from the bill, presents the points upon which I shall decide the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">If the matters mentioned in the proviso of the deed could be legally regarded as covenants, and as such be enforced at law, I should have no difficulty in declaring them to be covenants relating to the <em>realty </em>and running with the land, and that both the liability to perform them and the right to take advantage of them, passed to the <em>assignee </em>of the land and of the reversion. It appears to me that such a construction would not conflict with the principles established. I use the word <em>established </em>because those principles have ruled and regulated all subsequent authorities <em>in Spencer\u2019s </em>case. 5 <em>Coke\u2019s Rep. </em>17.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>It is argued that the word assigns, being omitted in reference to the things to be performed by the grantees, and the things to be done not being in <em>esse </em>and parcel of the premises, the defendants, as the <em>assignees </em>of the Trenton Delaware Palls Company, are not bound; that it is directly within <em>Spencer\u2019s case, </em>and of the first resolution, as there laid down.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">And it also insisted that, by the principle laid down in the <em>second resolution </em>in <em>Spencer\u2019s </em>case, the defendants are not bound, because the thing to be done is collateral to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">It was resolved <em>(by the second, resolution), </em>that in this case <em>(Spencer\u2019s case) </em>if the lessee had covenanted for him and his assigns that they would make a new wall upon some part of the thing demised, that forasmuch as it is to be done upon the land demised that it should bind the assignee ; for although the covenant doth extend to a thing to be newly made, yet it is to be made upon the thing demised, and the assignee is to take the benefit of it, and therefore shall bind the assignee by express words. But although the covenant be for him and his assigns, yet if the thing to be done be merely collateral to the land, and doth not touch or concern the thing demised in any sort, there the assignee shall not be charged. As if the lessee covenants for him and his assigns to build a house upon the land of the lessor which is no parcel of the demise, or to pay any collateral sum to the lessor or to a stranger, it shall not bind the assignee, because it is merely collateral, and in no manner touches or concerns the thing that was demised or that is assigned over; and therefore in such case the <em>assignee </em>of the thing demised cannot be charged with it no more than any other stranger.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">In the present case there was nothing to be done <em>collateral </em>to the land conveyed. The grantor reserved to himself a right of way on the main raceway, and also a convenient landing place at the river. This right of way, as well as landing place, was an interest in the thing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>granted, and would pass as <em>appurtenant </em>to the grantor\u2019s farm. The thing to be done upon the land was the <em>medium </em>which created the privity of estate between the grantor and the grantee. It was an incident to the land conveyed, enuring to the benefit of the grantor as the owner in fee of the adjacent soil. It is not like a mere personal covenant which does not affect or concern the premises conveyed, as to build a house or a wall upon the land of the grantor, which is not parcel of the thing granted, or merely to pay a sum of money to the grantor or to a stranger.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">In <em>Bally </em>v. <em>Wells (Wilmot\u2019s </em>opinion, 341, 3 <em>Wils. </em>25,) Lord Chief Justice Wilmot says, \u201c the reason why the assignees, though named, are not bound, is because the thing covenanted to be done has not <em>the least reference </em>to the thing demised. It is a substantive independent agreement, not <em>quod,am modo </em>but <em>nullo </em>modo, annexed or appurtenant to the thing leased.\u201d But although this is a covenant running with the land, yet, according to the first resolution in <em>Spencer's </em>case, it does not bind the assignee not expressly named, if the covenant does not extend to a thing in <em>esse </em>at the time of the covenant. The principle is well settled; the only question is as to its application. It does not extend to <em>repairs. </em>In <em>Cockson </em>v. <em>Cook </em>(Cro. <em>Jac. </em>125), it was decided that covenant lies against the assignee on a covenant not to plough, although assignees are not named in the deed, for it runs with the land, but not on a collateral act, as to build <em>de novo. </em>And in the <em>Dean and Chapter of Windsor\u2019s case </em>(5 <em>R. </em>24), it was resolved that the assignee is bound to repair, though not mentioned in the lease. To apply the principle properly,' it is necessary that we should look at the character of the thing covenanted to be done; its connection with the land; the mode of its enjoyment; and for whose benefit it is intended. At the time of the conveyance of this land, it constituted the grantor\u2019s mode of access to the river, .and also a landing place, both of which conveni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>enees were necessary to the grantor\u2019s beneficial enjoyment of his property. That way and landing place were to be kept good by the grantees. (I am assuming that the stipulation named in the <em>proviso </em>constituted covenants on the part of the grantee.) By digging the raceway, the grantees destroyed the grantor\u2019s access to the river. The reconstruction of the way and landing place was not like doing a thing <em>de </em>novo, but a <em>reparation </em>of that which had been destroyed. The particular manner in which the way was to be reconstructed does not alter its legal character in this respect. A. covenants in a lease to repair; the building is destroyed by fire; the covenant can be fulfilled only by erecting a new building. Suppose there had been a covenant in this deed by which the grantor was always to have access to the river by a right of 'way over the land in as convenient a manner as it existed at the time of the grant, there cannot be a doubt but that the assignee of the grantor would have been entitled to the benefit of the covenant, although not named in it. Is the covenant impaired or limited in' its extent because it specified that this right of way shall be in the shape of a <em>bridge </em>to be erected by the covenantor ?</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">But it is unnecessary to pursue this investigation any further. There is another point in the ease of less difficulty, which, I think, must determine the rights of the parties in this court. There are no covenants contained in this deed on the part of the grantees. They did not sign the deed. It is true this is not necessary always. The acceptance of the conveyance and the land granted will in some cases bind the grantees to the performance of the covenants; but it cannot bind them to covenants which do not exist. I have already recited all that part of the deed in wdiich it is <em>said </em>the covenant exists. There is a <em>proviso </em>by which it is declared, that unless the grantees perform certain things specifically stipulated, the said lands and premises shall revert to the said Q-eorge \"W\"oodrufi\u2018. A <em>condition </em>is quite distinct from a <em>covenant. </em>The language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>in this deed is appropriate to create a condition, and, as if to avoid any doubt, the legal consequences of a breach or violation of the condition is inserted. Upon covenants, the legal responsibility of their nonfulfilment is, that the party violating them must respond in damages. The consequence of the nonfulfilment of a condition is a forfeiture of the estate. The grantor may re-enter at his will, and possess himself of his former estate. The grantees were to make the raceway in conformity to their act of incorporation; they were to erect, maintain, and keep in good repair a safe and substantial bridge over the raceway; they were to make a landing place on the river Delaware, and to make and maintain the fences. But they entered into no covenants to do these things. They were to enjoy the land, provided they did perform these stipulations; and they accepted the deed, and entered upon the land upon the condition, that if they did not perform them, they should forfeit all the benefits of the grant. Unless these are conditions, then there exists no distinction between a condition and a covenant. <em>Nicoll </em>v. <em>The New York and Erie Railroad Co., </em>12 <em>Barb. S. C. Rep. </em>460; <em>Coke upon Litt., by Thomas, 4; Com. Dig., Condition 1, A. 2; Co. Litt. </em>216 <em>C.; Hamilton </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>5 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>375; <em>Platt on Cov. </em>36, 37; <em>Bouv. Law Dict., title Proviso.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">It appears to me there can be no question as to the proper legal construction of the deed. The only question then is, can this court enforce the specific performance in a deed, the nonperformance of which works a forfeiture of the estate ? This was not contended on the argument. I cannot see upon what principle the court can exercise this branch of its jurisdiction in such a case. The grantor has fixed his own remedy, and can forfeit the estate at his pleasure. There is no agreement upon which the party can maintain a suit at law for damages. I admit that this is not a criterion universally applicable. But it is one test. It has many exceptions, but this is not one of them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>If any authority can be furnished by counsel, I am willing to hear the counsel further upon the point. My impression is none can be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">In the case of <em>Stuyvesant </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c., of New York, </em>11 <em>Paige </em>414, there was a condition in the grant upon which the title of the corporation to the land depended ; but there was other and additional language in the deed, which the Chancellor said amounted to a covenant on the part of the corporation to perform such condition. The deed, too, was executed by the defendants under their corporate seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The defendant further insisted, that this was not such a case as to justify the court in the exercise of its peculiar jurisdiction of decreeing a specific performance. The great delay in applying to this court for relief; the fact, that George \"Woodruff never pointed out the place, as the deed provided, where the bridge and landing place should be made; the change of the original parties to the contract; the death of the original grantor, and the transmission of the property by the authority of the legislature to others than the original grantees; the character by which the complainants now hold, some by purchase and others by descent, these constitute serious objections to the action of this court. But I am satisfied to decide the cause upon the other ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The appeal was argued November term, 1855, and decided March term, 1856.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The decision of the Chancellor was affirmed by the following vote:</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\"><em>For </em>affirmance\u2014Chibe Justice, Judges Arrowsmith, Elmer, Haines, Ogden, Bisley, Valentine, Cornelison, Huyler, Potts, Byerson, Vredenburgh, Wills.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\"><em>For </em>reversal\u2014None.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
