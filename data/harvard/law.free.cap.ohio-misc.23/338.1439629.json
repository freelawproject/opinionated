Defendants are the Commissioners, the Auditor, and the Treasurer of Paulding County, Ohio. All defendants have waived service of summons and entered their appearance. All parties stipulate that there is no issue as to the facts stated in the petition, that it is a real concern of the plaintiffs to provide hospital professional liability insurance protection for their employees as they have done pursuant to their interpretation of R. C. 339.06, and that all parties are agreed the court shall hear the matter upon the merits and render a declaratory judgment on the petition, including a writ of mandamus against the commissioners if that appears lawful and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Plaintiffs, acting under their understanding of E. C. 339.06, in 1967 designated for purchase and referred to the Board of County Commissioners for payment a certain insurance policy issued by The Buckeye Union Insurance Company, No. CL A 1988 55, a renewal of No. CL 28903, policy period June 2,1967 to 1970, and known as a hospital professional liability policy. The limits of liability are $50,000 for each personal injury claim and an aggregate of $150,000 and as to property damage $5,000 and $25,000, respectively, and the premiums therefor have been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Plaintiffs have requested that the commissioners pay the premium for a renewal of the policy but the commissioners refuse to do so, saying they have not the authority to pay therefor. The auditor and treasurer need to know what is lawful in the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The policy in question, a copy of which is Exhibit A to the petition, contains two lines reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">\u201cIf this policy is written for a period of three years the net premium for three years shall be $4,732.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">\u201cPayable: In Advance $1,628.00 1st Anniversary $1,552.00 2d Anniversary $1,552.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Certain other provisions of the policy read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\"><em>\u201cItem 1.

Does any member of the Board of County Commissioners have any reason for disapproving payment of the present premium now due on the policy of which Exhibit \u201cA\u201d to the petition is a copy, other than doubt of legality created by the report of the State Examiner?</p>\n<p id=\"b354-17\">Answer: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-18\">7. If answer to Number 6 is \u201cyes,\u201d explain fully.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>II. The Hospital Trustees</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">1.

If no, explain fully.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-19\">7. What, in the opinion of the present members of the Board of Hospital Trustees, has heretofore been the chief reason or reasons why this insurance evidenced by the policy of which Exhibit \u201cA\u201d is a copy has been provided?</p>\n<p id=\"b355-20\">Answer: For employee protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-21\">8. Do the members of the Board of Hospital Trustees desire that this protection continue to be provided?</p>\n<p id=\"b355-22\">Answer: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-23\">9. What do you consider important reasons for main-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>taming the present hospital professional liability insurance program in the future?</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Answer: This insurance protection is very necessary for peace of mind of the employees and the general well being of the patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">III. E. E. Gorman Insurance Agency, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">1. What is your name and official position with the E. E. Gorman Insurance Agency?</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Answer: E. E. Gorman, President of E. E. Gorman Insurance Agency, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">2. Did your company write Buckeye Union Insurance Company policy No. CL A 19 88 55 providing comprehensive General Liability Insurance and Hospital Professional Liability Insurance for the period of June 2, 1967, to June 2, 1970, for the trustees of Paulding County Hospital and the commissioners of Paulding County, Ohio, as respects their liability arising from operations of trustees of Paulding County Hospital?</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Answer: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">3. How did this policy come to be issued?</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">Answer: As a renewal to Pol. No. CL 29803.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">4. How long has the Paulding County Hospital provided this kind of insurance coverage?</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">Answer: My office records show this coverage since 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">5. During this period have any claims been asserted under this coverage?</p>\n<p id=\"b356-15\">Answer: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-16\">6. If any, how many?</p>\n<p id=\"b356-17\">Answer: Eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-18\">7.

As to acts of the individual members of the Board of County Commissioners, the Board of Hospital Trustees, and the Administrator of the Paulding County Hospital, done in their official capacity in connection with the hospital, which might result in injury to others, is it your understanding that your company, The Buckeye Union Insurance Company, to the extent of the limits of liability set out in the policy of which Exhibit \u201cA\u201d to the petition is a copy, waives any defense which might be asserted in their behalf as representatives of the state of Ohio?</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">Answer: The policy has not been endorsed so as to waive defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">13. Is liability insurance in respect to their work commonly and easily available to all hospital employees?</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">Answer: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">14. During all years known to you in which the current and prior policies have been in force, do you know of any complaint by anyone, that the coverage was unnecessary, unlawful, or not desired by the hospital trustees, employees and patients?</p>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">Answer: Yes, in January 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-15\">15. What is your understanding of the chief reason or reasons the Board of Hospital Trustees have purchased the policy designated Exhibit \u201cA\u201d in these proceedings?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Answer: The Board of Trustees wanted protection from liability for themselves, their employees and hospital patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">IV. Richard W. Crowell, Administrator of the Paulding County Hospital</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">1. How long have you been Administrator of Pauld-ing County Hospital?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Answer: 8% years.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">2. When you became administrator was there in force a hospital professional liability insurance policy similar to the one of which, Exhibit \u201cA\u201d to the petition is a copy?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Answer: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">3. When did you first learn of this insurance program?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">Answer: When I started employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">4. Do you know for how long a similar insurance program has been provided in respect to Paulding County Hospital?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">Answer: I have been told it was in effect in the 1940\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">5. If answer to number 4 is yes, state period of time?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">Answer: 25 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">6.

In your judgment as administrator of the hospital for the members of the Board of Hospital Trustees, who are charged with the management of the hospital, are there good reasons this insurance has been provided in the past and should be provided in the future?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-18\">Answer: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-19\">8. If your answer to Number 7 is yes, explain fully.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-20\">Answer: I have been told by the laboratory technicians if without this protection they would resign. It is my understanding that under present Ohio law there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>a number of acts which hospital employees might do in performance of their duties in which they would be held liable and the hospital would be immune from suit. If this is so this protection is necessary for the peace of mind of our employees and also the patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">9. During the calendar year 1969 how many full time employees did the Paulding County Hospital have in the following categories: (1) interns and residents; (2) registered nurses; (3) licensed practical nurses; (4) nurses aides; (5) hospital orderlies; (6) laboratory technicians;</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">(7) dieticians, cooks and other kitchen help; (8) business office personnel; (9) maintenance and custodial employees; (10) other employees not fitting any classification listed above?</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Answer: (1) none</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">(2) 33</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">(3) 40</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">(4) 20</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">(5) 1</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">(6) 3</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">(7) 18</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">(8) 5</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">(9) 6</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">(10) 6</p>\n<p id=\"b359-16\">10. During the calendar year 1969 how many different individuals were called upon for part time work of any kind, who were paid for such work as they performed?</p>\n<p id=\"b359-17\">Answer: 19</p>\n<p id=\"b359-18\">11. During the calendar year 1969 how many persons performed volunteer service for the hospital, on the hospital premises?</p>\n<p id=\"b359-19\">Answer: 25</p>\n<p id=\"b359-20\">A state examiner for the Bureau of Inspection and Supervision of Public Offices, upon completion of his 1968 audit of the hospital records, made a finding that the payment of mentioned premium was an illegal expenditure, resulting in the filing of the petition herein on December 2, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Consequently, the question for decision is: \u201cMay the board of hospital trustees for a county hospital designate for purchase a hospital professional liability insurance policy and require the county commissioners to pay therefor?\u201d The court answers this question, \u201cYes,\u201d for reasons hereinafter set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">There can be no doubt that Ohio counties and county agencies have, since 1857,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> enjoyed as integral parts of the sovereign state of Ohio, immunity from suit in court in actions for damages generally.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As stated in the syllabus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>to <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Franklin County Veterans Memorial </em>(1960), 171 Ohio St. 228; which reversed the Court of Appeals decision (1959) reported in 82 Ohio Law Abs. 571, the general Ohio rule is, \u201cIn the absence of statutory authorization therefor, a county or its agencies are immune from suit for negligence. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">In 1963 the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County held specifically in the syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u201cA board of county hospital trustees appointed under Section 339.02, Revised Code, is not liable in its quasi corporate capacity, nor are the trustees individually liable when no malice or corruption is imputed, by statute or at common law, in an action for damages for injury resulting to a hospital patient by negligence in the discharge of its or their official functions; nor are either vicariously liable for the negligence of their servants or employees.\u201d <em>Wierszbicki, Exrx., </em>v. <em>Carmichael, </em>118 Ohio App. 239, 91 Ohio Law Abs. 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">This <em>Wierzbicki case, </em>however, did not disclose that the hospital had any liability insurance, nor did it indicate that it had any obligation to provide any under Ohio law. This case requires me to determine whether or not our statutes authorize boards of county hospital trustees to purchase a policy of hospital professional liability insurance for the benefit of all hospital employees and hospital patients, in such amount as the board members deem reasonable and proper, and thereby waive sovereign immunity as a defense to actions for damages within the limits of the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>tection provided by such policy. An examination of our statutes will show that they do.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">R. C. 339.06, as now in effect and as it has been since November 21, 1967, entitled, \u201cOperation of hospital by trustees; administrator,\u201d in pertinent part, now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\"># *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">\u201cThe board of county hospital trustees shall have the entire management and control of the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number><em>ti* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-4\">\u201cThe board * * * has control of * # * all funds used in its operation.

L.) 486; 108 O. L., Part 1, 255; 118 O. L. 430; 124 O. L. 705; 125 O. L. 301; 126 O. L. 68; 128 O. L. 737; 132 O. L. S219; 132 O. L. S321. This legislation has invariably provided that county boards of hospital trustees shall have the \u201centire management and control of said hospital,\u201d as does R. C. 339.06, presently in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">A search of Words and Phrases reveals no judicial definition for the words \u201centire management\u201d in respect to any enterprise, public or private. Consequently, I must interpret them in their commonly understood meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Turning to The Reader\u2019s Digest Great Encyclopedia Dictionary, 3d Ed., 1969, I find after \u201centire\u201d the meanings: \u201cHaving no part missing; whole, complete,\u201d and \u201cNot lessened nor impaired; full; total,\u201d among the several listed for the adjective, reflecting the sense of the word as used in the statute, and as long understood in the English language. After the noun, management, the same source lists these four meanings: \u201c1. The act, art, or practice of managing; administration. 2. The person or persons who manage a business, institution, etc.; the administration. 3. Managers collectively, especially in their relations with labor unions. 4. The skillful use of means; ingenuity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The present Paulding County Hospital building was newly erected in 1961 and opened its doors in February 1962. It was added to in 1968 and is now a small, sixty-five bed, modern hospital, so exceptionally well equipped that leading surgeons from sizable cities commonly visit it to practice their vocation. It receives the proceeds of a special tax levy voted by the people of this county and is a recipient of substantial donations derived from the continuous efforts of an effective local benevolent society. It is certainly an institution in which nearly every resident of this county takes considerable pride and will do much to defend, support and uphold.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>In 1951, the OMo Legislature introduced a new paragraph into Section 3137, General Code (the substance of which is retained in it. C. 339.06, see <em>supra) </em>reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqd-dedup-0\">\u201cThe trustees shall have the privilege of designating the amounts and forms of insurance to be provided, and it shall be incumbent upon the county commissioners to secure such protection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">The present language in E. C. 339.06 was first adopted, effective October 13, 1953. It is noted that the present statute states that the \u201cboard * * * may designate\u201d when the 1951 act said the \u201ctrustees shall have the privilege of designating,\u201d so that the act has always been permissive, and in light of the exercise of the board\u2019s \u201centire management\u201d of the hospital, I am unable to understand how permission could be more clearly granted or authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The present statute reads \u201cinsurance protection\u201d when the 1951 act said only \u201cinsurance.\u201d If there is any difference in meaning it seems certain that the present words \u201cinsurance protection\u201d are naturally broader and more inclusive than the word \u201cinsurance,\u201d standing alone. Still \u201cThe World Book Encyclopedia,\u201d 1957 edition, commonly used in our schools, says of Insurance: \u201cInsurance is a means of protection against money loss from many kinds of hazards,\u201d and in discussion lists these types of insurance, all of which must have been well known to our Ohio legislators in 1951 and since*.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Life Insurance</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Accident and Health Insurance</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Hospital Expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Surgical Expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">Medical Expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">Major Medical Expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">Disability Income Insurance</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">Automobile Insurance</p>\n<p id=\"b365-14\">Aviation Insurance</p>\n<p id=\"b365-15\">Boiler and Machinery Insurance</p>\n<p id=\"b365-16\">Burglary, Theft, Larceny and Bobbery Insurance</p>\n<p id=\"b365-17\">Credit Insurance</p>\n<p id=\"b365-18\">Fidelity, Forgery and Surety Bonds Glass Insurance</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Public Liability, or Personal Liability Insurance</p>\n<p id=\"AOWU\">Professional Liability Insurance</p>\n<p id=\"ajr-dedup-0\">Title Insurance</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Workmen\u2019s Compensation Insurance</p>\n<p id=\"AmiA\">Eire Insurance</p>\n<p id=\"AeP\">Marine Insurance</p>\n<p id=\"AeI\">Government Insurance</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">No doubt this list is not exhaustive but surely our children who read this in school, as well as our adult citizens, are entitled to believe that the word \u201cinsurance,\u201d when used in a statute by our legislators, includes them all unless some are, by name, excluded. I find the board of hospital trustees, the hospital employees, and hospital patients no less entitled to the plain meaning of this common word \u201cinsurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Consequently, under the statute the board of hospital trustees has full discretion to designate or not designate the amounts and forms of insurance protection to be provided subject to no limitation other than that the full implication of the statute requires that the insurance protection designated have some real relation to hospital management.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">A reading of the excellent and comprehensive article by Crawford Morris, Esq. (one of Cleveland\u2019s great present day trial lawyers) entitled: \u201cBesponse to Bibicoff: Malpractice Suits v. Patient Care\u201d (April 1970), 37 Insurance Counsel Journal 206, surely demonstrates the importance of this type of insurance to practitioners of the healing arts. Also, he recounts recent developments within and without Ohio, saying at page 207:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">\u201cCommon law dynamics to serve a dynamic age: In 1956 the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Avellone </em>v. <em>St. John\u2019s Hospital, </em>165 Ohio St. 467, 135 N. E. 2d 410, abolished a doctrine which had prevailed for over 50 years * # * (that a non-profit hospital is not liable for the torts of its servants) saying:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">\n<em>it* * *</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-10\">\u201c* * * Whatever the reason for the public policy that gave rise to the rule of immunity, <em>public policy today, ex</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>amined in the light of present day conditions, will not support such a rule.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">How the Paulding County Hospital trustees came to purchase this hospital professional liability insurance so long ago and to maintain it through the years is not known. There is some speculation that it seems likely that two late brother physicians, Drs. Justus and Ray Mouser, prominent in the practice of medicine here during the 1940\u2019s and 1950\u2019s, insisted upon it and probably regarded its purchase as a proper part of the \u201centire management\u201d of a hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">And, although this idea may have properly been held debatable prior to 1951, the statutory change of that year certainly provided explicit authorization for the purchase of such a policy. And if the trustees may lawfully cause the purchase of such a policy, then certainly licensed insurance companies may provide them.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Consequently, I hold that R. C. 339.06 clearly authorizes hoards of county hospital trustees to designate for purchase such policies of hospital professional liability insurance, and in such amounts, as they in their discretion determine expedient for their particular hospital, although they have no obligation to do so. When such designation is made, boards of county commissioners are mandated to provide payment therefor. This is evidenced by use of the statutory words \u201cshall secure such protection.\u201d I hold further that when such insurance protection is provided, there arises by necessary implication from this authorized action, a waiver of sovereign immunity by the state in the person of a county hospital, to the extent only of the limits of coverage provided by the policy or policies in question. Moreover, by accepting the premium for such protection, insurers waive to a like extent, any defense against recovery based upon sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">For me, this interpretation of the present Ohio law follows the rule of the second paragraph to the syllabus of the Supreme Court of Ohio, in <em>Slingluff </em>v. <em>Weaver </em>(1902), 66 Ohio St. 621, often followed and never overruled, reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">\u201cBut the intent of the law-makers is to be sought first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>of all in the language employed, and if the words be free from ambiguity and doubt, and express plainly, clearly and distinctly, the sense of the law making body, there is no occasion to resort to other means of interpretation. The question is not what did the general assembly intend to enact, but what is the meaning of that which it did enact. That body should be held to mean what it has plainly expressed, and hence no room is left for construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">With deference to the following Opinions of the Attorney General of Ohio, to wit: 1969 O. A. G. No. 69-085; 1966 O. A. G. No. 66-157; 1962 O. A. G. No. 3139; and 1954 O. A. G. No. 4566 \u2014 they are disapproved insofar as they may appear to conflict with this opinion. 1952 O. A. G. No. 1126 is approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The statutes in respect to the Ohio State University Hospital are in no way similar to those in respect to county hospitals. Consequently <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Ohio State University Hospital </em>(1959), 170 Ohio St. 49, has no application to this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Does the subject policy of hospital liability insurance have a definite relation to hospital management? How can it be otherwise when since 1948 there have been eight claims made, of which one is pending, five have been settled, and two have been rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Moreover, the board of hospital trustees states that in the past the chief reason they have provided this insurance is \u201cfor employee protection\u201d; and that important reasons for continuing the program \u201care necessary for the peace of mind of the employees and the general well being of the patients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Also, the hospital administrator states that: \u201cI have been told by the laboratory technicians if without this protection they would resign. It is my understanding that under the present Ohio law there are a number of acts which hospital employees might do in performance of their duties in which they would be held liable and the hospital would be immune from suit. If this is so this protection is necessary for the peace of mind of our employees and also the patients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">la Ohio it seeras clear that employees are generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>held primarily accountable, at the suit of third persons, for injury resulting from their torts, even though committed within the scope of their employment. See 36 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d, Master and Servant, Sections 378, 379, and 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">In 2 Restatement of the Law of Agency, 1958, it is stated at page 125:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">\u201cSection 354. Agent\u2019s Negligent Failure After Undertaking Protection of Others</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">\u201cAn agent who, by principal or otherwise, undertakes to act for his principal under such circumstances that some action is necessary for the protection of the person or tangible things of another, is subject to liability to the other for physical harm to him or to his things caused by the reliance of the principal or other upon his undertaking and his subsequent unexcused failure to act, if such failure creates an unreasonable risk of harm to him and the agent should so realize.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">And at page 128 it is written:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">&lt;&lt;# # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">\u201cIllustrations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">\u201c3. A is employed by the government as a coast guardsman with a function of rescuing mariners in distress. T\u2019s boat is in danger, and word is sent to A, who. negligently fails to respond and does not save T as he could have done if he had performed his duty to the government. A is liable for causing T\u2019s death whether or not the government had a duty to aid or had an immunity for liability # # # J J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">The appendix to the foregoing Section 354 of the Restatement indicates that the principle enunciated, although doubtful in 1933, has since had wide support in state and other courts despite some contrary opinion. The comment specifically cites these Ohio authorities in support of the rule: <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Schrage </em>(1945), 75 Ohio App. 62; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co. </em>(1945), 75 Ohio App. 299, 43 Ohio, Law Abs. 178, m. c. o. May 16, 1945; and <em>Employer\u2019s Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>United Parcel Service </em>(1950), 89 Ohio App. 447, 59 Ohio Law Abs. 561. None of them, however, dealt specifically with hospital cases,</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Consequently, the court finds that the proposed renewal of the policy in issue here is clearly lawful and a writ of mandamus directing the county commissioners to pay the premium therefor is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\n<em>Judgment for plaintiffs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-5\"><em> Board of Commissioners </em>v. <em>Mighels </em>(1857), 7 Ohio St. 109, overruling a precedent of 30 years duration, first laid down in Ohio, as a general rule of law, that counties enjoyed the benefit of sovereign immunity. In 1912, there was added to Section 16, Article I, Ohio Constitution, these words, \u201cSuits may be brought against the state, in such courts and in such manner as may be provided by law.\u201d It seems always to have been assumed that \u201cprovided by law\u201d means \u201cprovided by the Legislature\u201d although, in light of prior Ohio history, this assumption may not necessarily be correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b360-6\"> The <em>Mighels case </em>overruled <em>Commissioners of Brown Co. </em>v. <em>Butt </em>(1826), 2 Ohio 348, holding that county, as represented by commissioners who had not provided a jail as required by law, was liable for not supplying jail without reference to degree of negligence, in a case where judgment was entered against a sheriff for permitting the escape of a prisoner confined for debt and the sheriff sought indemnity in court from the county. At page 353 the court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">\u201cThe injury has been sustained in consequence of a neglect of duty on the part of the commissioners, not as individuals, but in their corporate capacity as the representatives of the county of Brown.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">A dissent insisted the commissioners voluntarily accepted their trust and if by their illegal conduct injury was occasioned they should be personally responsible. Also, there was no statute on the subject and at p. 358 we find: \u201c* * * under our territorial government, a statute was adopted by the governor and judges, in August 1792, declaring the counties liable for escapes that should happen through the insufficiency of the jail. The act pointed out the manner in which the money should be assessed and paid, and also the mode of commencing and conducting suits for the recovery thereof, in case the courts should not order it assessed and paid. The frauds that were practiced on the counties under the law, by collusions between plaintiffs and defendants, when no debts were really due and when defendants were utterly insolvent, became so apparent and oppressive, that the first territorial Legislature, in 1799, repealed the act, and no subsequent Legislature has seen proper to revive it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"adq-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Although both the original drafts of the Ohio Constitution of 1802 and 1851 were silent on the subject, the rule in this <em>Butt case </em>remained the law of Ohio until 1857 when it was overruled to set asde the $7,750.00 judgment entered against Hamilton County on the verdict of a jury for a person whose \u201cthigh and two ribs were * * * fractured and broken\u201d and whose petition asked $10,000.

Schultz entitled, \u201cOhio Sovereign Immunity: Long Live the King\u201d (1967), 28 O. S. L. J. 75, and the cases therein cited and discussed. Mr. Schultz after considering the precedents, proposes that it would be well for Ohio to abolish sovereign immunity in respect to its contracts. At page 85 the author says: \u201c* ** In short, the Ohio courts have taken a very narrow view of what constitutes consent to suit. The state may only be sued in accordance with legislation which clearly expresses the state\u2019s consent to suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">\u201cConsent to suit has been granted in piecemeal fashion in Ohio. These consent-to-suit statutes are scattered throughout the Code. (Here reference is made to footnote 76 wherein is found a listing of 16 consent-to-suit sections from the Ohio Revised Code which the author says is \u201cfairly complete.\u201d) Noticeably absent from any listing of statutes in which the General Assembly has given consent to suit is any provision for suit against the state on its contracts or for its torts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">At page 88 the author remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\">\u201cWith the increase of government contact with the individual, sovereign immunity has been increasingly questioned. Courts and legislatures have been quicker to do away with immunity from suit in contract than in tort. By the turn of the century several states and the federal government had already given up their immunity from suit on their contracts. This is a step long overdue in Ohio. There is good reason for a state to be more willing to surrender its immunity in contract than in tort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-12\">\u201cA tort is usually an accidental relationship. Frequently the parties having nothing more in common than the fact that they ran their vehicles together in an intersection. The number of torts for which a state could be held responsible is not predictable. Consequently, the demands on the treasury are not foreseeable. It is this uncertainty which is the cause of the General Assembly\u2019s reluctance to do away with its sovereign immunity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-13\">The interpretation made here creates no uncertain liabilities against either the state or any county thereof. Neither does it require that the county rent its facilities to a non-profit corporation, as the court understands some counties have done, in order that the insurance protection requested here may be provided,,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
