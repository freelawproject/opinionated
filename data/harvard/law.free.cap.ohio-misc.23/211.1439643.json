If only Americans of color were able to acquire housing accommodations as easily as they can purchase Cadil-lacs the occasion for cases such as this would surely be rare.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">This is an appeal from a decision of the Board of Adjustment (board) of the city of Lima, Ohio, affirming action of Boy C. Coon, Building and Zoning Supervisor, denying a building permit to appellant (Lakewood) for the erection of a modern twelve-building apartment complex, Northwood Homes, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">1. 32 \u2014 1 bedroom units to rent for $130 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">2. 112 \u2014 2 bedroom units to rent for $150 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">3. 48 \u2014 3 bedroom units to rent for $160 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">4. 8 \u2014 4 bedroom units to rent for $175 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">The building of which is to be accomplished with funds provided under the Bent Supplement Act of 1965 and amendments thereto.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>For reasons hereinafter stated the action of the Board of Adjustment is reversed and remanded with instructions, and law applicable to this case is declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\">In 1968 when the writer accepted assignment to this case he had no knowledge of its nature and might well have begged off had he known. It having, nevertheless, fallen to his lot, he shall discharge his duty as bound by oath and conscience. At the conclusion of the evidence on February 25,1969, the court assured counsel that a thorough study of the issues presented would be made. It also asked that briefs be filed. By March 24th, all parties had filed briefs in support of their views. The court now freely confesses that it did not then know what a task it had set for itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Ostensibly, this is a simple little case involving no more than a decision as to whether Section 1303.01 of the Codified Ordinances of Lima (C. O. L.) is constitutional or whether the board in interpreting it has acted lawfully or not. It appears to the court, however, to be far more than that. For if the matters here in controversy cannot be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>solved so that the policy declared by Congress in the Housing Act of 1937 as amended,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> can be substantially realized as a practical matter, I perceive that millions of Americans of every hue who could be better housed are going to remain ill housed. We first consider\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The Parties and Their Views oe the Legal Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AgS\">Appellant corporation is wholly owned by its president, Ben C. Cogen. He is an established builder of new, modern homes, having built in the past 25 years approximately 700 houses in the vicinity. About half of these houses sold for $15,000 or less; about half at prices between $15,000 and $23,000, all prior to January 1,1968. Franklin Realty Company (Franklin) owns a 13.601-acre vacant tract of land lying just south of Brower Road (an east-west street marking the northern boundary of the city of Lima) and just west of certain east facing properties fronting on North West Street (also known as State Route No. 65). Appellant has control of the development of this tract by reason of some arrangement with Franklin.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>The action of the board was determined at a second open meeting after public notice, both sessions being attended by counsel and some parties on August 7 and 14, 1968. The conclusory minutes of the board were reduced to writing and signed on or about August 28, 1968. See Appendix II. This appeal is from the decision recorded in these minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">On September 5, 1968, Lakewood (at times also referred to herein as appellant and/or Cogen) filed with the deputy secretary of the board its \u201cNotice of Appeal from Agency of a Political Subdivision\u201d alleging error in sustaining denial of mentioned building permit for the reasons given by the Building and Zoning Supervisor, to wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">(1) That Lakewood\u2019s plans were not approved by the City Planning Commission and the City Council under Section 1303.01 C. O. L. (Codified Ordinances of Lima).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">(2) That if not, the board acted unreasonably in light of the evidence before it in interpreting Section 1303.01 C. O. L. as specifically charged in six separate paragraphs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">On September 6, 1968, this notice of appeal and a transcript from the board were filed in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">In its brief filed March 3, 1969, Lakewood alleges as issues made the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">\u201c1. Was the appeal by the appellant from the Board of Adjustment to the Common Pleas Court timely filed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number><em>\u201c2. </em>Is Section 1303.01 C. O. L. so vague, indefinite, lacking in standards and criteria that it is not capable of application?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">\u201c3. Does the lack of standards and criteria in Section 1303.01 C. O. L. constitute an improper delegation of legislative authority by Lima City Council to City Planning Commission and/or the Building and Zoning Supervisor to make it in violation of the XIY Amendment to the United States Constitution and to Sections 1 and 19 of Article I of the Ohio Constitution? In other words, does Section 1303.01 C. O. L. deny the appellant of the due process of law and constitute an unlawful taking of his property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">\u201c4. Does the manner in which Section 1303.01 C. O. L. as interpreted and applied by City Planning Commission, Building and Zoning Supervisor and Board of Adjustment of the City of Lima and refusal to grant the variance result in the appellant having been denied the equal protection of the law?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">In the brief submitted for the city in behalf of the board and in that of the adjoining and nearby landowners (neighbors), both filed March 17, 1969, defense counsel agree that mentioned issues numbered 1, 2 and 3 are presented but contend that the facts do not truly raise the issue alleged by appellant under number 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">The court agrees with appellant that all four issues were properly raised and respectively finds: (1) that the appeal was timely filed and that the court has full jurisdiction; (2) that Section 1303.01 C. O. L. is not unconstitutionally vague and indefinite; (3) that Section 1303.01 C. O. L. on its face is not violative of Amendment XIV, U. S. Constitution or of Sections 1 and 19, Article I, Ohio Constitution; and (4) that the action of the board is illegal because based only upon superficially plausible reasons lacking the equity required by (1) general equitable principles and (2) the prohibition against deprivation of rights provided by Title 42, U. S. Code, Section 1983 (R. S. 1979, Act Apr. 20, 1871, C. 22, 1, 17 Stat. 13) reading-:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">\u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, <em>custom, </em>or <em>usage,, </em>of any State or Territory, subjects or causes to be subjected any citizen of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in <em>an action at law, suit in equity, </em>or <em>other proper proceeding </em>for redress. (Emphasis supplied.) Moreover, the words \u201cConstitution and laws\u201d in the foregoing paragraph embrace the words \u201cPrivate property shall ever be held inviolate but subservient to the public welfare * # * \u201d found in Section 19, Article I, Ohio Constitution,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as well as those of Sections 1981 and 1982, Title 42, U. S. Code, Health and Welfare.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>B. C. 2506.01, providing for <em>\u201cAppeal from decisions of any agency of any political </em>subdivision,\u201d incorporates by reference, unless otherwise modified, the statutes governing appellate procedure generally in the courts, R. C. 2505.01 to 2505.45. R. C. 2505.04 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\">\u201cAn appeal is perfected when written notice of appeal is filed with the lower court, tribunal, officer, or commission. Where leave to appeal must be first obtained, notice of appeal shall also be filed in the appellate court. After being perfected, no appeal shall be dismissed without notice to the appellant, and no step required to be taken subsequent to the perfection of the appeal is jurisdictional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">B. C. 2505.07, <em>Time for perfecting appeal, </em>in pertinent part reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">\u201cAfter the journal entry has been approved by the court in writing and filed with the Clerk for journalization, or after the entry of other matter for review, the period of time within which the appeal shall be perfected, unless otherwise provided by law is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">\u201c(A) Appeals to the supreme court or to courts of appeals, or from the municipal courts and from probate courts to courts of common pleas, shall be perfected within twenty days. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">(Paragraph re new trials in courts omitted.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">\u201c(B) <em>All other appeals shall be perfected within ten days.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">\u201c(C) In case of the insanity or death of a party after judgment, the court may extend the time for filing the appeal, an additional twenty days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">\u201cThis section applies to any action or proceeding pending in the courts on the effective date of this section.\u201d Effective 10-27-1953. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">By reason of the foregoing statutes it is very clear that until the minutes of the board\u2019s meeting and final decision made on August 14, 1968, were reduced to writing and filed with the deputy secretary of the board on August 27, 1968, there was no \u201centry of * * * matter for review.\u201d Clearly the \u201cnotice of appeal\u201d was in writing, was filed, and specifically indicated the matter and action appealed from. Moreover, it was filed with the deputy clerk of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>board on September 5, 1968, just 8 days after the \u201cmatter for review\u201d was entered on the board\u2019s records in the office of the Deputy Secretary. <em>Sun Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals </em>(1966), 9 Ohio Misc. 101, is substantially in accord with the view of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\">Turning now to the second issue we find the text of Section 1303.01 O. O. L. to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\">\n<em>\u201cDevelopment plan.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">\u201cThe owner of any tract of land shall submit to the City Planning Commission a plan for the use and development of such tract of land primarily for residential purposes and if such development plan is approved after public notice and hearing by the City Planning Commission and by the City Council, the application of use, height, area and yard regulations established herein shall be modified as required by such development plan, provided that for the tract as a whole excluding street area, but including area to be devoted to parks, parkways or other permanent open spaces there will not be less than the required area per family for the area district in which such tract of land is located for each family which under such development plan may be housed on such street. And provided further that under such development plan the appropriate use of property adjacent to the area included in such development plan is fully safeguarded (1949 Code, C. 34, Section 27).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Appellant contends the words \u201ctract\u201d and \u201cfully safeguarded\u201d as found in the ordinance have no definite meaning and also that the words \u201cif such development plan is approved\u201d provide no standards of performance for either the City Planning Commission or the City Council who are to do the approving of the \u201cplan for the use and development\u201d which every \u201cowner of any tract\u201d must submit when the use is \u201cprimarily for residential purposes after public notice and hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The court, finding that a number of the neighbors had appeared before the board and the City Planning Commission (commission) and had objected to and protested against Lakewood\u2019s proposal, overruled appellant\u2019s objection to their being made parties herein. The court also oyerrules the neighbor\u2019s contention that this appeal should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>be dismissed because Lakewood is not the \u201cowner\u201d of instant 13.6-acre tract. In the opinion of the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Grieser </em>v. <em>Huntington National Bank </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 291, at page 294, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\">\u201cThe word \u2018owner,\u2019 as used in various statutes is one of flexible meaning, depending on the language and purpose of the particular statute in which employed, and it may vary from an absolute proprietary interest to a mere possessory right. <em>Animal Rescue League </em>v. <em>Assessors of Bourne, </em>310 Mass. 330, 333, 37 N. E. 2d 1019, 1021, 138 A. L. R. 110, 113.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In zoning regulation what is important is who has power of control of the land or structure in question. As not the slightest evidence contradicts appellant\u2019s evidence that it has an arrangement with Franklin Eealty Company so that it has control of this land to use it for the proposed apartment complex the court finds that for the purpose of Section 1303.01 C. O. L. appellant Lakewood is the owner of the land affected by its proposed apartment house development thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The court agrees that the provisions of Section 1303.01 C. O. L. are to be considered as a part of the entire Planning and Zoning Code \u2014 Part Thirteen of the Codified Ordinances of Lima (Code) and are to be interpreted in that light. This means that the commission and council do not have unfettered discretion to disapprove any plan submitted. They may only disapprove development plans which are violative of the legitimate purposes of the Planning and Zoning Code. This means that they may\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">(1) Disapprove nonconforming uses under the existing code, <em>a proposal which is not here made.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">(2) They may disapprove for failure to meet legitimate quality standards for construction materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">(3) They may disapprove for failure to meet legitimate and known requirements for buffer screening areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">(4) They may disapprove for failure to meet known and legitimate standards for floor area and outside space.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">(5) They may disapprove for failure to meet fire and other legitimate exit regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">(6) They may disapprove for failure to meet known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>and legitimate drainage and sewage disposal requirements \u2014and for other similar legitimate reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\">(7) They may not disapprove for no reason, for reasons of mere bias or antipathy, or for a wrong interpretation of the existing code \u2014 here the objection that Section 1335.01 (i) O. O. L. requires that \u201cEvery dwelling shall face on a public street.\u201d or for reasons which deny nationally secured rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">(8) They may disapprove because the surrounding area is not \u201cfully safeguarded\u201d as those words are legitimately defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">An examination of the entire Lima Code discloses that it incorporates by reference the Sections 713.01 <em>et seq. </em>\u201cPlanning Commissions\u201d and Sections 711.08 <em>et seq. </em>\u201cPlats\u201d of the Revised Code of Ohio, and asserts \u201c* * * Unless specifically regulated by the Charter of the City, or by ordinance passed by the Council of the City, all powers, authority and procedure shall be governed by the Ohio Revised Code,\u201d Section 1307.07 C. O. L.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Section 1311.28 C. O. L. reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">\u201cA <em>lot </em>is a parcel of land occupied or designated to be occupied by one building and the accessory buildings or uses customarily incident to it, including such open spaces as are required by this Code and such open spaces as are arranged and designed to be used in connection with such building. Such lot may or may not be the same as the lot in recorded subdivision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">\u201cLot shall include \u2018plot.\u2019 (1949 Code, C 34 Section 33.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">No similar definition is given for the word \u201ctract of land.\u201d In light then of the Code and common experience the court finds that \u201ctract of land\u201d here refers to any land area occupied or designated to be occupied by more than one building or one building larger than a \u201cdwelling\u201d as that word is defined in Section 1311.15 C. O. L. reading \u201cA <em>dwelling </em>is a building arranged, intended or designed to be occupied by not more than four families living independently of each other and doing their own cooking upon the premises. (1949 Code, C. 34 Sec. 33.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">As the plan presented is an apartment house plan the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>units of which, are not \u201cdwellings\u201d as just defined it is clear that any objection that they do not face a public street is no violation of Section 1335.01 (i) reading: \u201cEvery dwelling shall face upon a public street of not less than fifty feet in width and no dwelling shall be built on a plat of ground less than fifty feet in width. (Ord. 9-52. Passed 2-11-51.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">It is clear from the testimony that Lakewood\u2019s purpose has been and is to build a modern, good quality 12 building \u2022 \u2014 200 unit \u2014 brick veneer apartment house complex which will in all likelihood cost at least $2,000,000. At the time of the hearing in this court architect plans were exhibited for which Mr. Cogen testified, plaintiff was then obligated to pay $65,000. The apartments are designed for rent to persons of moderate income in today\u2019s world.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In the opinion of this court the commission may \u201cfully safeguard\u201d the surrounding area by requiring protection from unusual air pollution, from stagnant water produced by improper drainage, from dinning noises substantially in excess of those normally in the area, from lack of buffer zones commonly provided. But \u201cfully safeguarded\u201d cannot be legitimately interpreted to deny appellant the use of its land as it desires to use it when otherwise in conformity to known law, nor to deny to it or its successors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>the rental of such land as developed to persons for whom the neighbors have for any reason extreme antipathy, or to deny to any citizen the opportunity to rent or buy from any landlord with whom he may strike a bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\">The court now reviews the action of Mr. Coon, Building and Zoning Supervisor,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> who denied the building permit to appellant in this case; the first building permit ever refused Mr. Cogen in hundreds of applications made personally or by one of his companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">On July 23, 1958, Mr. Coon, in his official capacity, wrote Mr. Cogen as president of plaintiff corporation, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">\u201cThis letter is to inform you that a building permit to construct an apartment complex at 409 Brower Road, Lima, Ohio, is denied. Basis for this decision are the following items:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">\u201c1. The development plan has not been approved by the City Planning Commission and City Council. (Sec. 1303.01, C. O. L.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">\u201c2. Every dwelling shall face on a public street. Sec. 1335.01, subsection (i) C. O.

The floor area of units 4A in bidding Number 7 on the second floor exceeds the allowable maximum for building of U-A construction. (Sec. BB-53-07, O. B. C.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-10\">\u201c5. A second exit is required from units 4A in building Number 7. (Sec. BB-53-12, O. B. C.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-11\">\u2018 \u2018 6.

Market Street, Lima, Ohio.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">\u201cItem number 6 shall be resolved to the satisfaction of the City Engineer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">He then concluded the letter and indicated one copy each for the \u201cDirector of Law\u201d and another for the \u201cCity Engineer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The next day, on July 24,1968, plaintiff by its attorney filed its \u201cApplication for a Variance and an Appeal from the Decision of the Building and Zoning Supervisor Denying a Building Permit,\u201d addressed to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">This leads the court to consider the\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Proceedings Prior to Denial oe Building Permit</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">Sometime about January 1968, Lakewood obtained P. H. A. (Federal Housing Authority) clearance as to quality and a commitment to provide funds for Northwood Apartments as a Rent Supplement Act apartment house project. Sometime \u2014 perhaps 6 or 8 weeks \u2014 thereafter someone in the F. H. A. office in some way communicated this fact to someone of the city officials and the news apparently spread rapidly, and the project was viewed and examined closely.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">Thereupon, Section 1303.01 C. O. L. was recalled and invoked for only the second time in 20 years. The other occasion, in respect to Criterion Homes \u2014 with 84 apartment units \u2014 was made in January 1968, when Mr. Coon told Criterion he believed Section 1303.01 C. O. L. applicable. Thereupon, Criterion presented plans which were approved by the City Planning Commission and the City Council. See Appendix III. It was never precisely disclosed what objections were made to Criterion\u2019s original plans. Nor is the special ordinance set out in mentioned appendix informative in this respect. It is clear, however, that no provisions of the Rent Supplement Act were in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>volved, nor was any issue made as to any rights under Section 1982, <em>42 </em>U. S. Code, Health and Welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">Mr. Cogen, for Lakewood, testified that it was his intention and purpose, in the preparation of the plans for Northwood Apartments to comply with every provision of the Code and Building Regulations and that objections of Mr. Coon, as Building and Zoning Supervisor, numbered 3, <em>4, </em>5 and 6 were oversights, which Lakewood stands ready and willing to correct. Viewing the project as a whole, and the extent and complexities of the detailed plans, the court can find nothing incredible in this testimony, and there is no evidence in the record to contradict it. Consequently, the court accepts it as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">When Lakewood was told that compliance with Section 1303.01 C. O.

Ted Wilson, Psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The Honorable Malcolm D. Basinger, attorney, is Deputy Secretary to both of these bodies. The Mayor, who is elected by the general electorate, appoints all other members of both bodies. Although the court notes that the dual positions of Messrs. Cory, Ghaster and Mac-Donnell on both commission and board might be found to be incompatible, no party has made any objection for such reason and for the purpose of this decision the court finds it is now too late to raise such issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Upon publication in the April 26, 1968, issue of The Lima News (Lima\u2019s daily paper) it was discovered that not a few Lima residents \u2014 chiefly neighbors, were interested in the matter and an uncounted number attended the session of the City Planning Commission on May 22, 1968, which appears to have been continued to May 29, 1968, and further continued to June 26, 1968, at which time the commission found that Mr. George L. Kruse, Jr., City Planning Director and resident of the Northland area, was not biased and prejudiced, that the project was located in an inappropriate area despite an appropriate use under the zoning code, and declined to approve the development plan, or to refer it to City Council for consideration,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> whereupon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Mr. Coon refused to issue a building permit to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Other proceedings, however, had been had before Mr. Coon acted. On April 3, 1968, Mr. Kruse wrote Mr. Roy D. Allen, Director, Federal Housing Administration in Columbus, Ohio as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">\u201cLocally, unofficial questions have been raised regarding a proposed rent supplement project, Northwood Apartments in Lima, Ohio.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">\u201cUnder Section 1303.01 of our Zoning Code, a development plan of this nature requires a public hearing and approval by the City Planning Commission and city Council.

In addition, please advise of your estimate of economic rents for various size units in the proposed North-wood Apartments project.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Before the Planning Commission, at its hearing on May 22, 1969, this letter received on April 12 was read in full by Mr. Kruse, and its meaning referred to. Mr. Dickason, attorney for appellant, argued that the Rent Supplement Act should constitute no part of the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>sion\u2019s consideration of the proposed development plan. Mr. Krnse apparently thought otherwise and stated \u201cI wish to point out, further, that I have been contacted initially by an individual from the Federal Housing Agency of Columbus who requested verbally from my office * * * what was the City Planning Commission\u2019s position regarding North-wood Apartment Project \u2014 the rent supplement program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\">Thereafter a motion was carried to request from the city\u2019s law director an \u201copinion # * # pertaining to the exclusion in public hearing consideration of the rent supplement program, Northwood Apartments, pertaining to the development plan proposal, including location.\u201d An excerpt showing the entire colloquy is shown in Appendix TV.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">At the continued hearing on May 29, Mr. Dickason charged that Mr. Kruse had a bias against the project and expressed an opinion that Mr. Kruse lived in the area and had organized or was a part of a group opposed to the project. Appendix V shows a full excerpt from the minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">On May 29, 1968, the Law Director issued his Opinion. No. 29-68 to the City Planning Commission. The concluding paragraph reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">\u201cEven though the City Planning Commission and the City Council may not base their ultimate decision on the type of prospective occupants of such rental units, it is my opinion that at a public hearing it is not improper to permit such type of discussion. Since the City Code calls for a public hearing, the rent supplement matters should be allowed to be introduced and the City Planning Commission or the City Council, as the case may be, can use its own judgment as to the necessary weight such testimony may have in arriving at their ultimate decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">I perceive there is little point in having a public hearing if the members appearing are not permitted to air their views and would exclude nothing having any relevancy or believed relevancy to the matter at hand. But municipal officials who must make decisions affecting others do not have unfettered discretion in making official judgments. Like judges, they are sworn to uphold the Consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>tutions of the United States and the state of Ohio, and to faithfully discharge the duties of their office. Ohio judges are, in addition, sworn to administer justice without respect to persons. Consequently, all public officials are bound to discharge the duties of their office regardless of praise or blame, deserved or undeserved, and despite public clamor in support of or opposition to the project under official consideration. Naturally, in a free country \u2014 or at least in one where individual freedom is widely, if not everywhere perfectly, enjoyed by all \u2014 where freedom is deeply treasured in the minds and hearts of nearly all, interests and desires which are incompatible and conflicting inevitably appear. When brought to court it becomes the task of the law to resolve them in ways as fundamentally fair and peaceable as possible, but definitely in a way honest men may at least call approximately just.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">When we seriously begin to deal with the concept of freedom or liberty, we discover these words spoken by Abraham Lincoln when he addressed the Baltimore Sanitary Fair on April 18, 1864: \u2018 \u2018 The world has never had a good definition of the word liberty, and the American people, just now, are much in want of one.\u201d Today, 106 years later, the American people are still much in want of such a definition. Although much evidence may easily be obtained that the American people enjoy more individual liberty than any other, there is perhaps as much easily available evidence that no people are more lawless than the American. Providing for all freedom under law which produces a high degree of personal liberty combined with as great a degree of both justice and safety to the unoffending citizen, whatever his color, office or status, is no easy task. Sir Henry Maine, in 1861, completed the original edition of his classic work \u201cAncient Law,\u201d which was to be republished in no less than 10 later editions. Upon review of a large sweep of the world\u2019s general and legal history, he concluded that \u201cNothing has been so distasteful to mankind, either individually or in the masses, than to admit the fact of their moral progress as a substantive reality.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>See p. 67, 5th Eng. Ed., Henry Holt &amp; Company, New York, 1875.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\">Frederic Bastiot, in his work \u201cThe Law\u201d (1850), quoted a friend who said \u201c * * * the statement, <em>the purpose of the law is to cause justice to reign, </em>is not a vigorously accurate statement. It ought to be stated that <em>the purpose of the law is to prevent injustice from reigning. </em>In fact, it is <em>injustice, </em>instead of justice, that has had an existence of its own. Justice is achieved only when injustice is absent.\u201d Quotation from Dean Eussell translation \u2014 The Foundation for Economic Education, Inc., Irvington on Hudson, N. Y., 1956, pages 28, 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">So, although the City Planning Commission is privileged to hear any objections from any person in interest, it is not free to weigh objections whose effect is to deny a builder\u2019s constitutional right to private property with substantial dominion over it or a lawful dominion over it on the meretricious ground of a risk of lowered property values.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">We now examine the proceedings before the City Planning Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Mr. Kruse made a 9 page letter report to the Commission dated May 22, 1968, parts of which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">\u201cUnder Section 1303.01 of the Lima Planning and Zoning Code, Lakewood Homes, Inc., has submitted site development plans for the proposed Northwood Apartments which require City Planning Commission and City Council approval thereof. * # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">\u2018 \u2018 The City Planning Commission, as one of the reviewing authority units under our Code, may approve the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>plication, reject it or prescribe further conditions before granting approval.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">\u201cAt the present time the entire apartment site is zoned for Class II Business under the Lima Zoning Code.

Then appellant waived its previous objection to any discussion of the matter. See Appendices IV and V for full excerpt of proceedings on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">In June 1968, while the City Planning Commission was considering this matter under Section 1303.01 C. O. L. and holding public meetings pursuant to the notice published in the Lima News on April 26,1969, there is in evidence 61 letters signed by 87 people (counting those signed Mr. and Mrs. as two) concerning this project, which were directed to either the commission or to some city official. Only one, dated May 29,1969, approved the project. It was from the Community Action Committee for Lima and Allen County (part of the federally promoted anti-poverty program). It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">\u201cPlease be informed that the Lima and Allen County Community Action Commission went on record at its May 23, 1968, meeting as supporting the apartment building program proposed by Mr. Ben Cogen to be operated under the rent supplement program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">\u2018 \u2018 This is a badly needed program in our area to help in seeing that all Lima residents have decent housing at a cost they can afford.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">\u201cTo have visited in some of the unsafe and dilapidated structures which are presently rented for $50.00 to $80.00 per month in our area is enough to convince the CAC Board of Directors that something must be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">\u201cWe hereby request that you consider this request by Mr. Cogen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">All the other letters were solidly opposed to the project and listed no less than 154 reasons why, which I have tabulated as follows: (For selected quotations from objectors, see Appendix VTH.)</p>\n<p id=\"b253-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Reason for opposition Number of Times Cited</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">1.

Although no evidence on the point was adduced, the court will assume from known facts that in all likelihood, a disproportionate amount of this \u201csubstandard\u201d housing presently houses black people in the southern area of the city, particularly wards 5 and 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Moreover, in the interest of establishing as much of the whole truth as can be, the court notes that, in connection with the matters litigated that although Lima\u2019s Chief of Police is a negro, neither the Mayor nor any member of City Council, any member of the City Planning Commission, Board of Adjustment, except Ted Wilson, City Planner, or any member of counsel in this case, is a person of color. At the hearing of this appeal requiring two full days, there were always from 12 to 20 spectators, all white, in appearance, except during the forenoon of the second day there was among the spectators one young negro. All were quiet and well behaved in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">In view of the foregoing there can be no doubt that at present <em>de facto </em>housing segregation exists in Lima and Allen County. As was held by Judge Austin in <em>Gautreaux </em>v. <em>Chicago Housing Authority </em>(10 Feb. 1969), 296 F. Supp. 907, it must be clear to all with clear perception that this pattern has chiefly resulted because of usage (a uniform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>practice) of the dominant white majority in discriminating generally against negroes in the sale and rental of housing, and definitely contrary to the words of Section 1982. True it has been held for decades that said sections did not apply to prohibit private discrimination in this field as in other areas of human conduct \u2014 only to prohibit official state action contrary to the 14th Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">But mentioned sections have never been repealed by Congress and have now been newly interpreted by the Supreme Court in which our Constitution vests the nation\u2019s judicial power. As <em>Gautreaux </em>discloses, the Aldermen of Chicago (comparable to members of city council here) made site locations of public housing facilities on a racial basis by the exercise of a veto through the usage of \u201cAlderman\u2019s courtesy.\u201d Akin to senatorial courtesy when in certain areas a senator finds something personally objectionable all join his ranks as a mesaure protective of the institution. Such action on the part of municipal officials is now declared to be clearly illegal and in fact all city officials involved are now declared, in Chicago, to have the duty of making new site locations in areas where the old segregated housing pattern will not be either enhanced or perpetuated. It is clear to me that these same provisions and principles of law apply to not only Chicago but to the entire United States including Allen County and the whole state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">This case differs from <em>Gautreaux </em>in that it does not involve a public housing agency charged with providing low rent housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">It concerns the right of a free white citizen land owner who wishes to provide modern private housing (part of which will accommodate those of moderate and low income, as by Congress and H. U. D. provided) by utilizing benefits available to such housing owners under the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, as amended (which includes the highly controversial Rent Supplement Act), in full or substantial compliance with Lima\u2019s zoning ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">In view of the foregoing I must now make\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b261-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>An Evaluation op Present Applicable Law</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\">If 42 U. S. Code, Section 1982 is a valid exercise of legislative power by Congress acting under the authority of Section 5, Amendment XIV, U. S. Constitution; and it is a fact that in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Alfred H. Mayer Co. </em>(1968), 392 U. S. 409, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1189, 88 S. Ct. 2186, the Supreme Court of the United States declared that the enactment of Section 1982, Title 42, U. S. Code, was a valid exercise of power by Congress authorized by Section 5, Amendment XIY, U. S. Constitution, and the fact that it had lain partially dormant for many years in no way diminished its present force \u2014 it must be determined if Section 1983 of the same Title is also in full force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Section 1982 was a part of the Civil Rights Act of April 9, 1866, passed after adoption of Amendment XIII, U. S. Constitution. It was re-enacted in 1870 after Amendment XIY had been adopted in 1868, along with Section 1983, which made its first appearance in 1870. As previously mentioned, Section 1982 reads, \u201cAll citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by <em>white citizens thereof </em>to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold and convey real and personal property.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) As a result, a decision of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri dismissing plaintiff\u2019s action for injunctive relief because of defendant\u2019s refusal to sell a home in a private subdivision to plaintiff solely because of race was reversed. The Supreme Court also held that the fact that the statute governing property rights of citizens is couched in declaratory terms and provides no explicit method of enforcement does not prevent federal courts from fashioning an effective equitable remedy.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Nor did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>the court stop here, it ruled that Amendment XIII, U. S. Constitution is not a mere prohibition of state laws establishing or upholding slavery but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States and that Congress is given power to remove every badge of such prior status.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">If this is so, then I cannot escape the implication that the present force of Section 1983, Title 42, U. S. Code, is also a valid exercise of the power of Congress and also has a present undiminished force. Section 1983 (a part of the Act of April 20, 1871, c. 22, 1, 17 Stat. 13 \u2014 R. S. 1979) reads: <em>\u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, </em>ordinance, regulation, <em>custom </em>or <em>usage </em>of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in <em>an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding </em>for redress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">This court exercises general equity jurisdiction and certainly has power to exercise it in this \u201cappeal from the decision of an agency of a political subdivision.\u201d Consequently, I believe it can be fairly deduced that this <em>Jones case </em>firmly supplants the majority opinion of the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Coney Island </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 150, and reveals that in respect <em>to </em>personal civil rights the correct rule was stated by Judge Hart for the dissenters in said cause.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">For it is clear that the U. S. Constitution and valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>acts of Congress and treaties with other nations constitute the supreme law of the land which every one in my position has taken a most solemn oath to uphold. See Clause 2, Article VI, U. S. Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\">This case brings into sharp focus the civil rights of the plaintiff, the objecting neighbors, plaintiff\u2019s prospective tenants, and all the citizens \u2014 including white ones\u2014 that propose to make Northwood Apartments a reality, or to prevent it becoming so.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">Here it seems entirely probable that if the usage common in the past persists, and if the law of nondiscrimination is proclaimed and interpreted in absolute terms of grammatical logic, major fears of the objectors to this project may quite possibly come true and in about five years we will have one more blighted area in Lima. I can think of nothing Lima or Allen County needs less.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">By reason of the foregoing, I perceive a special need for all parties to be told what the law is in a way which all can understand. Moreover, from such understanding it must be clear to Mr. Cogen that he has a fair chance to succeed economically if he complies with it, taking people as they are and not as many might imagine they should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Moreover, the neighbors must be told that their old usage (uniform practice) of private discrimination in the field of the sale and lease of real estate is now positively contrary to federal law. They must also understand that maintaining their present objections in respect to this project (although it will deprive some black and some poor persons of housing benefits) will no doubt deprive, in whole numbers, many more of their own moderate income white people.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Also, if Sections 1981,1982 and 1983 are correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>understood, the consequences of future discrimination must be clear not only to the neighbors but to city officials, to attorneys, to realtors and to financial lending institutions. Finally, if Sections 1981, 1982 and 1983 are in the future observed, there will be no real depreciation in the value of objector\u2019s homes because primarily chance alone will henceforth determine whether any white person will have a black neighbor tomorrow, or vice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Having thoroughly examined a wide range of legal writing on this subject,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> some studies indicating a contri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>bution by housing deficiency toward disorder,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> current news and magazine comment,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> to say nothing of a host of precedents of the United States Supreme Court and other courts, and concurring with Mr. Justice Holmes that \u201cThe life of the law has not been logic, it has been experience,\u201d and with Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is that \u201cIf we would guide by the light of reason, we must let our minds be bold,\u201d I have reached a conclusion that a census rule of threes and thirds, complemented by a rule of indiscriminate chance, may be adopted by plaintiff in the initial rental of the apartments he proposes to build and be adhered to by him for 21 years and be held during all that time to be nondiscriminatory in practical effect and lawful under the U. S. Constitution and present federal and state laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\">The rule is that as to any housing unit arrangements or other compact residential area, wherein not less than 100 families are sheltered within any one square mile area, any housing owner (or sponsor) who proposes to build or rebuild using some funds provided by a public treasury may look at the last published census figures, in any county wherein the total nonwhite population does not exceed twice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>the national average percentage of snch population, in which the proposed construction is to be located and observe the percentage of residents of any minority groups, here in particular negroes (it clearly appearing to all that they have been for the longest time the chief victim of invidious discrimination). For example, the 1960 census for Allen County shows the population to consist of 51 persons who are neither white nor black, 7,358 black persons, and 96,282 white people \u2014 a total of 103,691.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">So, if appellant will initially allocate rental of his units as follows, I hold it will be done equitably and en-forcible as a matter of equity under Section 1983 \u2014 to say nothing of the fact that I perceive it to be in accord with general equitable principles (here I include the 51 persons who are neither white nor black along with the whites as I have no reason to suspect they suffer any invidious local discrimination by reason of any uniform practice of the vast majority in Allen County).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Seeing then that the population percentage of negroes in Allen County is .0711 we round it off at the next full percent of 8. So 8 per cent of the units must be allocated for black tenants (if there are such applicants) who must not be crowded into any one building, where a number of buildings containing multiple units are erected as is here proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Multiplying 8% by three and subtracting from 100% gives us 76% of the units which can be allocated for white tenants who also may not choose single buildings wherein no black people reside.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Now adding mentioned 8% and 76% equal 84%, which, subtracted from 100%, leaves 16% to be assigned as follows (assuming there are both more white and black applicants than there will be available units): For a period of at least 30 days before possession can be granted appellant must accept the applications of all \u201cqualified tenants\u201d whether of independent means or as defined by H. U. D., and then operating an open and true game of chance, lease to those who draw the lucky numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">With respect to filling later vacancies, appellant may during the first 21 years, maintain, if he desires, a rental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>quota wherein at least 8% of the units are negro occupied and 76% are white occupied with fluctuations among the remaining 16% in accord with any fair rental policy appellant may formulate. Moreover, the equity commanded by Section 1983 requires that he may have, if he requests, a declaratory judgment, good for at least 21 years, determining whether or not a rental policy, if uniformly adhered to, will be a fair and equitable one under our laws and constitutions, for I perceive that anything truly called a rule of law in our modern urban society demands it. The foregoing presumes that among the qualified applicants at least 8% will be black, and there will probably be more such applicants. Of course, if after fair public notice, less than 8% of the applicants are black, appellant may fill the vacancies with other applicants. As to future vacancies during the first 21 years, preference must be given to Negro applicants as per the rule announced until the basic percentage, increased by one-third, is attained as a minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\">Should the official publication of the 1970 census show an increase in Negro population to 9%, then, until the next such publication, appellant would have to provide at least 9% units to be occupied by black people and 73% by white people with the rest being rented in accordance with the owner\u2019s published fair rental policy. So for 10 years at a time, appellant can thus manage his apartments if he so desires, and particularly if he deems it necessary to economic success.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Now, as Judge Austin in <em>Gautreaux </em>observed, the present situation (wherein nearly % of the county\u2019s black people reside in four areas comprising perhaps a little more than 1 square mile of the county\u2019s 410) must presumptively have come about because the result of invidious discrimination against black people, except perhaps in a few special instances. By reference to the census figures and common knowledge in the vicinity, I hold that a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>sumption arises in any area of one square mile or lesser area of not less than 100 family residences, where less than 1/3 of the total percentage of Negroes in the county raised to the next full percent (here 3%) are not occupied by black people, <em>every sale is presumptively invalid </em>unless countervailing evidence of a clear and convincing nature to the contrary is adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Also that in any county wherein the last census shows that less than 3% of the population constitute any minority group recognized as the object of widespread invidious discrimination on the basis of ancestry or religion a like presumption arises in every area of the county not already accommodating at least 1% of such group.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">I hold further that whenever three times the percentage of Negroes as per the last census (or in specific counties any other ethnic minority widely recognized as a victim of invidious discrimination) exceeds 50%, an individual owner may maintain 50% of his units for white occupancy so long as white people, on a national scale, continue to constitute an overwhelming percentage of the total national population.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Nor do I forget any of the people the Rent Supplement Act proposes to help. Again, I do not propose to tell appellant what to do but I hold that he may, if he desires or as a matter of economic management, in respect to any class the Act proposes to benefit, be held not to unlawfully discriminate if he refuses to accommodate on this basis after a full percentage of such persons in the county, increased by one-third, are already accommodated. For example, the percentage of persons over 62 in Allen County reported by the last census is .075. So .075 plus .025 equals 10%. If 10% of the units are occupied by such persons, new qualified applicants may be refused on the basis of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">In Section 1701s (h), Title 12, U. S. Code, providing <em>\u201cAdditional definition of housing owner; restriction on </em>payments\u201d it is stated that with respect to properties financed with loans under Section 1701g made on or before August 10, 1965, \u201cpayments shall not be made with respect to more than 20 per centum of the dwelling units in any property so financed\u201d \u2014 and similarly as to those assisted at any time under Section 1715z -1 of this title (12).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>In considering this 20% limitation figure in the statute, I must suspect it was a practical provision designed to foster the efforts of private enterprise and provide wider occasion and example for people who truly want better and nicer places in which to live and are willing to abide by the discipline necessary to provide and maintain them. So, if and when the owner is accommodating qualified tenants who receive rent supplements to the extent that their total numbers equal one third of his units he may refuse \u2014 though he is not required to \u2014 to accept more such unless they move into units vacated by persons whose rent is supplemented by the government. Here this means he may, at time of any lease, refuse to rent to statutory \u201cqualified tenants\u201d if he is already renting 67 units of the 2\u00dc0 to such persons. It now appears doubtful that appropriations by Congress will provide for 20% of the tenants but as to projects begun now, I hold it would be inequitable for H. U. D., during the next 21 years, to compel subsidized occupancy in excess of this figure.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>I cannot regard the situation here lightly \u2014 and although the days have been few indeed, since March 17, 1969, when I have not given some thought, study or dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>cussion to aspects of this case, it was early October before I arrived at a general conclusion which I deemed to be theoretically sound and providing practical answers to appellant so he can have a fair chance to succeed in building needed apartment houses now and in the future \u2014 and so that like-minded men of ability might be able to do likewise anywhere in Ohio \u2014 and perhaps in the Nation. Nor am I at all satisfied that my solution is perfect \u2014 or the best \u2014 but it is the best I have been able to devise within a reasonable time in addition to other demands made upon me.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\">I would have a strong suspicion \u2014 in the absence of countervailing evidence of a clear and convincing nature\u2014 that the provision in C. O. L. 1303.01 requiring development plan approval by both the City Planning Commission and the City Council provide, in part, a procedure to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">(1) facilitate (by amending ordinances) projects desired and approved by both the Commission and the Council; and</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">(2) veto projects not desired by either the Commission or Council much as Chicago Aldermen have for years vetoed projects whose locations they disapproved \u2014 a practice now definitely illegal because unconstitutional if to perpetuate racial segregation.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">For the benefit of appellant and all who are victims of the discrimination forbidden by Sections 1981 and 1982 and any usage contrary to Section 1983, I have held that in any one square mile of area in any county, or lesser area consisting of at least 100 residences, where the residences occupied by negroes percentagewise, house fewer in number than 1/3 of their total percentage of population, every sale or lease of housing accommodations is presumptively made pursuant to local discriminatory usage and that such sales may not be lawfully facilitated by either owners, licensed real estate agents or established lending agencies. For any discriminatory sale in such area appellant (if he is complying with the requirements of law pertaining to his project) or any victim of legal discriminatory usage may enjoin such sale if not consummated or recover as damages the difference between actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>sale price and any higher price at which it may have been offered bnt not sold to a person of color, together with all costs, and as against realtors and finance agencies who profit by snch transactions, recover all commission received together with such reasonable attorney fee as is necessary to recover same.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">I hold that Section 1983 authorizes this in any court exercising general equity powers and that such provision is necessary to practical, effective results. Moreover, under Section 1983, appellants have their choice of remedy other than suits in equity. Also, this particular appeal is an \u201cother proper proceeding\u201d wherein the rights therein specified must be vindicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Appellant here has standing to be a party in this respect because unless he can be freed from the usage common in the past the market value of his own project will necessarily decline with excess rapidity.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Of course all victims or prospective victims of housing discrimination based <em>solely </em>on race have standing to assert their rights as against anyone who has not previously done his part as I have adjudged appellant will have if he maintains a minimum equitable or benign quota for 21 years.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>All areas and particularly new development areas of any kind must prove they have <em>had </em>no minority race applicants unless they are accommodating a percentage of such minority equal to one-third of the county\u2019s last census figure. I make this rule because I am unable to see any solution feasible in the foreseeable future for eliminating so-called \u201ceconomic segregation\u201d \u2014 and probably, considering the claims of freedom, the possibility of \u201cupward\u201d mobility is all that should for some decades concern us.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\">Also, I hold that financial institutions lending to real estate purchasers can protect themselves by requiring sworn affidavits of fact from sellers and their brokers that in any particular sale affiants have not violated either Section 1982, Title 42, U. S. Code, Health and Welfare; and/or Section 4112.02 (H) (9), Revised Code of Ohio. If the managers of such institutions have reason to suspect that their affiants might not be telling the truth, I have no doubt they can require an indemnifying agreement that should the affidavits prove false they will save harmless the lending agency as a part of the consideration for making the loan. And true equity will certainly closely scrutinize all sales anywhere in the county during the next 10 years made to white persons now living within one mile of this project.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><em>Bush, </em>v. <em>Kaim </em>(Feb. 5, 1959), 297 F. Supp. 151, 17 Ohio Misc. 259, decided by United States District Court Judge Lambros, formerly an Ohio Common Pleas Judge, has already applied in Ohio 42 U. S. Code, Section 1982, as now in full effect to nullify a private discrimination, based on race, in the rental of housing with a ruling that the issuance of an injunction based on equitable principles was necessary to provide an acceptable remedy for denial of Section 1982 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">And if Section 1982, Title 42, U. S. Code, Health and Welfare, is today a thoroughly effective statute, I am un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>able, I repeat, to see why Section 1983, Title 42, U. S. Code is not equally effective by virtue of Clause 2, Article VI, U. S. Constitution, the supreme law of the land which I am bound to uphold, even if the Ohio Legislature had not enacted Section 2506.04, Revised Code, or Section 4112.02 (H) (9), Revised Code. This latter section, known as the \u201canti-blockbusting statute\u201d effective October 30, 1965, I find, is hardly known. Perhaps this is so because the procedure in respect to violations is so cumbersome and time consuming before leading to mild practical results I would expect many victims would think it not worth making complaint.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Consequently, in the exercise of its full equity powers, which I perceive this court has by virtue of a true delegation thereof by the state Legislature in Section 2506.04, Revised Code, and in this type of case particularly, by virtue of the command of Congress in Sections 1981, 1982 and 1983, Title 42, U. S. Code, Health and Welfare, so that had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>appellant brought action for either injunction or declara-' tory judgment, this court has authority, when public officials fail to act equitably under applicable law, to do what true equity has always done, <em>i. e., </em>do what ought to be done considering the whole of the circumstances and consider-, ing that equity is the mitigating principle in the law,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> that \u201cequity delights to do justice, and not by halves,\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> that equity does not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and that equity is that aspect of the law which has ever refused to define words such as fraud, \u201clest the craft of man evade the definition.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\">In my consideration of this case, I have not forgotten, I hope, the civil rights of anyone. Not the appellant, nor the appellees (city officials or neighbors), nor the prospective beneficiaries of the Rent Supplement Act \u2014 not even those of every citizen whose taxes are to make some contribution towards projects such as these.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">I start with the appellant. He is a white man and a successful builder of substantial individual homes. It is certainly a fair inference that all the objectors were able to have the comfortable and attractive homes they have\" because neither they nor appellant were denied any civil right guaranteed them not only by the law of Ohio or Acts of Congress, but by the usage (the universal practice) all: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>city officials exercised in respect to them as the Codified Ordinances of Lima were administered when the permits to build the houses they occupy were issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Now appellant proposes to exercise the right of private property over his own for a purpose specified in the Zoning Code since at least 1964 and proceedings are had under the same Codified Ordinances and there is an uproar of protest such that in the minutes of the City Planning Commission for June 26, 1968, a member stated (some 8 weeks after notice of the public hearing in respect thereto was published) \u201cto date he had received <em>no </em>correspondence from anybody in favor of the plan.\u201d And of the more than five dozen letters concerning the project and directed to city officials \u2014 only one favored it. And this one was from a group lawfully created by Congress to war on poverty!</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Considering the reasons for objection, I group the probable real reasons to be as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">1. The requirement that black people be accommodated (present occupants of substandard housing) if found qualified by H. U. I).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">2. The requirement that poor people be accommodated \u2014 particularly if this means that about 90% of the tenants will always be receiving rent supplements; (I perceive this to be the real objection to a proposed low rent housing project in a community now largely occupied by black achievers in Cleveland, Ohio).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">3. The requirement that families with children are to be encouraged as are old people.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">4. The impact on the local school if these apartments are nearly all quickly filled by prolific young families having several children.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">Surveying the law of the English speaking peoples for almost 1,000 years now, I perceive (in exercising the authority vested in public offices) philosophical attitudes ranging all the way from that of a \u201cRoyal Commission\u201d to that exemplified by those well understood words in the American vernacular, \u201cThe Buck Stops Here,\u201d forthrightly displayed on the desk of one President of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>States. Although it would be pleasant and convenient to refer this to a \u201cBoyal Commission\u201d as described by Sir Alan Herbert<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-3\">\u201cThe necessity for action was clear to everyone, But the view was very general that nothing could be done, And the Government courageously decided that the Crown should appoint a score of gentlemen to track the trouble down\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\">\u201cWhich always takes a long, long time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">But I can not believe such a disposition would comport with Article I, Section 16, Ohio Constitution requiring that in Ohio justice be administered \u201cwithout denial or delay.\u201d Frankly, I deplore the fact that I have required so much time and am taking so many words to decide this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">But long ago I learned that for me only patient, persistent examination of everything known to have connection with any controversy is necessary before I can feel confident that I have a reasonably good understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of matters involved. And for me, in our growing urban society the great main practical issue presented here is, \u201cAre we going to find a way to succeed in providing housing for millions in our urban society as well or better than we in times past provided benefits to beneficiaries of Congressional action such as\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">1. The Bailroad Land Grant Acts of 1856 and 1862;</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">2. The Land Grant College Act of 1862;</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">3. The Homestead Act of 1862 and numerous amendments thereto in the 1800\u2019s and, since 1900 such as\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">1. The Air Mail Contracts Acts of 1934 and 1935;</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">2. The G. I. Bill of Bights Act of 1944;</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">3. The Interstate Highway Act of 1956 as since amended and other similar Congressional measures too numerous to mention here, or are we not?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">My determination is to try. For it seems to me most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>likely that practically everyone involved in this litigation is either a direct or indirect beneficiary of mentioned Congressional legislation, despite the fact that probably only a few know or realize this.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Moreover, I have received not a little inspiration from the words of Neil Armstrong, native of the adjoining county of Auglaize, when he became on July 20, 1969, the first man to set foot on the moon and said \u201cOne small step for a man, a giant leap for mankind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Hopefully, I have examined this situation with sufficient thoroughness, care, and perception that the solution at which I have arrived will constitute \u201cOne small step for better housing in Lima, a giant leap for better housing in Ohio and the U. S. A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Another reason for taking so much pains with this decision has been that the court has been introduced to a number of aspects of city planning while being unable to forget the words of Oskar Stonorov, Architect and City Planner, from a speech at Cooper Union, reported in The Toledo Blade, August 8, 1965: \u201cWe are always capable of doing the wrong thing at the wrong time.\u201d And of course often we cannot be sure what the right thing to do is.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Nor can the court believe that it would be a bad thing for every resident of Lima, and particularly every resident of Northland to read in the November, 1969, issue of Reader\u2019s Digest the article at page 157, entitled \u201cThe Suburbs Are Changing\u201d by Wolfgang Langewiesche.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">After describing a modern \u201cneighborhood\u201d of 900-1200 houses or apartments for 3000-5000 people called Columbia he concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u201cYou can see how all this changes the climate in which people live. Kids and grown-ups, too, have a sudden increase in <em>practical </em>freedom, a wider choice of things to do, a wider choice of times to do them in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-3\">\u201cAnd that is the intention. Town planners are convinced that the layout of a community has a profound effect upon its people. The human being thrives more where there is more diversity, more privacy, a broader range of contacts, a greater variety of things to do and of ways to be. James W. House, the creator of Columbia, says that he wants his town to be \u2018garden for people to grow in.\u2019 Nice phrase; and a good summing up of what the change in suburbs is all about.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">At this point I anticipate a number of excellent legal minds will declare that what I have promulgated as lawful will enable appellant in respect to some particular individual, very soon to discriminate in housing on the basis of race. In terms of grammatical logic I do not deny it, but in terms of practical results over the years and takng people as they have been \u2014 and as many now are judging only from the objections to this project \u2014 this subservience to grammatical logic in uncounted housing situations, I perceive, is clear illustration of law where \u201cthe letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.\u201d And not infrequently among white men I have heard declarations of fealty to this absolutist grammatical view of Constitutional requirements and if my senses failed me not, I perceived a cynical preference for the position because the speaker was certain that, people being as they are, nothing would be done in matters personally affecting him. And, if I am not mistaken, if such doctrine prevails in cases like this nothing much will be done except to create more terrible problems for our posterity than now confront us.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The reason is that to date in most cases white builders and brokers who would do justice to the negro or other minority groups must suffer the full economic burden of the almost universally present uniform practice (in law \u201cusage\u201d) of discrimination while the contumacious who believe their ancestry entitles them to special privileges over certain other human beings of a different ancestry\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>especially if the fact is visible \u2014 either profit by the fact or arrange themselves to their satisfaction in an \u201cexclusive neighborhood.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Moreover, as is so often the case when we search carefully into the resources of our law, we find that great judges in days long gone by not infrequently handed down wise decisions that have become forgotten, although when found their merit sparkles like a newly polished diamond.</p>\n<p id=\"AXb\">While the darkness of legalized slavery was a part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>our current law the rule was widely acknowledged that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-3\">\u201cWhere in a specific case the words of the statute would lead to a practical result at odds with the reason and purpose for a statute, the court will make an equitable interpretation and decree in accord with the purposes and reason of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">In short, this court finds that the substance, the reason and purpose of the Civil Nights Acts justify the formulation and judicial approval of equitable housing quotas based upon or geared to census facts available to all where desired, and above all where believed necessary economically in order to cope with the usage of the community which would otherwise create a greater volume of discrimination. In all probability such quotas should not be judicially enforced for periods longer than 21 years, a figure much utilized historically in land law to say nothing of the fact it commonly measures the length of one generation, and exceeds a common mortgage term of 20 years. The court recognizes this to be state action, but denies that it is state action which impairs equal protection; it is state action necessary to provide freedom to the productive in the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ercise of their civil right to engage in the worthwhile activity of producing adequate shelter for multitudes.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Essentially, the court holds that the realities of the situation require some such measures in order to provide a greater measure of equal protection in fact than has heretofore been possible despite the finest and most idealistic in abstract theory.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The court now considers</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The Propriety of Enforcing Civil Eights In State Courts</p>\n<p id=\"ARM\">Prior to <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Alfred E. Mayer Co., supra, </em>there was, I suppose, little reason to examine the claims of federal law in the civil rights area in state courts as private discrimination, except in certain specified areas, was not declared illegal and the federal statutes were held to be proscriptive of only official state action.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">But if Sections 1981, 1982 and 1983, Title 42, U. S. Code, Health and Welfare, now have an all pervasive existence in every judicial district (whether state or national) in the United States, as I perceive they do, then it seems certain that the rule of <em>Testa </em>v. <em>Katt </em>(1947), 330 U. S. 386, 91 L. Ed. 967, 67 S. Ct. 810, 172 A. L. E. 225, requires that these statutes be observed and applied in state courts. In this case the state of Ehode Island was precluded from refusing to entertain an action to enforce the civil penalty (triple damages and attorney fees) provided for violations of the World War II Eent Control Act, more particularly \u201cSection 205 (e) of The Emergency Price Control Act\u2014 [January 30, 1942] 56 Stat. 23, 24c 26 as amended [June 30, 1944], 58 Stat. 632, 640, c 325, 50 U. S. Code Appx., Section 925 (e), II PCA title 50, Appx. 25, Section 205(c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AvqU\">This principle that state courts are ordinarily obligated to enforce all provisions constituting a part of \u2018 \u2018 The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>supreme law of the laud\u201d seems to have long been recognized although hardly discussed.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\">Also, I note under present annotation Nos. 139 to 142 U. S. Code A. Section 1983, a total of 15 federal cases dealing with jurisdiction to entertain claims of invasion of civil rights in federal courts where there is <em>no diversity </em>of citizenship. Of these cases eight hold that such claims must be brought in state courts, seven that they may be brought in federal district courts. <em>Dargan </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1953), 346 U. S. 840, 98 L. Ed. 361, 74 S. Ct. 52, denied certiorari where it was ruled that such claims must be filed in state courts. In <em>Kenney, J., </em>v. <em>Killian </em>(1956), 352 U. S. 855, 1 L. Ed. 2d 66, 77 S. Ct. 84, and <em>Kenney, J., </em>v. <em>Hatfield </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>(1956), 352 U. S. 856, 1 L. Ed. 2d 66, 77 S. Ct. 84, two cases from the 6th Circuit, certiorari was denied where it was ruled in a Michigan case that such claim might be filed in federal district court. From this I can only be confident that there is respectable authority that state courts have and should exercise jurisdiction in this field.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Perhaps we should be reminded that as a matter of course we have long enforced in state courts the rights provided to members of our Armed Forces by The Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act, 50 U. S. Code Appx. Section 501 <em>et seq. Vara </em>v. <em>Vara </em>(1961), 85 Ohio Law Abs. 268, 171 N. E. 2d 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">For a case where persons in the position of the neighbors here were unable to show a violation of \u201cany zoning or other governmental regulation applicable to the locality\u201d could not prevent a Housing Authority from locating a low rent public housing project in their locality, see <em>Philbrook </em>v. <em>Chapel Hill Mousing Authority </em>(1967), 269 N. C. 598, 153 S. E. 2d 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Having made the foregoing analysis and declaration of applicable substantive law, we next consider\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The Jurisdiction and Duty op the Court</p>\n<p id=\"Aqv\">Re: Appeals From Decisions op a Political Subdivision</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Section 2506.01, Revised Code, effective September 16, 1957, provides for an <em>\u201cAppeal from decisions of any agency of any political </em>subdivision,\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> This court concurs with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the opinion of Judge Leach in <em>Broad-Miami Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Adjustment of City of Columbus </em>(1959), 89 Ohio Law Abs. 140,185 N. E. 2d 76, to the effect that in appeals such as this the court is not confined to a mere curbing of extreme actions, or positively illegal ones, or abuses of discretion, and that it places in the court authority to correct, revise or reverse the action appealed from on any ground deemed reasonable. Also, as I have heretofore noted, in the area of civil rights, Sections 1981, 1982 and 1983, 42 U. S. Code, constitute supreme law which is to be utilized and justly administered by the court, in special proceedings such as this as well as generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\">R. C. 2506.02 provides for a filing, within 30 days after the filing of the notice of appeal, of a complete transcript of all the original papers, testimony and evidence offered, heard and taken into consideration in issuing the order appealed from. This was done prior to the hearing by the court of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">R. C. 2506.03 provides in part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">\n<em>\u201cHearing on Appeal\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">\u201cThe hearing of such appeal shall proceed as in the trial of a civil action but the Court shall be confined to the transcript as filed pursuant to Section 2506.02 of the Revised Code, unless it appears on the face of the transcript or by affidavit filed by the appellant that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">\u201c(A) The transcript does not contain a report of all evidence admitted or proferred by the appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">&lt; <em>\u00cd </em># # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">\u201c(C) The testimony adduced was not given under oath.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-11\">&lt;&lt;# * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-12\">\u201c(E) The officer or body failed to file with the tran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>script, conclusions of fact supporting the order, adjudication or decision appealed from, in which case, the Court shall hear the appeal upon the transcript and such additional evidence as may be introduced by any party.

C. 2506.02, to be applicable to this appeal and considered all testimony and exhibits submitted by the parties. In addition the court has taken notice of all applicable law as required by R. C. 2317.44 and 2317.441, matters of common knowledge, and data found in official reports of the Bureau of the Census.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">From the foregoing the court concludes that it has power to do what the agency appealed from (here tne Board of Adjustment) should have done (based of course upon law and reason).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Under the provisions of Section 1303.01, C. O. L., appellant did submit to the City Planning Commission a plan for the development of a 200 unit, 12 building apartment house complex to be located upon its 13.06 acres. The commission gave the matter official consideration and held public hearings in respect to it. All concede that under the zoning law, in force when the application was made the application was for use then and now authorized, a use which had been authorized since 1964 at least, judging from the city zoning map accompanying the copy of the Codified Ordinances of Lima introduced in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">As we have seen (Footnote 10, <em>supra), </em>the commission properly rejected the first recommendation of the city\u2019s Director of Planning, Mr. Kruse, that the area be rezoned to exclude apartment house use.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Mr. Kruse\u2019s other recommendations to the commission made May 22, 1968, were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-3\">\u201c2.

Specific preliminary recommendations * * * <em>[supra} </em>concluding with the recommendation that the project be taken \u2018under consideration and that a study session be held to review the rent supplment factors\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">Mr. Kruse\u2019s June 26 report acknowledges receipt of drawings for Northwood Apartments and opportunity to study them; more information on the rent supplement; that the drawings are for 2 story brick veneer on wood frame over concrete slab apartment buildings; that one 1575 square foot and one 1750 square foot tiny tot play areas are shown, specifically designating only 3,325 square feet for recreation, and comments, \u201cwith 200 dwelling units in the project area to be served, the proposed recreation facilities are somewhat inadequate and the space as designated is not fully appropriate in size.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-14\">His final specific recommendations then are:</p>\n<p id=\"b287-15\">(a) More adequate recreation space and facilities should be specified for the apartment project.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-16\">(b) Is omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>(c) Utility easements should be defined and located.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">(d) Is omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">(e) The southernmost parking lot should be relocated either 25 feet from the south lot line or 12' therefrom with a four foot redwood woven fence installed along same.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">(f) The traffic circulation plan is essentially unacceptable as presented. No outlet to Lewis Boulevard should be permitted. Access should be by a loop public street connecting, if possible, Brower Road and North West Street in a manner that would discourage through traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">(g) Pedestrian access to Lewis Boulevard and between the six northernmost buildings and six southernmost buildings should be provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">(h) Some additional buffer consideration should be given between the project and Timmerman Ford property.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">(i) Buffer screening should be provided for the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">(j) Post and floodlight outdoor lighting facilities are identified on sheets El and E2 of the drawings. All exterior wiring should be underground and all exterior lighting on the applicant\u2019s property should be installed so as not to disturb the surrounding neighbors.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">The trouble with the record presented to the Board of Adjustment is that it is wanting in the specificity necessary to enable the board to take intelligent action. The Planning Commission is obliged to respect appellant\u2019s civil rights to utilize its real estate for a purpose authorized by the zoning code, here an apartment house. Consequently, when the commission refused to approve the development plan presented by Mr. Cogen, it was incumbent upon the commission to provide him a specific plan as near to the one proposed and in furtherance of his lawful purpose under the zoning code, which it would approve. Also, to give him opportunity to accept or reject, in whole or in part, again with all specifications necessary to proceed toward a practical realization of appellant\u2019s lawful purpose. In arriving at an acceptable plan the commission is obligated to base its action upon reasons having a firm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>foundation in known law, science, reason, and the best experience of the housing construction industry. In making its decision, it has a heavy burden to avoid frustrating appellant\u2019s purpose by invoking superficially plausible reasons without substantial relation to the cause of appellant\u2019s legitimate purpose.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Nor may persons in appellant\u2019s position be subjected to requirements not commonly required of all making similar proposals of a like ultimate purpose when lawful under the zoning code because some circumstances make the builder\u2019s particular purpose unpopular in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\">The court perceives that in modern urban housing \u201crecreation space and facilities\u201d are of great moment and great effort should be made to meet a planning standard based upon an intelligent, rational consideration of the specific project and within known planning guidelines, where available, of optimum and minimum standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">No doubt the commission is entitled to know if public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>utility services are planned to be available in sufficient quantity for construction purposes and for the project when ready for occupation, but appellant is entitled to have public utility services as are other members of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Certainly traffic circulation may be routed to require a greater number of autos to use one street than another, but denying any outlet to an adjoining street may not be done, unless an appropriate compensation is made to the owner for deprivation of the use of such street.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Parking facilities today are, of course, of fundamental importance and the court notes that apparently appellant did provide for same according to common planning standards in a way the commission did approve.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">All other items of legitimate concern may be specified, but they may not be made unduly burdensome in comparison to general standards of new construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Appellant and the commission are here obligated to co-operate to facilitate appellant\u2019s purpose to build new housing of good quality on appellant\u2019s land by utilizing provisions of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Before summarizing my conclusions I have felt a necessity \u2014 as a white American who does not hesitate to say that he believes in Christianity and who agrees with Dostoyevsky when he says, \u201cEven those who have renounced Christianity and attack it, in their inmost being, still follow the Christian ideal, for hitherto neither their subtlety nor the ardor of their hearts has been able to create a higher ideal of man and of virtue than the ideal given by Christ of old. When it has been attempted, the result has been only grotesque.\u201d [The Brothers Karamazov, Part II, Book IY, Chap. 1 (1880).] To file hereto appendices X and XI entitled, respectively, \u201cObservations of a Personal Nature\u201d and \u201cObservations and Reflections on American History.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Just why I should feel this necessity I do not know. But as one who has certainly been no firebrand for any particular panacea for the world\u2019s ills but who for decades has had a conviction that it is well for men to strive to do good, and as one who has for years made some effort to carefully observe the human situation in which he found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>himself, it seems appropriate that I share my understanding as a man with both the lay and professional persons affected by this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Having now explained my interpretation of the law applicable to the facts exemplified in this case, my decision is this:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">1. The City Planning Commission was obligated under Section 1303.01, C. O. L. to inform appellant as to specifically (1) what it did not approve in his development plan and (2) at least one plan, altered as little as possible, which it would approve.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">2. In exercising its jurisdiction under Section 1303.01, the Commission is obligated to facilitate appellant\u2019s project for utilizing its real estate for a lawful purpose under the Zoning Code, especially where he is trying to faithfully comply with the local code.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">3. In exercising its jurisdiction, the commission may not frustrate appellant\u2019s efforts to use its property for a lawful purpose by (1) the invocation of superficially plausible reasons unrelated to the owner\u2019s purpose \u2014 here residential housing, or (2) inventing requirements not commonly required of substantially similar structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">4. This is particularly true when the project being considered is (1) that of a private citizen who (2) proposes to utilize federal law so as to provide benefits to persons Congress has declared to be eligible for such benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">5. In exercising jurisdiction in respect to a private citizen who desires to locate a lawful development upon his own property agencies such as the Planning Commission, City Council, and the Board of Adjustment are obliged to respect equitable principles in the application of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">6. When administrative agencies (whether local, state or national) have twice fully considered the aspects of a proposal such as appellant\u2019s here, equity requires that builders, on a third review, are entitled to a declaratory judgment or its equivalent, telling the would be builder what he may lawfully do. Such a judgment will strike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>\u25a0down all requirements of state or municipal law that are based on no valid reason, or only superficially plausible reasons, and will enjoin the unreasonably contumacious from interfering with the construction of an authorized project.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\">Consequently, counsel may prepare a journal entry reversing the decision of the Board of Adjustment appealed from and remanding the cause to the Planning Commission for action to be performed within 30 days of the order, and consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\n<em>Decision reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqAg\">Appendix No. n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Minutes op Board op Adjustment</p>\n<p id=\"A6q\">Filed August 28, 1968</p>\n<p id=\"aou-dedup-0\">Board op Adjustment</p>\n<p id=\"AMl\">Meeting of August 14, 1968</p>\n<p id=\"aon-dedup-0\">Members Present: Mr. Frank B. Cory</p>\n<p id=\"AO-\">Mr. Earl Ghaster</p>\n<p id=\"asr-dedup-0\">Mr. Robert Grimes</p>\n<p id=\"A6v\">Mr. John W. MacDonell</p>\n<p id=\"AS8\">Mr. Ted Wilson</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Also Present: Mr. George L. Kruse, Jr., Director of Planning</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Mr. Roy Coon, Building &amp; Zoning Admr.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">The first matter for consideration by the Board was the Minutes of the meeting of August 7, 1968, two corrections as appear in the original of the Minutes as approved and ultimately signed by Mr. Cory were made by suggestion of Mr. MacDonell and were the change of the name of Mac-Donell to Dickason as appears on page 4, and the change of the word \u201cclosed\u201d to clothed as it appears on page 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">The correction having been made, it was moved by Mr. Cory, seconded by Mr. Wilson, and unanimously carried, that the Minutes of the meeting be approved but not read.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">The next matter to be considered was the Application of Lakewood Homes, Inc., relative to its proposed. apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>ment complex at the Southwest quadrangle of Brower Road and Northwest Street Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\">Mr. Cory moved, seconded by Mr. Chaster that Mr. Dickason be allowed to amend his Application, such amendment having been filed with the Board on August 13, 1968, and including both Mr. Dickason\u2019s letter addressed to Mr. Basinger and the actual amendment itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Mr. Basinger then resumed the situation to date, the purpose of the meeting and asked Mr. Dickason if he wished to speak on the issues of law involved. Mr. Dickason stated that his feeling was that the matter had been considered, that he could speak for an hour and a half on the subject, but that he would waive his opening argument in favor of Mr. Bowers, Attorney for some of the parties present, and would reserve his time to rebut.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Mr. Bowers stated that he had no comments in view of Mr. Dickason\u2019s statement and the Director of Law\u2019s opinion. Mr. Cory stated to Mr. Bowers that he was somewhat taken back by his statement that he did not feel he had anything to say, and Mr. Bowers said that he felt that the opinion of the Application had not changed, notwithstanding the amendment. If this changed the Director of Law\u2019s opinion he then wished to be heard, and if not he would rest with the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Mr. Cory stated that he sure [sic] whether or not Mr. Evans, the Director of Law wished to go farther, but noted that originally the Application did not seek a variance, and there was no notation in the opinion in regard to this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Mr. Evans stated that he just recently received the opinion, that he had not had the opportunity to study the matter, and was not in a position to interpret it for the Board at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Mr. Ghaster inquired as to when Mr. Evans would be in a position to give an opinion. After some discussion, Mr. Evans indicated that he thought he could be ready in one week, if the Board had a meeting at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">Mr. Dickason stated that he didn\u2019t know why the Director of Law couldn\u2019t give his opinion this afternoon, because the question was simply whether or not Lakewood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Homes, Inc., had the right to a variance. He didn\u2019t see why the matter couldn\u2019t be spelled out at this meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Mr. Bowers stated that he found only two issues, these being whether or not the Board had any jurisdiction at all, the second as to whether or not they could give a variance on the basis of a hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Mr. Basinger stated that it was his opinion that the only thing before the Board was the matter of an appeal, and that under the circumstances, the variance did not seem to be the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Mr. Cory stated that no useful purpose would be served by the delay and that the parties had been extremely patient to this point. He addressed a question to Mr. Dieka-son relative to his concern as to the amendment to the Application filed, the import of which, as he understood it, was that the Board of Adjustment would sit in judgment of the City Planning Commission. Mr. Cory stated that as he understood the prayer, it requested that the Board vary the Application of Section 1303.01 C. O. L. as interpreted by the City Planning Commission. He stated that if the Board was permitted to interpret this, it would be asking the Board to interpose its judgment as to what would be asking the Board to interpose its judgment as to what was in the minds of the City Planning Commission at the time, granting that three members of the Board were also members of the Planning Commission, and pointed out that all members of the Board were trying to sit solely in judgment of this matter without regard to the aspect previously treated. He stated that he did not feel that the Board could interpret that decision, nor had the authority to interpret the validity of this Section or the constitutionality thereof, feeling that this was a judicial function, and that it would be capricious and unreasonable on the part of the Board to attempt to do so. He went on to say that he felt the validity of the Section was the sole question and whether that Section was invalid, because it was vague and unreasonable, and therefore that Mr. Coon erred in his denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">He stated that there was nothing before the Board other than the question of the invalidity of the statute to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>indicate that Mr. Coon did err. Mr. Cory went on to say that not only were the duties relative to the Building and Zoning Administrator set out in the Section heretofore set forth, but that also under the provisions of Section 104.21 of the Ordinances, and that he was charged with being duly satisfied that plans for a building conform to all pertinent Sections and that therefore, it must be presumed that Mr. Coon was looking at all. He stated that under these circumstances he was at a loss and could not give the Release sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">Mr. Ghaster stated that he agreed with Mr. Cory, and that the only way in which the Variance could be granted was on the basis of unnecessary hardship. Mr. Dickason then went on to say that the function of the Board is to provide elasticity in the administration of a comprehensive Zoning Code, that it must be a comprehensive Code, but that he realized in certain areas there would be problems, it was for this purpose the Board was created and but for the Board, every little problem would become a judicial problem. He stated that discretion was given and that only the Board had such discretion as opposed to the City Planning Commission which had none. It had the power to determine the issue and if it had no power to grant the Release sought, then all the meetings that had been held in regard to this matter were worthless. He stated that if the Council and City Planning Commission had erred, there must be power in the Board or why run the matter through the Board of Adjustment; that the Board did have power based on hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">He pointed out that attached to his original Application were verbatim copies of the City Planning Commission Minutes of prior meetings which had been approved, and that when you go to these Minutes you find only one reason for disapproval, which was the location. He pointed out that the Planning Commission had said that they had no complaint about the construction at all, except from the standpoint of location.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">He stated that this was the first time that the City Planning Commission made a mistake in regard to this matter, and that this mistake relative to the question of de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>nial on the basis of location was a hardship to Lakewood Homes, and that in effect the City Planning Commission overruled the provisions of Section 1321.02 C. O. L. which gave authority to establish a Class II-Business, therefore settling the question of location in the area, because this Section also permitted the construction of multiple family apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">He stated that he was not saying there was no need to find that the Statute was unconstitutional, assume that it is, the Board could still give relief by virtue of the fact there were no established criteria; that all other Sections of the Zoning Code constituted the standards on which relief could be given relative to the apartment and clearly the applicant had complied in all other areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The Application having been denied, there was no place, Mr. Dickason said, to which the builder could take his appeal. He stated that there was no right on behalf of the Commission to say that this was not a proper location, and that the City Planning Commission made an error. He stated in addition that the issue of Civil Rights crept into the matter, and that under the provisions of Section 4112.-02 Revised Code Legislature had forever settled this question, and that the Commission\u2019s second error had been to allow evidence or argument to be heard in the case relative to the nature of the prospective tenants. He stated that the depreciation value of the neighborhood, schools, the race issue, et cetera, was prohibited by the terms of the Civil Rights Act, and that there was a hardship as a result; that in addition there was a hardship in having to go to court in that the building costs were rising daily;</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Mr. Bowers stated that Mr. Dickason had gotten off the basic issue; that the Board of Adjustment certainly had power relative to the granting of hardship, but it could not amend or rewrite the Zoning Code, but was primarily created to grant Variances.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">He stated that his points were that the Board, if it entertained authority to grant the Release sought, would be capricious; 2 \u2014 that the Board had authority to act in given areas, but this was not a proper area, and 3 \u2014 that to declare the Section unconstitutional was without its juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>diction. He went on to say that Mr. Dickason spoke of hardship and that there was as much of a hardship of the residents in the areas, and that if the Board entertained jurisdiction, it would be a case of its acting arbitriciously relative to the question of constitutionality. He stated that he felt Mr. Cory was right, and that the Director of Law\u2019s Opinion had not been changed by the filing of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\">Mr. Dickason then interjected that there was, under these circumstances, no case where the Board could grant relief, that he was required to exhaust all his remedies, that he could not go from the City Planning Commission to the Court, and had to take a step by step procedure and that the Court would inquire as to whether or not he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Mr. Cory stated the remedy, he felt, was judicial relative to the question of whether the law was vague and indefinite. He stated he didn\u2019t know the answer to this, and if there was a question of hardship, hardship was a matter which and should have been treated by the City Planning Commission, and that he did not feel the Board had authority to consider that prior action. Thereafter, Mr. Cory stated that he would move that the Application be denied on grounds which were as follows: 1 \u2014 that it was his feeling that the Board was not clothed with the authority to pass on the actions of the City Planning Commission and to make a determination that the City Planning Commission had erred in the consideration of the matter as presented to it. 2 \u2014 that it was his opinion that the Building and Zoning Administrator, in the light of the existing provisions of the Ordinances of this City did not err in refusing to grant a permit considering the inability of the Board of Adjustment and the inability of the Building and Zoning Administrator to render an opinion as to the validity and constitutionality of Section 1303.01 C. O. L. Mr. Cory\u2019s motion and remarks were seconded by Mr. Chaster, who stated that he agreed with the reasons given for the motion. Mr. Cory said for what it\u2019s worth, the proper source for relief in this matter would be in the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">There being no further discussion relative to the motion; a voice vote y^as taken resulting as follows: Mr, Cory</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u2014yes, Mr. Chaster \u2014 yes, Mr. MacDonell \u2014 yes, Mr. Grimes</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u2014abstaining, Mr. Wilson \u2014 yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">There being no further business before the Commission, the meeting was declared adjourned.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Respectfully submitted, Board of Adjustment Malcolm D.

I presume he has reference to what has been distributed \u2014 FHA No. 2504. To this extent, the chair, subject to appeal from the commission is inclined to agree with Mr. Dickason to the extent that while an explanation of the rent supplement program under the FHA might be in order, such information as may pertain to occupants would not be.\u201d ... \u201cIt\u2019s subject to appeal- \u2014 -if the commission wishes to overturn my decision on that matter it may be done so by motion. The chair hearing no motion from the commission will proceed then, on the basis that status of occupants in this matter will have no bearing and will not be germaine to the issue and considered irrelevant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-4\">Mr. Kruse: \u201cMay I ask a question?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">Mr. Basinger: \u201cYes, Mr. Kruse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">Mr. Kruse: \u2018 \u2018 The chair has ruled the rent supplement factors of this program have no bearing on the discussion, and review of the City Council and City Planning Commission?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">Mr. Basinger: \u201cI can\u2019t rule as to City Council, Mr. Kruse. I can only rule for the commission, and I\u2019m talking particularly specifically about occupancy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">Mr. Kruse: \u201cI wish to point out, further, that I have been contacted initially by an individual from the Federal Housing Agency of Columbus who requested verbally from my office . . . what was the City Plannng Commission\u2019s Position regarding Northwood Apartment Project \u2014the rent supplement program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">Mr. Dickason: \u201cMr. Chairman, on that statement, I would like to say that the City Council took care of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>situation on January <em>7, </em>when it passed the resolution that the rent supplement program would be welcome here. I don\u2019t know what the man in Mr. Kruse\u2019s office told him, but I have a letter from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a copy of which I will give to the secretary ... it\u2019s dated May 21st, yesterday, and it says\u2014 \u2018Dear Mr. Cogen ... re project Northwood Apartments ... the purpose of this letter is to inform you that evidence of proper zoning must be obtained for this proposal in accordance with the zoning code of the City of Lima, Ohio. We already have the resolution from City Council regarding rent supplement approval; therefore, nothing more is necessary on that particular point. Please submit this evidence as soon as possible. Very truly yours, Roy D. Allen, Director,\u2019 and that\u2019s dated as of yesterday. So, with the City Council having spoken on that subject and the housing director saying that he has no interest in what the Planning Commission thinks about it, I think any further proceedings in that direction would be out of order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">Mr. Basinger: \u201cLet me make myself perfectly clear\u2014 to explain rent supplement in terms of what rent supplement is, I would have no objection. What I am objecting to is references to poverty as such \u2014 and I would make this further comment. This commission (?) bound by the extent of the statute and it would be my ruling that under the circumstances the intent of the statute would not go to the matter. Now, that it might in some other areas, there would be no question. But unfortunately, I think that\u2019s the status of the matter, so certainly as to what rent supplement is \u2014 to that extent \u2014 I think we can be guided generally by what it says.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">Mr. Kruse: \u201cI would formally request a legal opinion from our Law Director pertaining to the exclusion in public hearing consideration of the rent supplement program, Northwood Apartments, pertaining to the development plan proposal, including location.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">Mr. Basinger: \u201cIs there a motion from the floor to request such an opinion?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">(It was moved by Mr. Ghaster and seconded by Mr. MacDonnell.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Mr. Basinger: \u201cNow this is in regard to the relevancy of rent supplement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-3\">\u201cAny discussion? If not all in favor. Motion carried unanimously.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\">Mr. Dickason: \u201cI have discussed this matter with Mr. Cogen, and it appears that there is some hesitancy in having this rent supplement program discussed, and we have nothing like that at all, and for that reason we\u2019re going to withdraw the motion that it be excluded and Mr. Kruse, so far as we\u2019re concerned, may take all the time that he likes in presenting the rent supplement program.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">Mr. Basinger : \u201cYou may proceed Mr. Kruse. Mr, Dickason has waived any objection that he might have.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">Mr. Ghaster: \u201cI think the motion for opinion should still stand \u2014 whether we do act on it, or do not act on it\u2014 whether it\u2019s a purpose of our consideration or not \u2014 we better know about it now. We\u2019re bound by his approval. (Upon question) We can delete Northwood now, but on the basis of future sites, we might just as well know where the Planning Commission stands as to any possible decision. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">\u201cMr. Basinger: \u201cThe chair will delete the specific reference (to Northwood) unless there is an objection of the commission.\u201d (There were no objections.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">Mr. Kruse: \u201cI have passed out to the Planning Commission Members the head sheet and pages 1, 2, 5 in the rent supplement program FHA, No. 2504. In the introduction of the rent supplement program, the program is authorized by Congress to provide housing for low income families and individuals who would be eligible for public housing, and who in addition, qualify by the following .. .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">(Here, Mr. Kruse read from the above.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Appendix No. V</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">Excerpt From City Planning Commission Public Hearing, May 29, 1968 \u2014 3:00 p. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">Mr. Dickason: Members of the Commission, Ladies and Gentlemen: I\u2019m proceeding with my summation here, although I am not sure if that is the proper subject at this time, and the reason is that we have before us the written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>report of the Planning Director of date of May 22, and in it there are listed eleven recommendations. Now, the Planning Director has had a detailed set of the plans for a week, and it would seem to me that his report at this time would be in order as to what, if any, of those objections have been removed, if any, by the supplying of the detailed plans, with reference to lights, and green area . . . and things of that kind. I would say that it would be in order at this time to hear from the Planning Director since he has reviewed the detailed plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Mr. Kruse: My review in relation with the comments has not been completed and my recommendations in the report calling for a study session still stand. Undoubtedly some of my recommendations have been complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Mr. Dickason: Of course <em>I think </em>that our biggest disappointment here is <em>that the planning commission has not received objective information in its report on this project. Mr. Kruse is a resident of Northland Area and he has been instrumental in the organizing of a group to .. .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Mr. Basinger: Mr. Dickason, I am going to <em>cut this off at this time. </em>I think this would be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Mr. Dickason: <em>I think </em>we have the right to bring to the attention of the committee what\u2019s going on <em>here </em>\u2014 that <em>the Planning Director has pursued a course of conduct for a period of several months ...</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Mr. Basinger: We\u2019re getting into a thin borderline here. I think that personalities \u2014 when we become concerned with this. <em>I think this a matter for the administration to investigate </em>if true. I do not know. I have had no indication to date that this is the fact in regard to the matter myself, but I just wonder if under the circumstances and under this consideration if it is specifically appropriate to consider <em>Mr. Kruses\u2019 role in organizing a group opposing this. </em>His considerations as far as the report are concerned as far as I can see go to the matter of the specific things which you have proposed. I take it from his comment he wants a study session with the Planning Commission relative to this. But <em>I am not inclined at this time to go into the matter of personal prejudice. </em>If you wish to take exception to this, I\u2019ll so note your exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Mr. Cory: Mae, may I ask a question? (yes.) Oren, if you \u2019ll share the ruling, I think we \u2019ll all abide by it, but <em>is it your contention </em>\u2014 just <em>yes or no </em>\u2014 that <em>this report that has been put before us is somewhat inaccurate because of a personal interest of the planning director?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\">Mr. Dickason: <em>Ye.s, it is </em>bias, <em>that is correct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Mr. Kruse: May I say something?</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Mr. Basinger: No, not at this time. I might say, Mr. Kruse, under the circumstances, and considering beyond that one remark that\u2019s been made, I think you\u2019ll have adequate time which is satisfactory to the commission in this regard. But, <em>I think to go into it now any further is improper. </em>Go ahead Mr. Dickason.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Mr. Dickason: Well, since all of the recommendations, the objections that the Planning Director has made still stand, I don\u2019t see of any way we can proceed here without answering everyone of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Appendix No. VIII</p>\n<p id=\"AWC\">Quotations From Objectors</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">To illustrate the opinions and sentiments of objecting Northland area residents in respect to Northwood Apartments I quote anonymously selected sentences from the letters of objection mailed to the city officials concerned with this project in early 1968, to-wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">\u201cMy child as well as all taxpayers need a playground to play in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">\u2018 \u2018 One family has already moved and three more houses are for sale in the eight hundred block of Northern Avenue now because of the possibility of such an apartment. These families are all friends.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-11\">\u201cI do want to make one point quite clear. There are those who have spread rumors, that the residents of North-land, are against this apartment complex, because we do not want any Negroes living in the Neighborhood. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>is not the reason for being against the proposal. In fact we have Negro families living in the Northland neighborhood. They are good neighbors and work as hard at keeping their place nice as do the rest of us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">\u201cThis type of project is known to deteriorate by neglect due to lack of interest and frequent turnover of residents living there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">\u201cThe sewers would not take care of that many apartments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">\u201cIf, when I bought my home in Northland about eleven years ago, I had wanted to live on the edge of a ghetto I would have located on the edge of one of those already established in Bath or Perry Townships.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">\u201cMany thanks for listening and for any effort you may bend to nip this cancerous proposal in the bud.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">\u201cThe poor of our community are in need of help by building their self respect and by developing their intellectual capabilities to the fullest (through schooling, etc.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">\u201cWithout this teaching, Northwood Apartments will end up run down, which will in turn lower the value of our property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">\u201cIf this project has to be built, I feel there must be a better location further away from this area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-11\">\u201cNorthland is a residential area which represented to us eight years ago when we bought our home as a place where our neighbors would have ideas, ambitions and would be of an economic level comparable to ours. I feel that this area should be allowed to continue to represent the above qualities and attract people regardless of race, religion or creed who feel these are attributes necessary for raising their families. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-12\">\u201cI feel certain the residents of Northland are not opposed to the normal processes of integration, but to thrust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>two hundred families (many of whom would possess undesirable qualities) upon a refined and well kept neighborhood is highly objectionable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-3\">\u201cShouldn\u2019t these apartments be built to replace the blight on the south side of the city, where better housing is what the Federal Government has in mind when lending money for better housing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\">\u201cPlease do what you can to keep our section of Lima a safe and respectful place to live.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">\u201cWe are not against the project in itself \u2014 but against what our neighborhood will be in a year\u2019s time, if this follows the trend as it has in other cities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">\u201cWe were completely satisfied and proud of our community until we heard of this project and now feel that we may be forced to move and lose money on our investment which we worked so hard to achieve. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">\u201cThe transplanting of the poor and needy does not help them, because they can\u2019t afford to live where they are put. They have to be in the low income class to live in them, roughly $50-$55 a week income. Take % of that for rent which they have to pay leaves them with about $40.00. Anyone that has 3-4-5 or more children knows that you can\u2019t pay utilities, feed, clothe, and send the children to school with that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">\u201cIf this is completed it will be a slum within a couple of years and why should we suffer loss for it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">\u201cAttorney Dickason also says Cogen will retain control and have complete say over who could rent the apartments. This is a complete falsehood. If the government says he has to rent to a certain amount of green men with purple wives he\u2019s going to have to find that number of green men or the government won\u2019t subsidize his project.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>\u201cI think the people of Northland should be given first consideration. We are here, we are established, we have a big investment in this part of Lima. Everything that most of us have is at stake. We have worked long and hard for what we have and the only uncertainties in our area can mostly be handled by our own Northland Neighborhood Association.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-4\">\u201cMany elderly people have settled here as their last stop. They will not financially be able to make another move. I have six neighbors living around me in this category.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">\u201cI hate to see something like this come in and degrade us. Northland and Northlea is a quiet and respectable development and if this comes in I would be afraid to even leave my children outside Day or Night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">\u201cPlease don\u2019t think I\u2019m hard hearted and do not want to help people. That is not true but as I said before I have worked and have helped my family get what we have and I don\u2019t believe in just handing something over to somebody. I think they should have to put some sweat and respect into what they have.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">\u201cAnyone using fundamental logic can easily see that this development would be detrimental to our property values and burden our school system beyond recovery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">\u201cI bought in this vicinity because I did not wish to live in a low rent district. And I think Mr. Cogen is wrong in his views.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">\u201cWe are personally opposed to these apartments for the possible re-occurrence of sewer problems of which we just recently rid ourselvs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">\u201cThey will only be a disaster to our schools, to our playgrounds, which already are inadequate, and also will lower the resale value of real estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>\u201cIt is not realistic to believe that rent supplement units would even allow the present dwellings to hold at their present value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-3\">\u201cI also think it will create a greater social problem than it is trying to correct. At this time there is very much a feeling of ill will, in the Northland area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\">\u201cIf this Apartment goes through, the valuation of Northland property will drop 40% in valuation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">\u201cWe are not especially against the project, but against it being erected in this location. We have been told by the Planning Commissioner that the area north of Robb Avenue has been doing a lot of face lifting since Northlea and Northland have been constructed. In other words, our section of Lima has been upgrading itself, while other sections are depreciating in value. Since this obviously is a slum clearance project, why can it not be erected where it is needed most instead of the site in question?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">\u201cBeing a property owner adjacent to the development we do not feel guilty in voicing our objections.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">\u201cWhy are real estate agents advising people not to buy in Northland? We live close to where it is to go up and frankly <em>I am frightened </em>about it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">\u201cI am very much against Mr. Cogen receiving tax dollars to supplement the rent. I think $130.00 a month for a one bedroom apt. is terrible. What would he get for the 2-3-4 bedrooms? I would be willing for taxes to go up to help for food and clothing but not to make a landlord rich.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">\u201cI certainly hope they can build it where the people are now and <em>keep the children in their own school </em>district.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>\u201cWe intend to <em>go </em>along with any measures necessary, legal or otherwise to halt this project.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\">\u201cWe know that police protection to take care of this large influx of people who brag that they will not be controlled by laws they dislike (this from a direct statement of an officer to me personally) cannot be provided by the City of Lima.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">\u201cNorthland in general is a fine place to live: it\u2019s clean, well maintained, and the people that live there (I believe) represent a cross-section of America\u2019s finest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">\u201cI certainly hope you gentlemen will exercise your proven good judgment and recommend a site where it can successfully achieve the purpose for which it is intended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">\u201cIt should be further noted that those who work with the type of people in these income brackets (such as the Salvation Army) say that to pull them from their element tends to frustrate rather than to make them happy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">\u201cThe builder of this area promised the buyers that a recreation area would be built for their children, so far this has not been done. This would be a benefit and asset to our community.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">\u201cSomehow we feel that the complex will not attract the quality of citizenry which will be commensurate with the existing neighbors in this neighborhood.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">Note: These letters illustrate, I believe, that several great misconceptions are widespread, viz.:</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">(1) That this is a low rent government housing project.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">(2) That it means an extraordinary influx of Negro families with numerous children.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">(3) That it means nearly every tenant will be receiving a rent supplement, and</p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">(4) That the management will lose <em>all </em>control to H. IT.

Plaintiff and her escort, negroes, were not permitted to remain seated in the center section of a theater because of their color. In a suit against the theater for the penalty a jury ignored the court\u2019s charge as to the law and returned a verdict for the defendants. On appeal, the court found that the jury <em>did not comprehend </em>the trial judge\u2019s correct charge as to the law. Ordinary knowledge of our legal procedure tells us the case must have been about one year old, at least, when it reached the appellate court, at appellant\u2019s expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">In opinion, at pp 515, 516, Judge Louis T. Parr, a former Common Pleas Judge of Columbiana County said, \u201cWhat are the circumstances of this case? Here was this young theological student and his lady, both persons of good character. Was there any reason why they should be discriminated against? Is it not true that under the provisions of the foregoing sections of the statute they <em>were </em>discriminated against? To hold otherwise, would be to render these sections as sounding brass. Said sections were passed by our Legislature not for an imaginary, but a real purpose. A little more consideration, a little more willing obedience to these laws, on the part of the people of the white race might render some of the problems which have arisen a little less perplexing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">But the only remedy the Court of Appeals could grant was a new jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">Nor is the court unmindful of ancient cases such as <em>Polly Gray </em>v. <em>State of Ohio </em>(1831), 4 Ohio 853. She was indicted for robbery. The only witness against her was a negro. The trial court permitted him to testify and she was convicted. A statute then provided that the testimony of blacks and mulattoes could not be admitted where white persons were a party. It was conceded that Polly was not pure white. The Supreme Court of Ohio in concluding the case said,</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">\u201c* <em>* * </em>We believe a man, of a race nearer white than a mulatto is admissible as a witness, and should partake in the privileges of whites.</p>\n<p id=\"Axm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\u201cWe are of opinion that a party of such a blood is entitled to the privileges of whites, partly because we are unwilling to extend the disabilities of the statute further than its letter requires, and partly from the difficulty of defining and of ascertaining the degree of duskiness which renders a person liable to such disabilities.\u201d Consequently the testimony against Polly was incompetent and her conviction reversed. The court\u2019s syllabus succinctly reads, \u201cA negro is not an admissible witness, against a quarteroon, on trial charged with a crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Auq\">And that in 1851, in constitutional convention, it was seriously proposed that the new Ohio Constitution include a provision reading, \u201cAnd the General Assembly shall, by law, prohibit black or mulatto persons from emigrating into, or becoming residents within the limits of this state.\u201d Ohio Convention Debates, 1851-1852, Vol. 2, page 598.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b257-4\"> Special difficulties which Negroes have encountered in respect to housing are discussed in \u201cThe American Negro Reference Book,\u201d editor John P.

L. J. (Pa.) 305. Here the owner of \u201cGreen Garden Terrace\u201d subdivision of building lots created restrictions by deed applicable to the sale of all lots, not only as to the first sale of each lot but to every transfer of title thereafter. The common covenant was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABQ\">\u201cIt is further agreed that the grantees, their heirs or assigns shall not sell, lease or convey the property herein described to any person of Polish, Italian, Austrian, Russian, Hungarian, Slavish or Negro descent, or to any other person or persons whose reputation is such as would not be desired in a first class residence section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Lot No. 1, Block No. 1 in this subdivision was first sold by the developer Butt in 1915 to Pease; in 1916, Pease sold to Mertens, and later in the same year Mertens sold to Ellsworth; in 1917, Ellsworth sold to Hanson; in 1920, Hansen sold to Stewart (all of which transfers occurred without complaint). In 1926, Stewart sold to Cosimo and Angiolina Surgo, husband and wife, who were concededly of Italian descent. Thereupon Ellsworth and other owners of lots with homes erected in \u201cGreen Garden Terrace\u201d brought a bill in equity in the Common Pleas Court of Erie County, Pennsylvania, praying (1) that the deed to the Surgos be declared null and void; (2) for an injunction restraining the Surgos from acquiring any title to the lot; (3) for an injunction restraining the Stewarts from conveying the lot to the Surgos or any other persons coming within the language of the restrictions; and (4) any other proper relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The court dismissed the bill, finding the restriction to be upon alienation rather than a reasonable restriction concerning use and occupancy, and that the right of alienation is an inherent and inseparable quality of a common law estate in fee simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Another problem suggested itself because, following the restrictive language quoted above, each deed contained these words: \u201cIn the event of such sale, lease or transfer being made, said property shall revert to the grantor, Daniel E. Butt, his heirs and assigns.\u201d The court found it need not in this case decide concerning the effect of these words, as neither Butt, nor any of his heirs were among the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b281-5\"> As examples of this rule, see:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\"><em>Hersha </em>v. <em>Brenneman </em>(1820), Pa., 6, S &amp; R 2, 4 holding guardian had right to exercise right of parents who predeceased testator in favor of his children, although the statute made no such provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\"><em>White </em>v. <em>Carpenter </em>(1830), N.

Also, that when it appears that the effect of such law, regulation, or practice is to foster actual racial discrimination, a heavy burden of positively showing that it does not is placed upon the official or officials concerned.
