L. 938. The excuse given by the defendant for not filing it was that the justice promised to mail it to him, but did not do so. The defendant testified that he did not receive the transcript, while the justice and his clerk testified to the effect that the transcript was properly signed, sealed, and mailed to the defendant on October 14, in an envelope bearing the request that it be returned to the justice\u2019s address, which was given, if not delivered, and that it was never returned. Upon this state of proofs the court would have been justified in finding that the defendant\u2019s allegation, that the justice had not kept his promise, was not sustained by the weight of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">But assuming for a moment that the justice did not keep his promise, this was not the neglect of anything that pertained to the official duty of justices of the peace, but was like the failure of a justice to fulfill his promise to file the transcript, or his promise to deliver it to the appellant\u2019s attorney for filing, each of which excuses has been held insufficient to justify the court in sustaining an appeal entered after the rethrn day: Houk v. Knop, 2 Watts, 72; Sherwood v. McKinney, 5 Wharton, 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Moreover, even if the defendant could be excused for relying for a reasonable time upon the promise of the justice, he was not justified in waiting indefinitely, and, as already seen, he had ample time before the return day within which to appear personally and demand the transcript, and was negligent in not doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">In either view that may be taken of the case the court was right in discharging the rule to show cause why the. transcript should not be filed nunc pro tunc.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Order affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
