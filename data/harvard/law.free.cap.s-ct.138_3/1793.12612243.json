In fact, some of the new evidence may bolster that determination. But whether the defendant poses a risk of future dangerousness is not the only inquiry a jury considering death must undertake. Having found future dangerousness, a jury still must consider whether \"there is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances to warrant that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole rather than a death sentence be imposed,\" in light of variables such as the \"circumstances of the offense, the defendant's character and background, and the personal moral culpability of the defendant.\" \u00a7 2(e)(1). In that inquiry, as the Court in\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    stated, \"[m]itigating evidence unrelated to dangerousness may alter the jury's selection of penalty, even if it does not undermine or rebut the prosecution's death-eligibility case.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508607\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/362/#p398\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508607\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/362/#p398\">\n     at 398\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508607\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/362/#p398\">\n     120 S.Ct. 1495\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Had the Fifth Circuit majority undertaken a full inquiry, it is unlikely that the new aggravating evidence would have factored substantially into the jury's mitigation decision, as much of the new aggravating evidence \"was merely cumulative\" of the evidence presented at trial.\n    <em>\n     Wong,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638982\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/15/\">\n     558 U.S., at 22\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638982\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/15/\">\n     130 S.Ct. 383\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The jury already knew, for example, that Trevino was a member of a street gang and a violent prison gang. The allegations that Trevino assaulted his former girlfriend, although serious, reflected his violent tendencies and were hardly new character-and-background information for a jury that had just convicted Trevino of capital murder. The fact that one expert testified that Trevino's FASD \" 'would not have significantly interfered with his ability to know right from wrong, or to appreciate the nature and quality of his actions at the time of the capital offense,' \"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276184\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/545/#p551\">\n     861 F.3d, at 549\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , cannot be considered new aggravating evidence given that \"Trevino did not assert an insanity defense and the same jury had already found him guilty of the offense,\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276184\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/545/#p551\">\n      id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276184\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/545/#p551\">\n     at 556\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Dennis, J., dissenting).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    In contrast, the new mitigating evidence relating to FASD is completely different in kind from any other evidence that the jury heard about Trevino. At sentencing, the testimony of Trevino's aunt did not in any sense touch on Trevino's FASD or its implications for his cognitive development.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    Had the jury learned of the FASD and related testimony, it would have had a much fuller perspective of his character and background. For example, the jurors learned that Trevino dropped out of school early, but they had no idea that his disorder\n    affected his academic functioning, including his problem-solving skills, memory, and reading ability, or that his achievement of basic childhood milestones like potty training had been so severely delayed. As in\n    <em>\n     Williams,\n    </em>\n    where the jury had not learned that the petitioner was \" 'borderline mentally retarded,' \"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508607\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/362/#p398\">\n     529 U.S., at 398\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508607\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/362/#p398\">\n     120 S.Ct. 1495\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , the jurors here did not know that Trevino's \" 'daily functioning skills are essentially at a level that might be expected from an individual who was diagnosed with an intellectual disability.' \"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276184\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/545/#p551\">\n     861 F.3d, at 550\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The jurors heard that Trevino was a good father and often cared for his aunt's children, but they did not know of the childhood abuse and neglect that he overcame to learn to care for other children.

Yet, despite the lack of any other evidence at trial that dealt with Trevino's lifelong cognitive disorder, the Fifth Circuit majority discounted the new evidence in its entirety under its double-edged theory, without considering its potential effect on a jury's \"appraisal of [Trevino's] moral culpability.\"\n    <em>\n     Williams,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508607\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/362/#p398\">\n     529 U.S., at 398\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508607\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/362/#p398\">\n     120 S.Ct. 1495\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The Fifth Circuit majority's error is glaring, because considering all of the evidence, including that relating to Trevino's FASD, it is obvious that \"there is a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance.\"\n    <em>\n     Wiggins,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898384\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/510/#p534\">\n     539 U.S., at 537\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898384\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/510/#p534\">\n     123 S.Ct. 2527\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    III\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The Fifth Circuit majority plainly misapplied our precedents. Absent intervention from this Court to correct that error, Trevino remains subject to a death sentence having received inadequate consideration of his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, and with no jury having fairly appraised the substantial new mitigating evidence that a competent counsel would have discovered. That result is indefensible, especially where our failure to intervene sanctions the taking of a life by the state.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    I therefore respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-51\">\n     If at least one juror decides either of those two issues in the negative, the court must impose a life sentence regardless of the effect of mitigating circumstances.
