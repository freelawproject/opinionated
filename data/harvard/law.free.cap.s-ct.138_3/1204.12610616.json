The question in this case is whether a similarly worded clause in a statute's definition of \"crime of violence\" suffers from the same constitutional defect. Adhering to our analysis in\n   <em>\n    Johnson,\n   </em>\n   we hold that it does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) renders deportable any alien convicted of an \"aggravated felony\" after entering the United States.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii). Such an alien is also ineligible for cancellation of removal, a form of discretionary relief allowing some deportable aliens to remain in the country. See \u00a7\u00a7 1229b(a)(3), (b)(1)(C). Accordingly,\n   removal is a virtual certainty for an alien found to have an aggravated felony conviction, no matter how long he has previously resided here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The INA defines \"aggravated felony\" by listing numerous offenses and types of offenses, often with cross-references to federal criminal statutes. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) ; see\n   <em>\n    Luna\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Torres v.

A native of the Philippines, Dimaya has resided lawfully in the United States since 1992. But he has not always acted lawfully during that time. Twice, Dimaya was convicted of first-degree burglary under California law. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 459, 460(a). Following his second offense, the Government initiated a removal proceeding against him. Both an Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals held that California first-degree burglary is a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 16(b). \"[B]y its nature,\" the Board reasoned, the offense \"carries a substantial risk of the use of force.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a. Dimaya sought review in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   While his appeal was pending, this Court held unconstitutional part of the definition of \"violent felony\" in the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). ACCA prescribes a 15-year\n   mandatory minimum sentence if a person convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm has three prior convictions for a \"violent felony.\" \u00a7 924(e)(1). The definition of that statutory term goes as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-20\">\n   \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives,\n   <em>\n    or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\n   </em>\n   \" \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The italicized portion of that definition (like the similar language of \u00a7 16(b) ) came to be known as the statute's residual clause. In\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States,\n   </em>\n   the Court declared that clause \"void for vagueness\" under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. 576 U.S., at --- ------,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 2561-2563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit held that \u00a7 16(b), as incorporated into the INA, was also unconstitutionally vague, and accordingly ruled in Dimaya's favor. See\n   <em>\n    Dimaya v. Lynch,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347586\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/1110/#p1120\">\n    803 F.3d 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1120 (2015).

And the doctrine guards against arbitrary or discriminatory law enforcement by insisting that a statute provide standards to govern the actions of police officers, prosecutors, juries, and judges. See\n   <em>\n    Kolender v.

See Brief for Petitioner 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   But this Court's precedent forecloses that argument, because we long ago held that the most exacting vagueness standard should apply in removal cases.

To salvage \u00a7 16's residual clause, even for use in immigration hearings, the Government must instead persuade us that it is materially clearer than its now-invalidated ACCA counterpart.

Its principal section begins as follows: \"Two features of [ACCA's] residual clause conspire to make it unconstitutionally vague.\" 576 U.S., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The opinion then identifies each of those features and explains how their joinder produced \"hopeless indeterminacy,\" inconsistent with due process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 2558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And with that reasoning,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   effectively resolved the case now before us. For \u00a7 16's residual clause has the same two features as ACCA's, combined in the same constitutionally problematic way. Consider those two, just as\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   described them:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"In the first place,\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   explained, ACCA's residual clause created \"grave uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a crime\" because it \"tie[d] the judicial assessment of risk\" to a hypothesis about the crime's \"ordinary case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The problem came from layering such a standard on top of the requisite \"ordinary case\" inquiry. As the Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-35\">\n   \"[W]e do not doubt the constitutionality of laws that call for the application of a qualitative standard such as 'substantial risk' to real-world conduct; the law is full of instances where a man's fate depends on his estimating rightly ... some matter of degree[.] The residual clause, however, requires application of the 'serious potential risk' standard to an idealized ordinary case of the crime. Because the elements necessary to determine the imaginary ideal are uncertain[,] this abstract inquiry offers significantly less predictability than one that deals with the actual ... facts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 2561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (some internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   So much less predictability, in fact, that ACCA's residual clause could not pass constitutional muster. As the Court again put the point, in the punch line of its decision: \"By combining indeterminacy about how to measure the risk posed by a crime with indeterminacy about how much risk it takes for the crime to qualify as a violent felony, the residual clause\" violates the guarantee of due process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 2558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Section 16's residual clause violates that promise in just the same way. To begin where\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   did, \u00a7 16(b) also calls for a court to identify a crime's \"ordinary case\" in order to measure the crime's risk. The Government explicitly acknowledges that point here. See Brief for Petitioner 11 (\" Section 16(b), like [ACCA's] residual clause, requires a court to assess the risk posed by the ordinary case of a particular offense\"). And indeed, the Government's briefing in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   warned us about that likeness, observing that \u00a7 16(b) would be \"equally susceptible to [an] objection\" that focused on the problems of positing a crime's ordinary case. Supp. Brief for Respondent, O.T. 2014, No. 13-7120, pp. 22-23. Nothing in \u00a7 16(b) helps courts to perform that task, just as nothing in ACCA did. We can as well repeat here what we asked in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   : How does one go about divining the conduct entailed in a crime's ordinary case? Statistical analyses? Surveys? Experts? Google? Gut instinct? See\n   <em>\n    Johnson,\n   </em>\n   576 U.S., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2557 ;\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1213 - 1214;\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1231 - 1232 (GORSUCH, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). And we can as well reiterate\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's example: In the ordinary case of attempted burglary, is the would-be culprit spotted and confronted, or scared off by a yell? See\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1231 - 1232 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.) (offering other knotty examples). Once again, the questions have no good answers; the \"ordinary case\" remains, as\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   described it, an excessively \"speculative,\" essentially inscrutable thing. 576 U.S., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2558 ; accord\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1256 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   And \u00a7 16(b) also possesses the second fatal feature of ACCA's residual clause: uncertainty about the level of risk that makes a crime \"violent.\" In ACCA, that threshold was \"serious potential risk\"; in \u00a7 16(b), it is \"substantial risk.\" See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1211, 1212. But the Government does not argue that the latter formulation is any more determinate than the former, and for good reason. As THE CHIEF JUSTICE's valiant attempt to do so shows, that would be slicing the baloney mighty thin. See\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1244 - 1245 (dissenting opinion). And indeed,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   as much as equated the two phrases: Return to the block quote above, and note how\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   -as though anticipating this case-refers to them interchangeably, as alike examples of imprecise \"qualitative standard[s].\" See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1214; 576 U.S., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 2561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Once again, the point is not that such a non-numeric standard is alone problematic: In\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's words, \"we do not doubt\" the constitutionality of applying \u00a7 16(b)'s \"substantial risk [standard] to real-world conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 2561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). The difficulty comes, in \u00a7 16's residual clause\n   just as in ACCA's, from applying such a standard to \"a judge-imagined abstraction\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   \"an idealized ordinary case of the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 2558, 2561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Justice THOMAS accepts that the ordinary-case inquiry makes \u00a7 16(b)\"impossible to apply.\"\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1256. His solution is to overthrow our historic understanding of the statute: We should now read \u00a7 16(b), he says, to ask about the risk posed by a particular defendant's particular conduct. In contrast, the Government, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, accepts that \u00a7 16(b), as long interpreted, demands a categorical approach, rather than a case-specific one. They argue only that \"distinctive textual features\" of \u00a7 16's residual clause make applying it \"more predictable\" than its ACCA counterpart. Brief for Petitioner 28, 29. We disagree with both arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The essentials of Justice THOMAS's position go as follows. Section 16(b), he says, cannot have one meaning, but could have one of two others. See\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1256. The provision cannot demand an inquiry merely into the elements of a crime, because that is the province of \u00a7 16(a). See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1211 (setting out \u00a7 16(a)'s text). But that still leaves a pair of options: the categorical, ordinary-case approach and the \"underlying-conduct approach,\" which asks about the specific way in which a defendant committed a crime.\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1255. According to Justice THOMAS, each option is textually viable (although he gives a slight nod to the latter based on \u00a7 16(b)'s use of the word \"involves\"). See\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1254 - 1256. What tips the scales is that only one-the conduct approach-is at all \"workable.\"\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1256. The difficulties of the ordinary-case inquiry, Justice THOMAS rightly observes, underlie this Court's view that \u00a7 16(b) is too vague. So abandon that inquiry, Justice THOMAS urges. After all, he reasons, it is the Court's \"plain duty,\" under the constitutional avoidance canon, to adopt any reasonable construction of a statute that escapes constitutional problems.\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1256 - 1257 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

To begin where\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   did, the Government once again \"has not asked us to abandon the categorical approach in residual-clause cases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To the contrary, and as already noted, the Government has conceded at every step the correctness of that statutory construction. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1214 - 1215. And this time, the Government's decision is even more noteworthy than before-precisely because the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   dissent laid out the opposite view, presenting it in prepackaged form for the Government to take off the shelf and use in the \u00a7 16(b) context. Of course, we are not foreclosed from going down Justice THOMAS's path just because the Government has not done so. But we find it significant that the Government cannot bring itself to say that the fact-based approach Justice THOMAS proposes is a tenable interpretation of \u00a7 16's residual clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Perhaps one reason for the Government's reluctance is that such an approach would generate its own constitutional questions. As Justice THOMAS relates,\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1253, 1256 - 1257, this Court adopted the categorical approach in part to \"avoid[ ] the Sixth Amendment concerns that would arise from sentencing courts' making findings of fact that properly belong to juries.\"\n   <em>\n    Descamps v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/#p267\">\n    570 U.S. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 267,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/#p267\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/#p267\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). Justice THOMAS thinks that issue need not detain us here because \"the right of trial by jury ha[s] no application in a removal proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1256 - 1257 (internal quotation marks omitted). But although this particular case involves removal, \u00a7 16(b) is a criminal statute, with criminal sentencing consequences. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1211. And this Court has held (it could hardly have done otherwise) that \"we must interpret the statute consistently, whether we encounter its application in a criminal or noncriminal context.\"\n   <em>\n    Leocal,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n    543 U.S., at 12, n. 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n    125 S.Ct. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So Justice THOMAS's suggestion would merely ping-pong us from one constitutional issue to another. And that means the avoidance canon cannot serve, as he would like, as the interpretive tie breaker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In any event, \u00a7 16(b)'s text creates no draw: Best read, it demands a categorical approach.

And the words \"by its nature\" in \u00a7 16(b) make that meaning all the clearer. The statute, recall, directs courts to consider whether an offense,\n   <em>\n    by its nature,\n   </em>\n   poses the requisite risk of force. An offense's \"nature\" means its \"normal and characteristic quality.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1507 (2002). So \u00a7 16(b) tells courts to figure out what an offense normally-or, as we have repeatedly\n   said, \"ordinarily\"-entails, not what happened to occur on one occasion. And the same conclusion follows if we pay attention to language that is\n   <em>\n    missing\n   </em>\n   from \u00a7 16(b). As we have observed in the ACCA context, the absence of terms alluding to a crime's circumstances, or its commission, makes a fact-based interpretation an uncomfortable fit.

According to Justice THOMAS, we need not worry here because immigration judges have some special factfinding talent, or at least experience, that would mitigate the risk of error attaching to that endeavor in federal courts. See\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1257 - 1258. But we cannot see putting so much weight on the superior factfinding prowess of (notoriously overburdened) immigration judges. And as we have said before, \u00a7 16(b) is a criminal statute with applications outside the immigration context. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1211, 1217. Once again, then, we have no ground for discovering a novel interpretation of \u00a7 16(b) that would remove us from the dictates of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Agreeing that is so, the Government (joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE) takes a narrower path to the same desired result. It points to three textual discrepancies between ACCA's residual clause and \u00a7 16(b), and argues that they make \u00a7 16(b) significantly easier to apply. But each turns out to be the proverbial distinction without a difference. None relates to the pair of features-the ordinary-case inquiry and a hazy risk threshold-that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   found to produce impermissible vagueness. And none otherwise affects the determinacy of the statutory inquiry into whether a prior conviction is for a violent crime. That is why, contrary to the Government's final argument, the experience of applying\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   statutes has generated confusion and division among lower courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Government first-and foremost-relies on \u00a7 16(b)'s express requirement\n   (absent from ACCA) that the risk arise from acts taken \"in the course of committing the offense.\" Brief for Petitioner 31. (THE CHIEF JUSTICE's dissent echoes much of this argument. See\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1236 - 1237.) Because of that \"temporal restriction,\" a court applying \u00a7 16(b) may not \"consider risks arising\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   \" the offense's commission is over.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   In the Government's view, \u00a7 16(b)'s text thereby demands a \"significantly more focused inquiry\" than did ACCA's residual clause.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   To assess that claim, start with the meaning of \u00a7 16(b)'s \"in the course of\" language. That phrase, understood in the normal way, includes the conduct occurring throughout a crime's commission-not just the conduct sufficient to satisfy the offense's formal elements. The Government agrees with that construction, explaining that the words \"in the course of\" sweep in everything that happens while a crime continues. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 57-58 (Oct. 2, 2017) (illustrating that idea with reference to conspiracy, burglary, kidnapping, and escape from prison). So, for example, conspiracy may be a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b) because of the risk of force while the conspiracy is ongoing (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   \"in the course of\" the conspiracy); it is irrelevant that conspiracy's elements are met as soon as the participants have made an agreement. See\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    United States v. Doe,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416702\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/49/859/#p866\">\n    49 F.3d 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 866 (C.A.2 1995). Similarly, and closer to home, burglary may be a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b) because of the prospects of an encounter while the burglar remains in a building (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   \"in the course of\" the burglary); it does not matter that the elements of the crime are met at the precise moment of his entry. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 57-58 (Oct. 2, 2017);\n   <em>\n    James,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/#p208\">\n    550 U.S., at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/#p208\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, a court applying \u00a7 16(b) gets to consider everything that is likely to take place for as long as a crime is being committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Because that is so, \u00a7 16(b)'s \"in the course of\" language does little to narrow or focus the statutory inquiry. All that the phrase excludes is a court's ability to consider the risk that force will be used after the crime has entirely concluded-so, for example, after the conspiracy has dissolved or the burglar has left the building. We can construct law-school-type hypotheticals fitting that fact pattern-say, a burglar who constructs a booby trap that later knocks out the homeowner. But such imaginative forays cannot realistically affect a court's view of the\n   <em>\n    ordinary case\n   </em>\n   of a crime, which is all that matters under the statute. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1211 - 1212, 1213 - 1214. In the ordinary case, the riskiness of a crime arises from events occurring during its commission, not events occurring later. So with or without \u00a7 16(b)'s explicit temporal language, a court applying the section would do the same thing-ask what usually happens when a crime goes down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   And that is just what courts did when applying ACCA's residual clause-and for the same reason. True, that clause lacked an express temporal limit. But not a single one of this Court's ACCA decisions turned on conduct that might occur after a crime's commission; instead, each hinged on the risk arising from events that could happen while the crime was ongoing. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sykes v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335985,12450132\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/1/\">\n    564 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335985,12450132\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/1/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335985,12450132\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/1/\">\n    180 L.Ed.2d 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (assessing the risks attached to the \"confrontations that initiate and terminate\" vehicle flight, along with \"intervening\" events);\n   <em>\n    Chambers v.

Nor could those decisions have done otherwise,\n   given the statute's concern with the ordinary (rather than the outlandish) case. Once again, the riskiness of a crime in the ordinary case depends on the acts taken during-not after-its commission. Thus, the analyses under ACCA's residual clause and \u00a7 16(b) coincide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The upshot is that the phrase \"in the course of\" makes no difference as to either outcome or clarity. Every offense that could have fallen within ACCA's residual clause might equally fall within \u00a7 16(b). And the difficulty of deciding whether it does so remains just as intractable. Indeed, we cannot think of a single federal crime whose treatment becomes more obvious under \u00a7 16(b) than under ACCA because of the words \"in the course of.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The phrase, then, cannot cure the statutory indeterminacy\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   described.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, the Government (and again, THE CHIEF JUSTICE's dissent, see\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1244 - 1245) observes that \u00a7 16(b) focuses on the risk of \"physical force\" whereas ACCA's residual clause asked about the risk of \"physical injury.\" The \u00a7 16(b) inquiry, the Government says, \"trains solely\" on the conduct typically involved in a crime. Brief for Petitioner 36. By contrast, the Government continues, ACCA's residual clause required a second inquiry: After describing the ordinary criminal's conduct, a court had to \"speculate about a chain of causation that could possibly result in a victim's injury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679441\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/122/#p128\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Government's conclusion is that the \u00a7 16(b) inquiry is \"more specific.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679441\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/122/#p128\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   But once more, we struggle to see how that statutory distinction would matter. To begin with, the first of the Government's two steps-defining the conduct in the ordinary case-is almost always the difficult part. Once that is accomplished, the assessment of consequences tends to follow as a matter of course. So, for example, if a crime is likely enough to lead to a shooting, it will also be likely enough to lead to an injury. And still more important, \u00a7 16(b) involves two steps as well-and essentially the same ones. In interpreting statutes like \u00a7 16(b), this Court has made clear that \"physical force\" means \"force capable of causing physical pain or injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    559 U.S. 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1265/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1265/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (defining the term for purposes of deciding what counts as a \"violent\" crime). So under \u00a7 16(b) too, a court must not\n   only identify the conduct typically involved in a crime, but also gauge its potential consequences. Or said a bit differently, evaluating the risk of \"physical force\" itself entails considering the risk of \"physical injury.\" For those reasons, the force/injury distinction is unlikely to affect a court's analysis of whether a crime qualifies as violent. All the same crimes might-or, then again, might not-satisfy both requirements. Accordingly, this variance in wording cannot make ACCA's residual clause vague and \u00a7 16(b) not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Third, the Government briefly notes that \u00a7 16(b), unlike ACCA's residual clause, is not preceded by a \"confusing list of exemplar crimes.\" Brief for Petitioner 38. (THE CHIEF JUSTICE's dissent reiterates this argument, with some additional references to our caselaw. See\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1246 - 1248.) Here, the Government is referring to the offenses ACCA designated as violent felonies independently of the residual clause (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   burglary, arson, extortion, and use of explosives). See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1212. According to the Government, those crimes provided \"contradictory and opaque indications\" of what non-specified offenses should also count as violent. Brief for Petitioner 38. Because \u00a7 16(b) lacks any such enumerated crimes, the Government concludes, it avoids the vagueness of ACCA's residual clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We readily accept a part of that argument. This Court for several years looked to ACCA's listed crimes for help in giving the residual clause meaning. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Begay v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674072\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/137/#p142\">\n    553 U.S. 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 142,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674072\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/137/#p142\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674072\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/137/#p142\">\n    170 L.Ed.2d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) ;\n   <em>\n    James,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/#p208\">\n    550 U.S., at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/#p208\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But to no avail. As the Government relates (and\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   explained), the enumerated crimes were themselves too varied to provide such assistance. See Brief for Petitioner 38-40; 576 U.S., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 2561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Trying to reconcile them with each other, and then compare them to whatever unlisted crime was at issue, drove many a judge a little batty. And more to the point, the endeavor failed to bring any certainty to the residual clause's application. See Brief for Petitioner 38-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   But the Government's conclusion does not follow. To say that ACCA's listed crimes failed to resolve the residual clause's vagueness is hardly to say they caused the problem. Had they done so,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   would not have needed to strike down the clause. It could simply have instructed courts to give up on trying to interpret the clause by reference to the enumerated offenses. (Contrary to THE CHIEF JUSTICE's suggestion, see\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1247 - 1248, discarding an interpretive tool once it is found not to actually aid in interpretation hardly \"expand[s]\" the scope of a statute.) That\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   went so much further-invalidating a statutory provision rather than construing it independently of another-demonstrates that the list of crimes was not the culprit. And indeed,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   explicitly said as much. As described earlier,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   found the residual clause's vagueness to reside in just \"two\" of its features: the ordinary-case requirement and a fuzzy risk standard. See 576 U.S., at ---------,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2557-2558 ;\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1213 - 1214. Strip away the enumerated crimes-as Congress did in \u00a7 16(b) -and those dual flaws yet remain. And ditto the textual indeterminacy that flows from them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Faced with the two clauses' linguistic similarity, the Government relies significantly on an argument rooted in judicial experience. Our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the Government notes, spoke of the longstanding \"trouble\" that this Court and others had in \"making sense of [ACCA's] residual clause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   576 U.S., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2559-2560 ; see Brief for Petitioner 45. According to the Government, \u00a7 16(b) has not produced \"comparable difficulties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 46. Lower courts, the Government claims, have divided less often about the provision's meaning, and as a result this Court granted certiorari on \"only a single Section 16(b) case\" before this one.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The most likely explanation,\" the Government concludes, is that \" Section 16(b) is clearer\" than its ACCA counterpart.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   But in fact, a host of issues respecting \u00a7 16(b)'s application to specific crimes divide the federal appellate courts. Does car burglary qualify as a violent felony under \u00a7 16(b) ? Some courts say yes, another says no.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   What of statutory rape? Once again, the Circuits part ways.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   How about evading arrest? The decisions point in different directions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Residential trespass? The same is true.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those examples do not exhaust the current catalogue of Circuit conflicts concerning \u00a7 16(b)'s application. See Brief for National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild et al. as\n   <em>\n    Amici Curiae\n   </em>\n   7-18 (citing divided appellate decisions as to the unauthorized use of a vehicle, firearms possession, and abduction). And that roster would just expand with time, mainly because, as\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   explained, precious few crimes (of the thousands that fill the statute books) have an obvious, non-speculative-and therefore undisputed-\"ordinary case.\" See 576 U.S., at ---------,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct., at 2557-2558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Nor does this Court's prior handling of \u00a7 16(b) cases support the Government's argument. To be sure, we have heard oral argument in only two cases arising from \u00a7 16(b) (including this one), as compared with five involving ACCA's residual clause (including\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   But while some of\n   those ACCA suits were pending before us, we received a number of petitions for certiorari presenting related issues in the \u00a7 16(b) context. And after issuing the relevant ACCA decisions, we vacated the judgments in those \u00a7 16(b) cases and remanded them for further consideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   That we disposed of the ACCA and \u00a7 16(b) petitions in that order, rather than its opposite, provides no reason to disregard the indeterminacy that \u00a7 16(b) shares with ACCA's residual clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   And of course, this Court's experience in deciding ACCA cases only supports the conclusion that \u00a7 16(b) is too vague. For that record reveals that a statute with all the same hallmarks as \u00a7 16(b) could not be applied with the predictability the Constitution demands.

The Government would condemn us to repeat the past-to rerun the old ACCA tape, as though we remembered nothing from its first showing. But why should we disregard a lesson so hard learned? \"Insanity,\" Justice Scalia wrote in the last ACCA residual clause case before\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , \"is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.\"\n   <em>\n    Sykes,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335985,12450132\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/1/\">\n    564 U.S., at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335985,12450132\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/1/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dissenting opinion).

Section 16(b) possesses the exact same two features. And none of the minor linguistic disparities in the statutes makes any real difference.

That is just wrong: When a criminal shoots a gun, he does so while (\"in the course of \") possessing it (except perhaps in some physics-defying fantasy world).

Before the Revolution, the crime of treason in English law was so capaciously construed that the mere expression of disfavored opinions could invite transportation or death. The founders cited the crown's abuse of \"pretended\" crimes like this as one of their reasons for revolution. See Declaration of Independence \u00b6 21. Today's vague laws may not be as invidious, but they can invite the exercise of arbitrary\n    power all the same-by leaving the people in the dark about what the law demands and allowing prosecutors and courts to make it up.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The law before us today is such a law. Before holding a lawful permanent resident alien like James Dimaya subject to removal for having committed a crime, the Immigration and Nationality Act requires a judge to determine that the ordinary case of the alien's crime of conviction involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used. But what does that mean? Just take the crime at issue in this case, California burglary, which applies to everyone from armed home intruders to door-to-door salesmen peddling shady products. How, on that vast spectrum, is anyone supposed to locate the ordinary case and say whether it includes a substantial risk of physical force? The truth is, no one knows. The law's silence leaves judges to their intuitions and the people to their fate. In my judgment, the Constitution demands more.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    I begin with a foundational question.

Because the residual clause in the statute now before us uses almost exactly the same language as the residual clause in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    , respect for precedent alone would seem to suggest that both clauses should suffer the same judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    But first in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    and now again today Justice THOMAS has questioned whether our vagueness doctrine can fairly claim roots in the Constitution as originally understood. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g., post,\n    </em>\n    at 1242 - 1245 (dissenting opinion);\n    <em>\n     Johnson, supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1226 - 1233 (opinion concurring in judgment) ( 576 U.S., at ---- - ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2566-2573 ). For its part, the Court has yet to offer a reply. I believe our colleague's challenge is a serious and thoughtful one that merits careful attention. At day's end, though, it is a challenge to which I find myself unable to subscribe. Respectfully, I am persuaded instead that void for vagueness doctrine, at least properly conceived, serves as a faithful expression of ancient due process and separation of powers principles the framers recognized as vital to ordered liberty under our Constitution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Consider first the doctrine's due process underpinnings. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee that \"life, liberty, or property\" may not be taken \"without due process of law.\" That means the government generally may not deprive a person of those rights without affording him the benefit of (at least) those \"customary procedures to which freemen were entitled by the old law of England.\"\n    <em>\n     Pacific Mut.

Admittedly, some have suggested that the Due Process Clause does less work than this, allowing the government to deprive people of their liberty through whatever procedures (or lack of them) the government's current laws may tolerate.\n    <em>\n     Post,\n    </em>\n    at 1243, n. 1 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (collecting authorities). But in my view the weight of the historical evidence shows that the clause sought to ensure that the people's rights are never any less secure against governmental invasion than they were at common law. Lord Coke took this view of the English due process guarantee. 1 E. Coke, The Second Part of the Institutes of\n    the Laws of England 50 (1797). John Rutledge, our second Chief Justice, explained that Coke's teachings were carefully studied and widely adopted by the framers, becoming \" 'almost the foundations of our law.' \"\n    <em>\n     Klopfer v.

Many of the Constitution's other provisions presuppose and depend on the existence of reasonably clear laws. Take the Fourth Amendment's requirement that arrest warrants must be supported by probable cause, and consider what would be left of that requirement if the alleged crime had no meaningful boundaries. Or take the Sixth Amendment's mandate that a defendant must be informed of the accusations against him and allowed to bring witnesses in his defense, and consider what use those rights would be if the charged crime was so vague the defendant couldn't tell what he's alleged to have done and what sort of witnesses he might need to rebut that charge. Without an assurance that the laws supply fair notice, so much else of the Constitution risks becoming only a \"parchment barrie[r]\" against arbitrary power. The Federalist No. 48, p. 308 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Although today's vagueness doctrine owes much to the guarantee of fair notice embodied in the Due Process Clause, it would be a mistake to overlook the doctrine's equal debt to the separation of powers. The Constitution assigns \"[a]ll legislative Powers\" in our federal government to Congress. Art. I, \u00a7 1. It is for the people, through their elected representatives, to choose the rules that will govern their future conduct. See The Federalist No. 78, at 465 (A. Hamilton) (\"The legislature ... prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated\"). Meanwhile, the Constitution assigns to judges the \"judicial Power\" to decide \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\" Art. III, \u00a7 2. That power does not license judges to craft new laws to govern future conduct, but only to \"discer[n] the course prescribed by law\" as it currently exists and to \"follow it\" in resolving disputes between the people over past events.\n    <em>\n     Osborn v.

Nor is the worry only that vague laws risk allowing judges to\n    assume legislative power. Vague laws also threaten to transfer legislative power to police and prosecutors, leaving to them the job of shaping a vague statute's contours through their enforcement decisions. See\n    <em>\n     Grayned v.

Under the Constitution, the adoption of new laws restricting liberty is supposed to be a hard business, the product of an open and public debate among a large and diverse number of elected representatives. Allowing the legislature to hand off the job of lawmaking risks substituting this design for one where legislation is made easy, with a mere handful of unelected judges and prosecutors free to \"condem[n] all that [they] personally disapprove and for no better reason than [they] disapprove it.\"\n    <em>\n     Jordan, supra,\n    </em>\n    at 242,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1148002\" index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/341/223/#p229\">\n     71 S.Ct. 703\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Jackson, J., dissenting). Nor do judges and prosecutors act in the open and accountable forum of a legislature, but in the comparatively obscure confines of cases and controversies. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    A. Bickel, The Least Dangerous Branch: The Supreme Court at the Bar of Politics 151 (1962) (\"A vague statute delegates to administrators, prosecutors, juries, and judges the authority of\n    <em>\n     ad hoc\n    </em>\n    decision, which is in its nature difficult if not impossible to hold to account, because of its narrow impact\"). For just these reasons, Hamilton warned, while \"liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone,\" it has \"every thing to fear from\" the union of the judicial and legislative powers. The Federalist No. 78, at 466. No doubt, too, for reasons like these this Court has held \"that the\n    <em>\n     more important\n    </em>\n    aspect of vagueness doctrine 'is not actual notice, but ... the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement' \" and keep the separate branches within their proper spheres.\n    <em>\n     Kolender, supra,\n    </em>\n    at 358,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298570\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/352/#p357\">\n     103 S.Ct. 1855\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Goguen,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178884\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/566/#p575\">\n      supra,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178884\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/566/#p575\">\n     at 575\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178884\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/566/#p575\">\n     94 S.Ct. 1242\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added)).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Persuaded that vagueness doctrine enjoys a secure footing in the original understanding of the Constitution, the next question I confront concerns the standard of review. What degree of imprecision should this Court tolerate in a statute before declaring it unconstitutionally vague? For its part, the government argues that where (as here) a person faces only civil, not criminal, consequences from a statute's operation, we should declare the law unconstitutional only if it is \"unintelligible.\" But in the criminal context this Court has generally insisted that the law must afford \"ordinary people ... fair notice of the conduct it punishes.\"\n    <em>\n     Johnson,\n    </em>\n    576 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2557. And I cannot see how the Due Process Clause might often require any less than that in the civil context either. Fair notice of the law's demands, as we've seen, is \"the first essential of due process.\"\n    <em>\n     Connally,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"186255\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/269/385/#p391\">\n     269 U.S., at 391\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"186255\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/269/385/#p391\">\n     46 S.Ct. 126\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . And as we've seen, too, the Constitution sought to preserve a common law tradition that usually aimed to ensure fair notice before any deprivation of life, liberty, or property could take place, whether under the banner of the criminal or the civil law. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1224 - 1227.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    First principles aside, the government suggests that at least this Court's precedents support adopting a less-than-fair-notice standard for civil cases. But even that much I do not see. This Court has already expressly held that a \"stringent vagueness test\" should apply to at least some civil laws-those abridging basic\n    First Amendment freedoms.\n    <em>\n     Hoffman Estates v.

So the happenstance that a law is found in the civil or criminal part of the statute books cannot be dispositive.

Ours is a world filled with more and more civil laws bearing more and more extravagant punishments. Today's \"civil\" penalties include confiscatory rather than compensatory fines, forfeiture provisions that allow homes to be taken, remedies that strip persons of their professional licenses and livelihoods, and the power to commit persons against their will indefinitely. Some of these penalties are routinely imposed and are routinely graver than those associated with misdemeanor crimes-and often harsher than the punishment for felonies. And not only are \"punitive civil sanctions ... rapidly expanding,\" they are \"sometimes more severely punitive than the parallel criminal sanctions\n    <em>\n     for the same conduct\n    </em>\n    .\" Mann, Punitive Civil Sanctions: The Middleground Between Criminal and Civil Law,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=101%20Yale%20L.J.%201795\">\n     101 Yale L.J. 1795\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1798 (1992) (emphasis added). Given all this, any suggestion that criminal cases warrant a heightened standard of review does more to persuade me that the criminal standard should be set\n    <em>\n     above\n    </em>\n    our precedent's current threshold than to suggest the civil standard should be buried\n    <em>\n     below\n    </em>\n    it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Retreating to a more modest line of argument, the government emphasizes that this case arises in the immigration context and so implicates matters of foreign relations where the Executive enjoys considerable constitutional authority. But to acknowledge that the\n    <em>\n     President\n    </em>\n    has broad authority to act in this general area supplies no justification for allowing\n    <em>\n     judges\n    </em>\n    to give content to an impermissibly vague law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Alternatively still, Justice THOMAS suggests that, at least at the time of the founding, aliens present in this country may not have been understood as possessing any rights under the Due Process Clause. For support, he points to the Alien Friends Act of 1798. An Act Concerning Aliens \u00a7 1,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20Stat.%20571\">\n     1 Stat. 571\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 1244 - 1248 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). But the Alien Friends Act-better known as the \"Alien\" part of the Alien and Sedition Acts-is one of the most notorious laws in our country's history. It was understood as a temporary war measure, not one that the legislature would endorse in a time of tranquility. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Fehlings, Storm on the Constitution: The First Deportation Law,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20Tulsa%20J.%20Comp.%20%26%20Int%27l%20L.%2063\">\n     10 Tulsa J. Comp. &amp; Int'l L. 63\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 70-71 (2002). Yet even then it was widely condemned as unconstitutional by Madison and many others. It also went unenforced, may have cost the Federalist Party\n    its existence, and lapsed a mere two years after its enactment. With this fuller view, it seems doubtful the Act tells us a great deal about aliens' due process rights at the founding.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Besides, none of this much matters. Whether Madison or his adversaries had the better of the debate over the constitutionality of the Alien Friends Act, Congress is surely free to extend existing forms of liberty to new classes of persons-liberty that the government may then take only after affording due process. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sandin v.

Rev. 85, 88 (\"If ... the constitution, statute, or regulation creates a liberty or property interest, then the second step-determining 'what process is due'-comes into play\"). Madison made this very point, suggesting an alien's admission in this country could in some circumstances be analogous to \"the grant of land to an individual,\" which \"may be of favor not of right; but the moment the grant is made, the favor becomes a right, and must be forfeited before it can be taken away.\" Madison's Report 319. And, of course, that's exactly what Congress eventually chose to do here. Decades ago, it enacted a law affording Mr. Dimaya lawful permanent residency in this country, extending to him a statutory liberty interest others traditionally have enjoyed to remain in and move about the country free from physical imprisonment and restraint. See\n    <em>\n     Dimaya v.

No one suggests Congress\n    <em>\n     had\n    </em>\n    to enact statutes of this sort.

My colleagues suggest the law before us should be assessed under the fair notice standard because of the special gravity of its civil deportation penalty. But, grave as that penalty may be, I cannot see why we would single it out for special treatment when (again) so many civil laws today impose so many similarly severe sanctions. Why, for example, would due process require Congress to speak more clearly when it seeks to deport a lawfully resident alien than when it wishes to subject a citizen to indefinite civil commitment, strip him of a business license essential to his family's living, or confiscate his home? I can think of no good answer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    With the fair notice standard now in hand, all that remains is to ask how it applies to the case before us. And here at least the answer comes readily for me: to the extent it requires an \"ordinary case\" analysis, the portion of the Immigration and Nationality Act before us fails the fair notice test for the reasons Justice Scalia identified in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    and the Court recounts today.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Just like the statute in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    , the statute here instructs courts to impose special penalties on individuals previously \"convicted of\" a \"crime of violence.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1227\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2)(A)(iii), 1101(a)(43)(F). Just like the statute in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    , the statute here fails to specify which crimes qualify for that label. Instead, and again like the statute in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    , the statute here seems to require a judge to guess about the ordinary case of the crime of conviction and then guess whether a \"substantial risk\" of \"physical force\" attends its commission.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b) ;\n    <em>\n     Johnson,\n    </em>\n    576 U.S., at ---------, 135 S.Ct., at 2556-2558.\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    held that a law that asks so much of courts while offering them so little by way of guidance is unconstitutionally vague. And I do not see how we might reach a different judgment here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Any lingering doubt is resolved for me by taking account of just some of the\n    questions judges trying to apply the statute using an ordinary case analysis would have to confront. Does a conviction for witness tampering ordinarily involve a threat to the kneecaps or just the promise of a bribe? Does a conviction for kidnapping ordinarily involve throwing someone into a car trunk or a noncustodial parent picking up a child from daycare? These questions do not suggest obvious answers. Is the court supposed to hold evidentiary hearings to sort them out, entertaining experts with competing narratives and statistics, before deciding what the ordinary case of a given crime looks like and how much risk of violence it poses? What is the judge to do if there aren't any reliable statistics available? Should (or must) the judge predict the effects of new technology on what qualifies as the ordinary case? After all, surely the risk of injury calculus for crimes like larceny can be expected to change as more thefts are committed by computer rather than by gunpoint. Or instead of requiring real evidence, does the statute mean to just leave it all to a judicial hunch? And on top of all that may be the most difficult question yet: at what level of generality is the inquiry supposed to take place? Is a court supposed to pass on the ordinary case of burglary in the relevant neighborhood or county, or should it focus on statewide or even national experience? How is a judge to know? How are the people to know?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The implacable fact is that this isn't your everyday ambiguous statute. It leaves the people to guess about what the law demands-and leaves judges to make it up. You cannot discern answers to any of the questions this law begets by resorting to the traditional canons of statutory interpretation. No amount of staring at the statute's text, structure, or history will yield a clue. Nor does the statute call for the application of some preexisting body of law familiar to the judicial power. The statute doesn't even ask for application of common experience. Choice, pure and raw, is required. Will, not judgment, dictates the result.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Having said this much, it is important to acknowledge some limits on today's holding too. I have proceeded on the premise that the Immigration and Nationality Act, as it incorporates \u00a7 16(b) of the criminal code, commands courts to determine the risk of violence attending the ordinary case of conviction for a particular crime. I have done so because no party before us has argued for a different way to read these statutes in combination; because our precedent seemingly requires this approach; and because the government itself has conceded (repeatedly) that the law compels it.\n    <em>\n     Johnson, supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1217, 135 S.Ct., at 2561-2562 ;\n    <em>\n     Taylor v.

In response to the problems engendered by the ordinary case analysis, Justice THOMAS suggests that we should overlook the government's concession about the propriety of that approach; reconsider our precedents endorsing it; and read the statute as requiring us to focus on the facts of the alien's crime as committed rather than as the facts appear in the ordinary case of conviction.\n    <em>\n     Post,\n    </em>\n    at 1252 - 1259. But normally courts do not rescue parties from their concessions, maybe least of all concessions from a party as able to protect its interests as the federal government. And normally, too, the crucible of adversarial testing is crucial to sound judicial decisionmaking. We rely on it to \"yield insights (or reveal pitfalls) we cannot muster guided only by our own\n    lights.\"\n    <em>\n     Maslenjak v. United States,\n    </em>\n    582 U.S. ----, ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605053\" index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1918/#p1931\">\n     137 S.Ct. 1918\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1931,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605053\" index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1918/#p1931\">\n     198 L.Ed.2d 460\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2017) (GORSUCH, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    While sometimes we may or even must forgo the adversarial process, I do not see the case for doing so today. Maybe especially because I am not sure Justice THOMAS's is the only available alternative reading of the statute we would have to consider, even if we did reject the government's concession and wipe the precedential slate clean. We might also have to consider an interpretation that would have courts ask not whether the alien's crime of conviction ordinarily involves a risk of physical force, or whether the defendant's particular crime involved such a risk, but whether the defendant's crime of conviction\n    <em>\n     always\n    </em>\n    does so. After all, the language before us requires a conviction for an \"offense ... that,\n    <em>\n     by its nature,\n    </em>\n    involves a substantial risk of physical force.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b) (emphasis added). Plausibly, anyway, the word \"nature\" might refer to an inevitable characteristic of the offense; one that would present itself automatically, whenever the statute is violated. See 10 Oxford English Dictionary 247 (2d ed. 1989). While I remain open to different arguments about our precedent and the proper reading of language like this, I would address them in another case, whether involving the INA or a different statute, where the parties have a chance to be heard and we might benefit from their learning.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    It's important to note the narrowness of our decision today in another respect too. Vagueness doctrine represents a procedural, not a substantive, demand. It does not forbid the legislature from acting toward any end it wishes, but only requires it to act with enough clarity that reasonable people can know what is required of them and judges can apply the law consistent with their limited office. Our history surely bears examples of the judicial misuse of the so-called \"substantive component\" of due process to dictate policy on matters that belonged to the people to decide. But concerns with substantive due process should not lead us to react by withdrawing an ancient procedural protection compelled by the original meaning of the Constitution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Today's decision sweeps narrowly in yet one more way. By any fair estimate, Congress has largely satisfied the procedural demand of fair notice even in the INA provision before us. The statute lists a number of specific crimes that can lead to a lawful resident's removal-for example, murder, rape, and sexual abuse of a minor.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201101\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(43)(A). Our ruling today does not touch this list. We address only the statute's \"residual clause\" where Congress ended its own list and asked us to begin writing our own. Just as Blackstone's legislature passed a revised statute clarifying that \"cattle\" covers bulls and oxen, Congress remains free at any time to add more crimes to its list. It remains free, as well, to write a new residual clause that affords the fair notice lacking here. Congress might, for example, say that a conviction for any felony carrying a prison sentence of a specified length opens an alien to removal. Congress has done almost exactly this in other laws. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (g). What was done there could be done here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    But those laws are not this law. And while the statute before us doesn't rise to the level of threatening death for \"pretended offences\" of treason, no one should be surprised that the Constitution looks unkindly on any law so vague that reasonable people cannot understand its terms and judges do not know where to begin in applying it. A government of laws and not\n    of men can never tolerate that arbitrary power. And, in my judgment, that foundational principle dictates today's result. Because I understand them to be consistent with what I have said here, I join Parts I, III, IV-B, and V of the Court's opinion and concur in the judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Chief Justice ROBERTS, with whom Justice KENNEDY, Justice THOMAS, and Justice ALITO join, dissenting.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Johnson v.

Section 16 of Title 18 defines it to mean:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n    \"(a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n    \"(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    This definition of \"crime of violence\" is also incorporated in the definition of \"aggravated felony\" in the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201101\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(43)(F) (\"aggravated felony\" includes \"a crime of violence (as defined in section 16 of title 18, but not including a purely political offense) for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year\" (footnote omitted)). A conviction for an aggravated felony carries serious consequences under the immigration laws. It can serve as the basis for an alien's removal from the United States, and can preclude cancellation of removal by the Attorney General. \u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1229b(a)(3).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Those consequences came to pass in respondent James Dimaya's case. An Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals interpreted \u00a7 16(b) to cover Dimaya's two prior convictions for first-degree residential burglary under California law, subjecting him to removal. To stave off that result, Dimaya argued that the language of \u00a7 16(b) was void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    The parties begin by disputing whether a criminal or more relaxed civil vagueness standard should apply in resolving Dimaya's challenge.

The latter provision defined a \"violent felony\" to include \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that ... is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives,\n    <em>\n     or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\n    </em>\n    \"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"317\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    , we concluded that the ACCA residual clause (the \"or otherwise\" language) gave rise to two forms of intractable uncertainty, which \"conspire [d]\" to render the provision unconstitutionally vague. 576 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2557. First, the residual clause asked courts to gauge the \"potential risk\" of \"physical injury\" posed by the conduct involved in the crime.\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    That inquiry, we determined, entailed not only an evaluation of the \"criminal's behavior,\" but also required courts to consider \"how the idealized ordinary case of the crime subsequently plays out.\"\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    Second, the residual clause obligated courts to compare that risk to an indeterminate standard-one that was inextricably linked to the provision's four enumerated crimes, which presented differing kinds and degrees of risk.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2558.

The two provisions do correspond to some extent. Under our decisions, both ask the sentencing court to consider whether a particular offense, defined without regard to the facts of the conviction, poses a specified risk. And, relevant to both statutes, we have explained\n    that in deciding whether statutory elements inherently produce a risk, a court must take into account how those elements will ordinarily be fulfilled. See\n    <em>\n     James v. United States,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/#p208\">\n     550 U.S. 192\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 208,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/#p208\">\n     127 S.Ct. 1586\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"320\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/#p208\">\n     167 L.Ed.2d 532\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2007) (this categorical inquiry asks \"whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents\" the requisite risk).\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    In the Court's view, that effectively resolves this case. But the Court too readily dismisses the significant textual distinctions between \u00a7 16(b) and the ACCA residual clause. See also\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1224 (opinion of GORSUCH, J.). Those differences undermine the conclusion that \u00a7 16(b) shares each of the \"dual flaws\" of that clause.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1221 - 1222 (majority opinion).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    To begin, \u00a7 16(b) yields far less uncertainty \"about how to estimate the risk posed by a crime.\"\n    <em>\n     Johnson,\n    </em>\n    576 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2557. There are three material differences between \u00a7 16(b) and the ACCA residual clause in this respect. First, the ACCA clause directed the reader to consider whether the offender's conduct presented a \"\n    <em>\n     potential\n    </em>\n    risk\" of injury. Forced to give meaning to that befuddling choice of phrase-which layered one indeterminate term on top of another-we understood the word \"potential\" to signify that \"Congress intended to encompass possibilities even more contingent or remote than a simple 'risk.' \"\n    <em>\n     James,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"321\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/#p208\">\n     550 U.S., at 207-208\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"322\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/#p208\">\n     127 S.Ct. 1586\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As we explained in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    , that made for a \"speculative\" inquiry \"detached from statutory elements.\" 576 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2558. In other words, the offense elements could not constrain the risk inquiry in the manner they do here. See\n    <em>\n     Leocal,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"323\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n     543 U.S., at 11\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"324\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n     125 S.Ct. 377\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The \"serious potential risk\" standard also forced courts to assess in an expansive way the \"collateral consequences\" of the perpetrator's acts. For example, courts had to take into account the concern that\n    <em>\n     others\n    </em>\n    might cause injury in attempting to apprehend the offender. See\n    <em>\n     Sykes v. United States,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335985,12450132\" index=\"325\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/1/\">\n     564 U.S. 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 8-9,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335985,12450132\" index=\"326\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/1/\">\n     131 S.Ct. 2267\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335985,12450132\" index=\"327\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/1/\">\n     180 L.Ed.2d 60\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2011). Section 16(b), on the other hand, asks about \"risk\" alone, a familiar concept of everyday life. It therefore calls for a commonsense inquiry that does not compel a court to venture beyond the offense elements to consider contingent and remote possibilities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Second, \u00a7 16(b) focuses exclusively on the risk that the offender will \"use [ ]\" \"physical force\" \"against\" another person or another person's property. Thus, unlike the ACCA residual clause, \" \u00a7 16(b) plainly does not encompass all offenses which create a 'substantial risk' that\n    <em>\n     injury will result from\n    </em>\n    a person's conduct.\"\n    <em>\n     Leocal,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"328\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n     543 U.S., at 10, n. 7\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"329\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n     125 S.Ct. 377\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). The point is not that an inquiry into the risk of \"physical force\" is markedly more determinate than an inquiry into the risk of \"physical injury.\" But see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1220 - 1221. The difference\n    is that \u00a7 16(b) asks about the risk that the offender himself will\n    <em>\n     actively employ\n    </em>\n    force against person or property. That language does not sweep in all instances in which the offender's acts, or another person's reaction, might result in unintended or negligent harm.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Third, \u00a7 16(b) has a temporal limit that the ACCA residual clause lacked: The \"substantial risk\" of force must arise \"in the course of committing the offense.\" Properly interpreted, this means the statute requires a substantial risk that the perpetrator will use force while carrying out the crime. See\n    <em>\n     Leocal,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"330\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n     543 U.S., at 10\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"331\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p7\">\n     125 S.Ct. 377\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"The reckless disregard in \u00a7 16 relates ... to the risk that the use of physical force against another might be required in committing a crime.\"). The provision thereby excludes more attenuated harms that might arise following the completion of the crime. The ACCA residual clause, by contrast, contained no similar language restricting its scope. And the absence of such a limit, coupled with the reference to \"potential\" risks, gave courts free rein to classify an offense as a violent felony based on injuries that might occur after the offense was over and done. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Benton,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4200888\" index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/639/723/#p732\">\n     639 F.3d 723\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 732 (C.A.6 2011) (finding that \"solicitation to commit aggravated assault\" qualified under the ACCA residual clause on the theory that the solicited individual might subsequently carry out the requested act).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Why does any of this matter? Because it mattered in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    . More precisely, the expansive language in the ACCA residual clause contributed to our determination that the clause gave rise to \"grave uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a crime.\" 576 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2558. \"Critically,\" we said-a word that tends to mean something-\"\n    <em>\n     picturing the criminal's behavior is not enough\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    (emphasis added). Instead, measuring \"potential risk\" \"seemingly require[d] the judge to imagine how the idealized ordinary case of the crime\n    <em>\n     subsequently plays out\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    (emphasis added). Not so here. In applying \u00a7 16(b), considering \"the criminal's behavior\"\n    <em>\n     is\n    </em>\n    enough.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Those three distinctions-the unadorned reference to \"risk,\" the focus on the offender's own active employment of force, and the \"in the course of committing\" limitation-also mean that many hard cases under ACCA are easier under \u00a7 16(b). Take the firearm possession crime from\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    itself, which had as its constituent elements (1) unlawfully (2) possessing (3) a short-barreled shotgun. None of those elements, \"by its nature,\" carries \"a substantial risk\" that the possessor will use force against another \"in the course of committing the offense.\" Nothing inherent in the act of firearm possession, even when it is unlawful, gives rise to a substantial risk that the owner will then shoot someone.

The \"substantial risk\" standard in \u00a7 16(b) is significantly less confusing because it is not tied to a disjointed list of paradigm offenses.

No litigant in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    suggested that solution, which is not surprising.

And that is because the result in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    did not follow from the presence of one frustrating textual feature or another. Quite the opposite: The decision emphasized that it was the \"sum\" of the \"uncertainties\" in the ACCA residual clause, confirmed by years of experience, that \"convince[d]\" us the provision was beyond salvage.\n    <em>\n     Johnson,\n    </em>\n    576 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2560.

But the fact that the ACCA residual clause required the ordinary case approach was not itself sufficient to doom the law. We instead took pains to clarify that our opinion should not be read to impart such an absolute rule. See\n    <em>\n     Johnson,\n    </em>\n    576 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2560.

First, of course, today's holding invalidates a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act-part of the definition of \"aggravated felony\"-on which the Government relies to \"ensure that dangerous criminal aliens are removed from the United States.\" Brief for United States 54. Contrary to the Court's back-of-the-envelope assessment, see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1222, n. 12, the Government explains that the definition is \"critical\" for \"numerous\" immigration provisions.

Of special concern, \u00a7 16 is replicated in the definition of \"crime of violence\" applicable to \u00a7 924(c), which prohibits using or carrying a firearm \"during and in relation to any crime of violence,\" or possessing a firearm \"in furtherance of any such crime.\" \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), (c)(3).

First, I continue to doubt that our practice of striking down statutes as unconstitutionally vague is consistent with the original meaning of the Due Process Clause. See\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at ------- --, 135 S.Ct., at 2566-2567 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Second, if the Court thinks that \u00a7 16(b) is unconstitutionally vague because of the \"categorical approach,\" see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1209 - 1216, then the Court should abandon that approach-not insist on reading it into statutes and then strike them down. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    I\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    I continue to harbor doubts about whether the vagueness doctrine can be squared with the original meaning of the Due Process Clause-and those doubts are only amplified in the removal context. I am also skeptical that the vagueness doctrine can be justified as a way to prevent delegations of core legislative power in this context. But I need not resolve these questions because, if the vagueness doctrine has any basis in the Due Process Clause, it must be limited to cases in which the statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied to the person challenging it. That is not the case for respondent, whose prior convictions for first-degree residential burglary in California fall comfortably within the scope of \u00a7 16(b).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    A\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    The Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause provides that no person shall be \"deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" Section 16(b), as incorporated by the INA, cannot violate this Clause unless the following propositions are true: The Due Process Clause requires federal statutes to provide certain minimal procedures, the vagueness doctrine is one of those procedures, and the vagueness doctrine applies to statutes governing the removal of aliens. Although I need not resolve any of these propositions today, each one is questionable. I will address them in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    1\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    First, the vagueness doctrine is not legitimate unless the \"law of the land\" view of due process is incorrect.

And, in this country, the notion that the Due Process Clause governed the removal of aliens was not announced until the 20th century.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    Less than a decade after the ratification of the Bill of Rights, the founding generation had an extensive debate about the relationship between the Constitution and federal removal statutes. In 1798, the Fifth Congress enacted the Alien Acts. One of those Acts, the Alien Friends Act, gave the President unfettered discretion to expel any aliens \"he shall judge dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States, or shall have reasonable grounds to suspect are concerned in any treasonable or secret machinations against the government thereof.\" An Act Concerning Aliens \u00a7 1,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"423\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20Stat.%20571\">\n     1 Stat. 571\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This statute was modeled after the Aliens Act 1793 in England, which similarly gave the King unfettered discretion to expel aliens as he \"shall think necessary for the publick Security.\" 33 Geo. III, ch. 4, \u00a7 18, in 39 Eng. Stat. at Large 16. Both the Fifth Congress and the States thoroughly debated the Alien Friends Act. Virginia and Kentucky enacted resolutions (anonymously drafted by Madison and Jefferson) opposing the Act, while 10 States enacted counter-resolutions condemning the views of Virginia and Kentucky. See Fehlings, Storm on the Constitution: The First Deportation Law,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"424\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20Tulsa%20J.%20Comp.%20%26%20Int%27l%20L.%2063\">\n     10 Tulsa J.

Some of the Jeffersonians argued that the Alien Friends Act violated the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. They complained that the Act failed to provide aliens with all the accouterments of a criminal trial. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Kentucky Resolutions \u00b6 6, in 4 The Debates in the Several Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 541-542 (J.

First, the Federalists argued that the rights of aliens were governed by the law of nations, not the Constitution. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Randolph, Debate on Virginia Resolutions, in The Virginia Report of 1799-1800, pp. 34-35 (1850) (Virginia Debates) (statement of George K.

The law of nations imposed no enforceable limits on a nation's power to remove aliens. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    1 E. de Vattel, Law of Nations, \u00a7\u00a7 230-231, pp. 108-109 (J. Chitty et al. transl. and ed. 1883).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    Second, the Federalists responded that the expulsion of aliens \"did not touch life, liberty, or property.\" Virginia Debates 34. The founding generation understood the phrase \"life, liberty, or property\" to refer to a relatively narrow set of core private rights that did not depend on the will of the government.

The Federalists argued that an alien's right to reside in this country was one such privilege. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Virginia Debates 34 (arguing that \"ordering away an alien ... was not a matter of right, but of favour,\" which did not require a jury trial); Report of the Select Committee of the House of Representatives, Made to the House of Representatives on Feb. 21, 1799, 9 Annals of Cong. 2987 (1799) (stating that aliens \"remain in the country ... merely as matter of favor and permission\" and can be removed at any time without a criminal trial); Charge to the Grand Juries 11-13 (similar). According to the Minority Address of the Virginia Legislature (anonymously drafted by John Marshall), \"[T]he right of remaining in our country is vested in no alien; he enters and remains by the courtesy of the sovereign power, and that courtesy may at pleasure be withdrawn\" without judicial process. Address of the Minority in the Virginia Legislature to the People of that State 9-10 (1799) (Virginia Minority Address). Unlike \"a grant of\n    land,\" the \"[a]dmission of an alien to residence ... is revocable, like a permission.\" A. Addison, Analysis of the Report of the Committee of the Virginia Assembly 23 (1800). Removing a resident alien from the country did not affect \"life, liberty, or property,\" the Federalists argued, until the alien became a naturalized citizen. See\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 23-24; Charge to the Grand Juries 11-13. That the alien's permanent residence was conferred by statute would not have made a difference. See Nelson 571, 580-582;\n    <em>\n     Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc.,\n    </em>\n    574 U.S. ----, ----, n. 2,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594237\" index=\"431\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/831/#p848\">\n     135 S.Ct. 831\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 848, n. 2, ---L.Ed.2d ---- (2015) (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    After the Alien Friends Act lapsed in 1800, Congress did not enact another removal statute for nearly a century. The States enacted their own removal statutes during this period, see G. Neuman, Strangers to the Constitution 19-43 (1996), and I am aware of no decision questioning the legality of these statutes under State due-process or law-of-the-land provisions. Beginning in the late 19th century, the Federal Government reinserted itself into the regulation of immigration. When this Court was presented with constitutional challenges to Congress' removal laws, it initially rejected them for many of the same reasons that Marshall and the Federalists had cited in defense of the Alien Friends Act.

And \u00a7 16(b) requires only a risk of physical force, not actual physical force, and that risk would seem to be present whenever someone is home during the burglary. Further,\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    is not conclusive because, unlike\n    ACCA's residual clause, \u00a7 16(b) covers offenses that involve a substantial risk of physical force \"against the person\n    <em>\n     or property\n    </em>\n    of another.\" (Emphasis added.) Surely the ordinary case of residential burglary involves at least one of these risks. According to the statistics referenced by the Court, most burglaries involve either a forcible entry (\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    breaking a window or slashing a door screen), an attempted forcible entry, or an unlawful entry when someone is home. See Bureau of Justice Statistics,\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2 (Table 1).

And \u00a7 16(b) has an even wider core, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE explains.

The sole reason that the Court deems \u00a7 16(b) unconstitutionally vague is because it reads the statute as incorporating the categorical approach-specifically, the \"ordinary case\" approach from ACCA's residual clause. Although the Court mentions \"[t]wo features\" of \u00a7 16(b) that make it vague-the ordinary-case approach and an imprecise risk standard-the Court admits that the second feature is problematic only in combination with the first.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1214. Without the ordinary-case approach, the Court \"do[es] not doubt\" the constitutionality of \u00a7 16(b).\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1215.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    But if the categorical approach renders \u00a7 16(b) unconstitutionally vague, then constitutional avoidance requires us to make a reasonable effort to avoid that interpretation. And a reasonable alternative interpretation is available: Instead of asking whether the ordinary case of an alien's offense presents a substantial risk of physical force, courts should ask whether the alien's actual underlying conduct presents a substantial risk of physical force. I will briefly discuss the origins of the categorical approach and then explain why the Court should abandon it for \u00a7 16(b).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    A\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    1\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    The categorical approach originated with Justice Blackmun's opinion for the Court in\n    <em>\n     Taylor v.

Aggravated felonies include \"crime[s] of violence\" as defined in \u00a7 16. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). Section 16, in turn, defines crimes of violence as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n    \"(a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n    \"(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-202\">\n    At first glance, \u00a7 16(b) is not clear about the precise question it poses. On the one hand, the statute might refer to the metaphysical \"nature\" of the offense and ask whether it ordinarily involves a substantial risk of physical force. On the other hand, the statute might refer to the underlying facts of the offense that the offender committed; the words \"by its nature,\" \"substantial risk,\" and \"may\" would mean only that an offender who engages in risky conduct cannot benefit from the fortuitous fact that physical force was not actually used during his offense. The text can bear either interpretation. See\n    <em>\n     Nijhawan v. Holder,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"592\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p34\">\n     557 U.S. 29\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 33-34,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"593\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p34\">\n     129 S.Ct. 2294\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"594\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p34\">\n     174 L.Ed.2d 22\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2009) (\"[I]n ordinary speech words such as 'crime,' 'felony,' 'offense,' and the like sometimes refer to a generic crime ... and sometimes refer to the specific acts in which an offender engaged on a specific occasion\").

To begin, \u00a7 16(b) asks whether an offense \"involves\" a substantial risk of force. The word \"involves\" suggests that the offense must\n    <em>\n     necessarily\n    </em>\n    include a substantial risk of force. See The New Oxford Dictionary of English 962 (2001) (\"include (something) as a necessary part or result\"); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1005 (2d ed. 1987) (\"1. to include as a necessary circumstance, condition, or consequence\"); Oxford American Dictionary 349 (1980) (\"1. to contain within itself, to make necessary as a condition or result\"). That condition is always satisfied if the Government must prove that the alien's underlying conduct involves a substantial risk of force, but it is not always satisfied if the Government need only prove that the \"ordinary case\" involves such a risk. See\n    <em>\n     Johnson,\n    </em>\n    576 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2580 (ALITO, J., dissenting). Tellingly, the other aggravated felonies in the INA that use the word \"involves\" employ the underlying-conduct approach. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"595\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201101\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(43)(M)(i) (\"an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000\"); \u00a7 1101(h)(3) (\"any crime of reckless driving or of driving while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol or of prohibited substances if such crime involves personal injury to another\"). As do the similarly worded provisions of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, the bill that contained \u00a7 16(b).

Section 16(a) covers offenses that have the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force \"as an element.\" Because \u00a7 16(b) covers \"other\" offenses and is separated from \u00a7 16(a) by the disjunctive word \"or,\" the natural inference is that \u00a7 16(b) asks a different question. In other words, \u00a7 16(b) must require immigration judges to look beyond the elements of an offense to determine whether it involves a substantial risk of physical force. But if the elements are insufficient, where else should immigration judges look to determine the riskiness of an offense? Two options are possible, only one of which is workable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    The first option is to consult the underlying facts of the alien's crime and then assess its riskiness. This approach would provide a definitive answer in every case. And courts are already familiar with this kind of inquiry. Cf.\n    <em>\n     Johnson, supra,\n    </em>\n    at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2561 (noting that \"dozens\" of similarly worded laws ask courts to assess \"the riskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant engages\n    <em>\n     on a particular occasion\n    </em>\n    \"). Nothing suggests that Congress imposed a more limited inquiry when it enacted \u00a7 16(b) in 1984. At the time, Congress had not yet enacted ACCA's residual clause, this Court had not yet created the categorical approach, and this Court had not yet recognized a Sixth Amendment limit on judicial factfinding at sentencing, see\n    <em>\n     Chambers v.

(observing that the categorical approach is \"nearly impossible to apply consistently\"). Because courts disfavor interpretations that make a statute impossible to apply, see A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law 63 (2012), this Court should reject the ordinary-case approach for \u00a7 16(b) and adopt the underlying-facts approach instead. See\n    <em>\n     Johnson, supra,\n    </em>\n    at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2578 (ALITO, J., dissenting) (\"When another interpretation is ready at hand, why should we assume that Congress gave the clause a meaning that is impossible-or even, exceedingly difficult-to apply\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    2\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    That the categorical approach is not the better reading of \u00a7 16(b) should not be surprising, since the categorical approach was never really about the best reading of the text. As explained, this Court adopted that approach to avoid a potential Sixth Amendment problem with sentencing judges conducting minitrials to determine a defendant's past conduct. But even assuming the categorical approach solved this Sixth Amendment problem in criminal cases, no such problem arises in immigration cases. \"[T]he provisions of the Constitution securing the right of trial by jury have no application\" in a removal proceeding.\n    <em>\n     Turner,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3630888\" index=\"604\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/194/279/#p290\">\n     194 U.S., at 290\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3630888\" index=\"605\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/194/279/#p290\">\n     24 S.Ct. 719\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . And, in criminal cases, the underlying-conduct approach would be perfectly constitutional if the Government included the defendant's prior conduct in the indictment,\n    tried it to a jury, and proved it beyond a reasonable doubt. See\n    <em>\n     Johnson,\n    </em>\n    576 U.S., at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2579 (ALITO, J., dissenting). Nothing in \u00a7 16(b) prohibits the Government from proceeding this way, so the plurality is wrong to suggest that the underlying-conduct approach would necessarily \"ping-pong us from one constitutional issue to another.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1217.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-209\">\n    If constitutional avoidance applies here at all, it requires us to\n    <em>\n     reject\n    </em>\n    the categorical approach for \u00a7 16(b). According to the Court, the categorical approach is unconstitutionally vague. And, all agree that the underlying-conduct approach would not be.

Thus, if the underlying-conduct approach is a \"reasonabl[e]\" interpretation of \u00a7 16(b), it is our \"plain duty\" to adopt it.\n    <em>\n     United States ex rel. Attorney General v.

See 576 U.S., at ---------, 135 S.Ct., at 2561-2562. The Court concluded that the categorical approach was the only reasonable reading of ACCA because the residual clause uses the word \"convictions.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at ----, 135 S.Ct., at 2561-2562.

Moreover, this Court has already rejected them. In\n    <em>\n     Nijhawan,\n    </em>\n    this Court unanimously concluded that one of the aggravated felonies in the INA-\"an offense that ... involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000,\" \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) -applies the underlying-conduct approach, not the categorical approach.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"609\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p34\">\n     557 U.S., at 32\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"610\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p34\">\n     129 S.Ct. 2294\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Although the INA also refers to \"convict[ions],\" \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), the Court was not swayed by that argument.

As for the supposed practical problems with proving an alien's prior conduct, the Court did not find that argument persuasive either. \"[T]he 'sole purpose' of the 'aggravated felony' inquiry,\" the Court explained, \" 'is to ascertain the nature of a prior conviction; it is not an invitation to relitigate the conviction itself.' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"613\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p34\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    And because the INA places the burden on the Government to prove an alien's conduct by clear and convincing evidence, \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(A), \"uncertainties caused by the passage of time are likely to count in the alien's favor,\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"614\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p34\">\n      id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"614\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p34\">\n     at 42\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"615\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p34\">\n     129 S.Ct. 2294\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    There are additional reasons why the practical problems identified in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    should not matter for \u00a7 16(b) -even assuming they should have mattered for ACCA's residual clause, see\n    <em>\n     Lewis v.

But those judges are already accustomed to finding facts about the conduct underlying an alien's prior convictions, since some of\n    the INA's aggravated felonies employ the underlying-conduct approach.
