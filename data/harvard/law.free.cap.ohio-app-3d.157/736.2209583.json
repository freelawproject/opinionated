Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">{\u00b6 1} In July 2001, the city of Dayton passed Ordinance No. 29990-01, which prohibits predatory lending practices in Dayton, restricts the ability of predatory lenders to transact business with Dayton, and allows injured parties to bring civil actions to void or correct predatory loans. The ordinance was codified as Sections 112.40 through 112.44 of the Revised Code of General Ordinances of the City of Dayton (\u201cR.C.G.O.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">{\u00b6 2} Subsequently, the Ohio General Assembly passed legislation on the same subject. Amended Substitute H.B. 386 enacted new sections of the Revised Code (R.C. 1349.25 to 1349.37) that basically incorporated the federal Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (\u201cHOEPA\u201d). HOEPA was enacted as an amendment to the Federal Truth in Lending Act, and requires creditors to make disclosures in connection with certain mortgages, known as \u201chigh-cost\u201d loans. See Pub.L. No. 103-325, Title I, Sections 151-158, 108 Stat. 2190 (1994) (amending Sections 1601-1602, 1604,1610, 1639-1641, and 1648, Title 15, U.S.Code); and <em>Terry v. Community Bank of N. Virginia </em>(W.D.Tenn.2003), 255 F.Supp.2d 811, 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">{\u00b6 3} HOEPA was designed \u201c \u2018to ensure that consumers understand the terms of such loans and are protected from high pressure sales tactics. * * * [It] prohibits High Cost Mortgages from including certain terms such as prepayment penalties and balloon payments that have proven particularly problematic.\u2019 \u201d <em>McIntosh v. Irwin Union Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>(D.Mass.2003), 215 F.R.D. 26, 29, quoting from S.Rep. No. 103-169, at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">{\u00b6 4} Ohio\u2019s Predatory Lending Act is contained in R.C. Chapter 1349 (Consumer Protection). R.C. 1349.25(D) defines loans covered under the act as those that (1) involve property located in Ohio, and (2) are considered \u201cmortgages\u201d under Section 152(a) of HOEPA, \u201c15 U.S.C.A. 1602(aa), as amended, and the regulations adopted thereunder by the federal reserve board.\u201d Section 152(a) of HOEPA defines a \u201cmortgage\u201d as:</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c[A] consumer credit transaction that is secured by the consumer\u2019s principal dwelling, other than a residential mortgage transaction, a reverse mortgage transaction, or a transaction under an open end credit plan, if\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>{\u00b6 6} \u201c(A) the annual percentage rate at consummation of the transaction will exceed by more than 10 percentage points the yield on Treasury securities having comparable periods of maturity on the fifteenth day of the month immediately preceding the month in which the application for the extension of credit is received by the creditor; or</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(B) the total points and fees payable by the consumer at or before closing will exceed the greater of\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(i) 8 percent of the total loan amount; or</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(ii) $400.\u201d 1602(aa)(l), Title 15, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">{\u00b6 10} When the Ohio General Assembly passed its own predatory lending Act, it included various provisions explicitly aimed at municipalities and other political subdivisions. These provisions were codified as R.C. 1.63, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(A) The state solely shall regulate the business of originating, granting, servicing, and collecting loans and other forms of credit in the state and the manner in which any such business is conducted, and this regulation shall be in lieu of all other regulation of such activities by any municipal corporation or other political subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(B) Any ordinance, resolution, regulation, or other action by a municipal corporation or other political subdivision to regulate, directly or indirectly, the origination, granting, servicing, or collection of loans or other forms of credit constitutes a conflict with the Revised Code, including, but not limited to, Titles XI, XIII, XVII, and XLVII, and with the uniform operation throughout the state of lending and other credit provisions, and is preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(C) Any ordinance, resolution, regulation, or other action by a municipal corporation or other political subdivision constitutes a conflict with the Revised Code, including, but not limited to, Titles XI, XIII, XVII, and XLVII, and is pre-empted, if the ordinance, resolution, regulation, or other action does either of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(1) Disqualifies a person, or its subsidiaries or affiliates, from doing business with such municipal corporation or other political subdivision based upon the acts or practices of such person, or its subsidiaries or affiliates, as an originator, grantor, servicer, or collector of loans or other forms of credit;</p>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(2) Imposes reporting requirements or other obligations upon a person, or its subsidiaries or affiliates, based upon such person\u2019s, or its subsidiaries\u2019 or affiliates\u2019, acts or practices as an originator, grantor, servicer, or collector of loans or other forms of credit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-14\">{\u00b6 16} In addition, the uncodified law accompanying R.C. 1.63 stresses:</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>{\u00b6 17} \u201c(A) The enactment of section 1.63 of the Revised Code by this act is intended as a clarification of existing law and not as a substantive change in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(B) The enactment of section 1.63 of the Revised Code by this act expresses the legislative intent of the General Assembly currently and at the time of the original enactment of the provisions of the Revised Code, including, but not limited to, Titles XI, XIII, XVII, and XLVII, relating to the origination, granting, servicing, and collection of loans and other forms of credit.\u201d H.B. 386, Sections 3 and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">{\u00b6 19} Ohio\u2019s Predatory Lending Act was effective on May 24, 2002. Several days later, Dayton filed the present action for declaratory and injunctive relief. Dayton did not object to the Act\u2019s general content; instead, Dayton challenged only R.C. 1.63. Specifically, Dayton claimed that the preemption provisions in R.C. 1.63 violated Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution (Home Rule Powers). Dayton also alleged that the uncodified law accompanying R.C. 1.63 abused judicial authority in violation of Section 1, Article IV of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">{\u00b6 20} After filing an answer, the state of Ohio filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Dayton then responded with a motion for summary judgment. Ultimately, the trial court found in Ohio\u2019s favor, granted Ohio\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, and held Dayton\u2019s summary judgment motion moot. In particular, the court concluded that Dayton\u2019s ordinance conflicted with H.B. 386, that Dayton\u2019s ordinance was not purely a matter of self-government, and that H.B. 386 was a general law. The court did comment in its decision that R.C. 1.63(A), (B), (C)(1), and (C)(2) were unconstitutional because these provisions prevented Dayton from enacting any type of legislation on predatory lending. However, because judgment on the pleadings was granted in Ohio\u2019s favor, this finding was not reflected in the court\u2019s judgment. Due to the confusion over the effect of the trial court\u2019s ruling, both Dayton and Ohio have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">{\u00b6 21} On appeal, Dayton raises the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cI. The trial court erred as a matter of law by failing to grant declaratory judgment on behalf of the City of Dayton.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cII. The trial court erred as a matter of law by granting judgment on the pleadings to the State of Ohio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">{\u00b6 24} As cross-appellee, the state claims in a single assignment of error that \u201cthe trial court erred as a matter of law by finding R.C. 1.63 unconstitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">{\u00b6 25} Various organizations requested, and have been given, leave to file amicus curiae briefs. The amici curiae on behalf of Dayton, include Ohio Municipal League, Edgemont Neighborhood Coalition (\u201cEdgemont\u201d), and Coali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>tion on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio (\u201cCOHHIO\u201d). In addition, American Financial Services Association has filed a brief supporting Ohio\u2019s position. We appreciate the effort of all to clarify this complex area of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">{\u00b6 26} After reviewing the record and applicable law, we find the assignments of error and the cross-assignment of error without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed. An explanation of our decision follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">{\u00b6 27} As a preliminary matter, we note that judgments on the pleadings are reviewed de novo, which means that we independently decide whether the trial court judgment was proper as a matter of law. <em>Snyder v. Fairborn </em>(July 12, 2002), Greene App. No. 2001 CA 107, 2002 WL 1483282, * 5. Because motions for judgment on the pleadings are characterized as belated motions to dismiss, trial courts apply the standard used in evaluating motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>Terry v. Ottawa Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Dev. Disabilities, </em>151 Ohio App.3d 234, 2002-Ohio-7299, 783 N.E.2d 959, at \u00b6 8. Thus, \u201c[w]hen considering a defendant\u2019s Civ. R. 12(C) motion for judgment on the pleadings, the trial court is required to construe as true all the material allegations in the complaint, with all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, in favor of the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Whaley v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 574, 581, 752 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">{\u00b6 28} The allegations in the complaint basically mirror the facts we outlined above. In the first assignment of error, Dayton claims that the trial court erred by failing to grant declaratory judgment in Dayton\u2019s favor. In this regard, Dayton focuses on four main points: (1) that R.C. 1.63 and H.B. 386, Sections 3 and 4, are unconstitutional because they purport to expressly preempt municipal legislation; (2) that R.C. 1.63(C)(1) unlawfully interferes with municipal powers of local self-government; (3) that R.C. 1.63 and H.B. 386, Sections 3 and 4, are not general laws; and (4) that R.C. 1.63 and H.B. 386, Sections 3 and 4, violate the separation-of-powers doctrine. We will address these matters separately, as well as other pertinent concepts of municipal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">A. Analysis of Local Self-Government</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">{\u00b6 29} Under Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution, or the Home Rule provision, \u201c[mjunicipalities shall have authority to exercise all powers of local self-government and to adopt and enforce within their limits such local police, sanitary and other similar regulations, as are not in conflict with general laws.\u201d In <em>Rispo Realty &amp; Dev. Co. v. Parma </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 101, 564 N.E.2d 425, the Ohio Supreme Court noted that \u201c \u2018[t]he words, \u201cas are not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>conflict with general laws\u201d * * * modify the words \u201clocal police, sanitary and other similar regulations\u201d but do not modify the words \u201cpowers of local self-government\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id. at 103, 564 N.E.2d 425, quoting <em>State ex rel. Canada v. Phillips </em>(1958), 168 Ohio St. 191, 5 O.O.2d 481, 151 N.E.2d 722, paragraph four of the syllabus. The Ohio Supreme Court has also stressed:</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cA state statute takes precedence over a local ordinance when (1) the ordinance is in conflict with the statute, (2) the ordinance is an exercise of the police power, rather than of local self-government, and (3) the statute is a general law.\u201d <em>Canton v. State, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, at \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cThe first step * * * in a proper home-rule analysis is to decide whether the matter in question involves an exercise of local self-government or an exercise of local police power.\u201d <em>Twinsburg v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 226, 228, 530 N.E.2d 26, overruled on other grounds in <em>Rocky River v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 1, 20, 539 N.E.2d 103. A power of local self-government includes \u201c \u2018such powers of government as, in view of their nature and the field of their operation, are local and municipal in character.\u2019 \u201d <em>Billings v. Cleveland R.R. Co. </em>(1915), 92 Ohio St. 478, 484, 111 N.E. 155. For example, municipal elections are matters of local concern, and municipalities are free to adopt a system of electing officials different from that provided by law, as long as constitutional requirements are not violated. <em>State ex rel. Toledo v. Lucas Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 73, 76-77, 765 N.E.2d 854. Similarly, municipal ordinances on military leave for employees are matters of local interest and prevail over conflicting state law. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Fraternal Order of Police, Ohio Labor Council, Inc. v. Sidney </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 399, 402, 746 N.E.2d 597. After reviewing the allegations in the complaint and the pertinent statutes, we find that regulation of predatory lending is not a matter of local self-government. Instead, it governs conduct that is not just local or municipal in character, and involves the use of police powers. Accordingly, we will apply the standards governing a municipality\u2019s exercise of police powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Preemption and the Statewide-Concern Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">{\u00b6 32} Before we apply police power standards, however, we should address Dayton\u2019s first objection, which involves the issue of preemption. Dayton contends that the legislature cannot extinguish the power of Ohio municipalities to enact police regulations because municipal power is derived from Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution, not from a legislative grant. As support for this theory, Dayton relies on <em>Fondessy Enterprises, Inc. v. Oregon </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 213, 23 OBR 372, 492 N.E.2d 797. The trial court agreed with Dayton that the legislature could not expressly preempt municipal power, and found R.C. 1.63(A), (B), and (C) unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>{\u00b6 33} In contrast, Ohio claims that the legislature has exclusive authority to regulate areas of \u201cstatewide concern.\u201d In this regard, Ohio focuses on cases like <em>Cleveland Elec. Ilium. Co. v. Painesville </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 125, 44 O.O.2d 121, 239 N.E.2d 75, which allegedly held that regulation of electric utilities is a matter of statewide concern, preempting all local regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">{\u00b6 34} After reviewing the law in this area, we find a general lack of consistency in the decisions. For example, in <em>Weir v. Rimmelin </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 55, 15 OBR 151, 472 N.E.2d 341, the Ohio Supreme Court considered the issue of municipal regulation of outdoor advertising signs along interstate and primary highways. The court found that regulation of such signs was of \u201cstatewide concern\u201d and a proper use of state police power. The court also concluded that because there was no evidence of state or federal legislative intent to \u201cpreempt\u201d municipal regulation of outdoor signs, municipalities could \u201clawfully regulate outdoor advertising devices as a legitimate exercise of local self-government if such regulations do not conflict with a general state law.\u201d Id. at 56-57, 15 OBR 151, 472 N.E.2d 341. Implicit in this holding is the fact that municipalities are precluded from acting in an area if preemptive legislation exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">{\u00b6 35} Likewise, <em>Clermont Environmental Reclamation Co. v. Wiederhold </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 44, 2 OBR 587, 442 N.E.2d 1278, invalidated a local zoning resolution that banned a preexisting hazardous waste facility. In this regard, the Ohio Supreme Court found that state legislation on the subject was a general law for carrying out statewide legislative goals, and political subdivisions were subject to its provisions, \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d the Home Rule Amendment. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">{\u00b6 36} A few years later, however, the Ohio Supreme Court decided <em>Fondessy Enterprises, </em>23 Ohio St.3d 213, 23 OBR 372, 492 N.E.2d 797. In this case, the city of Oregon had passed an ordinance that imposed permit fees on hazardous landfills within the city and also required operators to keep various records and forms. Both lower courts found that the statute (the same one involved in <em>Clermont, </em>i.e., R.C. 3734.05[D][3]) expressly preempted the city from enacting the ordinance. Id. at 215, 23 OBR 372, 492 N.E.2d 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">{\u00b6 37} On appeal, the Ohio Supreme Court reiterated that hazardous waste disposal was of vital concern and was of public interest to Ohio citizens. The court also observed that the central issue in <em>Fondessy Enterprises </em>was the hazardous waste statute and the construction given to the statute by <em>Clermont. </em>Id. In this regard, the court found inconsistencies between paragraph two of the syllabus in <em>Clermont </em>and the court\u2019s holding in the case. Id., 23 Ohio St.3d at 216, 23 OBR 372, 492 N.E.2d 797. Specifically, the syllabus implied that the state legislation preempted municipal authority. However, the holding in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>indicated that the state legislation would \u201ctake precedence over laws in conflict\u201d with the statutes. Consequently, the Ohio Supreme Court clarified:</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cTaken together, paragraph two of the syllabus of <em>Clermont </em>and its holding should mean that no municipal ordinance may be enacted which conflicts with the state statute. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cIf the provisions of * * * [the legislation in question] do preclude a home rule municipality, with police powers guaranteed it by the Ohio Constitution, from enacting any and all legislation, then that provision of state law must be ruled unconstitutional.\u201d Id., 23 Ohio St.3d at 216, 23 OBR 372, 492 N.E.2d 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">{\u00b6 40} While this may have temporarily reconciled some conflict, the law continued to be inconsistent concerning various aspects of Home Rule law. See Vaubel, Municipal Home Rule in Ohio (1978), Chapter VII, Section 91, at 798 (indicating that lower courts have had difficulty applying Home Rule law because guidelines from higher authorities, i.e., the Ohio Supreme Court and the General Assembly, are unclear and inconsistent). To some extent the difficulty arises from imprecise use of language and concepts in the case law. According to Vaubel:</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cAlthough the proponents of the Home Rule Amendments intended to separate state and municipal authority by a clear line of division, they in fact created three segments of power; two were consistent with the intended division, while the third blurred the distinction through the recognition of shared power. First, <em>exclusive </em>state power was retained in those areas where a municipality would in no way be affected or where state dominance seemed to be required. * * * A second area of exclusive municipal power * * * was created by the Amendments insofar as local self-government power is exercisable * * * by charter municipalities * * * and to the extent that municipalities may acquire and operate public utilities or contract for their services. * * * Finally, a third area of mutual power was established involving the adoption of police regulations, with points of friction between enactments of the two levels of government subject to resolution by the \u2018no conflict\u2019 test * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cGiven this division of power, there is no place for a fourth category. Therefore, the term \u2018statewide concern,\u2019 with the attendant stress that it places upon state authority, would as a matter of convenience rather than necessity best be used to describe those areas where state power is exclusive. It might also be used to describe the extent of state police power which was left unimpaired by the adoption of the Home Rule Amendments as well as to describe those areas of authority which are outside the outer limits of \u2018local\u2019 power, i.e., those matters which are neither \u2018local self-government\u2019 nor \u2018local police and sanitary regulations.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>{\u00b6 43} \u201cIf \u2018statewide concern\u2019 were given an additional meaning \u2014 one designating a fourth area of independent significance \u2014 it would require a withdrawal of municipal authority, not a contraction of state power. State power would therefore be defined with little or no heed paid to constitutional grants of authority to municipalities.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) Vaubel, Section IX, at 1107-1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">{\u00b6 44} Vaubel notes in his 1978 book on municipal law that Ohio courts have referred enough to \u201cstatewide concern\u201d to suggest that some modification of the traditional three-part division of authority may be developing. Id. at 1108. In a later update, covering the years 1976 through 1995, Vaubel discusses further inconsistencies in the area and the lack of clear-cut limitations, but reaches no ultimate conclusions. See Vaubel, Municipal Home Rule in Ohio (1995), 22 Ohio N.U.L.Rev. 143, 212-224.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">{\u00b6 45} Our review of the case law indicates that the term \u201cstatewide concern\u201d was first mentioned in <em>Billings, </em>supra, in the context of distinguishing (for purposes of the preliminary analysis of local self-government power) between matters that are local and those that are of broader, i.e., statewide, concern. In this context, <em>Billings </em>noted:</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cThe claim of the plaintiffs in this case is that the ownership and control of the streets for the purpose of travel [are] vested in the Legislature, as the representative of the people of the state. The contention substantially is that the control of the streets is not a matter of merely local concern, but is of statewide concern, and therefore not included within the power of local self-government.\u201d 92 Ohio St. 478, 485-486, 111 N.E. 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">{\u00b6 47} Ultimately, the court decided in <em>Billings </em>that an ordinance granting the right to construct a railroad in the streets was a matter of local concern, prevailing over state statutes that required the filing of consents of abutting property owners prior to the granting of permission to erect railroads in the street. Id., 92 Ohio St. at 490-492, 111 N.E. 155. A similar approach was followed in <em>State ex rel. Strain v. Houston </em>(1941), 138 Ohio St. 203, 207, 20 O.O. 265, 34 N.E.2d 219, where the court considered, among other things, whether the state legislature could \u201cenact a general law \u2018 \u201cfixing and regulating the hours of labor\u201d \u2019 of firemen employed by cities, and providing \u2018 \u201cfor the comfort, health, safety and general welfare\u201d \u2019 of such firemen, or * * * [whether] such provisions [are] matters of local self-government, not subject to regulation or control by state legislation.\u201d Id. at 207, 20 O.O. 265, 34 N.E.2d 219. In this particular instance, the court decided that fire protection involved police powers, that the state statute was a general law, and that a conflicting municipal ordinance was invalid. Id. at 214-215, 20 O.O. 265, 34 N.E .2d 219. However, the court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>speak in terms of \u201cpreemption\u201d; instead, the analysis was based on conflicts between the state legislation and the municipal ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">{\u00b6 48} In <em>Cincinnati v. Gamble </em>(1941), 138 Ohio St. 220, 20 O.O. 273, 34 N.E.2d 226, the Ohio Supreme Court held that \u201c[i]n matters of state-wide concern the state is supreme over its municipalities and may in the exercise of its sovereignty impose duties and responsibilities upon them as arms or agencies of the state.\u201d Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus. <em>Gamble </em>involved a clash between a state retirement fund and one established by the city of Cincinnati for police and firemen. Id. at 224-225, 20 O.O. 273, 34 N.E.2d 226. The court did not discuss preemption, however, but focused instead on whether the ordinance in question conflicted with or was \u201ccontrary\u201d to the state statute. Id. at 228, 20 O.O. 273, 34 N.E.2d 226. Accord <em>State ex rel. Arey v. Sherrill </em>(1944), 142 Ohio St. 574, 583-584, 27 O.O. 505, 53 N.E.2d 501 (local provisions allowing city manager to inquire into suspension of police department member conflict with and must yield to state statutes indicating that police and fire departments are governed by civil service system).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">{\u00b6 49} Preemption is mentioned for the first time in connection with \u201cstatewide concern\u201d in <em>Arey, </em>in a concurring opinion. Justice Williams acknowledged that preemption was not at issue in either <em>Arey </em>or <em>Gamble. </em>Nonetheless, Williams expressed the opinion that:</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cWhen the state acts in a matter affecting a municipality because it is a matter of statewide concern, the field is pre-empted or closed and the municipality can not act on the same matter as is possible in case of police, sanitary or similar regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cThe doctrine of pre-emption was studiously avoided in <em>City of Cincinnati v. Gamble, </em>supra, because the question of a matter of state-wide concern becoming one regarding which the municipality could act, when the state did not, did not arise. Likewise the question is not directly made in the instant case. But when the validity of municipal legislation (other than regulations) is asserted to be based upon the fact that such legislation is not in conflict with general laws, the principles of pre-emption become an important matter of inquiry.\u201d Id., 142 Ohio St. at 589-590, 27 O.O. 505, 53 N.E.2d 501 (Williams, J, concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">{\u00b6 52} Subsequently, the Ohio Supreme Court overruled the pertinent parts of <em>Gamble </em>and <em>Arey. </em>See <em>State ex rel. Canada v. Phillips </em>(1958), 168 Ohio St. 191, 192, 5 O.O.2d 481, 151 N.E.2d 722, paragraph eight of the syllabus. <em>Canada </em>involved conflicting state and municipal provisions regarding appointment of persons who were certified after a civil service examination for positions above the rank of patrolman in a police department. Id. at 192-193, 5 O.O.2d 481, 151 N.E.2d 722. In discussing whether this was a matter of local self-government, the Ohio Supreme Court noted that it was confronted with two lines of decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>that could not be reconciled on any reasonable basis. Id. at 199, 5 O.O.2d 481, 151 N.E.2d 722. The court then said, with regard to the <em>Gamble </em>line of cases:</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">{\u00b6 53} \u201c[I]f the \u2018statewide concern\u2019 in \u2018matters relating to the members of a police department\u2019 is the basis for justifying having such matters controlled by the state, as the foregoing cited decisions from volumes 138 and 142 of our reports indicate, it would seem that there would be even more \u2018state-wide concern\u2019 to justify state control over selection of the head of the police department than there would be with respect to appointment of less important members of such police department. There is certainly no apparent language in the Constitution that can furnish any reasonable basis for preventing state interference with the appointment of the head of the department while allowing such interference with appointments of somewhat less important members thereof. Also, any such possible distinction would seem to be irreconcilable with the decision in <em>State ex rel. Arey v. Sherrill, </em>supra * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cIt is undoubtedly true that the enforcement of laws by police in every part of the state is a matter of \u2018state-wide concern.\u2019 Undoubtedly the state has power to provide for police in every part of the state to enforce its laws. Actually, in providing for sheriffs, our state laws do provide for such police. However, where a municipality establishes and operates a police department, it may do so as an exercise of the powers of local self-government conferred upon it by Sections 3 and 7 of Article XVIII of the Constitution. If it does, the mere interest or concern of the state, which may justify the state in providing similar police protection, will not justify the state\u2019s interference with such exercise by a municipality of its powers of local self-government.\u201d Id., 168 Ohio St. at 199-200, 5 O.O.2d 481, 151 N.E.2d 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">{\u00b6 55} Accordingly, the <em>Canada </em>court stated in paragraphs three and four of the syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cThe authority of the General Assembly, to enact laws applicable to cities pursuant to Section 10 of Article XV of the Constitution, is an authority to enact such laws to be applicable in cities only where and to the extent that such laws will not restrict the exercise by such cities of their powers of local self-government.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cThe words, \u2018as are not in conflict with general laws\u2019 found in Section 3 of Article XVIII of the Constitution, modify the words \u2018local police, sanitary and other similar regulations\u2019 but do not modify the words \u2018powers of local self-government.\u2019 \u201d Id., 168 Ohio St. at 191, 5 O.O.2d 481,151 N.E.2d 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">{\u00b6 58} One would think this had settled some issues. However, just four years after <em>Canada, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court stated in the syllabus of <em>State ex rel. McElroy v. Akron </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 189, 19 O.O.2d 3, 181 N.E.2d 26:</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>{\u00b6 59} \u201cThe enactment of Section 1547.61, Revised Code, constitutes a valid exercise of the police power by the state, and by the enactment of such section the state has pre-empted the authority to license watercraft whether operated on public or private waters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">{\u00b6 60} In discussing whether boat licensing involved local self-government or was a matter of statewide concern, the court first identified various policy reasons why boating was a matter of statewide concern. Id., 173 Ohio St. at 191-192, 19 O.O.2d 3,181 N.E.2d 26. The court then concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cWhere the use of property becomes statewide, local regulations in the nature of licensing in respect thereto are a harassment to the general public[;] accompanying this then is the need for a uniform standard of safety regulations, and such matters are the subject of statewide concern requiring uniform and general regulation by the state.\u201d Id., 173 Ohio St. at 193, 19 O.O.2d 3, 181 N.E.2d 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">{\u00b6 62} Moreover, regarding Home Rule, the court commented that while the amendment \u201cextends powers to municipalities as to matters which are purely of local concern, it does not invest exclusive powers in the municipalities, and the police power, by the terms of the Constitution, is limited to those regulations which do not conflict with the general law. Once a matter has become of such general interest that it is necessary to make it subject to statewide control so as to require uniform statewide regulation, the municipality can no longer legislate in the field so as to conflict with the state. It must be remembered that a city is an agency (some prefer stepchild) of the state. As we have indicated the use of boats for recreational purposes has so expanded that local licensing would place an undue burden and constitute an unwarranted harassment of those of the general public who wish to enjoy the recreation of boating and would oft times require the purchase of a season\u2019s license for a single use of a lake.\u201d Id., 173 Ohio St. at 194,19 O.O.2d 3,181 N.E.2d 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">{\u00b6 63} The court then considered preemption. This was unnecessary, since the court could have simply found that the municipal requirement of a separate boat license conflicted with the state licensing scheme. In this regard, the court decided that the municipal requirement of a license was not a regulatory act but was instead an \u201cexcise tax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">{\u00b6 64} Consequently, the court believed that municipal action was precluded because the state had entered the field. Id., 173 Ohio St. at 195,19 O.O.2d 3, 181 N.E.2d 26, citing <em>Haefner v. Youngstown, </em>147 Ohio St. 58, 33 O.O. 247, 68 N.E.2d 64. <em>Haefner, </em>in turn, was based on the fact that a municipality\u2019s taxing power may be limited under Section 13, Article XVIII, by \u201cexpress statutory provision or by implication flowing from state legislation\u201d that preempts the field. 147 Ohio St. 58, 33 O.O. 247, 68 N.E.2d 64, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>{\u00b6 65} Subsequently, however, the Ohio Supreme Court overruled <em>Haefner </em>in part in <em>Cincinnati Bell Tel. Co. v. Cincinnati </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 599, 693 N.E.2d 212 (stating in the syllabus that \u201ctaxing authority of a municipality may be preempted or otherwise prohibited only by an express act of the General Assembly\u201d). This would probably not have affected the result in <em>McElroy, </em>because the statute in that case expressly prohibited political subdivisions from charging license fees. 173 Ohio St. at 191,19 O.O.2d 3,181 N.E.2d 26. However, <em>Cincinnati Bell </em>does represent a recent narrowing of state authority by the Ohio Supreme Court, and a return to more traditional notions of the equal dignity of state and municipal power. In this context, the court noted in <em>Cincinnati Bell:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cPursuant to Section 13, Article XVIII, and Section 6, Article XIII, the Constitution confers power upon the General Assembly to limit the exercise of taxing power by a municipality. These provisions should be interpreted coextensively with the general grant of local governing authority to municipalities under Article XVIII. By the grant of this authority, the intention of the Home Rule Amendment was to eliminate statutory control over municipalities by the General Assembly. * * * Its passage granted \u2018 \u201cmunicipalities sovereignty in matters of local self-government, <em>limited only by other constitutional provisions.\u201d </em>\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added by Ohio Supreme Court.) 81 Ohio St.3d at 605, 693 N.E.2d 212, quoting from <em>Canton v. Whitman </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St.2d 62, 65, 73 O.O.2d 285, 337 N. E.2d 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">{\u00b6 67} The above language directly contrasts with the court\u2019s remarks in earlier cases. For example, the court commented in the case of <em>In re Decertification of Eastlake </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 363, 20 O.O.3d 327, 422 N.E.2d 598:</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cAs expressed in R.C. Chapters 3781 and 3791, the state has manifested a statewide concern for uniformity in building industrialized units. When the state by comprehensive statutory plan has imposed regulations statewide where there is a genuine statewide concern for uniformity in building industrialized units, any ordinance which differs from the statutes by imposing more restrictive requirements is \u2018in conflict\u2019 therewith and is ipso facto invalid.\u201d Id., 66 Ohio St.2d at 369, 20 O.O.3d 327, 422 N.E.2d 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">{\u00b6 69} The dissent in <em>Eastlake </em>pointed out that this was a misapplication of the law. In addition, the dissent noted that the cases the majority relied on did not say that more restrictive requirements imposed by ordinances would be invalid if statutes legislated over the same matter. Instead, ordinances were traditionally invalidated only if a \u201chead-on collision\u201d occurred. Id., 66 Ohio St.3d at 371, 20 O. O.3d 327, 422 N.E.2d 598 (Locher, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">{\u00b6 70} In <em>State ex rel. Evans v. Moore </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 88, 23 O.O.3d 145, 431 N.E.2d 311, the Ohio Supreme Court cited both <em>Eastlake </em>and <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Painesville, </em>15 Ohio St.2d 125, 44 O.O.2d 121, 239 N.E.2d 75, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>\u201cfundamental principle of Ohio law that, pursuant to the \u2018statewide concern\u2019 doctrine, a municipality may not, in the regulation of local matters, infringe on matters of general and statewide concern.\u201d Id. at 89-90, 23 O.O.3d 145, 431 N. E.2d 311. Accordingly, the court held in <em>Moore </em>that a state prevailing wage law \u201cpreempts and supersedes any local ordinance to the contrary.\u201d Id. at 91, 23 O.O.3d 145, 431 N.E.2d 311. Again, however, the court did not need to resort to such a doctrine, because the ordinance in question clearly conflicted with the state statute. Specifically, the prevailing wage law was a general law providing a uniform framework for workers\u2019 rights and remedies, and outlining civil and criminal sanctions for its violation. 69 Ohio St.2d at 91, 23 O.O.3d 145, 431 N.E.2d 311. The municipal ordinance directly conflicted by exempting the city and its contracts from the prevailing wage law. Id. at 88, 23 O.O.3d 145, 431 N.E.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">{\u00b6 71} Furthermore, in commenting that the state statute \u201cpreempts and supersedes any local ordinance to the contrary,\u201d the court departed from traditional analysis, which indicates that municipal ordinances will \u201cyield\u201d to state statutes, or be held \u201cinvalid,\u201d when conflict occurs. <em>Houston, </em>138 Ohio St. at 214-215, 20 O.O. 265, 34 N.E.2d 219 (ordinance \u201cinvalid\u201d); <em>Gamble, </em>138 Ohio St. 220, 228, 20 O.O. 273, 34 N.E.2d 226 (city may not take action \u201ccontrary\u201d to statute); and <em>Arey, </em>142 Ohio St. at 583-584, 27 O.O. 505, 53 N.E.2d 501 (municipal ordinance \u201cyields\u201d to state statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">{\u00b6 72} As we mentioned earlier, the Ohio Supreme Court impliedly referred to preemption in <em>Clermont, </em>in 1982, but later retracted that in <em>Fondessy Enterprises, </em>in 1986. Compare <em>Clermont, 2 </em>Ohio St.3d 44, 2 OBR, 587, 442 N.E.2d 1278, at paragraph two of the syllabus, with <em>Fondessy Enterprises, </em>23 Ohio St.3d at 216, 23 OBR 372, 492 N.E.2d 797. Thus, <em>Fondessy Enterprises </em>held that a state law would be unconstitutional if it precluded a municipality from enacting any and all legislation. 23 Ohio St.3d at 216, 23 OBR 372, 492 N.E.2d 797. In addition, the Ohio Supreme Court subsequently returned to the approach taken in <em>Billings, </em>i.e., that \u201cstatewide concern\u201d is relevant in the context of deciding whether a particular matter falls within the ambit of local self-government or is a matter of statewide concern, so that it is not included within the power of local self-government. <em>Billings, </em>92 Ohio St. at 485-486, 111 N.E. 155; State <em>Personnel Bd. of Review v. Bay Village Civ. Serv. Comm. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 214, 216-217, 28 OBR 298, 503 N.E.2d 518; <em>Fenton v. Enharo </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 69, 70-71, 31 OBR 183, 509 N.E.2d 67; and <em>Ohio Assn, of Pub. School Emp., Chapter No. 471 v. Twinsburg </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 180,183, 522 N.E.2d 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">{\u00b6 73} The Ohio Supreme Court has not discussed or specifically addressed \u201cstatewide concern\u201d since the late 1980s. In addition, the court has continued to cite and apply <em>Fondessy Enterprises. </em>For example, in <em>Sheffield v. Rowland </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 9, 716 N.E.2d 1121, the village of Sheffield filed a declaratory judgment action against a proposed demolition debris facility, alleging that the facility violated village ordinances, even though the facility complied with the rules and standards in R.C. Chapter 3714. 87 Ohio St.3d at 10-11, 716 N.E.2d 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">{\u00b6 74} The trial court held that state law preempted the village ordinances, and the court of appeals affirmed. Id., 87 Ohio St.3d at 10, 716 N.E.2d 1121. However, on further appeal, the Ohio Supreme Court did not mention preemption. Instead, the court stated that the issue was \u201cwhether Sections 660.19 and 1155.05 of the Sheffield Village Codified Ordinances are m <em>conflict with </em>R.C. Chapter 3714.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. The court then applied traditional standards for deciding conflicts. In this regard, the court noted:</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cThe test to determine when a conflict exists between a municipal ordinance and a general law of the state is \u2018whether the ordinance permits or licenses that which the statute forbids and prohibits, and vice versa.\u2019 \u201d Id., 87 Ohio St.3d at 11, 716 N.E.2d 1121, quoting <em>Struthers v. Sokol </em>(1923), 108 Ohio St. 263, 140 N.E. 519, paragraph two of the syllabus; and <em>Fondessy Enterprises, </em>23 Ohio St.3d 213, 23 OBR 372, 492 N.E.2d 797, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">{\u00b6 76} In view of the continually \u201cshifting sands\u201d of legal authority in this area, we see no purpose in applying a separate doctrine of \u201cstatewide concern.\u201d Instead, we feel this concept is more pertinent to deciding, as a preliminary matter, whether a particular issue is \u201cnot a matter of merely local concern, but is of statewide concern, and therefore not included within the power of local self-government.\u201d <em>Billings, </em>92 Ohio St. at 485-486, 111 N.E. 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">Preemption and Conflict Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">{\u00b6 77} Having rejected the application of statewide concern as a separate concept, we must next consider whether the state can expressly preempt the city from enacting any and all ordinances or regulations in the area of predatory lending. See R.C. 1.63(A) and (B). This area, again, is the subject of inconsistent decisions, and both parties have cited authority supporting their position. Compare <em>McElroy, </em>173 Ohio St. 189, 19 O.O.2d 3, 181 N.E.2d 26; <em>Eastlake, </em>66 Ohio St.2d 363, 20 O.O.3d 327, 422 N.E .2d 598; <em>Clermont, </em>2 Ohio St.3d 44, 2 OBR 587, 442 N.E.2d 1278; and <em>Ohio Assn, of Private Detective Agencies </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 242, 602 N.E.2d 1147, with <em>W. Jefferson v. Robinson </em>(1965), 1 Ohio St.2d 113, 30 O.O.2d 474, 205 N.E.2d 382; and <em>Fondessy Enterprises, </em>23 Ohio St.3d 213, 23 OBR 372, 492 N.E.2d 797. We have already discussed many of the inconsistencies among these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">{\u00b6 78} For example, in <em>Eastlake, </em>the court stated that ordinances differing from a state comprehensive regulatory plan by imposing more restrictive require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>ments are \u201cipso facto invalid.\u201d However, the court said in <em>West Jefferson </em>that if a state statute \u201cprovided for a complete prohibition upon municipal regulation,\u201d \u201c[mjanifestly such a law would not be effective to take away the power conferred upon municipalities by the plain provisions of the Constitution.\u201d 1 Ohio St.2d at 117, 30 O.O.2d 474, 205 N.E.2d 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">{\u00b6 79} To some extent, inconsistencies can be reconciled by looking at what courts actually do, as opposed to what they say. For example, in <em>Ohio Assn, of Private Detective Agencies, </em>the dissent objected to invalidating the municipal ordinance because it felt the state law was not a general law, but was simply an impermissible attempt to limit municipal power. 65 Ohio St.3d at 246-249, 602 N.E.2d 1147 (Wright, J., dissenting). However, the majority opinion in the case actually applied a conflict analysis. Id. at 244-246, 602 N.E.2d 1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">{\u00b6 80} Moreover, in <em>Fondessy Enterprises, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court clarified its prior decision in <em>Clermont. </em>Specifically, the court stated that a conflict analysis should be applied because elevating the state statute to a level of \u201cexpress preemption\u201d would mean that \u201cno police power ordinance * * * would survive long enough to face a conflict test against a state statute.\u201d <em>Fondessy Enterprises, </em>23 Ohio St.3d at 216, 23 OBR 372, 492 N.E.2d 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">{\u00b6 81} Trying to further decipher and untangle the morass of conflicting opinions over the last century would be a completely unproductive task. In the absence of clarification from the Ohio Supreme Court, we will follow the approach outlined in <em>Fondessy Enterprises. </em>Thus, instead of applying preemption, we will use a conflict analysis. We note that the Eighth District has also interpreted <em>Fondessy Enterprises </em>in this manner and has chosen to focus on conflict, rather than preemption. See <em>Fairview Park v. Barefoot Grass Lawn Serv., Inc. </em>(1996), 115 Ohio App.3d 306, 311-312, 685 N.E.2d 300. We think this is the approach the trial court tried to follow, in holding R.C. 1.63(A) and (B) unconstitutional, while still invalidating Dayton\u2019s ordinance as being in conflict with Ohio\u2019s Predatory Lending Law. To some extent, this requires a strained interpretation of the statutes, which use terms like \u201cpreempt,\u201d but it is the only way the inconsistencies can be reconciled.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Application of Conflict Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"A3k\">Exercise of Police Powers and General Laws</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\"> {\u00b6 82} As we mentioned earlier, the Ohio Supreme Court has outlined the following approach to deciding alleged conflicts between state and local ordinances. According to the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">{\u00b6 83} \u201cA state statute takes precedence over a local ordinance when (1) the ordinance is in conflict with the statute, (2) the ordinance is an exercise of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>police power, rather than of local self-government, and (3) the statute is a general law.\u201d <em>Canton, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, at \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">{\u00b6 84} We have already decided that Dayton\u2019s ordinance involves an exercise of police power, not pure local government. Likewise, we believe that the predatory lending statutes are general laws, as that term has been defined by the Ohio Supreme Court. In <em>Canton, </em>the court stated that for a state statute to be considered a \u201cgeneral law\u201d for purposes of home rule analysis, the statute must \u201c(1) be part of a statewide and comprehensive legislative enactment, (2) apply to all parts of the state alike and operate uniformly throughout the state, (3) set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations, rather than purport only to grant or limit legislative power of a municipal corporation to set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations, and (4) prescribe a rule of conduct upon citizens generally.\u201d 95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">{\u00b6 85} Dayton makes several points regarding this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">{\u00b6 86} First, Dayton claims that R.C. 1.63(A), (B), and (C)(1) and (2) and H.B. 386, Sections 3 and 4, merely serve to limit Dayton\u2019s legislative power. As a result, Dayton believes that these provisions do not qualify as statewide and comprehensive legislation and do not set forth police, sanitary, or other similar regulations. However, we disagree. Although R.C. 1.63(A), (B), and (C) do attempt to restrict municipal power, they must be read in the context of the overall legislation. In <em>Clermont, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court stressed that challenged statutory provisions \u201cshould not be read and interpreted in isolation\u201d from other pertinent parts of the Ohio Revised Code. 2 Ohio St.3d at 48, 2 OBR 587, 442 N.E.2d 1278. Although <em>Clermont </em>was clarified in <em>Fondessy Enterprises, </em>this particular holding was not modified. The Ohio Supreme Court also followed this approach in <em>Canton. </em>See 95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, at \u00b6 17 and 21-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">{\u00b6 87} As we noted earlier, R.C. 1.63(A), (B), and (C) were part of Amended Substitute H.B. 386. This bill also enacted new sections of the Revised Code (R.C. 1349.25 to 1349.37), incorporating (with some exceptions) HOEPA, which is the federal Predatory Lending Act. Both R.C. 1.63(A), (B), and (C), and Ohio\u2019s Predatory Lending Act (R.C. 1349.25 through 1349.37) relate to the offering and provision of consumer mortgage credit. Compare R.C. 1349.25(D) (\u201ccovered loan\u201d means a consumer credit mortgage loan transaction meeting certain criteria) and R.C. 1.63(A) (\u201cthe state solely shall regulate originating, granting, servicing, and collecting loans and other forms of credit\u201d). Because these statutes were part of the same legislation and relate to the same subject matter, they should be read together, even though they are codified at different parts of the Ohio Revised Code. The first requirement under <em>Canton </em>is that the statute is \u201cpart of a statewide and comprehensive legislative enactment.\u201d 95 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>149, 2002-0hio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, at syllabus. Dayton does not address this point in detail, but COHHIO and Edgemont both contend that Ohio\u2019s Predatory Lending Act is not comprehensive because it lacks effective private consumer remedies and contains \u201cgaping\u201d loopholes. For example, consumers must rely on the state superintendent of financial institutions for enforcement. Consumers also have only a private remedy of rescinding the contract. See R.C. 1349.34 and 1349.29. COHHIO and Edgemont claim that rescission is ineffective because sub-prime-rate borrowers are generally at financial risk even before a transaction begins and would not be in a position to refund the contract proceeds. This would be particularly true of elderly consumers, who frequently fall victim to unsavory schemes in which contractors talk them into expensive home repairs, arrange for predatory loans, and then disappear with the money, having performed shoddy or incomplete work.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">{\u00b6 88} An example of a loophole is the fact, for example, that a creditor may replace a zero interest loan made by a government agency with a high cost loan if the borrower consents in writing. See R.C. 1349.27(J). According to COHHIO, such paperwork can easily be slipped into a voluminous set of loan documents. Additionally, Ohio\u2019s Predatory Lending Act fails to regulate loans of up to 7.999 percent over the prime rate, meaning that creditors can still impose significant interest rates on unsuspecting borrowers.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">{\u00b6 89} Undoubtedly, more effective legislation could be written, but that is not the function of the courts. \u201cComprehensive\u201d means \u201ccovering a matter under consideration, completely accounting for or comprehending all or virtually all pertinent considerations.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International. Dictionary (1981) at 467. Notably, \u201ccomprehensive\u201d does not mean \u201cperfect.\u201d The problem with courts\u2019 making judgments about the effectiveness of legislation is that perfect legislation is never written. If the drafters had used an interest rate of 7 percent over prime, the act would be subject to criticism because loans at 6.999 percent over prime escape liability. Even if actions for civil damages had been included, in addition to the rescission remedy, the Predatory Lending Act could be challenged because it failed to include an attorney-fee provision. A damages remedy is of little use if a party cannot afford to pay attorney or litigation fees. Again, legislatures, not courts, are in the best position to make these types of policy decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">{\u00b6 90} The second requirement for a general law is that the statute \u201capply to all parts of the state alike and operate uniformly throughout the state.\u201d <em>Canton, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, at syllabus. In <em>Canton, </em>the court found that the statute did not meet this prong because it excepted suburban areas of the state, which had a chance to opt out of the law by incorporating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>restrictive covenants in deeds. Id. at \u00b6 29-30. In contrast, Ohio\u2019s Predatory-Lending Act applies uniformly across the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">{\u00b6 91} <em>Canton\u2019s </em>third criterion is that the statute \u201cset forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations, rather than purport only to grant or limit legislative power of a municipal corporation to set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations.\u201d Id. at syllabus. We have already discussed this point, and have concluded that this matter involves the police power. We further find that when the statutes are read together, R.C. 1.63 and H.B. 386, Sections 3 and 4, do not solely grant or limit legislative power.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">{\u00b6 92} The final requirement under Canton is that the statutes \u201cprescribe a rule of conduct upon citizens generally.\u201d 95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, at syllabus. No one has seriously contested this point, and we find that the matter satisfies the final criterion for a \u201cgeneral law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Does Dayton\u2019s Ordinance Conflict with State Law?</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">{\u00b6 93} Having concluded that this matter is not purely a local self-government issue and that a general law is involved, we next consider whether the Dayton ordinance conflicts with the state statutes. 95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, at \u00b6 9. Dayton does not address this point. Instead, Dayton takes the position that the constitutionality of Dayton\u2019s own ordinance was not properly before the trial court. In particular, Dayton relies on the fact that the complaint challenged only the content of R.C. 1.63 and Sections 3 and 4 of H.B. 386, and that the state failed to file counterclaims relating to city ordinances. Dayton also notes that the conflict issue and validity of Dayton\u2019s Predatory Lending Ordinance were before the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court in a previously filed action, which was stayed pending resolution of the present case. See <em>Am. Fin. Serv. Assn. v. Dayton </em>(July 12, 2002), Montgomery C.P. No. 03982 (granting stay of proceedings and denying consolidation). Accordingly, Dayton claims that the trial court erred in finding that the city ordinance conflicts with Ohio\u2019s Predatory Lending Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">{\u00b6 94} Again, we disagree. Paragraphs 15 though 18 of the complaint specifically mention Dayton\u2019s Predatory Lending Ordinance (R.C.G.O. 112.40 through 112.44) and claim that H.B. 386 attempts to render the ordinance a nullity and invalidate the city\u2019s efforts to protect its citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">{\u00b6 95} In addition, the first and second claims for relief in the complaint allege that Dayton\u2019s ordinance is an exercise of local self-government. These claims for relief further allege that H.B. 386 impermissibly violates the Home Rule provisions of the Ohio Constitution by interfering with Dayton\u2019s local self-government, and by failing to be a \u201cgeneral law.\u201d Notably, these are the very issues the trial court addressed and that have been raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>{\u00b6 96} Moreover, as we previously stressed, the challenged sections of H.B. 386 do not exist in a vacuum. They must be considered in conjunction with the rest of H.B. 386. And once that occurs, the applicable test requires that the state statute be compared with the local ordinance to see whether conflict exists. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in considering whether R.C.G.O. 112.40 though 112.44 conflict with Ohio\u2019s Predatory Lending Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">{\u00b6 97} The primary complaint about Dayton\u2019s ordinance is that it imposes stricter requirements on lenders than Ohio\u2019s statutes do. For example, loans that would not be considered predatory under state law are covered by the ordinance. Specifically, R.C.G.O. 112.40(G) defines a \u201chigh-cost loan,\u201d in pertinent part, as one secured by residential real property within the City of Dayton, \u201cif at any time over the life of the loan, the annual percentage rate of the loan equals or exceeds by more than nine (9%) percentage points * * * the yield on Treasury Securities having comparable periods of maturity to the loan maturity.\u201d In contrast, Ohio\u2019s law defines a \u201ccovered loan\u201d as one that is considered a \u201cmortgage\u201d under HOEPA, i.e., it is a loan where the \u201cannual percentage rate at consummation of the transaction will exceed by more than 10 percentage points the yield on Treasury securities having comparable periods of maturity.\u201d See R.C. 1349.25(D) and Section 152(a) of HOEPA, Section 1602(aa), Title 15, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">{\u00b6 98} Because Dayton\u2019s threshold percentage rate is lower, a loan passing muster under Ohio\u2019s statute would still be a \u201chigh cost\u201d or predatory loan under the ordinance. In addition, Ohio\u2019s Act focuses on the annual percentage rate at consummation of the transaction, while Dayton\u2019s ordinance allows enforcement if the percentage rates fit within impermissible ranges at any time during the life of the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">{\u00b6 99} A further difference is that loans are covered under Ohio\u2019s Predatory Lending Act if the total points and fees payable at or before closing exceed the greater of 8 percent of the loan amount, or $400. Id. Dayton\u2019s threshold amount, again, is lower (\u201c5% of the total loan amount or 6% of the loan amount if the total transaction amount is twenty thousand ($20,000) or more and the loan is a purchase money loan guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration or Veterans Administration, whichever is less\u201d). R.C.G.O. 112.40(G)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">{\u00b6 100} As an additional matter, the ordinance and statutes contain different provisions for loans involving balloon payments. For example, R.C.G.O. 112.40(L)(3) states that covered loans with balloon payments will be considered predatory loans unless they contain certain disclosures. In contrast, Ohio\u2019s predatory lending law allows balloon loans where the loan term is more than five years. Different disclosures are also required. See R.C. 1349.26 and 1349.27(C). Dayton\u2019s ordinance also classifies loans with mandatory arbitration clauses as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>predatory, while Ohio\u2019s Predatory Lending Act does not include loans with such clauses. R.C.G.0.112.40(L)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">{\u00b6 101} Unquestionably, the ordinance and statutes conflict. The issue, then, become whether the conflicts are permissible. Regrettably, like the other areas of municipal law that we investigated, the subject of \u201cconflict\u201d has spawned some inconsistent decisions. As Vaubel noted:</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">{\u00b6 102} \u201cIt seems apparent from constitutional debates that the proponents of Home Rule considered that their original proposal to grant Home Rule powers to municipalities included authority to municipalities to impose stricter regulations than those imposed by statute in order to meet their individual needs. Although the change in the wording of the police regulation grant in the convention may raise some doubts concerning the proper meaning to be ascribed to Section 3, Article XVIII, as finally adopted, the viewpoint that the grant of municipal power to impose stricter regulations remained intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">{\u00b6 103} \u201cUnfortunately, case law is not as clear on this point as might be desired.\u201d Vaubel, Municipal Home Rule in Ohio (1978), Chapter V, Section 62, at 692-693.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">{\u00b6 104} For example, the Ohio Supreme Court adopted a \u201cheads-on-collision\u201d test in <em>Struthers v. Sokol </em>(1923), 108 Ohio St. 263, 140 N.E. 519. In this regard, the court said that, in deciding whether a municipal ordinance conflicts with a general state statute, \u201cthe test is whether the ordinance permits or licenses that which the statute forbids and prohibits, and vice versa.\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. This is a fairly straightforward test.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">{\u00b6 105} However, the court appears to have eroded the doctrine somewhat in a few later cases by using the concept of \u201cconflict by implication.\u201d This has been described as a situation in which prohibiting one thing is considered the same as allowing what was not prohibited. See, e.g., <em>Neil House Hotel Co. v. Columbus </em>(1944), 144 Ohio St. 248, 253, 29 O.O. 403, 58 N.E.2d 665. See, also, <em>Lorain v. Tomasic </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 1, 4, 13 O.O.3d 1, 391 N.E.2d 726 (city ordinance forbidding payment of prize money in excess of $1,200 unconstitutionally conflicts with state law forbidding charities to pay out more than $3,500).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">{\u00b6 106} On the other hand, even after the decision in <em>Neil House, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court has at times refused to apply conflict by implication. For example, in <em>Benjamin v. Columbus </em>(1957), 167 Ohio St. 103, 4 O.O.2d 113, 146 N.E.2d 854, the court rejected a claim that a local gambling ordinance conflicted with state statutes. In this regard, the court noted that to the extent the state statutes failed to prohibit the possession of the machines described in the ordinance, they \u201cmay be said to permit such possession or control. However, there is no statute or constitutional provision which authorizes the possession or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>control of such machines. * * * \u2018The ordinance merely goes further than the statute in prescribing a penalty for engaging in gambling transactions not covered by the statute. The ordinance is not inconsistent with the statute.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 117-118, 4 O.O.2d 113, 146 N.E.2d 854. See, also, <em>Cleveland v. Raffa </em>(1968), 13 Ohio St.2d 112, 114, 42 O.O.2d 329, 235 N.E.2d 138 (disagreeing with contention that <em>Neil House </em>modified the test announced in <em>Struthers).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">{\u00b6 107} The Ohio Supreme Court has continued to cite and apply <em>Struthers </em>in varying situations without commenting on the inconsistency in some of its own decisions. See, e.g., <em>State v. Burnett </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 419, 431, 755 N.E.2d 857 (ordinance creating drug-exclusion zones); <em>Sheffield v. Rowland </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 9, 11, 716 N.E.2d 1121 (zoning ordinance prohibiting excavation); and <em>Middleburg Hts. v. Ohio Bd. of Bldg. Stds. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 510, 512-513, 605 N.E.2d 66 (building standards). Rather than leap into the conundrum, and distinguish cases based on nearly intangible differences, we will apply the <em>Struthers </em>test in a straightforward manner. As a matter of common sense (something that should be welcome in the law but is sometimes absent), we believe that the conflicts are such that Dayton\u2019s ordinance must be invalidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">{\u00b6 108} As an example, Ohio\u2019s Predatory Lending Act does not explicitly say that loans are permissible if their annual percentage rate at consummation of the transaction exceeds the yield on Treasury securities by less than 10 percent. Under \u201cconflict by implication,\u201d a court would conclude that a conflict exists. Under a narrower construction, another court might find no conflict. Depending on what result a court might choose to reach, case law could be found to support the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">{\u00b6 109} Nonetheless, no matter how broad or narrow the interpretation, we believe that the only reasonable inference to be drawn is that Ohio\u2019s Predatory Lending Act allows loans, i.e., does not consider loans to be \u201cpredatory,\u201d if their interest rate exceeds the yield on Treasury securities by less than 10 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">{\u00b6 110} In this regard, we focus on the fact that if the General Assembly had intended to include loans of a lesser percentage rate within the meaning of \u201ccovered loans\u201d or \u201chigh-cost loans,\u201d it would have said so. Accordingly, we agree with the trial court that Dayton\u2019s ordinance impermissibly conflicts with state law on the same subject. We stress that this does not mean that Dayton is precluded from acting in the field; it simply means that any ordinance must be tailored in a way that it will not conflict with state legislation on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">R.C. 1.63(C)(1) and Local Self-Government</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">{\u00b6 111} As we mentioned, Dayton also claims in the first assignment of error that R.C. 1.63(C)(1) unlawfully interferes with municipal powers of local self-government. This section of the statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>{\u00b6 112} \u201c(C) Any ordinance, resolution, regulation, or other action by a municipal corporation or other political subdivision constitutes a conflict with the Revised Code, including, but not limited to, Titles XI, XIII, XVII, and XLVII, and is pre-empted, if the ordinance, resolution, regulation, or other action does either of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">{\u00b6 113} \u201c(1) Disqualifies a person, or its subsidiaries or affiliates, from doing business with such municipal corporation or other political subdivision based upon the acts or practices of such person, or its subsidiaries or affiliates, as an originator, grantor, servicer, or collector of loans or other forms of credit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">{\u00b6 114} According to Dayton, this part of the statute adds \u201cinsult to injury\u201d by eliminating the city\u2019s right to refuse to contract with predatory lenders who are destabilizing Dayton\u2019s neighborhoods. In contrast, the state contends that this simply prevents indirect enforcement of an ordinance that is otherwise impermissible. We agree with the state. As a contracting entity, Dayton certainly has the ability and right to choose those business entities with which it wishes to contract. However, Dayton does not need to pass an ordinance to that effect, particularly when the clear intent is to accomplish indirectly what cannot directly be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Sections 3 and 4 of H.B. 386</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">{\u00b6 115} Dayton\u2019s final arguments in connection with the first assignment of error raise the claim that Sections 3 and 4 of H.B. 386 are not general laws and that they also violate the separation-of-powers doctrine. We have already discussed the need to read the entire Act together and will not further consider the \u201cgeneral law\u201d issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">{\u00b6 116} In Section 3 of H.B. 386, the General Assembly states, without expressly saying so, that H.B. 386 complies with legal requirements for finding that state statutes take precedence over conflicting local ordinances. For example, the General Assembly notes in Section 3 that the bill furthers the state\u2019s police powers and is also a \u201cgeneral law.\u201d And, in Section 4, the General Assembly states that R.C. 1.63 is being enacted to clarify, rather than to substantively change existing law. According to Dayton, these remarks violate the separation-of-powers doctrine under <em>State ex rel. Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers v. Sheward </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 451, 715 N.E.2d 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">{\u00b6 117} The Ohio Supreme Court stressed in <em>Sheward </em>that \u201c[t]he power and duty of the judiciary to determine the constitutionality and, therefore, the validity of the acts of the other branches of government have been firmly established as an essential feature of the Ohio system of separation of powers. * * * However, this was not always so, and a major part of our history involves a continuing effort to establish and secure this power as intrinsic to the judiciary and, indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>to establish the judiciary as a viable and coequal branch of our government.\u201d 86 Ohio St.3d at 462, 715 N.E.2d 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">{\u00b6 118} Because the General Assembly intruded upon the power of the courts, <em>Sheward </em>held Am. Sub. H.B. No. 350 (the Tort Reform Act) unconstitutional. In particular, the court noted that the Tort Reform Act \u201cis no ordinary piece of legislation that happens to inadvertently cross the boundaries of legislative authority. The General Assembly has circumvented our mandates, while attempting to establish itself as the final arbiter of the validity of its own legislation. It has boldly seized the power of constitutional adjudication, appropriated the authority to establish rules of court and overrule judicial declarations of unconstitutionality, and, under the thinly veiled guise of declaring \u2018public policy,\u2019 establishing \u2018jurisdiction,\u2019 and enacting \u2018substantive\u2019 law, forbade the courts the province of judicial review.\u201d Id., 86 Ohio St.3d at 492, 715 N.E.2d 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">{\u00b6 119} In the present case, the General Assembly\u2019s comments could be interpreted as an attempt to circumvent the authority of the courts. However, we prefer to read the comments in question as mere expressions of nonbinding opinion. Thus, this case differs from <em>Sheward. </em>As the majority in that case observed, there is a difference between the legislature\u2019s attempt to nullify court interpretations of the constitutionality of statutes and the legislature\u2019s expression of opinion as to constitutionality. Id., 86 Ohio St.3d at 506, 715 N.E.2d 1062. See, also, <em>Scancarello v. Erie Ins. Co. </em>(July 25, 1996), Franklin App. No. 96APE02-166, 1996 WL 421858, * 3 (commenting that under Ohio\u2019s \u201csystem of checks and balances, the judiciary retains the power to nullify legislative decisions if they violate a state or federal constitutional provision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">{\u00b6 120} Accordingly, we are not bound by the General Assembly\u2019s opinion about the legal effect of H.B. 386. To the contrary, courts decide whether a statute complies with legal requirements for being a \u201cgeneral law\u201d or involves the exercise of police powers. By the same token, Sections 3 and 4 of H.B. 386 do not violate the separation-of-powers doctrine simply because the General Assembly took the opportunity to voice an opinion about the bill\u2019s legal effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">{\u00b6 121} Because we have rejected all of Dayton\u2019s arguments, the first assignment of error is overruled. Notably, we have also rejected the state\u2019s argument as to ambiguity in the trial court\u2019s decision. As we said, the trial court appeared to be focusing on conflict rather than preemption. Therefore, while the court commented that R.C. 1.63(A) and (B) were unconstitutional, the court ultimately and properly invalidated Dayton\u2019s ordinance. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s comments on unconstitutionality were of no consequence to the final judgment, and the state\u2019s cross-assignment of error is also overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">{\u00b6 122} In the second assignment of error, Dayton claims that the trial court erred as a matter of law by granting judgment on the pleadings to the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">{\u00b6 123} Dayton\u2019s first argument in this context is that the trial court erred in considering Dayton\u2019s Predatory Lending Ordinance. We have already rejected this argument, because the trial court could not evaluate the state statutes in a vacuum.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">{\u00b6 124} Dayton\u2019s second contention is that the trial court erred by making improper factual findings when ruling on the state\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. Specifically, in discussing whether Dayton\u2019s ordinance involved local self government powers or police powers, the trial court remarked:</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">{\u00b6 125} \u2018While Plaintiffs argue that the predatory lending ordinance only affects members of the Dayton community, Defendants argue that if local predatory lending laws are upheld throughout the state the citizens of Ohio as a whole would be negatively affected. This court finds that the City of Dayton ordinance regulating predatory lending has effects that reach outside the municipality. The reason being that the Dayton ordinance will not hinder the overall lending of these predatory institutions that target low income families. Rather these lenders will simply expand their efforts to other communities. Due to the composition of the community Dayton is a prime target for predatory lenders. By prohibiting predatory lending in Dayton, extraterritorial cities and communities that do not have similar local legislation are affected in the sense that predatory lending would become more prevalent in these communities in an effort by these lending institutions to substitute clients not covered by the Dayton ordinance. If the lending institutions cannot solicit clients from Dayton they will turn to other communities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">{\u00b6 126} According to Dayton, the trial court\u2019s remarks were improper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, were unsupported by the record, and were insulting to the people of the city of Dayton, by implying that they are less important than persons in surrounding counties. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">{\u00b6 127} It is true that the complaint lacked allegations, for example, that Dayton\u2019s community composition offers a prime target for predatory lenders. Instead, facts supporting this point were outlined in the affidavit of City Commissioner Dean Lovelace, which was attached to Dayton\u2019s combined motion for summary judgment and response to the state\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. In addition, the amicus curiae brief Edgemont filed in the trial court commented in detail about the problem of predatory lending in Dayton. The trial court can hardly be faulted for noticing the facts that were put before it, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>though judgments on the pleadings are to be based on the allegations of the complaint. <em>Whaley, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 581, 752 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">{\u00b6 128} Nonetheless, the trial court\u2019s error, if any, was harmless for two reasons. First, the court did not base its \u201cpolice power\u201d decision on the composition of Dayton\u2019s community or on other facts outside the record. Instead, the court simply observed that if Dayton outlawed predatory lending, unethical lenders would focus on other Ohio communities. Based on this observation, the court then found that Dayton\u2019s ordinance was not purely a matter of local self-government. These were not \u201cfactual\u201d findings. Instead, they were conclusions derived from common sense. If a predatory lender cannot operate in a particular vicinity, common sense dictates that the lender will go elsewhere for its victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">{\u00b6 129} The second reason any error is harmless is that we have independently concluded that Dayton\u2019s ordinance involves police powers, i.e., the ordinance regulates conduct that is not just local or municipal in nature. Since de novo review requires our independent analysis of the record and applicable law, the trial court\u2019s alleged improper focus does not require reversal. See, e.g., <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Cope, </em>Montgomery App. No. 20179, 2004-Ohio-2603, 2004 WL 1145840, at \u00b6 12; and <em>Back v. Am. States Ins. Co. </em>(Nov. 1, 1995), Montgomery App. No. 15915, 1995 WL 643121, * 2 (holding that trial court\u2019s alleged failure to provide parties with its interpretation of an insurance policy would be harmless error, because the appellate court independently reviews policies, pursuant to its de novo review power).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">{\u00b6 130} As a final matter, the trial court\u2019s remarks did not insult the people of Dayton. Predatory lending is a serious problem, for Dayton as well as other communities. However, uniform legislation is a better way to solve the problem than having many conflicting requirements at the state and local level. If the current predatory lending law needs stronger or more effective provisions, the legislature should address the problem, as a matter of public policy. And, as we stressed, Dayton is not precluded from acting, so long as conflict with state statutes can be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">{\u00b6 131} In light of the preceding analysis, Dayton\u2019s first and second assignments of error are overruled, and the state\u2019s cross-assignment of error is also overruled. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b798-10\">Wolff and Frederick N.
