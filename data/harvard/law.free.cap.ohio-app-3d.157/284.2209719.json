Corrigan, Administrative Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">{\u00b6 1} William Turchyn and Maria Turchyn (collectively, \u201cappellants\u201d) appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment granting appellees\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> joint motion to dismiss appellants\u2019 amended complaint for failure to state a claim and lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">{\u00b6 2} The gravamen of appellants\u2019 lengthy amended complaint is twofold. First, appellants allege that, as parishioners of St. Vladimir\u2019s Ukrainian Orthodox Church (\u201cSt. Vladimir\u2019s\u201d), they were harmed when their diocese, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the United States of America (interchangeably referred to as \u201cUOC-USA\u201d or \u201cdiocese\u201d), decided in 1995 to be recognized by and fall under the spiritual direction of the Ecumenical Patriarch in Turkey. It appears that appellants disapproved of the UOC-USA\u2019s decision, as they preferred St. Vladimir\u2019s (and the diocese) to be directly affiliated with the Orthodox Church in Kiev, Ukraine. Second, William Turchyn alleges that he was harmed when the clergy of St. Vladimir\u2019s decided in 1999 to place him on \u201cspiritual suspension\u201d surrendering his \u201cprivilege to receive the Mystery of Holy Communion\u201d for his \u201cactions * * * opposite to the teachings of the Holy Ukrainian Orthodox Church.\u201d Appellants allege that both the 1995 decision and the 1999 decision constituted a pattern of corrupt activity, fraud, and a scheme to defraud St. Vladimir\u2019s members of property and assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">{\u00b6 3} Appellees filed a joint motion to dismiss, arguing that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because appellants\u2019 claims depended upon resolution and review of religious doctrine and that appellants failed to state a valid claim upon which relief can be granted under R.C. 2923.31 et seq., Ohio\u2019s Pattern of Corrupt Activity Act (\u201cOhio RICO\u201d). Appellants filed a brief in opposition to appellees\u2019 joint motion to dismiss, as well as three supplemental briefs. By leave of court, appellees filed a reply memorandum in support of their joint motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court, in granting appellees\u2019 joint motion to dismiss for \u201cfailure to state a claim and lack of subject matter jurisdiction,\u201d reasoned as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>{\u00b6 5} \u201cUnder Ohio RICO, \u2018[n]o person employed by, or associated with any enterprise shall conduct or participate in, directly or indirectly, the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of corrupt activity.\u2019 Ohio Rev.Code 2923.32(A)(1). To state a valid claim under RICO, plaintiffs must plead with particularity: (1) conduct of defendants which involves the commission of two or more specifically prohibited state or federal criminal offenses; (2) the prohibited criminal conduct of the defendants constitute^] a pattern of corrupt activity; and (3) the defendants have participated in the affairs of an enterprise or has [sic] acquired and maintained interest in or control of an enterprise. <em>Universal Coach, Inc., v. New York City Transit Authority, </em>90 Ohio App.3d 284, 291 [629 N.E.2d 28]. The court finds that plaintiffs\u2019 blanket allegations of wrongdoing on the part of church officials and parishioners do not satisfy the Universal Test. Additionally, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations neither meet the definition of \u2018corrupt activity\u2019 as defined by Ohio Rev.Code 2923.31(1), nor do they sufficiently establish the existence of an \u2018enterprise\u2019 acting apart from the patter[n] of activity in which i[t] engages. <em>Patton v. Wilson </em>(June 26, 2003), Cuyahoga County App. No. 82079, 2003 WL 21473566. The court also notes that plaintiffs\u2019 claims as to William Turchyn\u2019s \u2018spiritual suspension\u2019 require interpretation of ecclesiastical issues of religious governance and the court declines to exercise jurisdiction over internal parish procedure, finding it more properly a matter for church discipline. <em>Shariff v. Rahman </em>([Mar. 20], 2003) [152 Ohio App.3d 210, 787 N.E.2d 72], Cuyahoga County App. No. 80745, 2003 WL 1354345.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">{\u00b6 6} Appellants now appeal, asserting four assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">{\u00b6 7} For their first assignment of error, appellants contend that the trial court abused its discretion when it converted appellees\u2019 joint motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment without notifying all parties and not permitting appellants adequate time for discovery. Appellants\u2019 contention, however, is wholly inaccurate, as there is nothing in the record before us that suggests that the trial court converted appellees\u2019 joint motion to dismiss, based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, into a motion for summary judgment. The trial court specifically ruled upon and granted appellees\u2019 joint motion to dismiss. Thus, appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">{\u00b6 8} In their second and third assignments of error, appellants contend that the trial court abused its discretion when it found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over their claims. Specifically, appellants assert that the trial court had jurisdiction to determine whether St. Vladimir acted appropriately when the diocese and St. Vladimir\u2019s chose to be affiliated with the Ecumenical Patriarch in Turkey and when the clergy of St. Vladimir\u2019s suspended William <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Turchyn\u2019s right to receive Holy Communion. Appellants\u2019 assertions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">{\u00b6 9} It should be noted that the trial court did not dismiss appellants\u2019 claims as to the 1995 decision to be affiliated with the Ecumenical Patriarch in Turkey because it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Instead, the trial court expressly stated that it declined jurisdiction only over William Turchyn\u2019s \u201cspiritual suspension\u201d claim because it \u201crequire[d] interpretation of ecclesiastical issues of religious governance * * * [which is] more properly a matter for church discipline.\u201d Appellants\u2019 claims as to the 1995 decision were dismissed for failure to state a claim under Ohio RICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">{\u00b6 10} In <em>Tibbs v. Kendrick </em>(1994), 93 Ohio App.3d 35, 43, 637 N.E.2d 397, this court set forth a two-step analysis to determine whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction to resolve a dispute between church members. First, the court must determine whether the church is a hierarchical or congregational church. Id. If the church is hierarchical, the court must decline jurisdiction. If the church is congregational, the court must determine whether the controversy involves ecclesiastical or secular issues. If the controversy is determined to be ecclesiastical, the court must decline jurisdiction. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">{\u00b6 11} Here, regardless of whether St. Vladimir\u2019s is a hierarchical or congregational church, the propriety of suspending a parishioner\u2019s privilege to receive Holy Communion is purely an ecclesiastical issue. For example, in <em>Shariff v. Rahman, </em>152 Ohio App.3d 210, 2003-Ohio-1336, 787 N.E.2d 72, this court affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of mosque members\u2019 claims that they had been improperly excluded by the imam from participating in congregational prayer because the determination involved a review of ecclesiastical matters of the mosque. Because William Turchyn\u2019s \u201cspiritual suspension\u201d necessarily involves ecclesiastical matters of St. Vladimir\u2019s, this court properly dismissed this claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Appellants\u2019 second and third assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">{\u00b6 12} For their fourth and final assignment of error, appellants contend that the trial court erred when it found that appellants failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Ohio RICO.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 contention is without merit, even when reviewing appellants\u2019 allegations in the light most favorable to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>{\u00b6 13} To maintain a valid action under Ohio RICO, the following three threshold requirements must be met:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(1) conduct of the defendant which involves the commission of two or more of specifically prohibited state or federal criminal offenses;</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(2) the prohibited criminal conduct of the defendant constitutes a pattern of corrupt activity; and</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(3) the defendant has participated in the affairs of an enterprise or has acquired and maintained an interest in or control of an enterprise.\u201d <em>Universal Coach, Inc. v. New York City Transit Auth. </em>(1993), 90 Ohio App.3d 284, 291, 629 N.E.2d 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">{\u00b6 17} First, appellants failed to allege that appellees\u2019 conduct involved the commission of two or more of the specifically prohibited state or federal criminal offenses and that such conduct constituted a pattern of corrupt activity. The decision of the diocese and St. Vladimir\u2019s to be affiliated with the Ecumenical Patriarch in Turkey is not a designated crime under Ohio and federal criminal statutes constituting \u201ccorrupt activity.\u201d Likewise, the decision of the clergy of St. Vladimir\u2019s to place William Turchyn on \u201cspiritual suspension\u201d is also not a designated crime under Ohio and federal criminal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\"> {\u00b6 18} Although appellants allege that their pastor\u2019s salary constituted a misappropriation of corporate funds because the pastor used church letterhead to promote opinions and viewpoints contrary to those held by appellants, criminal misappropriation does not include an employee\u2019s receipt of salary. And although appellants allege that their pastor laundered money when he solicited and received $25,000 from St. Vladimir\u2019s for a charitable organization, appellants failed to further allege that the monies were collected for an unlawful activity or never given to the charity. Instead, appellants allege that when the pastor collected the money, he failed to disclose an \u201caffiliation\u201d with the Ecumenical Patriarch in Turkey. The failure to disclose this affiliation is not a designated crime under Ohio and federal criminal statutes constituting \u201ccorrupt activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">{\u00b6 19} Second, appellants failed to allege an enterprise. Because an enterprise may not be composed simply of a corporation and its officers or employees, appellants\u2019 allegation that the \u201centerprise\u201d consisted of all appellees who were employed by or associated with St. Vladimir\u2019s does not suffice. <em>Patton v. Wilson, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82079, 2003-Ohio-3379, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">{\u00b6 20} Because the failure of a plaintiff to plead any of the elements necessary to establish a violation under Ohio RICO results in a defective complaint that cannot withstand a motion to dismiss based upon a failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, appellants\u2019 \u201cblanket allegations,\u201d without more, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>properly dismissed by the trial court. See <em>Universal Coach, </em>90 Ohio App.3d at 291, 629 N.E.2d 28. Appellants\u2019 fourth assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment of the trial court granting appellees\u2019 joint motion to dismiss is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">{\u00b6 21} The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-7\">Frank D. Celebrezze Jr. and Anthony 0. Calabrese Jr., JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-9\">. The appellees consist of appellants' pastor and deacon, 20 current or former members of the Board of Trustees of St. Vladimir\u2019s Ukrainian Orthodox Church, and the Metropolitan of Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the United States of America. They include John R. Nakonachny, Geofrey Greenleaf, Greenleaf Capital Management, Helen Greenleaf, Fr. Deacon Ihor Mahlay, Metropolitan Constantine, Archbishop Antony, Rev. Volodymyr Steliac, Rev. Dennis Kristof, Michael Kominko, Steven Gregory Pawuk, Paul Burlij, Jack Burscu, Lydia Schkurko, Wasyl Kotelewec, Eugene Boyko, Michael Dobronos Sr., Hans Harasimchuk, Alex Hutnik, Lucy Komichak, Roman Malysz, Iwan Michailuk, Wasyl Ponomarenko, Olga Samocha, Deborah Sirko-Osadsa, Eugene Wrubel, Dr. Anaolij Lysyj, Rev. Frank Estocin, Michael Heretz, and John and Jane Does.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b323-8\">. Appellants also reassert here the argument raised in their second assignment of error. However, because this court has already addressed appellants' second assignment of error, the remaining issue raised by appellants relates to Ohio RICO.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
