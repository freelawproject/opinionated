On appeal, Carter advances four assignments of error. Upon our determination that Carter was entitled to a hearing on his petition, we reverse the judgment of the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">{\u00b6 2} In June 1992, a Hamilton County jury found Carter guilty of aggravated robbery and aggravated murder in connection with the shooting death of a convenience store clerk during an armed robbery. The trial court imposed for aggravated murder a sentence of death. Carter\u2019s convictions were upheld on direct appeal to this court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and to the Ohio Supreme Court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the United States Supreme Court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">{\u00b6 3} In November 1997, we affirmed the common pleas court\u2019s denial of Carter\u2019s first postconviction petition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Ohio Supreme Court declined jurisdiction in his appeal of our decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">{\u00b6 4} In June 1999 and September 2000, Carter filed applications to reopen his direct appeal. We denied the applications. Carter appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court our denial of his second application. The Supreme Court affirmed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">{\u00b6 5} On June 6, 2003, Carter filed with the common pleas court a second postconviction petition. In this petition, he advanced a single claim for relief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>requesting that his death sentence be vacated or set aside on the ground that he is mentally retarded and thus that his execution would violate the proscription against cruel and unusual punishment contained in the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Carter filed with his petition an array of motions, seeking, among other things, the funds to retain a mental-retardation expert. On August 7, 2003, the common pleas court summarily denied the petition and the motions, and Carter appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">{\u00b6 6} In his first assignment of error, Carter contends that the common pleas court erred in denying his motion for funds for a mental-retardation expert and in denying his postconviction petition without an evidentiary hearing. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">A. <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Lott</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">{\u00b6 7} On June 20, 2002, the United States Supreme Court ruled in <em>Atkins v. </em>Virginia<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that executing a mentally retarded individual violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s proscription against cruel and unusual punishment. Having declared the principle, the court \u201c \u2018le[ft] to the State[s] the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the state of Virginia had disputed Atkins\u2019s claim of mental retardation, the court remanded to the state court the issue of whether Atkins was \u201cso impaired as to fall within the range of mentally retarded offenders [against] who[se] [execution] there [had emerged] a national consensus.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">{\u00b6 8} On December 11, 2002, the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>State v. </em>Lott<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> undertook the task of developing the procedures for enforcing the Eighth Amendment\u2019s proscription against executing the mentally retarded and the substantive standards for adjudicating a capital defendant\u2019s claim that he is mentally retarded. The court declared that \u201c[t]he procedures for postconviction relief outlined in R.C. 2953.21 et seq. provide[d] a suitable statutory framework for reviewing [an] <em>Atkins </em>claim.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">{\u00b6 9} The court in <em>Lott </em>acknowledged that the Supreme Court in <em>Atkins </em>had recognized a new federal right that applied retrospectively to convicted murder<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>ers facing the death penalty.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, a petitioner who had been sentenced to death before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Atkins </em>could seek review of his <em>Atkins </em>claim in a late or successive postconviction petition by invoking the jurisdiction conferred under R.C. 2953.23.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">{\u00b6 10} But the court in <em>Lott </em>recognized that a defendant who had been sentenced to death before the decision in <em>Atkins </em>had not had a full and fair opportunity to litigate a claim of mental retardation as a complete bar to the death penalty.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, the court viewed a postconviction petition \u201cfiled for the first time since <em>Atkins </em>[had] established the new standard for mental retardation * * * [to be] more akin to a first petition than a successive petition for postconviction relief.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This consideration prompted the court to conclude that the doctrine of \u201cres judicata d[id] not bar [a postconviction <em>Atkins </em>] claim,\u201d and that \u201cdue process <em>now </em>require[d] consideration of [a capital defendant\u2019s] evidence of mental retardation before he is executed.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Emphasis sic.) Moreover, the court elected to depart from R.C. 2953.23 by granting a petitioner who had been sentenced to death before its decision in <em>Lott </em>180 days from the date of the decision to present his postconviction <em>Atkins </em>claim. Thereafter, a petitioner could seek review of his <em>Atkins </em>claim in a late or successive postconviction petition only if, with certain qualifications, he had satisfied the jurisdictional requirements of R.C. 2953.23.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">{\u00b6 11} The court in <em>Lott </em>looked to the clinical definitions of mental retardation, cited with approval by the Supreme Court in <em>Atkins, </em>to provide three criteria for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>evaluating a capital defendant\u2019s claim that he is mentally retarded.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The court determined that the clinical definitions required the defendant to demonstrate \u201c(1) significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, (2) significant limitations in two or more adaptive skills, such as communication, self-care, and self-direction, and (3) onset before the age of 18.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">{\u00b6 12} The court in <em>Lott </em>cautioned that an IQ test score is merely one measure of intellectual functioning that \u201calone [is] not sufficient to make a final determination on [the mental-retardation] issue.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> But the Supreme Court in <em>Atkins </em>had based its holding, in part, upon what it saw as a \u201cnational consensus\u201d against executing the mentally retarded that had emerged from the growing number of state statutes that prohibited the practice.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> And the court in <em>Lott, </em>pursuing a similar line of reasoning, looked to those statutes, saw that \u201c[m]ost\u201d of the statutes \u201crequire[d] evidence that the individual ha[d] an IQ of 70 or below,\u201d and thus held that an IQ score above 70 gave rise to \u201ca rebuttable presumption that a defendant [was] not mentally retarded.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">{\u00b6 13} The court in <em>Lott </em>contemplated that a common pleas court would conduct its mental-retardation inquiry \u201cin a manner comparable to\u201d an inquiry into a question of competency. Thus, the court imposed upon the defendant the burden of establishing that he was mentally retarded by a preponderance of the evidence and committed the determination of mental retardation to the common pleas court, rather than to a jury. Further, the court instructed the common pleas court to \u201crely on professional evaluations of [the defendant\u2019s] mental status, and [to] consider expert testimony, appointing experts if necessary.\u201d Finally, the court required the common pleas court to memorialize the bases for its decision in the form of written findings.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">B. The Postconviction Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">{\u00b6 14} Carter presented his <em>Atkins </em>claim in a postconviction petition filed within 180 days from the date of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lott. </em>Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>the common pleas court had jurisdiction to entertain his petition under R.C. 2953.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">{\u00b6 15} R.C 2953.21(A)(1) requires a postconviction petitioner to demonstrate a denial or infringement of his rights in the proceedings resulting in his conviction that have rendered the conviction void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the United States Constitution. In advancing such a claim, the petitioner bears the initial burden of demonstrating, through the petition and any supporting affidavits and the files and records of the case, \u201csubstantive grounds for relief.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">{\u00b6 16} A postconviction claim is subject to dismissal without a hearing if the petitioner has failed to submit with his petition evidentiary material setting forth sufficient operative facts to demonstrate substantive grounds for relief.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Conversely, \u201cthe court shall proceed to a prompt hearing on the issues\u201d if \u201cthe petition and the files and records of the case show the petitioner is * * * entitled to relief.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">{\u00b6 17} To the extent that Carter\u2019s first assignment of error is directed against the denial of his motion for funds to retain a mental-retardation expert, it presents, in essence, a challenge to the common pleas court\u2019s failure to permit discovery. We have long held that the postconviction statutes do not contemplate discovery in the initial stages of a postconviction proceeding.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> But Carter was entitled to discovery to develop his claim, including the experts necessary to aid in that discovery and to assist in presenting the claim, if the petition and its supporting evidentiary material demonstrated substantive grounds for relief.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">{\u00b6 18} Carter\u2019s intellectual limitations were explored as a possible mitigating factor during the penalty phase of his trial.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> To facilitate that inquiry, the trial court had appointed a clinical psychologist to examine Carter, who was then 19 years old. The psychologist testified at the sentencing hearing that, as a small child, Carter had been slow to reach some developmental milestones, that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>needed speech therapy, and that he had been hospitalized for a serious medical problem at the age of four. Between the ages of five and nine, Carter had performed \u201crelatively well\u201d in school, receiving As, Bs, and Cs. But on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, administered when he was 12, Carter received a full scale IQ score of 76, thus displaying \u201can intellectual ability in the range of borderline mentally retarded.\u201d The psychologist speculated that the disparity between Carter\u2019s school performance and his IQ score may have been attributable to \u201ca learning disability and some sort of dysfunction in [his] brain.\u201d During his grade-school years, Carter was also physically clumsy, and his peers viewed him as a \u201cslow learner\u201d and teased him about his \u201climited intellectual ability,\u201d making it difficult for him to make friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">{\u00b6 19} By the age of 13, Carter\u2019s academic performance had dropped precipitously. He wanted to drop out of school then, but, at his mother\u2019s urging, he remained in school until he was 16. Those and the ensuing years were marked by drug and alcohol abuse, thefts, physically abusive behavior toward people and animals, anger- and impulse-control problems, and problems with finding and keeping a job. Also, several times in each of the years between the ages of 12 and 19, Carter sustained injuries that required emergency-room treatment, and, during that period, he underwent outpatient psychiatric treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">{\u00b6 20} In the course of his evaluation for sentencing, Carter displayed a \u201climited ability to read and write.\u201d As part of his evaluation, he took an IQ test. But the test results were invalidated upon the test administrator\u2019s suspicion that Carter had given false responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">{\u00b6 21} Upon the information before him, the psychologist concluded that Carter was \u201cborderline mentally retarded with limited intellectual ability\u201d that placed him \u201cin the bottom 5 percent of the nation intellectually.\u201d He further concluded that Carter was \u201csubstance dependent,\u201d and that he suffered from an \u201canti-social personality,\u201d evidenced by \u201calienation\u201d and \u201cdifficulty\u201d in his personal relationships and by being \u201ceasily led by others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">{\u00b6 22} The evidence adduced during the penalty phase of Carter\u2019s trial concerning his intellectual limitations certainly was relevant to the common pleas court\u2019s postconviction inquiry into Carter\u2019s <em>Atkins </em>claim. But the inquiry at Carter\u2019s sentencing hearing was directed at determining whether, for purposes of mitigation, Carter, \u201cat the time of committing the offense, * * * because of a mental disease or defect, [had] lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> It was not intended to probe the issue, presented by Carter\u2019s <em>Atkins </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>claim, of whether he was so impaired that his execution would constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">{\u00b6 23} In support of his <em>Atkins </em>claim, Carter offered Social Security Administration records, the report of the Hamilton County Justice Center\u2019s staff psychiatrist, and the affidavit of a psychologist experienced in assessing and treating mentally retarded and developmentally disabled individuals. The Social Security Administration records showed that, in 1992, Carter had been deemed eligible for supplemental security income based upon a psychologist\u2019s determination in 1986, when Carter was 13, that he was mentally retarded. The justice-center psychiatrist found that Carter had \u201clikely\u201d suffered from learning disabilities as a child; that he had exhibited \u201cdemonstrable cognitive limitations\u201d and \u201climited intellectual abilities\u201d that might have been attributable to a head injury sustained in early adolescence or to his heavy substance abuse as a teenager; that he had also exhibited an \u201cantisocial personality disorder along with features of sadistic personality disorder\u201d; and that \u201c[diagnoses [had] appeared] to be most consistent with probable mental retardation[,] * * * attention deficit disorder[,] * * * and organic impairment.\u201d Finally, the psychologist with expertise in mental retardation reviewed the trial record, the Social Security Administration records, and the justice center psychiatrist\u2019s report in light of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s definition of \u201cmental retardation\u201d and found them to contain \u201cstrong indications of mental retardation\u201d that warranted \u201cfurther testing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">{\u00b6 24} In support of its motion to dismiss Carter\u2019s postconviction petition, the state offered those parts of the trial record that suggested that Carter did not meet the criteria for mental retardation established in <em>Lott </em>and a printout from Carter\u2019s personal website. The website, the state asserted, showed Carter\u2019s \u201cwritten communication skills with a well thought out and deliberately worded essay seeking a pen pal\u201d and displayed \u201cartwork [that] reflected] a depth of human expression and communication that belie[d] his claim of * * * limited mental capabilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">{\u00b6 25} Carter\u2019s postconviction petition, with its supporting affidavits and the files and records of the case, presented factual issues as to whether he has, since before the age of 18, suffered from \u201csignificantly subaverage intellectual functioning\u201d and \u201csignificant limitations in two or more adaptive skills\u201d such that he cannot, consistent with the Eighth Amendment, be executed. Having thus sustained his burden of demonstrating substantive grounds for relief, Carter is entitled to a hearing on his postconviction claim and to discovery and the expert assistance needed to develop and present his claim.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>{\u00b6 26} We, therefore, hold that the common pleas court erred when it dismissed Carter\u2019s petition without a hearing. Accordingly, we sustain the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">{\u00b6 27} In his second assignment of error, Carter contends that the common pleas court erred in failing to appoint a mental-retardation expert. In his third assignment of error, he contends that the court denied him his due-process, equal-protection, and Eighth Amendment rights when it presumed that he was not mentally retarded based on his IQ score of over 70. And in his fourth assignment of error, he challenges the denial of his motion for a jury determination of the mental-retardation issue. Our disposition of the first assignment of error renders moot the challenges presented in the second, third, and fourth assignments of error. We, therefore, do not reach the merits of those challenges.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">{\u00b6 28} Upon our determination that the common pleas court erred when it dismissed Carter\u2019s postconviction petition without a hearing, we reverse the judgment entered below and remand this cause for further proceedings consistent with the law and this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b731-9\">Winkler, P.J., and Painter, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-13\">.
