The trial court sentenced him to maximum, consecutive terms of incarceration. The trial court further sentenced Morris to a three-year term of incarceration because Morris had committed the felonies while he was on post-release control.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">{\u00b6 2} On appeal, Morris now argues (1) that his maximum and consecutive sentences for the drug offenses were contrary to law; (2) that the court erred in imposing the additional three-year term of incarceration; and (3) that the court erred by clearing spectators from the courtroom during the sentencing hearing. We sustain the third assignment of error, vacate the sentences imposed, and remand this case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">\n<em>Morris\u2019s Sentencing Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">{\u00b6 3} After the trial court imposed the maximum sentences upon Morris for the possession and trafficking offenses, the following transpired on the record:</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cTHE COURT: Ma\u2019am, let\u2019s leave the courtroom. Leave the courtroom, please.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: That\u2019s six-and-a-half years for two fuckin\u2019 dope cases. How could you give me six-and-a-half years for two dope cases? That is injustice, man.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cTHE SHERIFF: I have got a couple of sheriffs coming.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-15\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cTHE COURT: Let\u2019s get the sheriffs back here.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-16\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: You give me six-and-a-half years.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-17\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cTHE COURT: Remove all those people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-18\">{\u00b6 11} Following that exchange, the court continued with the sentencing hearing and ordered the maximum prison terms to run consecutively. The court then imposed the additional three-year prison term before the hearing concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\n<em>The Right to a Public Trial Extends to The Sentencing Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">{\u00b6 12} A criminal defendant\u2019s right to a speedy and public trial is guaranteed by both Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied through the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The right of the public to attend criminal trials is also implicit within the guarantees of the First Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, the right to a public trial extends to pretrial as well as to trial proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">{\u00b6 13} Furthermore, sentencing, \u201ceven if it occurs in a separate hearing, * * * clearly amounts to the culmination of the trial. * * * [E]ven if * * * sentencing hearings are not considered part of the trial itself, they are surely as much an integral part of the criminal prosecution as are preliminary probable-cause hearings, suppression hearings, or bail hearings, all of which have been held to be subject to the public\u2019s First Amendment right of access.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the sentencing hearing is an essential part of the criminal trial itself, we hold that the right to a public trial extends to the sentencing hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But the right is not absolute. A trial court is responsible for the conduct of courtroom proceedings and, in limited circumstances, has discretion to order the exclusion of spectators.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> So the court may order the exclusion of spectators so long as it does not inappropriately deny the defendant\u2019s right to a public trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">{\u00b6 14} This court has stated, \u201cTo close a trial proceeding, the court must consider various factors. [Citations omitted.] First, the trial court must determine that there is an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced if the courtroom is not closed. Second, the trial court must determine whether there are reasonable alternatives available that will protect that interest yet preserve a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial. Third, it must issue an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>that is no broader than necessary to preserve the stated interest. Finally, the court must make findings adequate to support the closure.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">{\u00b6 15} In this case, it is apparent that initially the court had asked a female to leave the courtroom before ordering the removal of \u201call those people.\u201d The record does not indicate the identity of the persons who were subject to the court\u2019s removal order or whether the courtroom was cleared of all spectators. Moreover, the record is silent as to any conduct that would have prompted the removal order or that would have prompted the sheriffs deputy to interject that more deputies were on their way to the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 16} The trial court\u2019s actions in ordering the removal of certain individuals may well have been warranted and entirely appropriate due to disruptive conduct that impeded an overriding interest in the court\u2019s orderly administration of its docket. Certainly, a serious disruption must have occurred in the courtroom to trigger the removal order by this very experienced trial judge. But, on the record before us, we cannot say that the removal of some or all of the spectators was necessary to protect an overriding interest, that there were no viable alternatives to the removal, or that the order was narrow enough to protect only an overriding interest.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, we sustain the third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 17} With respect to Morris\u2019s first assignment of error, the trial court\u2019s sentence may well have been supported by appropriate findings and the reasons stated for those findings. And as to Morris\u2019s second assignment of error, the court\u2019s imposition of a term of incarceration for the commission of two felonies in violation of post-release control would have been appropriate under R.C. 2929.141.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But our ruling on the third assignment of error renders Morris\u2019s first and second assignments of error moot.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">{\u00b6 18} Accordingly, we vacate the sentences and remand this case to the trial court for resentencing. Should the court impose a consecutive term of incarceration for the violation of post-release control under R.C. 2929.141, the imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>term must be equal to the balance of time Morris would have spent on post-release control.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Sentences vacated and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b434-5\">Hildebrandt, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b434-6\">Painter, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-19\">.

Something was obviously wrong in the courtroom. It is highly unusual for a sheriffs deputy to have to call for assistance during sentencing. That being noted, this court has twice held that in order for a trial court to close a courtroom to spectators, the trial judge must make an appropriate finding supporting the closure of the courtroom on the record.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That was not done here, so we are constrained to reverse the imposition of the sentences.</p>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b434-12\">.

A trial judge has not only the power, but the duty to eject disruptive people from the courtroom. It just has to be done properly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
