The only issue raised in this appeal is whether defendant-appellee Donald Campbell was the subject of an investigative stop, or whether there was a mere consensual encounter between Campbell and the police officer, who ultimately found what appeared to be Valium, a controlled substance, upon Campbell\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">{\u00b6 2} Both the arresting police officer and Campbell testified at the suppression hearing. The trial court concluded that Campbell was the subject of an investigative stop, not merely a consensual encounter, and ordered the evidence suppressed. Both in the trial court and on appeal, the state argues only that the circumstances amounted to no more than a consensual encounter. The state appears to recognize that the circumstances did not justify the police officer in performing an investigative stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">{\u00b6 3} We conclude that the evidence in the record supports the trial court\u2019s findings. Accordingly, the suppression order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">{\u00b6 4} Dayton police officer Doug George was patrolling the 2200 block of West Second Street, in Dayton, shortly before 5:00 p.m. in the afternoon in late September 2003. George was in uniform and armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">{\u00b6 5} George saw Campbell sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a vehicle parked at the curb. Campbell was the sole occupant. The engine was not running. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>{\u00b6 6} George was familiar with the neighborhood and described it as a high-crime area, where there had been drug-related complaints and arrests. George was not familiar with Campbell. George decided to make contact with Campbell and attempt a field interview. George did not claim to have any particular suspicion that Campbell was involved in criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">{\u00b6 7} The state contends in its brief that George parked his cruiser approximately five to six car lengths behind Campbell\u2019s vehicle, but our reading of this testimony is different. We conclude that George\u2019s discussion of the number of car lengths behind Campbell\u2019s vehicle referred to the point where George turned around to pull in behind him. The trial court found that George\u2019s cruiser was parked immediately behind Campbell\u2019s vehicle, blocking Campbell in that direction, and we conclude that the evidence is susceptible of that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">{\u00b6 8} Campbell testified that George \u201cjumped out\u201d of the police cruiser and came up to Campbell\u2019s side of the car within five seconds to engage him in conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">{\u00b6 9} In terms of the substance of their conversation, Campbell\u2019s testimony corroborated George\u2019s. Campbell testified that not more than 20 to 30 seconds elapsed from when George came up to Campbell to George\u2019s asking Campbell for his identification. Campbell produced his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">{\u00b6 10} Campbell testified that he has previously been involved in a traffic stop and that the only thing different about this encounter from the time he was subject to a traffic stop was that on this occasion he had not been driving or moving before the police officer came up behind him.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">{\u00b6 11} George took Campbell\u2019s license back to George\u2019s cruiser to run a computer check. This check revealed that there was a warrant outstanding for Campbell\u2019s arrest. During a search incident to that arrest, a substance that George believed to be Valium was recovered from Campbell\u2019s right front pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">{\u00b6 12} Campbell was subsequently charged with drug abuse, a misdemeanor of the third degree. Campbell moved to suppress the evidence, contending that it was obtained as the result of an unlawful search and seizure. Following a hearing, the trial court granted Campbell\u2019s motion and ordered the evidence suppressed. The state appeals from the order of the trial court suppressing the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">{\u00b6 13} The state\u2019s sole assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting defendant-appellee\u2019s motion to suppress evidence when the encounter between the police officer and defendantappellee was a consensual encounter and raised no Fourth Amendment issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">{\u00b6 15} The state relies upon <em>California v. Hodari </em>(1991), 499 U.S. 621, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 113 L.Ed.2d 690, for the general proposition that the test for determining whether a police-citizen encounter rises from the level of a consensual encounter to the level of a seizure is whether a reasonable person, in light of all of the surrounding circumstances, would feel free to decline the officer\u2019s request or otherwise refuse the encounter. This is obviously a fact-sensitive determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">{\u00b6 16} The state relies specifically upon <em>State v. Montgomery </em>(May 31, 1996), Montgomery App. No. 15232, 1996 WL 283943, for the proposition that the interaction between George and Campbell was merely a consensual encounter. In <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>an officer in a police cruiser asked a pedestrian to come to the cruiser. The officer told the pedestrian that the officer wanted to get the pedestrian\u2019s name and check him out for a second. When the pedestrian started walking back toward the cruiser, the officer noticed that the pedestrian had his hand in his right pocket. Based on the fact that weapons were not uncommon in that area, and out of a concern for the officer\u2019s safety, the officer asked the pedestrian to take his right hand out of his pocket, but the pedestrian did not take his hand out of his pocket, while continuing to approach the cruiser. When the pedestrian was two or three feet away from the cruiser, the officer shined his spotlight at the pedestrian, and ordered the pedestrian to remove his right hand from his pocket. The pedestrian then removed his hand from his pocket and tossed to the ground a substance that was later determined to have been crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">{\u00b6 17} Although the issue is close, we conclude that the circumstances in the case before us are materially different from the circumstances in <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>supra. The defendant in <em>Montgomery </em>was a pedestrian who was asked to come talk to a police officer in a cruiser. Campbell was the lone occupant of a car, sitting in the driver\u2019s seat. The car was parked at a curb. The police cruiser had pulled up immediately behind Campbell, and George, the police officer, went immediately to the driver\u2019s side of the car to talk to Campbell. As the trial court found:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe facts of this case are that the defendant was seated in a vehicle, that a police car came up and blocked his ability to back up, got out, stood beside the defendant which blocked his ability to pull to the side. There was some testimony that there were vehicles in front of him. There was never a clear\u2014 clarification on the record how close those vehicles were. So, the Court does not know if he was totally blocked from pulling out in front or not. But we do know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>that there was \u2014 he was against the curb. So, there was no way he could get\u2014 move his vehicle that direction. So, we know at least three of the four exits were blocked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">{\u00b6 19} Actually, there was testimony in the record that although there were probably one or two cars parked in front of Campbell\u2019s car, \u201cthey were a few car lengths up the street.\u201d George testified that there was \u201cnobody right immediately in front of [Campbell],\u201d and Campbell did not rebut this.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">{\u00b6 20} Nevertheless, as the trial court notes, Campbell was sitting in a parked car with a curb to his right, a police cruiser directly behind him, and a police officer standing at the driver\u2019s door. Campbell testified that he did not feel free to leave under these circumstances, and we conclude that the trial court reasonably could have found, from all the attendant circumstances, that an objectively reasonable person in Campbell\u2019s situation would not have thought himself free to refuse the encounter and leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">{\u00b6 21} Then, within 20 to 30 seconds', George asked for and received Campbell\u2019s driver\u2019s license and took it back to the police cruiser to run a computer check on it. A reasonable person in Campbell\u2019s position would not believe himself free to leave while this was going on. Although George testified that Campbell could have left at this point, leaving Campbell\u2019s driver\u2019s license in George\u2019s possession, so that George \u201cprobably would have had to mail it to him,\u201d we will charitably construe this testimony as having been facetious. We conclude that a reasonable person in Campbell\u2019s position would not have deemed himself free to leave, secure in the assumption that the police officer who had taken possession of his driver\u2019s license would mail it to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">{\u00b6 22} Although the issue is close, we conclude, based upon the totality of the circumstances, that an investigative stop occurred. Accordingly, the state\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">{\u00b6 23} The state\u2019s sole assignment of error having been overruled, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b260-12\">Wolff and Grady, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
