Ell (\u201cthe Ells\u201d), appeal from the judgment of the Butler County Area III Court granting a judgment to plaintiff-appellee, Courtney W. Mitchell, in the amount of $2,462.10. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>In March 2002, the Ells hired Mitchell, an architect to develop a design plan for the renovation of their farmhouse. The Ells had interviewed several other architects, but settled on Mitchell for their project. The parties signed a contract entitled \u201cAgreement for Design/Build Services.\u201d The contract designated an hourly rate at which the Ells would pay Mitchell, and also indicated that Mitchell would receive 15 percent of the project\u2019s construction costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">{\u00b6 3} Several meetings took place between Mitchell and the Ells, the first occurring on February 28, 2002. Mitchell made measurements at the Ells\u2019 house, as well as preliminary drawings of the renovations. A general contractor, William Sickmann, was present at some of the meetings. Sickmann was working with Mitchell to estimate the construction costs of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">{\u00b6 4} In May 2002, the Ells asked Mitchell for an accounting of the hours he had worked. Mitchell eventually provided the Ells with an accounting, which indicated that Mitchell had spent 56 hours on the project at a cost to the Ells of $2,562.10. The Ells were shocked at the amount, which was much higher than they anticipated. They expressed that concern to Mitchell and asked him whether the total dollar amount included \u201cworking drawings.\u201d Mitchell indicated that it would cost an additional $2,450 for \u201cworking drawings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">{\u00b6 5} The Ells subsequently sent Mitchell a letter, terminating their contractual relationship. The Ells also enclosed a check for $600, what they considered to be a reasonable value for Mitchell\u2019s work. The Ells then hired another architect, who, according to the Ells, produced \u201cworking drawings\u201d of the renovation for $615.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">{\u00b6 6} Mitchell and Sickmann filed suit against the Ells in Butler County Area III Court, seeking $2,562.10 for the work completed pursuant to the contract. After a hearing, a magistrate awarded a judgment to Mitchell in the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>$2,462.10. The magistrate deducted $100 due to excessive secretarial costs claimed by Mitchell. The magistrate dismissed Sickmann as a party because he never entered into a contract with the Ells. The trial court overruled the Ells\u2019 objections and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">{\u00b6 7} The Ells now appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment, assigning two errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">{\u00b6 8} Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court erred in barring the Ell\u2019s [sic] recoupment of excessive architectural fees defense, by determining that the Ells failed to file a counterclaim against Mr. Mitchell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">{\u00b6 10} In this assignment of error, the Ells argue that the trial court erred by failing to consider their Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act defense. The Ells argue that they have a valid defense under the Act due to Mitchell\u2019s allegedly unconscionable and deceptive practices, and his failure to provide a cost estimate for the project. The Ells also assert the common-law defense of recoupment of excessive fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">{\u00b6 11} In an exhibit presented to the trial court entitled \u201cEll\u2019s Opinion,\u201d the Ells stated as follows regarding the Consumer Sales Practices Act:</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cWe think this instance is a possible violation of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act. An Architect providing services, in a consumer transaction, while failing to provide his clients with an oral or written estimate at the start and then later invoicing them an excessive amount, would seem to have committed an unfair or unconscionable act. We are * * * asking the court to rescind our earlier agreement with Mr. Mitchell.\u201d Near the conclusion of the hearing before the magistrate, Mr. Ell made a similar argument to the one presented in the exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">{\u00b6 13} In order to prove that Mitchell violated the Consumer Sales Practices Act, the Ells had to show that Mitchell committed an \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d act under R.C. 1345.02(A) or an \u201cunconscionable\u201d act under R.C. 1345.03(A). The Ells cite Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-05, which provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cIt shall be a deceptive act or practice in connection with a consumer transaction involving the performance of either repairs or any service where the anticipated cost exceeds twenty-five dollars and there has been face to face contact between the consumer or his representative and the supplier or his representative, prior to the commencement of the repair or service for a supplier to:</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c* * * Fail, at the time of the initial face to face contact and prior to the commencement of any repair or service, to provide the consumer with a form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>which indicates the date, the identity of the supplier, the consumer\u2019s name and telephone number, the reasonably anticipated completion date and, if requested by the consumer, the anticipated cost of the repair or service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">{\u00b6 16} The trial court determined that the Ells should have raised the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act issue as a counterclaim. Because the Ells did not raise the issue as a counterclaim, the trial court determined that the issue was not properly before the court, and that the magistrate did not err in failing to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">{\u00b6 17} It has been held that claims under the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act are not defenses, but must be brought as counterclaims. <em>Atelier Design, Inc. v. Campbell </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 724, 728, 589 N.E.2d 474. It is clear that the Ells did not bring an Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act claim as a counterclaim. Rather, they asserted a defense at the hearing that Mitchell had violated the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">{\u00b6 18} We also find that the Ells failed to prove the common-law defense of recoupment of excessive fees. For reasons more fully explained in our discussion of the Ells\u2019 second assignment of error, the Ells failed to offer sufficient proof that Mitchell\u2019s fees were excessive. Accordingly, the Ells\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">{\u00b6 19} Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe trial court erred by holding that the Ells were required to provide expert testimony to prove that Mr. Mitchell\u2019s fees far exceeded his services rendered to the Ells.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">{\u00b6 21} In this assignment of error, the Ells argue that the trial court erred by requiring expert testimony as to the reasonableness of Mitchell\u2019s fees. While the Ells concede that some cases involving professional fees require expert testimony, they assert that this case is not one of those cases. According to the Ells, the reasonableness of Mitchell\u2019s fee was not beyond the knowledge and experience of lay persons. The Ells assert that their exhibits clearly showed Mitchell\u2019s fees to be excessive, given the services he provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">{\u00b6 22} Generally, expert testimony is admissible to assist the trier of fact in determining a contested issue. <em>State v. Koss </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 213, 216, 551 N.E.2d 970. Under Evid.R. 702(A), a witness can testify as an expert if, among other things, the witness\u2019s testimony either \u201crelates to matters beyond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">{\u00b6 23} In this case, the trial court determined that, without the assistance of expert testimony \u201cestablishing the standards in the industry,\u201d it had no way of determining whether Mitchell overcharged the Ells for his services. The trial court did not \u201crequire\u201d expert testimony but found that the Ells could not prove the unreasonableness of Mitchell\u2019s fees without it.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">{\u00b624} We now review the evidence presented at the hearing. Mitchell provided the Ells and the trial court with an accounting of the hours he spent on the Ells\u2019 renovation project. Mitchell\u2019s accounting included hours for meetings with the Ells, contract preparation, design drawing, phone calls with the Ells discussing the project, cost estimation, and consultation with the general contractor. Mitchell billed the Ells at different hourly rates, depending on whether he was using his architectural expertise, whether the work involved drafting or cost estimating, or whether the work was secretarial in nature. Pursuant to the contract, Mitchell charged $62.50 per hour for his architectural expertise, $35 per hour for drafting, cost estimating, and travelling to and from meetings, and $20 per hour for secretarial work, such as contract drafting.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">{\u00b6 25} Mitchell\u2019s first meeting with the Ells was on February 28, 2002. His last meeting with the Ells was on May 24, 2002. During that time, Mitchell billed the Ells for 56 hours: 23 hours for his architectural expertise, 27 hours for drafting, cost estimating, and travel, and six hours for secretarial work. The total bill for these charges was $2,502.50. The magistrate reduced the secretarial hours from six to one. At the hearing, it became apparent that the six secretarial hours represented the time Mitchell spent drafting the parties\u2019 two-page contract and the one-page accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">{\u00b6 26} The Ells presented several additional exhibits at the hearing before the trial court. The Ells presented four pages of preliminary drawings completed by Mitchell, which they received from him at their request. Three of the pages contained drawings resembling floor plans, while the fourth, labeled \u201cElevations,\u201d contained three drawings of the exterior of the Ells\u2019 house. The Ells claimed that these drawings were the only items received from Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">{\u00b6 27} The Ells also presented an exhibit showing that another architect, R.W. Plikerd, billed them $615 for his services. The Ells testified that they received \u201cworking drawings\u201d from Plikerd, exactly what they wanted to receive from Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">{\u00b6 28} Further, the Ells presented as an exhibit a letter from another architect, James Fearing, with whom they had consulted prior to hiring Mitchell. In the letter, Fearing stated that he would charge $1,700 for \u201cmeasured floor plans and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>elevations.\u201d The letter also indicated that he would charge $2,250 for \u201cactual design plans of the renovations,\u201d which would require \u201cabout 25 hours of work.\u201d Further, the letter stated that if construction proceeded, he would charge up to 12 percent of the construction price, depending on how much additional involvement on his part was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">{\u00b6 29} Additionally, the Ells presented as an exhibit a letter from Robin Savage, another architect whom the Ells contacted prior to hiring Mitchell. In the letter, Savage quoted a fee of nine percent of the construction cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">{\u00b6 30} After reviewing the entire record, we cannot say that the trial court erred by ruling in Mitchell\u2019s favor. Absent expert testimony as to the reasonableness of Mitchell\u2019s fee, the court could not determine that Mitchell\u2019s fee was unreasonable. The Ells\u2019 exhibits alone were not sufficient to establish the unreasonableness of Mitchell\u2019s fees. While Plikerd charged them significantly less, the record does not show that he was hired to perform the same work. Under his contract with the Ells, Mitchell was obligated not only to complete \u201cworking drawings\u201d but also to develop \u201cconcept designs,\u201d estimate the construction costs of the project, select the products and materials to create the project, and secure necessary permits. According to Mitchell\u2019s accounting, he spent a significant number of hours estimating costs, something Plikerd apparently did not do. Therefore, the fact that he charged more than Plikerd is not necessarily evidence of an unreasonable fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">{\u00b6 31} Further, the letters from Fearing and Savage did not conclusively show that Mitchell\u2019s fees were unreasonable. The letters merely showed that those particular architects might have charged the Ells less money for their services. Additionally, Mitchell\u2019s accounting of his hours does not on its face prove that Mitchell\u2019s fees were unreasonable, absent testimony from an expert in the architectural field.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">{\u00b6 32} We cannot say that the trial court erred by ruling in Mitchell\u2019s favor and by \u201crequiring\u201d expert testimony. The Ells did not offer sufficient proof that Mitchell\u2019s fees were unreasonable. Under the terms of the contract, Mitchell was entitled to the amount awarded in the judgment. Accordingly, we overrule the Ells\u2019 second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b310-9\">William W. Young, P.J., and Valen, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-12\">. We do not rule on the issue, not addressed by the parties, of whether the Ells' dealings with Mitchell constituted a \"consumer transaction\u201d as defined in R.C. 1345.01(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
