Abele, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">{\u00b6 1} This is an appeal from a Meigs County Common Pleas Court judgment that dismissed an appeal from the Eastern Local School District Board of Education\u2019s decision not to renew the limited two-year contract it entered into with Rhett Milhoan. The court determined that R.C. Chapter 2506 did not provide it with jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a board of education\u2019s decision not to renew a nonteaching employee\u2019s limited contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">{\u00b62} Rhett Milhoan and the Ohio Association of Public School Employees/AFSCME Local 4, AFL-CIO, and its Local 448, plaintiffs below and appellants herein, raise the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-15\">\u201cThe trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffs-appellants[\u2019] administrative appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-16\">{\u00b6 3} On April 18, 2001, Milhoan signed a two-year limited contract of employment as a bus driver with the Eastern Local School District, beginning with the 2001-2002 school year. On February 19, 2003, Milhoan received a board-approved leave of absence until June 1, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-17\">{\u00b6 4} On March 14, 2003, Superintendent Derryl Well notified Milhoan that he would recommend that the board approve a continuing contract. Then, on March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>27, 2003, the superintendent advised Milhoan that he would recommend that the board not renew Milhoan\u2019s contract. At a May 20, 2003 meeting, the board voted not to renew Milhoan\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">{\u00b6 5} On May 29, 2003, appellants filed a notice of appeal in the trial court from the board\u2019s decision not to renew Milhoan\u2019s contract. On July 8, 2003, the board filed a Civ.R. 12(B)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The board asserted that no right of appeal exists from a board of education\u2019s decision not to renew a nonteaching employee\u2019s limited contract. The board essentially argued that because Milhoan did not have a right to continued employment, he did not have a valid basis to challenge its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">{\u00b6 6} Appellants contended that because Milhoan was on board-approved leave when notified of the nonrenewal, he had an expectation that upon his return from leave, he would be employed under the remainder of his limited two-year contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">{\u00b6 7} On August 7, 2003, the trial court granted the board\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court concluded that the board\u2019s decision not to renew Milhoan\u2019s nonteaching contract was not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">{\u00b6 8} Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">{\u00b6 9} In their sole assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court erred by granting appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss. Appellants assert that because Milhoan was on board-approved leave when he was given notice of nonrenewal, the general rule that there is no property right to continued employment does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">{\u00b6 10} Initially, we note that when ruling on a Civ.R. 12(B)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, the trial court must determine whether the claim raises any action cognizable in that court. See <em>State ex rel. Bush v. Spurlock </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 537 N.E.2d 641; <em>Roll v. Edwards, </em>156 Ohio App.3d 227, 2004-Ohio-767, 805 N.E.2d 162, at \u00b6 15. The trial court may grant the motion to dismiss only if the claim fails to raise any issue cognizable in that court. An appellate court reviewing a trial court\u2019s judgment regarding a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction must determine, as a matter of law, whether the trial court erred by holding that the claim did not state any action cognizable in that court. <em>Spurlock; Roll.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. Chapter 2506 governs appeals from administrative bodies. R.C. 2506.01 specifies what is the proper subject of an administrative appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-11\">\u201cEvery final order, adjudication, or decision of any officer, tribunal, authority, board, bureau, commission, department, or other division of any political subdivision of the state may be reviewed by the court of common pleas of the county in which the principal office of the political subdivision is located as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>provided in Chapter 2505. of the Revised Code, except as modified by this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYl\"><em>it </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">\u201cA \u2018final order, adjudication, or decision\u2019 means an order, adjudication, or decision that determines rights, duties, privileges, benefits, or legal relationships of a person, but does not include any order, adjudication, or decision from which an appeal is granted by rule, ordinance, or statute to a higher administrative authority if a right to a hearing on such appeal is provided, or any order, adjudication, or decision that is issued preliminary to or as a result of a criminal proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">{\u00b6 12} Thus, a court of common pleas may not review a board of education\u2019s decision if that decision does not violate the complaining party\u2019s rights. Cf. <em>DeLong v. Southwest School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1973), 37 Ohio App.2d 69, 66 O.O.2d 113, 306 N.E.2d 774, affirmed, 36 Ohio St.2d 62, 65 O.O.2d 213, 303 N.E.2d 890, superseded by statute; see <em>Kiel v. Green Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 149, 630 N.E.2d 716.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">{\u00b6 13} Additionally, for a decision to be appealed under R.C. 2506.01, the decision must be rendered in a quasi-judicial proceeding. <em>Sebest v. Campbell City School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>Mahoning App. No. 00-CA-272, 2002-Ohio-3467, 2002 WL 1483917, at \u00b6 6. \u201cA quasi-judicial proceeding is earmarked by the requirement of notice, a hearing, and an opportunity to present evidence.\u201d <em>Sebest, </em>citing <em>Lakota Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Brickner </em>(1996), 108 Ohio App.3d 637, 644, 671 N.E.2d 578.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">\u201cWhether a proceeding is a quasi-judicial proceeding from which an appeal may be taken under R.C. 2506.01 depends upon the requirements imposed upon the administrative agency by law. * * * In other words, the question is whether there is a requirement for notice and hearing, not whether the administrative agency complied with such requirement.\u201d <em>In re Howard </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 717, 719, 598 N.E.2d 165.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>M.J. Kelley Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 150, 153, 61 O.O.2d 394, 290 N.E.2d 562, the court stated that \u201c \u2018 \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d * * * signifies that the administrative boards from which an appeal may be taken act similarly to a court, to wit, witnesses are examined, a hearing is had and a finding or decision made all in accordance with statutory authority.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Zangerle v. Evatt </em>(1942), 139 Ohio St. 563, 580, 23 O.O. 52, 41 N.E.2d 369 (Williams, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>{\u00b6 15} In the case at bar, the first question presented is whether the board\u2019s decision not to renew Milhoan\u2019s nonteaching contract determined a right, duty, privilege, or benefit. In resolving the question, we first note that appellants appear to agree that a nonteaching employee holds no property right to continued employment at the end of a limited contract and therefore agree that no right of appeal exists. Appellants\u2019 argument is thus focused on whether Milhoan\u2019s leave of absence somehow stayed or tolled his two-year contract until his return and created an expectation or a right of continued employment, and whether his contract nonrenewal violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe requirements of procedural due process apply only to the deprivation of interests encompassed by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s protection of liberty and property. When protected interests are implicated, the right to some kind of prior hearing is paramount.\u201d <em>Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 564, 569-570, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548. When an school employee has yet to attain tenured, or continuing contract, status, that employee has no property interest in continued employment. See, generally, <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 578, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">{\u00b6 17} R.C. 3319.13 governs leave of absences for both teaching and nonteaching employees. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">\u201cUpon the written request of a teacher or a regular nonteaching school employee, a board of education may grant a leave of absence for a period of not more than two consecutive school years for educational, professional, or other purposes, and shall grant such leave where illness or other disability is the reason for the request. * * * * <em>Upon the return to service of a teacher or nonteaching school employee at the expiration of a leave of absence, the teacher or nonteaching school employee shall resume the contract status that the teacher or nonteaching school employee held prior to the leave of absence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">{\u00b6 18} In Ohio School Law, the authors explain the above statute as follows: \u201cUpon returning from leave under RC 3319.13, the employee has the contract status held prior to leave. <em>If he is not yet eligible for tenure, the board may choose not to renew his limited contract, and he is not entitled to reemployment if the required notice of nonrenewal is given.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Ohio School Law (2004), Section 10:47</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">{\u00b6 19} In the case at bar, upon his return from his leave of absence, Milhoan\u2019s contract status was a limited two-year contract, set to expire at the end of the 2002-2003 school year. Thus, upon his return from his leave of absence, he could expect to resume that same status. Before he returned from his leave of absence, Milhoan\u2019s contract expired, and the board properly notified him that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>would not renew his contract. We find no statute or case authority that required the board to stay or toll Milhoan\u2019s contract until his return from his leave of absence. Milhoan possessed no property interest in continued employment beyond the 2002-2003 school year. Because Milhoan did not possess a property interest in continued employment, he had no \u201crights\u201d determined within the meaning of R.C. 2506.01. Thus, an appeal will not lie, and the trial court properly determined that it was without jurisdiction to entertain appellants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">{\u00b6 20} Appellants\u2019 argument that the board was required to comply with the termination procedures set forth in R.C. 3319.081(C)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is unavailing. A decision not to renew an employee\u2019s contract is not the same as terminating the employee\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">{\u00b6 21} We also disagree with appellants\u2019 arguments comparing Milhoan\u2019s case to that of cases involving teaching employees. Appellants refer to <em>Skilton v. Perry Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>Lake App. No. 2001-L-140, 2002-Ohio-6702, 2002 WL 31744700. In <em>Skilton, </em>however, the appellate court relied heavily upon the board\u2019s noncompliance with R.C. 3319.11 and 3319.111, which apply to teaching employees, not nonteaching employees. At the time the parties submitted their appellate briefs in the case sub judice, the Ohio Supreme Court had accepted <em>Skilton </em>for review. In a recent decision that affirmed the Eleventh District\u2019s decision, the Ohio Supreme Court held in <em>Skilton v. Perry Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 173, 2004-Ohio-2239, 807 N.E.2d 919, that \u201c[a] teacher\u2019s medical leave of absence does not excuse a school board from complying with R.C. 3319.111.\u201d Id. at syllabus. We do not believe that the recent <em>Shilton </em>decision affects our disposition of appellants\u2019 appeal. First, <em>Shilton </em>involved a teaching employee, not a nonteaching employee. Second, the primary focus of the case involved the school\u2019s failure to comply with statutory evaluation proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>dures that apply to teachers. Skilton recognized that if a school board complies with R.C. 3319.11 before a leave of absence, a nonrenewal could withstand scrutiny. Id. at \u00b6 14. We therefore do not find <em>Skilton </em>determinative of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">{\u00b6 22} Additionally, the proceeding from which appellant wishes to appeal was not quasi-judicial. A board of education deciding not to renew a nonteaching employee\u2019s contract does not need to provide the nonteaching employee with a right to be heard and does not need to examine witnesses. Therefore, because such a proceeding is not quasi-judicial, the decision from that proceeding is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">{\u00b6 23} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b756-8\">Kline, P.J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AFr\">Harsha, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-10\">. Although <em>DeLong </em>was superseded by R.C. 3319.11 and 3319.111, the above legal proposition remains valid. Moreover, R.C. 3319.11 and 3319.111 apply to teaching, as opposed to nonteaching, employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\">. {\u00b6 a} R.C. 3319.081(C) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">{\u00b6 b} \"The contracts as provided for in this section may be terminated by a majority vote of the board of education. Such contracts may be terminated only for violation of written rules and regulations as set forth by the board of education or for incompetency, inefficiency, dishonesty, drunkenness, immoral conduct, insubordination, discourteous treatment of the public, neglect of duty, or any other acts of misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance. In addition to the right of the board of education to terminate the contract of an employee, the board may suspend an employee for a definite period of time or demote the employee for the reasons set forth in this division. The action of the board of education terminating the contract of an employee or suspending or demoting him shall be served upon the employee by certified mail.
