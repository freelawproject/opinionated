(\u201cLee\u2019s\u201d). The Commerce Department contends that the magistrate and trial court erred by determining that Lee\u2019s owed apprentice, rather than journeyman, wages to one of its workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">{\u00b6 2} We conclude that the magistrate\u2019s decision is supported by the record and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion or otherwise err in adopting the decision of the magistrate. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">{\u00b6 3} In 2001, the city of Dayton Water Department began a construction project known as the Dayton Office Building Project (\u201cthe Project\u201d). Because the construction was undertaken for a public authority and had an overall cost exceeding certain statutory threshold levels set forth in R.C. Chapter 4115, the Project was subject to the Prevailing Wage Law set forth in R.C. Chapter 4115 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">{\u00b6 4} Lee\u2019s was the heating and cooling system subcontractor on the Project. Lee\u2019s was aware that the Project was subject to Ohio\u2019s Prevailing Wage Law. Lee\u2019s employed Darnell McGraw on the Project; McGraw did sheet metal work.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> McGraw was a participant in the Dayton Step-Up Program, which is a \u201cbuilding maintenance/repair\u201d apprenticeship program and is not trade-specific. It is designed to provide its participants an \u201cintroduction and exposure to a myriad of trade tasks.\u201d The Step-Up Program is a bona-fide apprenticeship program that is registered with the Ohio Apprenticeship Council. McGraw worked 41 and one-half hours on the Project, and was paid $7 per hour. This rate was set by the Step-Up Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">{\u00b6 5} In May, 2001, the Commerce Department received a prevailing-wage complaint in which it was alleged that Lee\u2019s had not paid McGraw prevailing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>wages on the Project. Following an investigation, the Commerce Department determined that Lee\u2019s-owed McGraw $1,496.40 in unpaid prevailing wages. The Commerce Department commenced this action in the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court, seeking payment of the wages as well as a statutory penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">{\u00b6 6} The matter was tried before a magistrate. The magistrate issued a decision finding that McGraw was an apprentice and that he should be paid wages as an apprentice, rather than as a journeyman. The magistrate also found that McGraw had been engaged in sheet metal work, and that he should have been paid the amount of $14.42 per hour.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">{\u00b6 7} The Commerce Department filed an objection to the magistrate\u2019s decision, in which it specifically objected to the characterization of McGraw as an apprentice. The Commerce Department alleged that McGraw should have been paid the journeyman wage because he \u201cwas not a registered sheet metal apprentice at the time he performed the work\u201d on the Project. Lee\u2019s did not object to the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court overruled the Commerce Department\u2019s objection, adopted the decision of the magistrate, and entered judgment accordingly. From this judgment, the Commerce Department now appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">{\u00b6 9} The sole assignment of error presented by the Commerce Department is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant Ohio Department of Commerce and abused its discretion when it ordered that appellee Lee\u2019s Heating and Cooling, Inc. owed only $615.86 in prevailing wages and statutory penalties with respect to appellee\u2019s employment of Darnell McGraw at the Dayton Office Building Project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">{\u00b6 11} The Commerce Department contends that the trial court erred in its award of wages. This assertion is premised upon the argument that the trial court abused its discretion when it determined that McGraw was an apprentice and that Lee\u2019s owed McGraw wages only as an apprentice, not as a journeyman.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">{\u00b6 12} The prevailing wage rate statutes are set forth in R.C. Chapter 4115. R.C. 4115.05 provides: \u201cThe prevailing rate of wages to be paid for a legal day\u2019s work, as prescribed in section 4115.04 of the Revised Code, to laborers, workers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>or mechanics upon public works shall not be less at any time during the life of a contract for the public work than the prevailing rate of wages then payable in the same trade or occupation in the locality where such public work is being performed, under collective bargaining agreements or understandings, between employers and bona fide organizations of labor in force at the date the contract for the public work, relating to the trade or occupation, was made, and collective bargaining agreements or understandings successor thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">{\u00b6 13} In other words, a person working on a public works construction must be paid union scale. \u201cThe prevailing wage statutes, R.C. 4115.03 through R.C. 4115.16, require contractors and subcontractors for public improvement projects to pay laborers and mechanics the so-called prevailing wage in the locality where the project is to be performed. \u2018[T]he primary purpose of the prevailing wage law is to support the integrity of the collective bargaining process by preventing the undercutting of employee wages in the private construction sector.\u2019 \u201d <em>J.A. Croson Co. v. J.A. Guy, Inc. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 346, 349, 691 N. E.2d 655, quoting <em>State ex rel. Evans v. Moore </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 88, 91, 23 O.O.3d 145, 431 N.E.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 4115.05 goes on to permit apprentices to work on public construction projects and to be paid the prevailing wage rate for apprentices. \u201cApprentices will be permitted to work only under a bona fide apprenticeship program if such program exists and is registered with the Ohio apprenticeship council.\u201d Id. An apprentice may be paid apprentice wages \u201conly if there is in force at the time work is being performed under a contract for the public improvement project, in the locality of such project, a collective bargaining agreement or understanding between employers and bona fide organizations of labor which authorizes the employment of apprentices.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4101:9-4-16(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">(\u00b6 15} The term \u201capprentice\u201d is defined as \u201cany employee who is enrolled or indentured per trade occupation as a member of a bona fide apprenticeship program, or a person in the first ninety days of probationary employment as an apprentice in such apprenticeship program who has been certified by the Ohio apprenticeship council to be eligible for probationary employment as an apprentice.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4101:9-4-02(A). A \u201c[b]ona fide apprenticeship program\u201d is a \u201ccomprehensive training program registered with the Ohio apprenticeship council.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4101:9-4-02(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">{\u00b6 16} There is no dispute in this record that the Step-Up Program is a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with the Ohio State Apprenticeship Council; nor is there any dispute that McGraw is a participant in that program. Also, as previously stated, the Commerce Department, on its own initiative, classified McGraw as performing sheet metal work on the project. Additionally, the evidence supports a finding that there was a prevailing wage rate for sheet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>metal workers on the Project indicating that the provisions of Ohio Adm.Code 4101:9-4-16(B) and R.C. 4115.05 are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">{\u00b6 17} Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not err in determining that McGraw was entitled to wages for sheet metal work as an apprentice. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">{\u00b6 18} The Commerce Department\u2019s sole assignment of error having been overruled, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b599-9\">Brogan and Frederick N. Young, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-11\">. Although we have found no evidence in the record to support a finding that McGraw was engaged in sheet metal work while employed by Lee's, we note that the Commerce Department repeatedly informed the trial court that McGraw was engaged in sheet metal work. We conclude, then, that the Commerce Department implicitly stipulated that McGraw was performing sheet metal work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b597-13\">. The record shows that this amount is the prevailing wage rate for sheet metal apprentices.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b597-14\">. Amicus briefs supporting the Commerce Department\u2019s position have been filed by the Ohio State Apprenticeship Council and the Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
