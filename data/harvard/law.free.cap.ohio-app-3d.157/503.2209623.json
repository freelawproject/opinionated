The Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas affirmed the termination. Napier now appeals from that judgment, claiming that the Centerville City Schools Transportation Handbook created a contractual relationship between her and the school system. She also contends that her sanction' \u2014 termination\u2014was disproportionate in relation to other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">{\u00b6 2} We conclude that Napier was an at-will employee, subject to termination, and that the evidence in the record does not support a finding that the handbook created an implied contract for employment. We further conclude that the decision to terminate Napier\u2019s employment is supported by the evidence and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>not disproportionate in relation to other cases. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">{\u00b6 3} Napier was employed as a school bus driver for the Centerville City Schools and was assigned to drive a kindergarten route. On the morning of September 6, 2002, Napier transported kindergarten students to school. After the students exited the bus, Napier returned the bus to the school bus garage. Napier parked the bus, exited, and left the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">{\u00b6 4} Shortly thereafter, another school bus driver walked by Napier\u2019s bus and heard a child screaming from inside the bus. The bus driver found and removed a four-year-old child from the bus and took her to the Transportation Office. Transportation Supervisor George Sontag was notified. The child was subsequently transported to school.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">{\u00b6 5} Sontag and Assistant Superintendent Gary Smiga retrieved and viewed the videotape from the bus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The videotape shows that during the bus ride, the temperature on the bus reached 105 degrees Fahrenheit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the bus was parked, the temperature on the bus reached 122 degrees Fahrenheit. The videotape further demonstrates that Napier did not visually inspect any of the bus seats, either when the students were dropped off at school or when she parked in the garage. The videotape shows that after the bus was parked and Napier had exited, the child stood up on her seat and began to scream for her mommy. Some time after the videotape camera shut down, the child was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">{\u00b6 6} Pursuant to regulations adopted by the Ohio Department of Education, bus drivers are required to visually inspect each seat of their bus at the conclusion of each trip to ensure that all passengers have left the bus. This duty entails checking the bus after the students are dropped off at school and after the bus is returned to the garage. Centerville City Schools bus drivers are provided training regarding this regulation and are provided reminders of the regulation during the course of the school year. They are provided a Transportation Handbook, which also stresses the importance of the visual inspections.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">{\u00b6 7} When Napier returned for her afternoon route, Smiga and Sontag met with her and informed her that a student had been left on her bus. When asked, Napier indicated that she had visually inspected the bus. However, after being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>confronted with the videotape, Napier admitted that she had not performed the required inspection. Napier was placed on paid administrative leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">{\u00b6 8} Thereafter, Napier was sent a letter informing her that a hearing would be held on September 11, 2002. Napier appeared at the hearing without representation. After the meeting, Smiga sent Napier a letter informing her that due to her neglect of duty he intended to recommend that her employment be terminated. Napier was informed that she could appeal the recommendation for termination to the superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">{\u00b6 9} Napier requested a meeting with the superintendent, and a hearing was held. Napier appeared, with counsel, and admitted that she had violated Ohio law and Centerville School Board policies. However, Napier\u2019s counsel took the position that termination was an inappropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">{\u00b6 10} The superintendent recommended that the board terminate Napier\u2019s employment. The recommendation was accepted by the school board, and Napier\u2019s employment was terminated by letter dated September 24, 2002. Thereafter, Napier filed an appeal with the Centerville City School District Personnel Appeals Board, which upheld the termination. Next, Napier filed an appeal with the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court, which also affirmed the termination. Napier now appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">{\u00b6 11} Napier\u2019s first assignment of error states as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe common pleas court erred in sustaining the decision of the Centerville City Schools Personnel Appeals Board, which sustained the termination of appellant as a school bus driver, because the Centerville City School\u2019s Transportation Handbook does not allow termination in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">{\u00b6 13} Napier contends that the Transportation Handbook given to the school bus drivers creates an implied contract between the school district and its employees. Her argument is based upon the fact that the handbook provides for progressive discipline in the event that an employee does not adhere to the regulations. She argues that to hold that the handbook does not create a contract would render the handbook meaningless. She further states that \u201c[t]he unilateral issuing of these rules by the School Board, when they are adopted by the School Board, create[s] an implied contract between the School Board and its classified employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">{\u00b6 14} In this case, there does not appear to be any dispute that Napier was an at-will employee. Generally, an at-will employee may be terminated for any reason not contrary to law. <em>Henning v. Marriott Hotel &amp; Resorts, Inc. </em>(May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>25, 1995), Montgomery App. No. 14926, 1995 WL 316174. \u201cHowever, there are two exceptions to this general rule: implied contract and promissory estoppel.\u201d Id. Napier argues that the handbook constitutes an implied contract and therefore changes her status from at-will to a contractual employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c[A] handbook may be found to alter the terms of employment at will only if the employee and employer have agreed to create a contract from the writing. In the absence of mutual assent, a handbook is merely a unilateral statement of rules and policies which creates no rights or obligations.\u201d <em>Adams v. K-Mart Corp. </em>(Feb. 5, 1999), Greene App. No. 98CA75, 1999 WL 49146, quoting <em>Henning, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">{\u00b6 16} Napier has failed to present any evidence to demonstrate mutual assent to enter into a contract. Moreover, the record is devoid of evidence to indicate that the handbook represents anything more than a \u201cunilateral statement of rules and policies.\u201d Indeed, Napier\u2019s own appellate brief concedes the unilateral nature of the handbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">{\u00b6 17} Based upon the record before us, we cannot say that the trial court erred in finding Napier\u2019s claim of implied contract lacking in merit. Accordingly, the first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">{\u00b6 18} The second assignment of error provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe common pleas court erred in determining that the discipline imposed on appellant was not discriminatory, disproportionate, unfair, and inequitable when compared to other cases and, thus, her termination by the Centerville City School Personnel Appeals Board was not arbitrary and illegal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">{\u00b6 20} Napier contends that termination of her employment was an inappropriate sanction, given the facts of the case and based upon the disposition of similar, cases. Specifically, she argues that the fact that the child was not harmed militates against termination. She also argues that the school district did not terminate the employment of other bus drivers following similar incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">{\u00b6 21} In reviewing administrative decisions, \u201cthe Court of Common Pleas must weigh the evidence in the record, and whatever additional evidence may be admitted pursuant to R.C. 2506.03, to determine whether there exists a preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence to support the agency decision.\u201d <em>Dudukovich v. Lorain Metro. Hous. Auth. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 202, 207, 12 O.O.3d 198, 389 N.E.2d 1113. \u201cAn appellate court\u2019s review of a trial court\u2019s decision affirming an administrative decision is even more limited.\u201d <em>Arnett v. Franklin Monroe Local Bd. of Edn., </em>Darke App. No. 1567, 2002-Ohio-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>3559, 2002 WL 1483149, at \u00b6 15. \u201cUnless we can say, as a matter of law, that the decision of the trial court is not supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, or otherwise illegal, the trial court\u2019s decision must be affirmed.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">{\u00b6 22} We begin by noting that only one of the other \u201csimilar\u201d cases to which Napier refers is, in fact, similar. In that case, a bus driver did not inspect the bus after dropping students off at school. However, prior to leaving the bus, the driver discovered that a child had not exited the bus. The bus driver was not discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">{\u00b6 23} While this incident and Napier\u2019s case are somewhat akin, the fact that the other bus driver did in fact perform his duty and discover the child, even if belatedly, and the fact that the child was not abandoned on an overheated bus in which the temperature had reached a life-threatening level, make the two cases sufficiently dissimilar to persuade us that Napier has not shown a disparity in treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">{\u00b6 24} Furthermore, the record demonstrates that Napier had been a bus driver with the Centerville schools for 26 years, and that she was well aware of the need to visually inspect the bus. It also demonstrates that Napier was aware that the bus was extremely hot on the day she failed to inspect. The fact that the child did not suffer any physical harm does not negate the seriousness of Napier\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The child was exposed to a significant risk of great harm, perhaps including death, and the heightened hazard posed by the extreme heat was something of which Napier either was aware or should have been aware.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">{\u00b6 25} After reviewing the videotape and the entire record, we cannot say that the school system was unreasonable in finding that Napier\u2019s conduct was so egregious as to warrant termination. We conclude that the decision to terminate Napier is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. Therefore, we find no error on the part of the trial court. The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">{\u00b6 26} Both of Napier\u2019s assignments of error having been overruled, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b542-11\">Wolff and Grady, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-11\">. The school buses are equipped with videotape cameras, which activate when the ignition key is turned on and continue for approximately four minutes after the bus is shut down.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b539-12\">.
