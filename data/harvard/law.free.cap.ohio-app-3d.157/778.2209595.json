Smith, appeals from the May 12, 2003 judgment of the Common Pleas Court, Juvenile Division, Hancock County, Ohio, overruling her motion to declare R.C. 3111.13 unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-13\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Between December 1986 and February 1987, Shirley and the appellee, Matthew L. Smith, were involved in a sexual relationship.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 27, 1987, Shirley gave birth to a son, Anthony, but never directly informed Matthew that Anthony was his child. However, nearly ten years later, on September 26, 1997, Shirley initiated paternity proceedings against Matthew. Subsequent DNA testing revealed that Matthew was the father of Anthony. \u25a0 Thereafter, the trial court found that Matthew was Anthony\u2019s father and ordered that he begin paying child support for Anthony in the amount of $440.41 per month, as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>arrearages for the previous ten years totaling $41,833.06, to be paid at the rate of $44.33 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">{\u00b6 3} Matthew appealed that decision to this court on October 29, 1998, asserting, inter alia, that the doctrine of laches prevented Anthony\u2019s mother from seeking child support based upon her ten-year delay in pursuing the parentage action. Although this court held that the trial court erred in its calculation of support and remanded the case to correct this error, we also determined that the trial court did not err in refusing to apply the doctrine of laches. <em>Smith v. Smith </em>(Mar. 10, 1999), 3d Dist. No. 5-98-35, 1999 WL 181190. On remand, the trial court recalculated the current and past child support figures from the time of Anthony\u2019s birth through July 31, 1999, which required Matthew to pay $338.94 per month in current support and $100 per month for the $44,960.09 he owed in arrearages. This entry was filed by the court on December 16,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">{\u00b6 4} On August 27, 2002, Matthew filed a \u201cMotion to Set Aside or Otherwise Terminate and Extinguish the Arrearages Established for the Time Period Between Date of Birth of the Child Until and Including July 31,1999.\u201d The basis for this motion was the amendment of R.C. 3111.13(F)(3)(a), which went into effect on October 27, 2000. This amendment allowed for modifications of existing orders for back child support when a parentage action was not initiated before a child attained the age of three years and the alleged father did not know or have reason to know that he was the father of the child at issue. R.C. 3111.13(F)(3)(a) and (c). In response to this motion, counsel for Shirley filed a motion for declaratory relief, asking the court to declare R.C. 3111.13 unconstitutional. Notice of this motion was also served upon the Ohio Attorney General as required by R.C. 2721.12. A hearing was held on Shirley\u2019s motion, and the magistrate declined to find the statute unconstitutional. Although Shirley objected to the magistrate\u2019s decision, the trial court overruled these objections on May 12, 2003. This appeal followed, and Shirley now asserts two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe trial court erred in not declaring O.R.C. \u00a7 3111.13 unconstitutional as violating the Ohio Constitution, Section 28, Article II, ban on retroactive application.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe trial court erred in not declaring O.R.C. \u00a7 3111.13 unconstitutional as violating the Ohio Constitution, Section 5(B), Article IV, separation of powers doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">{\u00b6 7} This court\u2019s analysis of these issues begins by noting that \u201c[a] regularly enacted statute of Ohio is presumed to be constitutional and is therefore entitled to the benefit of every presumption in favor of its constitutionality.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Dickman v. Defenbacher </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 142, 146, 57 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>O.O. 134, 128 N.E.2d 59. Thus, the Supreme Court of Ohio has held \u201cenactments of the General Assembly to be constitutional unless such enactments are clearly unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. In addition, \u201c[a]ny doubt as to the constitutionality of a statute will be resolved in favor of its validity.\u201d Id. at 149, 57 O.O. 134, 128 N.E.2d 59, citing <em>State ex rel. Doerfler v. Price </em>(1920), 101 Ohio St. 50,128 N.E. 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">{\u00b6 8} The Ohio Constitution \u201cprohibits the General Assembly from passing retroactive laws and protects vested rights from new legislative encroachments.\u201d <em>Bielat v. Bielat </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 350, 352, 721 N.E.2d 28, citing Section 28, Article II, Ohio Constitution; <em>Vogel v. Wells </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 91, 99, 566 N.E.2d 154. However, \u201cOhio courts have long recognized that there is a crucial distinction between statutes that merely apply retroactively (or \u2018retrospectively\u2019) and those that do so in a manner that offends our Constitution.\u201d <em>Bielat, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 353, 721 N.E.2d 28, citing <em>Rairden v. Holden </em>(1864), 15 Ohio St. 207, 210-211; <em>State v. Cook </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 404, 410, 700 N.E.2d 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">{\u00b6 9} In order to determine whether a statute is unconstitutionally retroactive, the first step is \u201cto determine whether the General Assembly expressly intended the statute to apply retroactively.\u201d <em>Bielat, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 353, 721 N.E.2d 28. This question must be answered first based upon R.C. 1.48, which provides that \u201c[a] statute is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless expressly made retrospective.\u201d In fact, an \u201c[ijnquiry into whether a statute may be constitutionally applied retrospectively continues only after an initial finding that the General Assembly expressly intended that the statute be applied retrospectively.\u201d <em>State v. LaSalle, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 178, 2002-Ohio-4009, 772 N.E.2d 1172, \u00b6 14, citing <em>Van Fossen v. Babcock Wilcox Co. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 100, 522 N.E .2d 489, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>Bielat, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 353, 721 N.E.2d 28; <em>State ex rel. Kilbane v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 258, 259, 744 N.E.2d 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">{\u00b6 10} In the case sub judice, the statute at issue states that a court is prohibited from ordering the payment of back child support if the child was over the age of three at the time the parentage action was first filed and \u201cthe alleged father had no knowledge and had no reason to have knowledge of his alleged paternity of the child.\u201d R.C. 3111.13(F)(3)(a)(i) and (ii). Division (F)(3) further states that \u201c[a] party is entitled to obtain modification of an existing order for arrearages under this division regardless of whether the judgment, court order, or administrative support order from which relief is sought <em>was issued prior to, on, or after October 27, 2000.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) R.C. 3111.13(F)(3)(c). Thus, by electing to use the language \u201cprior to,\u201d the General Assembly expressly intended that the statute reach back in time and apply to the order for back support that was issued prior to the enactment of R.C. 3111.13(F)(3). See <em>Bielat, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>87 Ohio St.3d at 353-354, 721 N.E.2d 28. Therefore, there is an express intention that this section be applied retrospectively. Accordingly, we proceed to the next step in the test for unconstitutional retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">{\u00b6 11} The next issue to be determined is whether the statute is substantive or remedial. <em>Bielat, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 354, 721 N.E.2d 28. If a statute is retroactive and substantive, then it violates the constitutional prohibition against retroactivity. Id. at 353, 721 N.E.2d 28. However, if a retroactive statute is merely remedial, then it does not offend the Ohio Constitution and will not be declared invalid. Id. at 354, 721 N.E.2d 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\"> {\u00b6 12} A statute is substantive \u201cif it impairs vested rights, affects an accrued substantive right, or imposes new or additional burdens, duties, obligations, or liabilities as to a past transaction.\u201d Id., citing <em>Cook, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 411, 700 N.E.2d 570. To the contrary, a remedial statute merely affects \u201cthe methods and procedure by which rights are recognized, protected and enforced, not * * * the rights themselves.\u201d <em>Weil v. Taxicabs of Cincinnati, Inc. </em>(1942), 139 Ohio St. 198, 205, 22 O.O. 205, 39 N.E.2d 148. Such laws do not violate the Ohio Constitution because the General Assembly is permitted to \u201cauthorize courts to carry into effect, upon such terms as shall be just and equitable, the manifest intention of parties, and officers, by curing omissions, defects, and errors, in instruments and proceedings, arising out of their want of conformity with the laws of this state.\u201d Section 28, Article II, Ohio Constitution. Thus, this court is called upon to determine whether R.C. 3111.13(F)(3) impairs or affects any vested or substantive rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">{\u00b6 13} The Fifth District Court of Appeals recently addressed a similar issue regarding the back payment of child support and determined that R.C. 3111.13(F) was unconstitutional. See <em>Dixon v. Walcutt, </em>152 Ohio App.3d 372, 2003-Ohio-1667, 787 N.E.2d 1237. However, in <em>Dixon, </em>the mother of the child filed a complaint for retroactive child support against the child\u2019s father ten days prior to the effective date of R.C. 3111.13(F), but the trial court had yet to issue an order for arrearages before the statutes effective date. Id. at \u00b6 2. Those circumstances are unlike the facts in the case sub judice, where the order for arrearages was issued, and subsequently affirmed by this court, well before the effective date of the statute. Thus, <em>Dixon </em>is not entirely dispositive of the case presently before us, and we expressly decline to adopt the full scope of the <em>Dixon </em>holding at this time. Nevertheless, we find that the underlying rationale of the holding in <em>Dixon, </em>when applied to the facts of this case, has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>Dixon, </em>the court stated that it could \u201cimagine no other right greater than the right of a child to have the support of his/her father.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 22. The court further noted that this right has been consistently recognized in Ohio \u201cas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>evidenced by R.C. 2919.21, which governs offenses against the family, including nonsupport of dependents.\u201d Id. Thus, the Fifth District held that the retroactive application of R.C. 3111.13(F) was unconstitutional because it \u201caffect[ed] a substantive right and takes away the child\u2019s right to support.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">{\u00b6 15} As touched upon in <em>Dixon, </em>the right to support from one\u2019s parent has been consistently upheld by the courts of this state. See, e.g., <em>Haskins v. Bronzetti </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 202, 203, 594 N.E.2d 582; <em>State ex rel. Wright v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 187, 25 O.O. 277, 47 N.E.2d 209, paragraph one of the syllabus. Further, the right to support is legislatively mandated. For instance, R.C. 3103.03, entitled \u201cSupport obligations of married persons and of parents of minor child,\u201d states that \u201c[t]he biological or adoptive parent of a minor child must support the parent\u2019s minor children out of the parent\u2019s property or by the parent\u2019s labor.\u201d R.C. 3103.03(A). This section also permits any other person to support an unemancipated child if a parent of that child neglects to do so \u201cand recover the reasonable value of the necessaries supplied from the parent who neglected to support the minor child.\u201d R.C. 3103.03(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">(\u00b6 16} The Revised Code also provides methods for calculating support, including the minimum amount of permissible support. See R.C. Chapter 3119. In addition, the Revised Code creates an entire system for the collection and disbursement of child support, which includes the establishment of a governmental agency to assist in this endeavor and the ability to enforce wage withholdings in order to ensure that children are given support from their parents. See R.C. Chapter 3121. Furthermore, R.C. 2919.21 prohibits a parent from failing \u201cto provide adequate support to * * * [t]he person\u2019s child who is under age eighteen, or mentally or physically handicapped child who is under age twenty-one.\u201d R.C. 2919.21(A)(2). Moreover, a violation of this section constitutes a misdemeanor of the first degree on a first offense, R.C. 2919.21(G)(1), which is punishable by up to six months of incarceration and/or fines up to $1,000. R.C. 2929.21(B)(1) and (C)(1). Thus, these enactments created not only a statutory right of a child to support from his/her parents but also a comprehensive plan to enforce the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">{\u00b6 17} In sum, both common and statutory law provided Anthony with the right to support from his parents. See <em>Haskins, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 205, 594 N.E.2d 582. Such a right is certainly substantive given the infirmity of children to support themselves. Id. at 203, 594 N.E.2d 582, citing <em>Pretzinger v. Pretzinger </em>(1887), 45 Ohio St. 452, 458, 15 N.E. 471, overruled on other grounds by <em>Meyer v. Meyer </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 222,17 OBR 455, 478 N.E.2d 806. Furthermore, this right also vested once the trial court issued its 1998 and, upon remand, 1999 judgments, finding that Anthony was entitled to support for the years prior to the initiation of the paternity action and determining the amount owed. By enacting a statute that reaches back in time and destroys Anthony\u2019s previously adjudicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>right to support, the General Assembly violated the constitutional prohibition of enacting retroactive, substantive legislation. Therefore, we find the retroactive application of R.C. 3111.13(F)(3), regarding the termination of the order to pay back child support, to be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">{\u00b6 18} In addition, we note the dissent\u2019s view that under the facts of this case, Shirley\u2019s right to reimbursement for the support of Anthony is all that is affected by R.C. 3111.13(F)(3). If that were true, then laches should surely attach to bar the claim of any mother who deliberately waited ten years to inform the father of the existence of the child, and then seeks such reimbursement. However, the fact remains that she had a statutory right to reimbursement at the time that she sought arrearages. See, e.g., <em>Smith v. Smith </em>(1959), 168 Ohio St. 447, 7 O.O.2d 276, 156 N.E.2d 113; <em>Connin v. Bailey </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 34, 15 OBR 134, 472 N. E.2d 328. Moreover, both the trial court and this court on appeal determined that her action to recover arrearages was not barred by the doctrine of laches and further ordered that Shirley was entitled to arrearages from Matthew well before the effective date of R.C. 3111.13(F)(3). Thus, Shirley\u2019s right to reimbursement was not only in existence but was also <em>fully adjudicated </em>prior to the legislative enactment of R.C. 3111.13(F)(3). Therefore, we conclude that under these circumstances, even the right to reimbursement has become a substantive right, and the legislature\u2019s destruction of this fully accrued and adjudicated right was unconstitutional. See <em>Gregory v. Flowers </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 48, 58-59, 61 O.O.2d 295, 290 N.E.2d 181. Nevertheless, we would emphasize that this decision should not be construed in any way as prohibiting the <em>prospective </em>application of the statute but, rather, merely addresses and prohibits the <em>retroactive destruction of a previously adjudicated right.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">{\u00b6 19} For these reasons, the first assignment of error is sustained, rendering the second assignment of error moot. Accordingly, the judgment of the Common Pleas Court, Juvenile Division, Hancock County is overruled, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b819-9\">Cupp, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b819-10\">Thomas F. Bryant, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-14\">. Although Shirley and Matthew share a common last name, they were never married to each other.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b819-11\">Thomas F. Bryant, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AfE\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">{\u00b6 20} I dissent from the majority opinion for the following reasons. The majority finds R.C. 3111.13(F)(3) to be unconstitutional because it affects the right of a child to be supported by his parents. I disagree because the issue is not the child\u2019s right to be supported. The child has already received support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>from his mother and perhaps others. Instead, the issue is the right of the mother to recover for the support she furnished the child before the father learned of the existence of his child and of his duty to support him or her.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">{\u00b6 21} R.C. 3111.13(F)(3) limits the time from which an arrearage of support can be calculated to three years, providing that the father did not know of the paternity and had no reasonable method of knowing. This means that no notice of paternity was given to the father and that he could not reasonably have determined from the circumstances that he is the father of the child. In an ideal world, only couples in a committed relationship would be having children, and fathers would know whether or not and when they had a child. However, in reality, sometimes either circumstances or the mother\u2019s conscious choice to conceal the fact prevents the father from learning that he has a child to support. The mother is the person best in a position to establish the paternity of the child. If she chooses to prevent the establishment of a father-child relationship, she is, in effect, choosing to forgo the father\u2019s assistance to support the child. She always has the ability to file a paternity action for financial support by the father. By limiting the amount of arrearage that can be calculated to three years, the legislature is limiting only the mother\u2019s right to reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">{\u00b6 22} In this case, Shirley and Matthew were engaged in a relationship between December 1986 and February 1987. Eight months later, Shirley gave birth to Anthony but did not tell Matthew that he had a son. Shirley waited almost ten years to initiate paternity proceedings. When Matthew was found to be the father, he was ordered to pay future monthly child support and ten years of back child support in the cumulative amount of $41,833.06. The statute would have limited this amount to only three years\u2019 worth of back child support, which is actually a reimbursement to Shirley for the amounts she expended in supporting Anthony during a reasonable time within which to seek contribution by Matthew.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">{\u00b6 23} This case was not brought by a child for his support but by another who provided support for the child in years past while taking no action to seek assistance from a father. This is not a support case but an action akin to a creditor\u2019s bill for recovery for necessaries advanced in support of a needy dependent. Thus, I see no constitutional infirmity in a statute limiting the time in which an action must be brought against a parent for past support by one with superior knowledge of the duty to support.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">{\u00b6 24} Laches does not attach to the child\u2019s right, but to that of the creditor. The child has been supported in the years past. If the mother did not think she was fully supporting the child, she had the ability to seek support earlier by filing a paternity action at an earlier time. I do not view this statute any differently from any other statute limiting the creditor\u2019s remedy for recovery of a stale debt.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
