Because we conclude that the trial court erred in returning the case to the school board, we reverse and remand for a hearing before the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-15\">{\u00b6 2} The following facts are undisputed. Appellee, Gloria J. Sturdivant, was hired as a first-year teacher under a \u201climited contract\u201d by appellant, the Toledo Board of Education (\u201cboard\u201d). She taught during the 2001-2002 school year and was evaluated under standards and procedures established under a collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) with the board known as \u201cThe Toledo Plan-Intern, Intervention, Evaluation.\u201d This plan is administered by the Intern Board of Review (\u201cIBOR\u201d), which oversees the evaluation process and recommends whether limited contracts should be renewed. On April 17, 2002, the IBOR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>informed Sturdivant by letter that, based upon her internship evaluations, she was not being recommended for a contract for 2002-2003. Following the letter\u2019s instructions, Sturdivant requested a meeting to appeal the IBOR\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 3} Meanwhile, the board advised Sturdivant that at its next meeting, it would \u201cconsider the recommendation not to renew\u201d her contract. On April 29, 2002, the board met in regular session and approved the IBOR\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 4} Sturdivant did meet with the IBOR but was unsuccessful in changing its recommendation, which it reconfirmed by a letter dated May 9, 2002. She received a May 14, 2002 certified letter from the board on May 17, 2002, officially notifying her that her contract would not be renewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">{\u00b6 5} Sturdivant then appealed the board\u2019s decision with the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, and requested as the record for the court\u2019s review, her personnel file, written observations and evaluations by any board personnel, midterm and final evaluations, recommendations regarding the nonrenewal of her contract, as well as any appeals and related transcripts of all hearings. The board complied, filing the record with the court on July 25, 2002, and refiling it on May 22, 2003, when the first record could not be located.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">{\u00b6 6} At the common pleas level, Sturdivant alleged that the board denied her due process and failed to comply with R.C. 3319.11 and 3319.111 (evaluation procedures.) The board opposed Sturdivant\u2019s administrative appeal, arguing that it was not timely filed and that the CBA\u2019s evaluation plan and procedures superseded those statutory sections, as permitted by R.C. Chapter 4117 (collective bargaining agreements).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">{\u00b6 7} The only reference in the record to the actual CBA evaluation plan was a quote in Sturdivant\u2019s notice of appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cRevised evaluation standards and criteria shall be published by the Board free of charge in booklet form to each member o[f| the bargaining unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code Sections 3319.11 and 3319.111, as revised by the 1988 Ohio House Bill 330 (see Appendix O, pg. 265), the procedures, time lines, and all other matters regarding evaluation will be governed by the document, <em>The Toledo Plan </em>\u2014 Intern, <em>Intervention, Evaluation. </em>Subsequent changes must be mutually agreed [upon] by the Federation and the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cAPPENDIX O</p>\n<p id=\"b438-13\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe Board and the Federation hereby agree that:</p>\n<p id=\"b438-14\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe procedures for the evaluation of teachers employed under limited contracts, the employment and reemployment of such teachers, and the nonre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>newal of limited contracts, as set forth in the current collective bargaining agreement, and by the intern-intervention program, and established practices thereunder, shall supersede the provisions of Ohio Revised Code Sections 3319.11 and 3319.111, as revised by 1988 Ohio House Bill 330, in their entirety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">{\u00b6 13} After reviewing the record, the court determined that Sturdivant had timely appealed the board\u2019s decision under R.C. 2505.07<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 3319.16.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Noting that neither party had provided a complete copy of the CBA evaluation plan, the court ultimately found that because Sturdivant had not been permitted to present evidence or cross-examine witnesses under oath, there were deficiencies in the procedures at the administrative hearing. Since this resulted in insufficient evidence contained in the record, the court remanded the case to the board for a \u201crehearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">{\u00b6 14} The board now appeals from that judgment, setting forth the following four assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c[1.] The common pleas court erred when it refused to consider the provisions of collectively bargained agreements regarding non-renewal procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c[2.] The common pleas court erred regarding applicable law and abused its discretion by ordering the Board of Education to conduct a \u2018re-hearing.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c[3.] The common pleas court erred when it concluded that Ms. Sturdivant\u2019s administrative appeal was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c[4.] In the event that a re-hearing is ordered, what is the proper forum, and what procedures should be required?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">{\u00b6 19} We will first consider the board\u2019s third assignment of error, which asserts that Sturdivant\u2019s appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-13\">{\u00b6 20} R.C. Chapter 2506,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in conjunction with R.C. Chapter 2505, governs the procedure that must be followed in filing a notice of an appeal from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>an administrative decision of a school board. See <em>Kiel v. Green Local School Dist Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 149, 630 N.E.2d 716. R.C. 2505.07 provides that, generally, a party has 30 days after a final administrative order to file an appeal. Reasonable notice of a final order is essential to due process and fundamental to the right of appeal. <em>Moldovan v. Cuyahoga Cty. Welfare Dept. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 293, 296, 25 OBR 343, 496 N.E.2d 466. In the absence of applicable statutory provisions, if certified mail is used to give notice of an order or decision, the appeal time begins to run from the date of receipt. See <em>State ex rel. Francu v. Windham Bd. of Edn. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 351, 352, 25 OBR 403, 496 N.E.2d 902, citing <em>State ex rel. Peake v. S. Point Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St.2d 119,122, 73 O.O.2d 437, 339 N.E.2d 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">{\u00b6 21} Here, Sturdivant appealed from the board\u2019s final decision not to reemploy her, rather than the IBOR\u2019s recommendation upon which the board relied in making that decision. Although the board may have acted at the April 29, 2002 meeting, she did not receive actual notice of its action until May 17, 2002. Within 30 days of receiving the board\u2019s decision, Sturdivant filed her notice of appeal with the common pleas court on June 13, 2002. Nothing was offered to the trial court to show that Sturdivant was required to follow any other procedure set forth in the CBA. As a result, Sturdivant was permitted to appeal from the board\u2019s decision not to renew her teaching contract within the 30-day time limit of R.C. 2505.07. Accordingly, the trial court properly found that her appeal was timely and the third assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">{\u00b6 22} In the first assignment of error, the board contends that the court erred by not considering the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement concerning nonrenewal of teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">{\u00b6 23} Before 1989, nontenured teachers hired under limited contracts had no expectancy of continuing employment, and, thus, due process rights were not implicated when their contracts were terminated. See former R.C. 3319.11; <em>Delong v. Southwest School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St.2d 62, 65 O.O.2d 213, 303 N.E.2d 890, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus. Effective July 1, 1989, amended R.C. 3319.11(E) now requires school boards to give notice of nonrenewal to limited contract teachers. <em>Estock v. Conneaut Area City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(Sept. 30, 1993), Ashtabula App. No. 92-A-1757, 1993 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>408168; <em>Manholt v. Maplewood Joint Vocational School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(Aug. 21, 1992), Portage App. No. 91-P-2410, 1992 WL 207800. Moreover, R.C. 3319.11(G)(7) creates a right to a hearing before the school board and a limited right to an administrative appeal as set forth within R.C. Chapter 2506. <em>Kiel v. Green Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>supra, 69 Ohio St.3d at 152, 630 N.E.2d 716. In addition, R.C. 3319.111 provides for standardized evaluation procedures. Thus, R.C. Chapter 3319 was specifically revised to give due process safeguards to nontenured teachers. <em>Geib v. Triway Local Bd. of Edn. </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 447, 449, 705 N.E.2d 326; <em>Kiel, </em>supra, 69 Ohio St.3d at 150, 630 N.E.2d 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">{\u00b6 24} R.C. Chapter 4117, however, permits a school board and its teachers to enter into a CBA, to expressly opt out of the statutory evaluation procedures of R.C. 3319.11 and 3319.111, and agree to alternate procedures. See R.C. 4117.01 et seq.; <em>Naylor v. Cardinal Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 162, 630 N.E.2d 725. Nonetheless, R.C. 4117.10 states: \u201cWhere no agreement exists or where an agreement makes no specification about a matter, the public employer and public employees are subject to all applicable state or local laws or ordinances pertaining to the wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment for public employees.\u201d Thus, while a CBA may provide for alternative evaluation procedures, in our view, it must still offer comparable due process protections contemplated by the legislature which enacted the safeguards of R.C. Chapter 3319. See, also, <em>Naylor, </em>supra, at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">{\u00b6 25} In the present case, as the common pleas court correctly determined, a copy of the CBA evaluation plan was not included in the record or offered during the administrative appellate proceedings. While Sturdivant may have referred to a portion of the CBA, no substantive evidence of the actual evaluation plan and procedures was ever provided. Without the complete agreement, the board could not establish whether the CBA contains adequate evaluation procedures which truly supersede all the requirements of R.C. 3319.11 and 3319.111. Thus, the court committed no error in failing to consider an agreement that was not provided, and the first assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">{\u00b6 26} In its second assignment of error, the board argues that the court erred in applying the law and in ordering a rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\"> {\u00b6 27} In an appeal of the common pleas court\u2019s administrative appeal decision, an appellate court does not review the administrative agency\u2019s action directly, but, instead, reviews the court\u2019s action and factual findings for abuse of discretion. See <em>State Emp. Relations Bd. v. Adena Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 485, 613 N.E.2d 605; <em>Kisil v. Sandusky </em>(1984), 12 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>St.3d 30, 34, 12 OBR 26, 465 N.E.2d 848. The abuse-of-discretion standard, however, is not applied to the common pleas court\u2019s determinations of law. <em>In re Kralik </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 232, 235-236, 655 N.E.2d 273. An appellate court must determine, pursuant to R.C. 2506.04, whether, as a matter of law, the decision of the common pleas court has correctly applied the law to the facts as determined by the agency and the common pleas court. <em>Kisil, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">{\u00b6 28} We also note that a common pleas court\u2019s scope of review is more limited in R.C. Chapter 3319 appeals than in standard administrative appeals under R.C. Chapters 2505 and 2506. R.C. 3319.11(G)(7)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> allows an appeal to the court of common pleas only on the grounds that a board of education has not complied with R.C. 3319.11 or 3319.111. Where a CBA supersedes those sections, however, the standard of review is governed by R.C. 2506.04.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under this standard, the common pleas court considers the \u201cwhole record,\u201d including any new or additional evidence admitted under R.C. 2506.03, and determines whether the law was properly applied and whether the administrative order is unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence. <em>Henley v. Youngstown Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 142, 147, 735 N.E.2d 433. See, also, <em>Smith v. Granville Twp. Bd. of Trustees </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 608, 612, 693 N.E.2d 219, citing <em>Dudukovich v. Lorain Metro. Hous. Auth. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 202, 206-207, 12 O.O.3d 198, 389 N.E.2d 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>{\u00b6 29} Since the board itself did not conduct an actual hearing in Sturdivant\u2019s case, we must determine what procedures apply to her appeal in the common pleas court. Generally, no right to confrontation and cross-examination attaches to a pretermination hearing of a public employee. See <em>Ohio Assn, of Public School Emp., AFSCME, AFL-CIO v. Lakewood City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 175, 177, 624 N.E.2d 1043, citing <em>Cleveland Bd. of Edn. v. Loudermill </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 532, 545, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494. Public employment, however, has been deemed to constitute a statutorily created property right that cannot be taken without some measure of due process. <em>Ohio Assn., </em>supra. See, also, <em>Loudermill, </em>supra; <em>Arnett v. Kennedy </em>(1974), 416 U.S. 134, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 40 L.Ed.2d 15; and <em>Jackson v. Kurtz </em>(1979), 65 Ohio App.2d 152, 157, 19 O.O.3d 105, 416 N.E.2d 1064 (if state law gives a right to continued employment unless there is good cause for discharge, a legitimate property interest exists and the employee must be afforded procedural due process before deprivation of that right). Moreover, terminated public employees possess the right to cross-examine witnesses. See <em>Durham v. Pike Cty. Joint Vocational School, </em>150 Ohio App.3d 148, 2002-Ohio-6300, 779 N.E.2d 1051, at \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">{\u00b6 30} As the trial court correctly noted R.C. 2506.03, a procedural guide for administrative appeals to the common pleas court, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(A) The hearing of such appeal shall proceed as in the trial of a civil action, but the court shall be confined to the transcript as filed pursuant to section 2506.02 of the Revised Code unless it appears, on the face of that transcript or by affidavit filed by the appellant, that one of the following applies:</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(1) The transcript does not contain a report of all evidence admitted or proffered by the appellant;</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(2) The appellant was not permitted to appear and be heard in person, or by his attorney, in opposition to the final order, adjudication, or decision appealed from, and to do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c(a) Present his position, arguments, and contentions;</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(b) Offer and examine witnesses and present evidence in support;</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c(c) Cross-examine witnesses purporting to refute his position, arguments, and contentions;</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c(d) Offer evidence to refute evidence and testimony offered in opposition to his position, arguments, and contentions;</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c(e) Proffer any such evidence into the record, if the admission of it is denied by the officer or body appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-14\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c(3) The testimony adduced was not given under oath;</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>{\u00b6 40} \u201c(4) The appellant was unable to present evidence by reason of a lack of the power of subpoena by the officer or body appealed from or the refusal, after request, of such officer or body to afford the appellant opportunity to use the power of subpoena when possessed by the officer or body;</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c(5) The officer or body failed to file with the transcript, conclusions of fact supporting the final order, adjudication, or decision appealed from;</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cIf any circumstance described in divisions (A)(1) to (5) of this section applies, the court shall hear the appeal upon the transcript and such additional evidence as may be introduced by any party. At the hearing, any party may call, as if on cross-examination, any witness who previously gave testimony in opposition to such party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">{\u00b6 43} Thus, R.C. 2506.03 specifically provides terminated employees with the opportunity for more thorough post-termination hearings. <em>Ohio Assn., </em>supra, 68 Ohio St.3d at 178, 624 N.E.2d 1043, citing <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. at 546-547, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494. If an administrative hearing record is incomplete, if testimony was not given under oath, or if an appellant was not permitted to offer and examine or cross-examine witnesses or present evidence and do all such other things customarily allowed by due process, the common pleas court \u201c \u2018shall hear the appeal upon the transcript and such additional evidence as may be introduced by the party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lewis v. Fairborn </em>(1996), 116 Ohio App.3d 602, 604, 688 N.E.2d 1082, quoting R.C. 2506.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">{\u00b6 44} In this case, the trial court cited R.C. 2506.03, noting that witnesses did not testify and Sturdivant was unable to offer evidence of her own. There was no transcript of any \u201chearing\u201d and no copy of the CBA\u2019s evaluation plan placed in the record. Thus, on its face, the incomplete record did not provide sufficient evidence from which the trial court could review the propriety of the board\u2019s actions. The court then relied on R.C. 3319.16,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> however, and ordered a \u201crehearing\u201d by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">{\u00b6 45} As we noted, the legislature specifically enacted R.C. 3319.11 and 3319.111 to provide specific and exclusive review procedures to protect the due process rights of limited-contract teachers. Unlike R.C. 3319.16, those sections provide for an appeal to the common pleas court, rather than an additional full hearing before the school board. In our view, R.C. 3319.16 applies only to teachers under continuing contracts, not those with limited contracts. Consequently, the court\u2019s reliance on R.C. 3319.16 was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>{\u00b6 46} Rather than returning the matter to the board, the trial court itself should have conducted a hearing under R.C. 2506.03 and permitted the parties to offer sworn testimony, documents, or other evidence to determine whether the applicable evaluation procedures were used. Therefore, as the common pleas court erred in remanding the case to the board for rehearing, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is found well taken as to the trial court\u2019s remand to the board for rehearing and the fourth assignment of error is deemed to be moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">{\u00b6 47} The judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed in part and reversed in part. This case is remanded to the trial court for a hearing pursuant to R.C. 2506.03, and for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Court costs of this appeal are assessed equally between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b445-7\">Peter M.

This section, which applies to limited-contract teachers, states that \"Notwithstanding section 2506.04 of the Revised Code, the court in an appeal under this division is limited to the determination of procedural errors and to ordering the correction of procedural errors and shall have no jurisdiction to order a board to reemploy a teacher, except that the court may order a board to reemploy a teacher * * * when the court determines that evaluation procedures have not been complied with pursuant to division (A) of section 3319.111 * * * or the board has not given the teacher written notice on or before the thirtieth day of April of its intention not to reemploy the teacher * * *. Otherwise, the determination whether to reemploy or not reemploy a teacher is solely a board\u2019s determination and not a proper subject of judicial review and, except as provided in this division, no decision of a board whether to reemploy or not reemploy a teacher shall be invalidated by the court on any basis, including that the decision was not warranted * * * by any statement given pursuant to division (G)(2) of this section.* * * \"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b442-7\">. {\u00b6 a} The general standard of review for administrative appeals under R.C. 2506.04 provides that the common pleas court may find that the board's decision \u201cis unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the whole record. Consistent with its findings, the court may affirm, reverse, vacate, or modify the order, adjudication, or decision, or remand the cause to the officer or body appealed from with instructions to enter an order, adjudication, or decision consistent with the findings or opinion of the court. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">{\u00b6 b} Nothing in the record indicates that the CBA reserves the more limited standard of the superseded R.C. 3319.11. If, on remand, evidence is presented that the CBA has reserved the R.C. 3319.11 review standard, then that standard of review will apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b444-10\">. R.C. 3319.16 provides for the school board's review of its decision to terminate a teacher's contract, including the requirements of a full hearing, with the presentation of evidence, compulsory process and cross-examination of witnesses, and the stenographic recording of the proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
