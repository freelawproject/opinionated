Because we conclude that the court had jurisdiction to hear the case, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant, Rebecca Heiney, married appellee, Khristopher Heiney, in Bryan, Ohio, in 1997. When appellee joined the United States Air Force, appellant moved with him to his military posting in southeast Virginia. Two children were born of this union.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-13\">{\u00b6 3} At some point the relations between the parties became strained. According to appellant, when she attempted to initiate a divorce action in Virginia, she was advised that, since her husband\u2019s military home of record is Ohio, Virginia would not entertain jurisdiction over the divorce.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant states that Virginia attorneys advised her to pursue the divorce in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-14\">{\u00b6 4} On December 8, 2003, appellant filed in Williams County the divorce complaint that underlies this appeal. The trial court, however, sua sponte dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint, finding that \u201cjurisdiction has not been established pursuant to [R.C.] 3105.03.\u201d When appellant\u2019s motion for relief from judgment was denied, she instituted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-15\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant sets forth the following three assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b811-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe trial court denied plaintiff due process when it refused to hold a hearing on her 60B motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred when it refused to grant the plaintiffs 60B motion and reinstate the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court erred by failing to read Civil Rule 3B in the disjunctive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">{\u00b6 9} We will discuss appellant\u2019s assignments of error together.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">{\u00b6 10} In order to prevail on a motion for relief from judgment, pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B), the party seeking relief must show that he or she (1) has a meritorious claim or defense to present if relief is granted, (2) is entitled to relief under one of the grounds stated in Civ.R. 60(B)(1) through (5), and (3) the motion was made within a reasonable time. <em>GTE Automatic Elec., Inc. v. ARC Industries, Inc. </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St.2d 146, 1 O.O.3d 86, 351 N.E.2d 113, at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">{\u00b6 11} There is no argument that appellant\u2019s motion was untimely. Although this matter does not neatly fit into one of the Civ.R. 60(B)(1) through (4) categories, it may be considered under the catchall provision, Civ.R. 60(B)(5), if appellant\u2019s claim is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 3105.03 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe plaintiff in actions for divorce and annulment shall have been a resident of the state at least six months immediately before filing the complaint. Actions for divorce and annulment shall be brought in the proper county for commencement of action pursuant to the Rules of Civil Procedure. The court of common pleas shall hear and determine the case, whether the marriage took place, or the cause of divorce or annulment occurred, within or without the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">{\u00b6 14} The word \u201cresident\u201d as used in the statute means one who possesses a domiciliary residence, a residence accompanied by an intention to make the state of Ohio a permanent home. <em>Saalfeld v. Saalfeld </em>(1949), 86 Ohio App. 225, 226, 41 O.O. 94, 89 N.E.2d 165. The domicile of one entering the armed forces of the United States remains as it was prior to the serviceperson\u2019s enlistment throughout service unless a new domicile is voluntary selected by the person. <em>Glassman v. Glassman </em>(1944), 75 Ohio App. 47, 52, 30 O.O. 352, 60 N.E.2d 716. The spouse of a person in the military does not ordinarily change residence when living with that serviceperson at a military posting. <em>Dobson v. Dobson </em>(May 18,1998), Stark App. No. 97CA0217, 1998 WL 519255.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">{\u00b6 15} In her complaint and later in the affidavit accompanying her Civ.R. 60(B) motion, appellant states that both she and appellee are natives of Williams County, that appellee has maintained Bryan, Ohio, as his military \u201chome of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>record,\u201d and that he continues to hold a valid Ohio operator\u2019s license. Moreover, appellant avers, it is her intention to return to Ohio next year.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">{\u00b6 16} Absent evidence that the parties have voluntarily moved their domicile elsewhere, we must conclude that they continue to be residents of Ohio and of Williams County. Consequently, both parties meet the statutory six-month Ohio residency requirement, and venue is proper in Williams County under either Civ.R. 3(B)(1) or (9). <em>Wise v. Wise </em>(1983), 8 Ohio App.3d 243, 244, 8 OBR 316, 456 N.E.2d 1317; <em>Glover v. Glover </em>(1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 724, 728, 586 N.E.2d 159; see, also, 1970 Staff Notes to Civ.R. 3(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">{\u00b6 17} Accordingly, we conclude that appellant has a meritorious claim on her motion for relief from judgment. Appellant\u2019s second and third assignments of error are well taken. Her first assignment of error is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">{\u00b6 18} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Williams County Court of Common Pleas is reversed. This matter is remanded to that court to reinstate appellant\u2019s complaint. Costs to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b812-9\">Mark L.
