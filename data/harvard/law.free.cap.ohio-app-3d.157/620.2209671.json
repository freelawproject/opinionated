Burns and Kathleen F. Burns, appeal from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas in favor of defendants-appellees, Thomas W. Rice Sr., the city of Columbus (the \u201ccity\u201d), Gregory S. Lashutka, David Sturtz, D. James Dean, and Thomas Fischer (the last four defendants being collectively referred to as the \u201cindividual defendants\u201d) on plaintiffs\u2019 claims against defendants for defamation and conspiracy to commit defamation. Because the trial court did not err in entering judgment for defendants, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">{\u00b6 2} Plaintiffs\u2019 defamation and conspiracy claims arise out of statements contained in a Mayoral Investigative Report (the \u201cReport\u201d) released on June 30, 1997, that published the results of an in-depth mayoral investigation into serious allegations that Columbus Police Department (\u201cCPD\u201d) Chief James Jackson and other command and civilian employees of the CPD engaged in official misconduct and impropriety in the operation and management of the CPD. The subjects of the investigation included plaintiff Walter Burns, who was a CPD Commander, and plaintiff Kathleen Burns, who is Walter Burns\u2019s wife and Chief Jackson\u2019s personal secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">{\u00b6 3} On October 10, 1996, defendant Lashutka, the city\u2019s former mayor (\u201cMayor\u201d), authorized the mayoral investigation (\u201cinvestigation\u201d) pursuant to Section 63 of the Columbus City Charter, which grants power to the Mayor to investigate the conduct of city employees, subpoena witnesses and place them under oath, and cause witnesses to be punished for contempt. Section 63 further provides that persons the Mayor appoints to conduct the investigation have the same powers granted to the Mayor under Section 63 of the city charter. The Mayor directed that the scope of the investigation encompass allegations of police misconduct and mismanagement raised against CPD officers and employees concerning four subject areas: (1) an allegedly illegal gambling operation that a retired CPD sergeant, murdered in March 1995, purportedly ran, (2) prostitution enterprises, particularly a purported prostitution ring Anthony Menucci allegedly conducted, (3) favoritism in the bestowing of benefits to or by CPD employees, and (4) other acts of misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance that arose during the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">{\u00b6 4} The Mayor appointed defendant Rice, who had served as the City\u2019s Safety Director since February 1995, to formally examine the allegations of misconduct and mismanagement. Defendant Rice delegated to defendant Sturtz, the city\u2019s Assistant Director of Public Safety, the duty to handle the investigation and to supervise the other members of the investigative team. Among the other team members were defendant Dean, who was then CPD\u2019s Commander of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Internal Affairs Bureau, and defendant Fischer, a CPD lieutenant. Defendants Sturtz and Dean had supervised previous internal investigations into allegations of misconduct concerning Commander Burns\u2019s possible association with illegal gambling and his handling of an investigation of Anthony Menucci.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">{\u00b6 5} The results of the mayoral investigation were compiled into an April 4, 1997 draft report that the investigative team prepared and submitted to defendant Rice for review. Under Rice\u2019s direction, the draft report was revised and restructured to correspond to the four subject areas the Mayor designated for investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">{\u00b6 6} The finalized Report, dated June 30, 1997, contains a summary of information and events that led up to the mayoral investigation and presents an in-depth discussion of the allegations examined in the investigation. Specifically, the Report identifies 15 CPD employees whose conduct caused concern, together with the allegations raised against them; approximately 15 allegations pertain to Commander Burns and four allegations relate to Kathleen Burns. The Report discusses how the allegations arose and were investigated, what evidence was reviewed, the investigative team\u2019s conclusions regarding the allegations, and recommendations the investigative team made to the Mayor addressing various management issues and concerns noted in the Report. The Report concludes with 340 endnotes that cross-reference statements in the Report to specific testimony, witness statements, and documentary evidence contained in a voluminous appendix to the Report. The finalized Report was transmitted to the Mayor, who reviewed and released the Report to the public on June 30, 1997, without revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">{\u00b6 7} On October 30, 1997, plaintiffs filed a complaint and, on January 6, 1998, filed an amended complaint against the city of Columbus, the Mayor, and the individual defendants. Plaintiffs alleged that the individual defendants were liable for defamation, conspiracy to defame, violations of the Ohio Constitution, intentional infliction of emotional distress in connection with the publication of the Report, negligence, and abuse of power. Plaintiffs alleged that the city negligently supervised the individual defendants in the investigation of plaintiffs and the publication of the Report, and that the city was vicariously liable, as the employer of the individual defendants, for their alleged misconduct. Finally, plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of Section 63 of the Columbus City Charter, the authority on which the Mayor commenced the investigation that ultimately resulted in the Report\u2019s publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">{\u00b6 8} Utilizing Civ.R. 12(B)(6), each of the defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 claims. In a May 13, 1999 decision, journalized in a June 8, 1999 judgment entry, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants\u2019 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>{\u00b6 9} With regard to the individual defendants, the court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims for abuse of power, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and violations of the Ohio Constitution. The trial court declined to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 claims for defamation and conspiracy to defame, concluding that plaintiffs had alleged sufficient facts that, if later proven to be true, conceivably could establish such claims. The court, however, noted that the viability of plaintiffs\u2019 claims was subject to the possibility that the individual defendants could present a properly supported motion for summary judgment that pointed to facts and evidence proving their entitlement to a \u201cgood faith\u201d or \u201cqualified immunity\u201d defense to plaintiffs\u2019 defamation and conspiracy claims. See, generally, R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(b) (providing that employees of political subdivisions are immune from liability unless the \u201cemployee\u2019s act or omissions were with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">{\u00b6 10} The trial court further noted the city had asserted a defense of governmental immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744. See R.C. 2744.02(A) (setting forth the general rule of immunity under which political subdivisions are not liable in damages for personal injury). The court found that, although the city\u2019s claim of immunity was not subject to any of the exceptions listed in R.C. 2744.02(B), it \u201cmay\u201d be subject to an exception in R.C. 2744.09(B). Under that statutory exception, a political subdivision employer is not entitled to R.C. Chapter 2744 immunity where one of its employees commences a civil action relative to matters arising out of the employment relationship between the employee and the political subdivision. R.C. 2744.09(B). The trial court ruled that the city thus <em>conceivably </em>could be found vicariously liable, as the employer of the individual defendants, <em>in the event </em>plaintiffs introduced sufficient evidence that the individual defendants were liable for defamation and conspiracy to defame.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">{\u00b6 11} As a final matter, the trial court denied plaintiffs\u2019 request that Section 63 of the Columbus City Charter be declared unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">{\u00b6 12} After the parties\u2019 extensive discovery, the trial court granted summary judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims. Notwithstanding the findings in its May 13, 1999 decision, the trial court granted summary judgment to the city on the ground that the city is entitled to immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744. In granting summary judgment, the court agreed with the city that intentional acts between an employer and employee fall outside an employment relationship. Consequently, the court concluded that the employment-relationship exception to immunity in R.C. 2744.09(B) does not apply, and that the city is immune from liability pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">{\u00b6 13} Similarly, in decisions filed January 26, 2001, and June 4, 2003, the trial court granted the Mayor and the individual defendants summary judgment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>claims not resolved through their motions to dismiss. Specifically, the trial court found that the Mayor was not individually liable because plaintiffs presented no evidence that the Mayor wrote or published the Report. The court further ruled that the Mayor could not be held liable for the acts of the individual defendants under a theory of respondeat superior because the Mayor and the individual defendants were all agents or employees of the same employer, the city of Columbus.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">{\u00b6 14} The court further concluded that the individual defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffs\u2019 defamation claims because plaintiffs did not present evidence demonstrating with convincing clarity that the individual defendants published any of the statements in the Report with \u201cactual malice,\u201d as required by <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan </em>(1964), 376 U.S. 254, 279-280, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686, for a public figure/public official defamation action. The court also determined that R.C. 2744.03 provides immunity to the Mayor and the individual defendants against plaintiffs\u2019 defamation claims because plaintiffs failed to overcome the statute\u2019s qualified immunity defense by showing that the defendants acted \u201cwith malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">{\u00b6 15} Having determined that plaintiffs did not establish their defamation claims, the court concluded that the derivative claims for conspiracy to commit defamation also were not established, thus entitling the Mayor and the individual defendants to judgment on those claims as well. Finally, the court ruled that the intracorporate-conspiracy doctrine barred plaintiffs\u2019 conspiracy claims against the individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">{\u00b6 16} On June 17, 2003, the trial court entered final judgment in favor of all defendants and dismissed all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims with prejudice. Plaintiffs appeal, assigning the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">\u201c1. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment to defendantsappellees Thomas Rice, David Sturtz, D. James Dean and Thomas Fischer, and Gregory S. Lashutka as to plaintiffs\u2019-appellants\u2019 claims for defamation and conspiracy to defame.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">\u201c2. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment to defendantappellee the City of Columbus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-10\">\u201c3. The trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019-appellants\u2019 claims for declaratory judgment and violations of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">{\u00b6 17} Preliminarily, we note that, on January 28, 2004, this court granted plaintiffs\u2019 January 23, 2004 Motion for Leave to Dismiss Assignment of Error Number One as it pertains to Gregory Lashutka only. Accordingly, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Lashutka is dismissed as a party in this appeal, as no remaining assignments of error pertain to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">{\u00b6 18} In their first assignment of error, plaintiffs assert that the trial court ignored evidence and erroneously granted summary judgment to the individual defendants on plaintiffs\u2019 claims of defamation and conspiracy to defame. Before we review the arguments plaintiffs advance in support of their first assignment of error, we begin by reviewing the law regarding defamation of public officials. No dispute exists that plaintiffs in this case are public officials for purposes of their defamation action.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">{\u00b6 19} In Ohio, defamation is a false statement published by a defendant acting with the required degree of fault that injures a person\u2019s reputation, exposes the person to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, shame or disgrace, or adversely affects the person\u2019s profession. <em>A &amp; B-Abell Elevator Co., Inc. v. Columbus/Central Ohio Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 1, 7, 651 N.E.2d 1283; <em>Cooke v. United Dairy Farmers, Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-781, 2003-Ohio-3118, 2003 WL 21389646, \u00b6 24; <em>Rountree v. WBNS TV, Inc. </em>(Nov. 23, 1999), Franklin App. No. 98AP-1649, 1999 WL 1054882. The type of defamation that plaintiffs allege is \u201clibel,\u201d which involves the publication of written defamatory statements. <em>A &amp; B-Abell Elevator </em>at 7, 651 N.E.2d 1283. \u201cAs a general rule, all persons who cause or participate in the publication of libelous or slanderous matter are responsible for such publication.\u201d <em>Cooke </em>at \u00b6 25, quoting <em>Scott v. Hull </em>(1970), 22 Ohio App.2d 141, 144, 51 O.O.2d 289, 259 N.E.2d 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">{\u00b6 20} Ohio law and federal law are in accord as to the basic principles of public-official defamation law. <em>Perez v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 215, 218, 520 N.E.2d 198, certiorari denied (1988), 488 U.S. 870, 109 S.Ct. 179, 102 L.Ed.2d 148. Statements made about public officials are constitutionally protected when the statements concern \u201canything which might touch on an official\u2019s fitness for office.\u201d <em>Soke v. Plain Dealer </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 395, 397, 632 N.E.2d 1282, quoting <em>Garrison v. Louisiana </em>(1964), 379 U.S. 64, 77, 85 S.Ct. 209, 13 L.Ed.2d 125. In the present case, the Report, which published the results of the investigation the Mayor authorized, concerned matters pertaining to the fitness of Commander Burns and others as public officials. The Report\u2019s statements, thus, are entitled to constitutional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">{\u00b6 21} Under the standard enunciated in <em>New York Times </em>and its progeny, public officials or public figures must demonstrate \u201cactual malice\u201d with convincing clarity to establish the requisite degree of fault to support their defamation claims. <em>New York Times, </em>supra; <em>Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts </em>(1967), 388 U.S. 130, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094; <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>(1974), 418 U.S. 323, 342, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789. Accord <em>Dupler v. Mansfield Journal Co., Inc. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 116, 18 O.O.3d 354, 413 N.E.2d 1187, paragraph two of the syllabus, certiorari denied (1981), 452 U.S. 962, 101 S.Ct. 3111, 69 L.Ed.2d 973; <em>Bukky v. Painesville Tel. &amp; Lake Geauga Printing Co. </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 45, 22 O.O.3d 183, 428 N.E.2d 405, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">{\u00b6 22} The actual malice standard \u201cprohibits a public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with \u2018actual malice\u2019 \u2014 that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d <em>New York Times, </em>376 U.S. at 279-280, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686. To establish reckless disregard, a defamation plaintiff must present clear and convincing evidence that the false statements were made with a \u201chigh degree of awareness of their probable falsity,\u201d <em>Garrison, </em>379 U.S. at 74, 85 S.Ct. 209, 13 L.Ed.2d 125, or that \u201cthe defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.\u201d <em>St. Amant v. Thompson </em>(1968), 390 U.S. 727, 731, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 20 L.Ed.2d 262; <em>Varanese v. Gall </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 78, 80, 518 N.E.2d 1177, certiorari denied (1988), 487 U.S. 1206, 108 S.Ct. 2849, 101 L.Ed.2d 886. Actual malice is measured at the time of publication. <em>Dupler, </em>64 Ohio St.2d at 124, 18 O.O.3d 354, 413 N.E.2d 1187; <em>Varanese, </em>at 80, 518 N.E.2d 1177. As the United States Supreme Court explained, a showing of actual malice is necessary to promote an \u201cuninhibited, robust, and wide-open\u201d debate on important issues of public concern even though the debate \u201cmay well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\u201d <em>New York Times, </em>376 U.S. at 269-270, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">{\u00b6 23} Whether the evidence in the record in a defamation case is sufficient to support a finding of actual malice is a question of law for the court to decide. <em>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc. </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 485, 510-511,104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502. In making this legal determination, the trial court must \u201creview the statement under the totality of the circumstances\u201d and read the statements at issue \u201cin the context of the entire article\u201d in order to determine \u201cwhether a reader would interpret them as defamatory.\u201d <em>Mendise v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 721, 726, 591 N.E.2d 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">{\u00b6 24} Summary judgment procedures \u201care especially appropriate in the First Amendment area.\u201d <em>Dupler, </em>64 Ohio St.2d at 120, 18 O.O.3d 354, 413 N.E.2d 1187. \u201cIt is for this reason that the plaintiffs burden of establishing actual malice must be sustained with convincing clarity even when the plaintiffs case is being tested by a defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Varanese, </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 81, 518 N.E.2d 1177, citing <em>Dupler, </em>at paragraphs one and two of the syllabus, and <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 242, 257, 106 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202. In ruling on a defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion in a public official\u2019s libel action, the trial court considers the evidence and all reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the plaintiff to determine whether the plaintiff presented affirmative evidence such that a reasonable jury could find actual malice had been shown with convincing clarity. Id.; <em>Varanese, </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 81, 518 N.E.2d 1177; <em>Grau v. Kleinschmidt </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 84, 31 OBR 250, 509 N.E.2d 399, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Dupler </em>at paragraphs one and two of the syllabus. On appeal, this court conducts an independent examination of the whole record to determine whether actual malice has been established with convincing clarity to ensure that the <em>New York Times </em>standard has been satisfied. <em>Bose, </em>466 U.S. at 508, 514, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502; <em>Varanese, </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 80, 518 N.E.2d 1177; <em>Dupler, </em>64 Ohio St.2d at 120, 18 O.O3d 354, 413 N.E.2d 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">{\u00b6 25} Here, plaintiffs challenge the trial court\u2019s findings that plaintiffs presented insufficient evidence of \u201cactual malice\u201d to withstand the individual defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions. Plaintiffs assert that they presented \u201cabundant evidence\u201d that defamatory statements about plaintiffs contained in the Report were false and that defendants published the false and defamatory statements with actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">{\u00b6 26} With regard to Commander Burns, plaintiffs contend that the individual defendants knowingly or recklessly published defamatory statements in the Report that they knew to be untrue concerning (1) Commander Burns\u2019s knowledge of or participation in an illegal gambling operation allegedly run by a retired CPD sergeant, and (2) Commander Burns\u2019s handling of the Menucci investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">{\u00b6 27} Initially, we note that, in addressing whether evidence substantiated the assertions of their complaint, plaintiffs repeatedly fail in their brief on appeal to distinguish between (1) \u201callegations\u201d that were investigated, and (2) the Report\u2019s \u201cconclusions\u201d drawn from information obtained during the investigation. As an example, the initial \u201cstatement\u201d with which plaintiffs take issue, concerning Commander Burns\u2019s knowledge of and participation in an illegal gambling operation, is expressly identified in the Report as an \u201callegation.\u201d The Report\u2019s \u201cconclusions\u201d regarding the allegation are that (1) \u201cBurns could not be placed at the * * * address [of the alleged gambling operation] and actually participating in the illegal card games,\u201d and (2) \u201c[t]his investigation does not confirm or deny the allegations that * * * [Commander] Burns participated in the illegal gambling operation[.]\u201d Thus, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 suggestions, the Report does not affirmatively conclude that Commander Burns knew of or participated in the illegal gambling operation, as plaintiffs alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Nevertheless, for purposes of our review, we will assume that (1) the statements with which plaintiffs take issue are false and defamatory and (2) the individual defendants were at least negligent in publishing the statements. Accordingly, our analysis focuses on whether plaintiffs presented clear and convincing evidence that the individual defendants acted with actual malice in publishing statements concerning plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">{\u00b6 29} Plaintiffs assert that actual malice is demonstrated because the Report omitted pertinent evidence that disproves the allegation concerning Commander Burns\u2019s involvement in illegal gambling. Plaintiffs contend that all of the admitted participants of the purported illegal gambling operation who were interviewed in this and previous investigations flatly denied that Commander Burns had any association with it, but that none of their statements exonerating Commander Burns was included in the Report. Plaintiffs argue that the Report\u2019s failure to include the exculpatory statements demonstrates actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">{\u00b6 30} The omission of material from a publication does not demonstrate a disregard for the truth unless the selection of material for inclusion in the publication \u201cis made with a view toward the dissemination of false information.\u201d <em>Perez, </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 220, 520 N.E.2d 198. In this case, because the Report concluded that Commander Burns could not be placed either at the address where illegal gambling purportedly occurred or as actually participating in illegal card games, the Report\u2019s omission of specific statements of participants in the allegedly illegal gambling operation does not demonstrate actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">{\u00b6 31} Similarly lacking in merit is plaintiffs\u2019 further contention that the individual defendants\u2019 failure to include information in the Report absolving <em>another </em>CPD officer, not Commander Burns, of involvement in illegal gambling demonstrates actual malice. The omission of such information is irrelevant to show actual malice with regard to the Report\u2019s statements concerning Commander Burns\u2019s alleged involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">{\u00b6 32} Plaintiffs also argue that the sole evidence supporting Commander Burns\u2019s alleged connection with illegal gambling was information supplied by an unverified, anonymous informant who telephoned the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s (\u201cF.B.I.\u201d) Cincinnati office in April 1995, and accused Commanders Burns and Marcum of playing in and protecting the alleged illegal gambling operation of the retired CPD sergeant. Plaintiffs assert that the weight the investigative team gave to the single, unverified source constituted an unreasonable departure from accepted methods of investigation and reporting and thus is evidence of actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>{\u00b6 33} Reckless disregard may be found \u201c \u2018where a story is fabricated by the defendant, is the product of his imagination, or is based <em>wholly </em>on an unverified anonymous telephone call.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>A &amp; B-Abell, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 12-13, 651 N.E.2d 1283, quoting <em>St. Amant, </em>390 U.S. at 732, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 20 L.Ed.2d 262. The record does not support plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the allegation concerning Commander Burns\u2019s knowledge of or participation in illegal gambling was based \u201cwholly\u201d on an unverified anonymous telephone call. Although the record indicates one of the <em>initial </em>sources of such allegations was the anonymous informant, the record further reflects that similar allegations about Commander Burns were received from several named law enforcement sources within the CPD. Because other evidence supports the allegation at issue, plaintiffs have failed to establish reckless disregard in either the investigation of the allegation or the reporting of the results of the investigation concerning the allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">{\u00b6 34} Next, plaintiffs take issue with statements in the Report regarding the allegation that \u201cCommander Walter Burns failed to carry out his responsibilities during the criminal investigation of the Anthony Menucci escort service.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that the individual defendants knew or should have known the Report falsely stated that (1) \u201ccritical errors\u201d occurred in the Menucci investigation while it was under the direct supervision and control of Commander Burns and (2) Commander Burns\u2019s handling of the investigation \u201celiminated any possibility by the Columbus Division of Police to file criminal charges on Menucci.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">(\u00b6 35} Specifically, plaintiffs contend that evidence in the record, such as testimony and an affidavit Commander Burns submitted, disputes the statement that \u201ccritical errors\u201d occurred during Commander Burns\u2019s handling of the Menucci investigation, including the disappearance of 90 to 100 written investigative summaries, surveillance logs, progress reports, photographs, and a videotape relating to the investigation. According to plaintiffs, their evidence further disputes the Report\u2019s additional notation of \u201ccritical errors\u201d involving the disappearance of a Rolodex seized from the Menucci residence, the failure to follow proper procedures for handling and documenting evidence, and Commander Burns\u2019s impeding an internal affairs investigation by ordering that a CPD officer\u2019s name be removed from a potentially incriminating report. Plaintiffs contend that the Report\u2019s conclusion regarding Commander Burns\u2019s handling of the Menucci investigation should have been consistent with the evidence plaintiffs presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">{\u00b6 36} The record, however, reveals that other evidence, including statements of several identified CPD officers who served with Commander Burns during the Menucci investigation, provides support for the Report\u2019s conclusion that errors occurred during Commander Burns\u2019s handling of the Menucci investigation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Additional support for the Report\u2019s conclusion also is found in a letter from then United States Attorney Edmund Sargus to CPD Deputy Chief Rockwell. In the letter, Sargus, who apparently reviewed much of the same evidence relating to Commander Burns\u2019s handling of the Menucci investigation as was examined in the investigation, concluded that, while there was not sufficient evidence to support a federal criminal conviction of Commander Burns, \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d existed that \u201cthe Menucci investigation was mishandled and the integrity of the evidence compromised by Commander Burns\u2019 actions.\u201d Sargus further concluded that \u201cCommander Burns\u2019 actions have created serious problems in the chain of custody of seized evidence\u201d in the Menucci case. The individual defendants were justified in relying upon the testimony, evidence collected, and conclusions of other law enforcement officers. See <em>New York Times, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">{\u00b6 37} Moreover, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 contention, where evidence conflicts and is subject to differing reasonable interpretations, such a dispute supports, rather than precludes, summary judgment for defendants in a public official defamation case. <em>Perez, </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 219, 520 N.E.2d 198. The election to make one of two reasonable' interpretations does not demonstrate a disregard for the truth. Id. at 220, 520 N.E.2d 198. Because the Report\u2019s conclusions regarding Commander Burns\u2019s handling of the Menucci investigation were based upon reasonable interpretations of conflicting evidence, actual malice is not demonstrated. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">{\u00b6 38} Plaintiffs also argue that the individual defendants knew or should have known of the falsity of the statement that Commander Burns\u2019s handling of the Menucci investigation \u201celiminated any possibility by the Columbus Division of Police to file criminal charges on Menucci.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that defendant Rice was fully aware at the time the Report was published that a Franklin County Grand Jury had indicted Menucci for promoting prostitution, as reflected in a June 7, \u201c1997\u201d press release Rice issued, in which Menucci\u2019s indictment was expressly noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">{\u00b6 39} While the record reflects that the press release announcing the grand jury\u2019s indictment of Menucci was issued on June 7,1996, not 1997, the date is not dispositive of plaintiffs\u2019 contentions. Rather, arguments that the defendants \u201cshould have known\u201d of the alleged falsity of a statement or failed to verify the truth of a statement are constitutionally insufficient to show actual malice unless the statement is incredible on its face or the defendant in fact had subjective reasons to doubt the source\u2019s reliability. <em>Varanese, </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 82, 84, 518 N.E.2d 1177, citing <em>St. Amant, </em>390 U.S. at 731-732, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 20 L.Ed.2d 262, and <em>Dupler, </em>64 Ohio St.2d at 119, 18 O.O.3d 354, 413 N.E.2d 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>{\u00b6 40} Here, the record indicates that a Franklin County Grand Jury issued a criminal indictment against Menucci for prostitution-related offenses. The record further reflects, however, that the Franklin County Prosecutor\u2019s Office later dropped the charges and that federal charges against Menucci were filed instead, resulting in his conviction for federal money laundering. Rice testified that, although he may have reviewed the press release at the time it was issued, which was over a year before the Report was released, he did not recall it when reviewing the Report for publication. Rice\u2019s failure to recall the contents of the press release, while arguably negligent, is \u201cconstitutionally insufficient to show the recklessness that is required for a finding of actual malice.\u201d <em>New York Times, </em>376 U.S. at 288, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686. Moreover, even if the statement at issue is false, whether every statement in the Report is actually true is not pivotal to the \u201cactual malice\u201d inquiry. See discussion in <em>New York Times </em>at 270-273, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (observing \u201c[t]hat erroneous statement is inevitable in free debate, and that it must be protected if the freedoms of expression are to have the \u2018breathing space\u2019 that they \u2018need * * * to survive,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Cantwell v. Connecticut </em>[1940], 310 U.S. 296, 310, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213). Plaintiffs have not demonstrated actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">{\u00b6 41} Turning to Kathleen Burns, plaintiffs take issue with statements about Kathleen Burns that are contained in the Report\u2019s Executive Summary section, which identifies CPD employees and their conduct that caused \u201cconcern\u201d during the investigation. Plaintiffs contend that the statements \u201ccreate an impression\u201d that Kathleen Burns hid investigative summaries and attempted to improperly access internal affairs files relating to the Menucci investigation, and that Commander Burns assigned her to work improper overtime during the Menucci investigation. Plaintiffs assert that the statements were published with knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard for their truth because (1) the investigative team failed to fully investigate the allegations and unreasonably departed from accepted standards of investigation by failing to interview Kathleen Burns and other witnesses who were critical to proving or disproving the allegations and (2) the Report omitted exculpatory evidence relating to the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">{\u00b6 42} The plaintiffs in this case have failed to present clear and convincing evidence that the individual defendants knew or had serious doubt about the truth of the statements about Kathleen Burns. First, Kathleen Burns does not dispute that two of the missing Menucci investigative summaries were found in her office on a computer disk. Second, although plaintiffs argue that statements in the Report imply that she improperly accessed a CPD record room where internal affairs files were kept, the Report actually concludes that it was not proven that the room had an unauthorized entry. Third, Kathleen Burns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>admitted that her husband, when he was Vice Commander, assigned her over 30 hours of overtime, as stated in the Report, but that she did not recall whether it involved the Menucci investigation. Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 suggestions, the Report does not conclude that Kathleen Burns\u2019s performance of the referenced overtime was improper, although statements in the Report may raise questions about the propriety of a senior officer assigning overtime to his spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">{\u00b6 43} Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are without merit insofar as they contend that the investigative team\u2019s failure to fully investigate and to interview witnesses concerning the statements about Kathleen Burns demonstrates actual malice. A failure to investigate the truth or falsity of a publication, even when a reasonably prudent person would have done so, may raise an issue of negligence, but it does not demonstrate actual malice unless the plaintiff first establishes that the defendant had a high degree of awareness of probable falsity, had serious doubts as to the truth of the statements, or purposefully avoided the truth. <em>Harte-Hanks Comm., Inc. v. Connaughton </em>(1989), 491 U.S. 657, 688, 109 S.Ct. 2678,105 L.Ed.2d 562; <em>St. Amant, </em>390 U.S. at 731, 733, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 20 L.Ed.2d 262; <em>A &amp; B-Abell Elevator, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 12-13, 651 N.E.2d 1283; <em>Varanese, </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 81, 518 N.E.2d 1177; <em>Dale v.

As the trial court noted, \u201c[w]hether the publishers acted prudently in all respects, or as reasonable persons in their positions would have acted, is not the question before the court.\u201d Plaintiffs simply have not shown with convincing clarity that defendants ignored or omitted evidence in an effort to purposefully avoid the truth or to disseminate false information regarding Kathleen Burns, or that defendants otherwise acted with reckless disregard for the truth in publishing the statements at issue. Accordingly, the actual-malice standard has not been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>{\u00b6 45} Plaintiffs next assert that the trial court disregarded \u201cabundant circumstantial evidence\u201d that the individual defendants \u201chad no intention of publishing the truth.\u201d In support, plaintiffs note that defendants (1) acted with spite and ill will and conducted a \u201csmear campaign\u201d directed at Chief Jackson to remove him from office and to damage the reputations and careers of those deemed loyal to him, including these plaintiffs, (2) relied on questionable sources to support the allegations against plaintiffs, and (3) edited and restructured the Report to highlight plaintiffs\u2019 alleged misconduct and to cast plaintiffs in a \u201cbad light.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">{\u00b6 46} A plaintiff is entitled to prove actual malice through circumstantial evidence, although courts are not to place too much reliance on such factors. <em>Harte-Hanks, </em>at 668, 109 S.Ct. 2678, 105 L.Ed.2d 562; <em>Perk v. Reader\u2019s Digest Assn., Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 1991), 931 F.2d 408, 411. Actual malice in the context of defamation is not satisfied merely through a showing of personal spite or ill will, as the defendants\u2019 motives alone are insufficient to establish actual malice. <em>Harte-Hanks, </em>491 U.S. at 666, 109 S.Ct. 2678, 105 L.Ed.2d 562; <em>Varanese </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Dupler, </em>64 Ohio St.2d at 119, 18 O.O.3d 354, 413 N.E.2d 1187. Nonetheless, the defendants\u2019 motives, when combined with other circumstantial evidence, may amount to a showing of malice. <em>Perk, </em>supra. In any event, the focus is on the defendants\u2019 attitude toward the truth or falsity of the publication, rather than the defendants\u2019 attitude toward the plaintiffs. <em>Garrison, </em>379 U.S. at 73-79, 85 S.Ct. 209, 13 L.Ed.2d 125; <em>Perez </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Dupler, </em>at 119,18 O.O.3d 354, 413 N.E.2d 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">{\u00b6 47} According to the record, Rice expressed an opinion that Chief Jackson and Commander Burns should resign from their positions in the face of the allegations against them. Even so, plaintiffs have not shown with convincing clarity that Rice or the other individual defendants engaged in a \u201csmear campaign\u201d or had spite and ill will as a motive for investigating or publishing defamatory allegations concerning plaintiffs. Even if evidence of convincing clarity had demonstrated such a motive, such evidence still would be insufficient to establish actual malice in the absence of clear and convincing evidence, lacking in this case, that the defendants published the defamatory statements about plaintiffs with knowledge that the statements were false or with a high degree of awareness of their probable falsity. <em>Varanese; Perez, </em>supra. \u201cA defendant who was motivated to publish by the blackest spirit of hatred and spite will not be liable if he subjectively believed in the truth of the statement.\u201d <em>Varanese, </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 80, 518 N.E.2d 1177.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">{\u00b6 48} Plaintiffs next contend that circumstantial evidence of actual malice is demonstrated in defendants\u2019 reliance on \u201cquestionable\u201d sources, as obvious reasons exist to doubt the truthfulness or reliability of the sources. As examples, plaintiffs refer to the Report\u2019s inclusion of (1) allegations of an anonymous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>informant who telephoned the F.B.I. office in Cincinnati concerning Commander Burns\u2019s alleged involvement with illegal gambling and (2) an incarcerated criminal\u2019s allegations concerning misconduct that Chief Jackson and others within the CPD, not including the instant plaintiffs, allegedly committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">{\u00b6 49} Where a report is made of a third party\u2019s allegations, \u201crecklessness may be found where there are obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of the informant or the accuracy of his reports.\u201d <em>St. Amant, </em>390 U.S. at 732, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 20 L.Ed.2d 262. With regard to the anonymous informant, we previously concluded that other, sufficient evidence supported the allegation regarding Commander Burns\u2019s possible involvement with illegal gambling; thus, plaintiffs failed to demonstrate actual malice in the Report\u2019s including the anonymous informant\u2019s allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">{\u00b6 50} With regard to the Report\u2019s inclusion of a prisoner\u2019s allegations concerning misconduct of Chief Jackson and others, we note initially that the allegations at issue are not directed toward Commander Burns or Kathleen Burns; hence, they do not evidence defendants\u2019 actual malice toward these two plaintiffs. However, even if the allegations are relevant and material to our consideration of plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, the Report specifically notes that law enforcement personnel deemed the prisoner source to be a \u201cscam artist,\u201d a \u201cliar,\u201d and \u201cnot reliable.\u201d Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, the Report\u2019s disclosure of concerns or credibility problems regarding a source displays a lack of actual malice rather than malice. <em>Rountree, </em>supra, citing <em>Barry v. Time, Inc. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1984), 584 F.Supp. 1110, 1122; and <em>Barger v. Playboy Enterprises, Inc. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1983), 564 F.Supp. 1151, 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">{\u00b6 51} Finally, the editing and restructuring of the April draft report, which plaintiffs argue \u201cslanted\u201d the Report against plaintiffs and highlighted their alleged wrongdoing, is insufficient to meet the actual malice standard. See <em>Perez, </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 220-221, 520 N.E.2d 198 (finding that similar allegations of improper motive, reliance on questionable sources, and questionable editing were insufficient to establish actual malice); <em>Perk, </em>931 F.2d at 411-412 (concluding that the defendant\u2019s motive to write a story with a \u201cparticular slant\u201d to portray the plaintiff in a negative light, even when coupled with the defendant\u2019s reliance on questionable sources and its failure to interview witnesses and to perform a more thorough investigation, was insufficient to establish actual malice).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">{\u00b6 52} In the final analysis, plaintiffs failed to present clear and convincing evidence that the individual defendants published statements in the Report with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of their publication. Accordingly, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the individual defendants on plaintiffs\u2019 defamation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>{\u00b6 53} Given the foregoing conclusion, we necessarily also conclude that plaintiffs are unable to proceed on their claims for conspiracy to commit defamation. See <em>Bigelow v. Brumley </em>(1941), 138 Ohio St. 574, 594-595, 21 O.O. 471, 37 N.E.2d 584 (finding no cause of action for conspiracy to commit defamation where no underlying cause of action for defamation exists). See, also, <em>A &amp; B-Abell Elevator, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 15, 651 N.E.2d 1283 (holding that the \u201cactual malice\u201d standard applies to claims that are derivative of a defamation claim); and <em>Kenty v. Transamerica Premier Ins. Co. </em>(Nov. 18, 1993), Franklin App. No. 93AP-478, 1993 WL 478056, reversed on other grounds (1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 415, 650 N.E.2d 863 (determining that without the existence of the underlying cause of action, there can be no claim for civil conspiracy). Summary judgment therefore appropriately was granted on plaintiffs\u2019 claims for conspiracy to commit defamation. Whether the intracorporate-conspiracy doctrine also bars the conspiracy claims is a question we need not reach, and we decline to address it. App.R. 12(C)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">{\u00b6 54} The trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the individual defendants on plaintiffs\u2019 claims of defamation and conspiracy to commit defamation, and plaintiffs\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">{\u00b6 55} In their second assignment of error, plaintiffs assert that the trial court improvidently granted summary judgment in favor of the city of Columbus because the trial court\u2019s ultimate determination, that R.C. 2744.09(B)\u2019s exception to political subdivision immunity does not apply to this case, is erroneous. Plaintiffs argue that the trial court\u2019s ruling conflicts with this court\u2019s decision in the related case of <em>Marcum v. Rice </em>(July 20, 1999), Franklin App. No. 98AP-717, 1999 WL 513813, discretionary appeal not allowed (1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 1449, 719 N.E.2d 966 (concluding that the plaintiff police officers\u2019 defamation claims against the city of Columbus based on the mayoral investigation and the publishing of the Report relate to matters arising out of the employment relationship between the plaintiffs and the city), and also conflicts with the trial court\u2019s own prior ruling that R.C. 2744.09(B) \u201cmay apply to this action.\u201d Plaintiffs submit the trial court was bound under the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine to follow its prior ruling on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">{\u00b6 56} In light of our disposition of plaintiffs\u2019 first assignment of error, we need not reach the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claim. As plaintiffs alleged, the city\u2019s liability to plaintiffs is derivative, predicated upon respondeat superior principles under which the city is potentially liable as the employer of individual defendants found to have engaged in misconduct, and on the city\u2019s negligent supervision of individual defendants found to have committed misconduct. However, \u201cif an employee has no liability, the employer cannot be liable under the theory of respondeat superior because any liability of the employer is derivative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>of the employee\u2019s liability.\u201d <em>Walk v. Ohio Supreme Court, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-205, 2003-Ohio-5343, 2003 WL 22290209, \u00b6 6, citing <em>Pretty v. Mueller </em>(1997), 132 Ohio App.3d 717, 723, 726 N.E.2d 503. Similarly, an underlying requirement in an action for negligent supervision is that the. employee is individually liable for a tort or a claimed wrongdoing against a third party, who then seeks recovery against the employer. <em>Strock v. Pressnell </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 207, 217, 527 N.E.2d 1235.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">{\u00b6 57} In overruling plaintiffs\u2019 first assignment of error, we concluded that plaintiffs failed to present sufficient evidence of the individual defendants\u2019 actual malice to establish defendants\u2019 liability for the defamation-based claims. Because plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the city are derivative of the defamation-based claims against the individual defendants, they likewise cannot be sustained. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 second assignment of error is rendered moot, and we decline to address it. App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">{\u00b6 58} In their third assignment of error, plaintiffs assert that the trial court erred in dismissing their constitutional challenge to Section 63 of the Columbus City Charter. Plaintiffs contend that, but for the authority granted to the Mayor under Section 63, the investigation that ultimately produced the allegedly defamatory Report would not have been possible. Plaintiffs argue that Section 63 unconstitutionally delegates judicial power to the Mayor by granting the Mayor unlimited subpoena and contempt power. Thus, plaintiffs assert, Section 63 is unconstitutional as overbroad and in violation of the separation of powers doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">{\u00b6 59} Section 63 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\">\u201cThe mayor may without notice cause the affairs of any department or the conduct of any officer or employee to be examined. Any person or persons appointed by the mayor to examine the affairs of any department or the conduct of any officer, or employee, shall have the same power to compel the attendance of witnesses, and the production of books and papers and other evidence and to cause witnesses to be punished for contempt, as is conferred upon the council by this charter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">{\u00b6 60} Plaintiffs\u2019 request for declaratory judgment regarding the constitutionality of Section 63 was dismissed in the trial court, pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6), under which a claim may be dismissed when it appears \u201c \u2018beyond doubt from the complaint that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts entitling him to recovery.\u2019 \u201d <em>Springfield Fireworks, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, Div. of State Fire Marshal, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-330, 2003-Ohio-6940, 2003 WL 22976621, \u00b6 12, quoting <em>O\u2019Brien v. Univ. Community Tenants Union, Inc. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 242, 71 O.O.2d 223, 327 N.E.2d 753, syllabus. A court looks only to the complaint and, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, determines whether the allegations are legally sufficient to state a claim. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">{\u00b6 61} In asserting that Section 63 is unconstitutional, plaintiffs focus on its contempt provision. The trial court concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint did not allege that plaintiffs actually had been punished for contempt, and it determined that the lack of actual punishment distinguished this case from <em>Haas v. Jennings </em>(1929), 120 Ohio St. 370, 166 N.E. 357, upon which plaintiffs relied. In <em>Haas, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held unconstitutional an identical Toledo City Charter provision under which the petitioners in that case were punished for contempt. Because the plaintiffs here were not actually so punished, the present trial court concluded that it was precluded from passing on the constitutionality of Section 63, as a justiciable controversy did not exist, plaintiffs lacked standing, and the case was not ripe for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">{\u00b6 62} Before plaintiffs have standing to present a claim for declaratory relief, they generally must have suffered an actual injury, and an actual controversy must exist between the parties. See <em>Dickason v. State, </em>Franklin App. No. 01AP-1373, 2002-Ohio-5168, 2002 WL 31160094, \u00b6 17 (determining that a claim for declaratory relief is appropriately dismissed if neither a justiciable issue nor an actual controversy between parties exists and requires speedy relief to preserve rights that may otherwise be lost or impaired). Notwithstanding the lack of actual punishment upon these plaintiffs for contempt during the mayoral investigation, plaintiffs\u2019 compliance with the mayoral investigation under a <em>threat </em>of punishment for contempt arguably is sufficient to confer standing on plaintiffs to test the validity of Section 63. See <em>Pack v. Cleveland </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 129, 131, 1 OBR 166, 438 N.E.2d 434; <em>Peltz v. S. Euclid </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St.2d 128, 40 O.O.2d 129, 228 N.E .2d 320, paragraph one of the syllabus (holding that a person has standing to bring an action for declaratory judgment to test the validity of an ordinance, even where the person does not violate the ordinance but faces the threat of criminal penalties if the ordinance is violated).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">{\u00b6 63} Nevertheless, even if plaintiffs have standing to litigate their claim that Section 63 is unconstitutional, the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the claim was proper. Pursuant to Section 233 of the Columbus City Charter, \u201c[i]f any section or part of a section of this charter proves to be invalid or unconstitutional, the same shall not be held to invalidate or impair the validity, force or effect of any other section or part of a section of this charter unless it clearly appear that such other section or part of a section is wholly or necessarily dependent for its operation upon the section or part of a section so held unconstitutional or invalid.\u201d Thus, if the contempt clause in Section 63 is stricken as invalid, it is severed, and the balance of Section 63 remains intact by virtue of Section 233\u2019s \u201csaving clause.\u201d Under the remaining portions of Section 63, the Mayor still would retain power to issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>subpoenas and investigate alleged improprieties of city employees, including the power to authorize the mayoral investigation in this case, without violating any allegedly unconstitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">{\u00b6 64} Accordingly, the trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional challenge to Section 63 of the Columbus City Charter, and plaintiffs\u2019 third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">{\u00b6 65} Having overruled plaintiffs\u2019 first and third assignments of error, rendering moot their second assignment of error, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b677-8\">Bowman and Petree, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
