Because the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter a nunc pro tunc judgment entry, we vacate the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>{\u00b6 2} The facts underlying this appeal are largely undisputed. On August 8, 2002, plaintiffs filed a complaint in the common pleas court alleging that Huff negligently or recklessly operated a motor vehicle in the course and scope of his employment and, as a result, struck and dragged a bicycling juvenile, Shanna Marler. In addition to contending that FedEx was responsible under the theory of respondeat superior, plaintiffs alleged that FedEx negligently entrusted the vehicle to Huff when it knew or should have known that Huff was inexperienced or incompetent to operate the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">{\u00b6 3} In May 2003, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. By decision and entry filed June 12, 2003 (\u201cJune 12 decision\u201d), the trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs\u2019 partial motion for summary judgment. At the conclusion of the court\u2019s explanation for its decision, the trial court instructed counsel for defendants to submit an entry journalizing the decision in accordance with Loe.R. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">{\u00b6 4} Apparently recognizing the inconsistency in its June 12 decision, the next day the trial court filed a nunc pro tunc decision and entry granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment (\u201cJune 13 entry\u201d). In it, the court noted that it had \u201cmistakenly directed Defendants\u2019 counsel to submit an entry journalizing [the June 12 decision]. However, the Court\u2019s Decision was dispositive of the case and no claims or parties remain. As is evident from the caption of the Decision, the Court intended it to be a final entry.\u201d The court concluded the June 13 entry by stating that it \u201chereby issues this nunc pro tunc Decision and Entry Granting Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment and Denying Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Partial Summary Judgment for the reasons contained in the Decision rendered June 12, 2003.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">{\u00b6 5} Between the trial court\u2019s June 12 decision and its June 13 entry, plaintiffs filed a Civ.R. 41(A)(1) notice of dismissal. Specifically, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their action at 1:00 p.m. on June 13, thereby preceding the trial court\u2019s June 13 entry filed at 4:26 p.m. Plaintiffs timely appeal, assigning the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">\u201cI. The trial court erred in issuing and filing a nunc pro tunc entry on an earlier decision after dismissal of action was filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-10\">\u201cII. The trial court erred in determining there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding the ordinary negligence of defendant Huff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-12\">\u201cHI. The trial court erred in determining defendant Huff was not negligent per se for violating certain statutes and local ordinances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">{\u00b6 6} Plaintiffs\u2019 first assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred in filing its June 13 entry following plaintiffs Civ.R. 41(A) notice of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>{\u00b6 7} Civ.R. 41 governs the dismissal of actions: Civ.R. 41(A) pertains to voluntary dismissals, while Civ.R. 41(B) applies to involuntary dismissals. Civ.R. 41(A), in turn, provides two bases for a voluntary dismissal. Under Civ.R. 41(A)(1), a plaintiff may dismiss an action, without order of the court, by filing a notice of dismissal at any time before commencement of trial, unless a defendant has served a counterclaim that cannot remain pending for the trial court\u2019s independent adjudication. Unlike Civ.R. 41(A)(1), Civ.R. 41(A)(2) provides that, except as set forth in Civ.R. 41(A)(1), an action shall not be dismissed at plaintiffs instance except upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">{\u00b6 8} Once a plaintiff files a notice of dismissal, the trial court is deprived of further jurisdiction over the case. <em>Powell v. Kevin Coleman Mental Health Ctr., Inc. </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 706, 656 N.E.2d 423; <em>Frazee v. Ellis Bros., Inc. </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 828, 682 N.E.2d 676. Indeed, plaintiffs\u2019 voluntary dismissal renders the action as if it had never been commenced. <em>Zimmie v. Zimmie </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 94, 95, 11 OBR 396, 464 N.E.2d 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">{\u00b6 9} Relying on the foregoing principles, plaintiffs contend that the trial court lacked the jurisdiction to file the June 13 entry correcting its June 12 decision on the parties\u2019 summary judgment motions. Defendants respond with two contentions: (1) plaintiffs\u2019 notice of voluntary dismissal failed to comply with Loc.R. 22.04 and therefore was ineffective, and (2) the trial court\u2019s June 12 decision was a final judgment that plaintiffs\u2019 voluntary dismissal did not dissolve. Cf. <em>De Ville Photography, Inc. v. Bowers </em>(1959), 169 Ohio St. 267, 272, 8 O.O.2d 281, 159 N.E.2d 443 (noting that \u201c[w]here an action or proceeding is dismissed without prejudice, rulings preceding the final judgment or decree of dismissal are, as a general proposition, not capable of becoming <em>res judicata\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">_{\u00b6 10} Loc.R. 22.04 requires that all Civ.R. 41(A) dismissals, whether or not the trial judge has signed them, be presented to the bailiff for termination before filing. Plaintiffs concede that they did not present their Civ.R. 41(A)(1) dismissal to the bailiff before filing it. Thus, the issue under defendants\u2019 first contention is whether plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with the dictates of Loc.R. 22.04 renders plaintiffs\u2019 dismissal ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">{\u00b6 11} As defendants properly note, Section 5, Article IV, Ohio Constitution provides that \u201c[cjourts may adopt additional rules concerning local practice in their respective courts which are not inconsistent with the rules promulgated by the supreme court.\u201d See, also, Civ.R. 83(1). Even though Civ.R. 41(A)(2) permits the court to impose terms and conditions on a dismissal, Civ.R. 41(A)(1) allows a plaintiff to terminate a case without the trial court\u2019s intervention; no court approval is necessary. <em>Payton v. Rehberg </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 183, 191, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>694 N.E.2d 1379. While we recognize a valid administrative purpose behind Loc.R. 22.04, we nonetheless are compelled to conclude that Loc.R. 22.04 is inconsistent with Civ.R. 41(A)(1). By requiring that a Civ.R. 41(A) notice of dismissal be presented to the court\u2019s bailiff <em>prior </em>to filing, Loc.R. 22.04 undermines a plaintiffs unilateral authority to dismiss a case under Civ.R. 41(A)(1). In effect, it adds a condition to Civ.R. 41(A)(1) and requires court review, if not approval. Although the court is empowered to attach such a condition to a Civ.R. 41(A)(2) filing, it may not by local rule engraft such a condition to a Civ.R. 41(A)(1) dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">{\u00b6 12} Whether a local rule requiring presentation of the Civ.R. 41(A)(1) notice of dismissal to the bailiff <em>following </em>filing would achieve the same administrative purpose and comply with Civ.R. 41(A)(1), we need not address in this case. Rather, we determine only that Loc.R. 22.04 is inconsistent with Civ.R. 41(A)(1) in requiring that a plaintiffs voluntary notice of dismissal under Civ.R. 41(A)(1) be subject to presentation to the court\u2019s bailiff prior to its effectiveness on filing. Because plaintiffs\u2019 Civ.R. 41(A)(1) notice of dismissal was effective upon filing, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter its June 13 entry following plaintiffs\u2019 notice of dismissal. See <em>Powell, </em>supra (concluding that plaintiffs voluntary dismissal pursuant to Civ.R. 41[A][1] deprived the court of jurisdiction and rendered void the court\u2019s subsequent journal entry attempting to declare a prior partial summary judgment to be final).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">{\u00b6 13} Defendants nonetheless contend that, even if plaintiffs\u2019 Civ.R. 41(A)(1) dismissal was effective on filing, it nonetheless was ineffective in eliminating the judgment against plaintiffs, as defendants contend that the trial court\u2019s June 12 filing was a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">{\u00b6 14} As defendants correctly note, the trial court\u2019s June 12 filing is entitled \u201cDecision and Entry\u201d on defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, as well as \u201cDecision and Entry\u201d on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment. While such language ordinarily would render the decision a final judgment, the trial court\u2019s June 12 filing specifically instructs counsel for defendants to \u201csubmit an entry journalizing this Decision in accordance with Loe. R. 25 on or before July 2, 2003.\u201d As a result, the title of the document contradicts the language the trial court employed in the body of the document. Generally, we look to the substance of the document, rather than its title, in ascertaining whether the document is a final appealable order. Here, because the body of the document suggests that it was not intended to be a final judgment in the action, we conclude that it is not a final judgment. As a result, plaintiffs\u2019 voluntary notice of dismissal preceded any final judgment and was effective in dismissing the action before the trial court could file its nunc pro tunc entry. See <em>Powell, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>{\u00b6 15} In the final analysis, without expressing any opinion as to the. merits of filing a voluntary dismissal following a trial court\u2019s decision on a summary judgment motion, we conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 filing a Civ.R. 41(A)(1) notice of dismissal effectively dismissed their action before the trial court filed its June 13 entry. As a result, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to take further action following plaintiffs\u2019 voluntary dismissal. Plaintiffs\u2019 first assignment of error is sustained, rendering moot their second and third assignments of error. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s judgment, reflected in its June 13 entry, is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Judgment vacated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b682-6\">Bowman and Watson, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
