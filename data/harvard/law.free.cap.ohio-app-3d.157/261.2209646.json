Specifically, on March 20 and 24, 2003, Tarbay began on-line conversations with a girl he thought was 13 years old. Tarbay was actually chatting with the undercover sheriffs deputy. During those conversations, Tarbay solicited the \u201cgirl\u201d to engage in sexual activity. On March 20, 26, and 27, 2003, Tarbay began Internet conversations with a \u201cgirl\u201d he believed was 15 years old. Again, Tarbay was actually communicating with the undercover deputy. During each of the conversations, Tarbay solicited the \u201cgirl\u201d to engage in sexual activity. During the last conversation with the \u201cgirl,\u201d Tarbay arranged to meet \u201cher\u201d at a Hamilton County motel. When Tarbay arrived at the motel, he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">{\u00b6 3} Tarbay was charged with five counts of importuning and one count of attempted unlawful sexual conduct with a minor. Prior to trial, Tarbay moved to dismiss the charges. The trial court denied the motion. Eventually Tarbay entered no-contest pleas to each count. The trial court accepted the pleas and found him guilty as charged. The court sentenced Tarbay to three years of community control and, as a condition of community control, ordered Tarbay to serve 180 days in the Hamilton County Justice Center. Tarbay now appeals, bringing forth two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>{\u00b6 4} In his first assignment of error, Tarbay argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss. Tarbay\u2019s first argument pertains to the importuning charges. Tarbay maintains that R.C. 2907.07(E)(2) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to him because it infringes upon the right of free speech guaranteed under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">{\u00b6 5} R.C. 2907.07(E)(2), which has now been renumbered R.C. 2907.07(D)(2), provides that \u201c[n]o person shall solicit another by means of a telecommunications device, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, to engage in sexual activity with the offender when the offender is eighteen years of age or older and * * * [t]he other person is a law enforcement officer posing as a person who is thirteen years of age or older but less than sixteen years of age, the offender believes that the other person is thirteen years of age or older but less than sixteen years of age or is reckless in that regard, and the offender is four or more years older than the age the law enforcement officer assumes in posing as the person who is thirteen years of age or older but less than sixteen years of age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">{\u00b6 6} Tarbay argues that this part of the importuning statute is facially invalid under the First Amendment because it is an impermissible content-based limitation on speech. The state argues that R.C. 2907.07(E)(2) is facially valid because the statute\u2019s prohibitions do not regulate protected speech, but if the statute did regulate protected speech, then the statute is narrowly tailored to serve the state\u2019s compelling interest in protecting children from being solicited for sexual activity with an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">{\u00b6 7} Preliminarily, we note that there is a strong presumption that legislative enactments are constitutional.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cAn enactment of the General Assembly is presumed to be constitutional, and before a court may declare it unconstitutional it must appear beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislation and constitutional provisions are clearly incompatible.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A statute may be considered overbroad, and thus in violation of the First Amendment, if \u201c[it] prohibits constitutionally protected conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But even speech protected by the First Amendment can be regulated if the state has a compelling reason, and if the statute is narrowly tailored to achieve the state\u2019s interest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>{\u00b6 8} In <em>State v. </em>Snyder;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a case factually similar to the one at bar, the Third Appellate District held that R.C. 2907.07(E)(2) did not violate the First Amendment because the statute was narrowly construed so as to apply only to unprotected speech. In <em>Snyder, </em>a police officer posing as a 14-year-old girl made contact over the Internet with a 36-year-old man. After several conversations describing sexual activities that the man wanted to engage in with the girl, a meeting was arranged. When the adult male appeared for the meeting, he was arrested and charged with importuning.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">{\u00b6 9} In considering the First Amendment challenge, the Third Appellate District first determined that R.C. 2907.07(E)(2) could possibly apply to speech protected by the First Amendment. \u201cR.C. 2907.07(E)(2) makes criminal the act of soliciting a law enforcement officer to engage in sexual activity if the offender believes, or is reckless in that regard, that the law enforcement officer is thirteen years of age or older but less than sixteen years of age. The First Amendment does protect two adults communicating about and soliciting sexual activity.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But the Third Appellate District concluded that the state had a compelling interest in protecting minors from unlawful sexual activity. We agree. \u201cThe United States Supreme Court has recognized that there is a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors, which extends to shielding minors from influences that are not obscene by adult standards.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Third Appellate District also concluded that the importuning statute was narrowly tailored to achieve the state\u2019s interest and did not have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on speech, \u201cbecause the offender would have to believe that he is soliciting a minor for sexual activity, a criminal act, before his conduct would be regulated by R.C. 2907.07(E)(2).\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, the Third Appellate District observed that R.C. 2907.07(E)(2) did not restrict any more conduct or speech than was necessary to achieve the state\u2019s interest.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Notably, the statute did not restrict \u201cadults and minors from communicating about sex\u201d or \u201cspeech about adults engaging in sexual conduct with minors\u201d; it only prohibited \u201cspeech that solicits minors to engage in illegal sexual activity with adults.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>{\u00b6 10} We agree with the Third Appellate District\u2019s reasoning and conclusion and hold that R.C. 2907.07(E)(2) is not facially invalid on First Amendment grounds. We note that the Second Appellate District has also reached the same conclusion about a similar First Amendment challenge based on the reasoning in <em>Snyder.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">{\u00b6 11} Tarbay, citing <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition,</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>argues that R.C. 2907.07(E)(2) is not narrowly tailored to serve the legislature\u2019s stated interest in protecting minors from the significant potential for psychological and physical harm involved in adult solicitations to engage in illegal sexual activity, because there is no real minor involved to protect from harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">{\u00b6 12} In <em>Ashcroft, </em>the Supreme Court clarified the scope of governmental power to regulate child pornography. The court held provisions of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (\u201cCPPA\u201d), which criminalized the production and possession of \u201csexually explicit images that appear to depict minors but were produced without using any real children,\u201d to be in violation of the First Amendment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because <em>New York v. Ferber\u2019s </em>[ (1982), 458 U.S. 747, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113] rationale for classifying child pornography as unprotected speech relied upon the government\u2019s interest in protecting children harmed in the production process, the CPPA\u2019s criminalization of pornography that did not involve the exploitation of actual children was unconstitutionally overbroad. Although the government advanced several arguments, including that a pedophile could potentially use the images to engage minors in sexual activity, linking \u201cvirtual\u201d child pornography with the protection of children, the Supreme Court found any link to be too attenuated. Finally, because the statute did not contain an exception for speech with \u201cserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value,\u201d it could not ban \u201cvirtual\u201d child pornography as obscene under the <em>Miller v. California </em>[ (1973), 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419] analysis.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">{\u00b6 13} <em>Ashcroft </em>is distinguishable from the case at bar. In <em>Ashcroft, </em>the court based its opinion on its view that certain provisions of the CPPA violated the First Amendment because they prohibited the dissemination of <em>protected </em>speech, i.e., the expression of ideas. Essentially, the court held that some \u201cvirtual child pornography\u201d could be protected speech. Thus, unlike the provisions in <em>Ashcroft, </em>the importuning statute here is aimed not at preventing the expression of ideas but at \u201cprohibiting adults from taking advantage of minors and the anonymity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>and ease of communicating through telecommunications devices, especially the Internet and instant messaging devices, by soliciting minors to engage in sexual activity.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> R.C. 2907.07(E)(2) regulates conduct \u2014 soliciting a child to engage in sex acts \u2014 that is not protected by the First Amendment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It does not regulate any type of protected speech as the CPPA attempted to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">{\u00b6 14} Second, the rationale set forth by the government in <em>Ashcroft, </em>that there was the attenuated potential at some unspecified time in the future that a hypothetical pedophile might use the material considered protected speech to arouse himself or to improve his chances of engaging in sexual activity with a child, is not present in the case at bar. Here, the immediate potential for a person to use the anonymity of the Internet and unprotected speech to directly solicit a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity is very significant. The harm to children was prevented in this case by the \u201csting\u201d operation. It was fortunate that Tarbay was communicating with an undercover officer whom he only believed was a minor but who was not an actual minor. It appears that the importuning statute served its purpose by preventing harm to a minor.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">{\u00b6 15} Tarbay also seems to argue that the importuning statute is not narrowly tailored to serve the state\u2019s interest, because it applies only to an adult offender who is four years older than the age assumed by the officer posing as a minor. We believe that it is reasonable for the state to find that the impact of a direct solicitation for sex on an adolescent from a much older adult is more damaging than such a solicitation from a person closer in age.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The older adult is more likely to be more sophisticated and better able to coerce or overcome the resistance of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">{\u00b6 16} Because R.C. 2907.07(E)(2) is narrowly tailored to serve the government\u2019s compelling interest, we hold that it is constitutional on its face and as applied to Tarbay. We note that our holding is in line with United States Supreme Court precedent, which has rejected the contention that the First Amendment extends to speech that is incidental to or part of a course of criminal conduct, i.e., soliciting a minor child for sex.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Finally, Tarbay raises the argument that R.C. 2907.07(E)(2) punishes mere thought. But, as noted above, the importuning statute does not prohibit an adult and child from communicating about sex, nor does it prevent two people, regardless of their age, from talking about sexual activity between a child and an adult. R.C. 2907.07(E)(2) criminalizes only the solicitation of a minor, or someone the offender believes to be a minor, to engage in illegal sexual activity with an adult. Tarbay was not convicted of importuning because he was thinking about having sex with a minor; he was convicted for his intent to solicit a person he believed to be a minor to engage in sex acts with him. \u201c[T]he harm is in the asking,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> not the discussion of it. In sum, we reiterate that there is simply \u201c[no] First Amendment right to attempt to persuade minors to engage in illegal sex acts.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">{\u00b6 18} Next, Tarbay argues that the charge of attempted unlawful sexual conduct with a minor should have been dismissed because simply driving to the hotel where Tarbay had arranged to meet the 15-year-old girl was not a substantial step in the commission of the offense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">{\u00b6 19} Initially, we note that Tarbay entered a no-contest plea to the charge of attempted unlawful sexual conduct with a minor. By pleading no contest, Tarbay admitted to the truth of the facts alleged in the indictment.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Those facts were that Tarbay \u201cknowingly engaged in conduct which, if successful, would have constituted or resulted in the offense of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor.\u201d At the plea hearing, the prosecutor read into the record that Tarbay had made arrangements to meet a person he believed to be a 15-year-old girl at the Red Roof Inn in Blue Ash, Ohio, for the purpose of sexual activity, and that on March 27, 2003, Tarbay drove from Columbus, Ohio, to the arranged location.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cA \u2018criminal attempt\u2019 is when one purposely does or omits to do anything which is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> A substantial step involves conduct that is \u201cstrongly corroborative of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>{\u00b6 21} In <em>State v. Schaefer,</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Second Appellate District held that the defendant\u2019s act of driving to meet a person whom he believed was a 14-year-old girl he had solicited over the Internet for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity was a substantial step in the commission of the offense of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, and that the act of driving to the arranged meeting spot on the date and time planned was strongly corroborative of his criminal purpose.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">{\u00b6 22} Likewise, Tarbay\u2019s act of driving to an arranged meeting place, the Red Roof Inn, on the date that he had agreed to meet a 15-year-old girl for the purpose of engaging in the sexual activity that they had discussed on the Internet was strongly corroborative of Tarbay\u2019s specific intent to engage in sexual activity with a minor, and it thereby constituted a substantial step in committing the offense of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to dismiss the charge of attempted unlawful sexual conduct with a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">{\u00b6 23} In sum, because R.C. 2907.07(E)(2) is not invalid facially or as applied on First Amendment grounds, and because Tarbay took a substantial step in the commission of the offense of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor by driving to a hotel on an arranged date, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying Tarbay\u2019s motion to dismiss. The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">{\u00b6 24} In his second assignment of error, Tarbay maintains that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing jail time as a condition of community control, when none of the factors under R.C. 2929.14(B) warranting a prison sentence was present. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">{\u00b6 25} A trial court has broad discretion in sentencing a defendant, and a reviewing court will not alter the sentence unless the trial court has abused its discretion.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> An abuse of discretion amounts to more than a mere error of judgment; it implies that the trial court\u2019s decision was arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">{\u00b6 26} R.C. 2929.16 governs the imposition of community control. R.C. 2929.16(A) states that an offender who is not subject to a mandatory prison term may be required to submit to any \u201ccommunity residential sanction or combination of community residential sanctions.\u201d There are no set guidelines for determining which sanction or combination of sanctions should be imposed. We note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>R.C. 2929.16(A)(1) does permit a trial court to impose a community-control sanction that includes a \u201cterm of up to six months at a community-based correctional facility that serves the county.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">{\u00b6 27} We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Tarbay to 180 days in the Hamilton County Justice Center, a community-based correctional facility, in light of the fact that Tarbay stood convicted of six separate felony offenses. We note that R.C. 2929.14(B) requires a trial court to make statutory findings only before imposing a prison sentence that is served in a facility governed by the Department of Correction. Serving time in a local jail as part of a community-control sanction is not the same as a prison sentence.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court did not have to rely upon any of the factors in R.C. 2929.14(B) before imposing Tarbay\u2019s jail sentence. The second assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b304-7\">Winkler, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b304-8\">Painter, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\">. <em>State </em>v. <em>Collier </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 267, 581 N.E.2d 552.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b298-9\">. <em>State v.
