And on said 3d day of May, said <em>James, </em>by his deed of that date, conveyed said premises to said <em>Oliver Parker </em>in fee; but his said wife did not, in or by said deed, relinquish or part with her right of dower in said premises, nor has she at any time relinquished or parted with the same. And said premises, at the time of making said writing obligatory, were, and still continue, liable to the claim of said <em>Susanna </em>for her dower therein; <em>without that, </em>that said <em>Oliver, </em>at the time of making the deed in said plea mentioned, was sole seised of said premises free and clear of all encumbrances whatever ; and this he is ready to verify, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-10\">\n<em>T. Bigelow.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-11\"><em>Rejoinder, </em>that before the time when said <em>Prescott </em>became seised of all the premises, in manner and form as in the replication is supposed, one <em>O. P., </em>now deceased, was in his lifetime seised of the same in his demesne as of fee, and being so seised, on 3d Jan. 1787, by his deed of bargain and sale, granted the same to said <em>Prescott; </em>that, at the time of making the same deed, the said <em>Prescott, </em>by his certain deed of defeasance or writing obligatory, bound himself to the said <em>O. P., </em>deceased, in the sum of $1000, on condition that, if he, the said <em>O. P., </em>should, on or before the first day of April then next, pay to said <em>Prescott </em>the sum of $658 and 33 cents, with the lawful interest for the same, then the same deed should be void, and that he, the said <em>Prescott, </em>would release to him, the said <em>O. P., </em>the premises aforesaid; which defeasance *was executed and delivered at the same time of making and executing the said deed of <em>Prescott </em>from said <em>O. P.; </em>whereby, and by force of the conveyance so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>made as aforesaid, the said <em>Prescott </em>became seised of the same premises in fee and in mortgage <em>only, </em>subject to the condition in the same bond mentioned; and this the defendants are ready to verify.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-5\">To this rejoinder the plaintiff demurred, and assigned for causes, <em>First, </em>that the <em>plea </em>does not set forth that <em>all </em>the defendants conveyed the premises to the plaintiff by a warranty deed <em>; secondly, </em>that the <em>rejoinder </em>is a departure, in that it does not join the traverse offered by the replication ; <em>thirdly, </em>that it does not appear by said plea or rejoinder that there was no subsisting title out of said defendants at the time of said conveyance to the plaintiff; and <em>lastly, </em>that the rejoinder does not deny that <em>James Prescott </em>was seised in fee, as the plaintiff in his replication has alleged, nor is it stated in the rejoinder that the conveyance by <em>O. P., </em>deceased, to said <em>Prescott, </em>was the only seisin which said <em>Prescott </em>had in the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-6\">And the defendant joined in demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-7\"><em>Parsons, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQs4\">said that the only question he should <em>now </em>make was, whether, upon a covenant by <em>three </em>to make a deed of warranty, the deed of warranty of <em>one, </em>with a <em>release </em>of <em>the other two, </em>be a substantial performance of the covenant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-8\"><em>S. Dana, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARu\">contended that it appeared by the pleadings, that <em>Parker, </em>at the time he made the deed mentioned in the <em>lar, </em>was <em>sole seised </em>of the premises which the defendants had covenanted to convey. When, therefore, the one <em>having right </em>to the estate had conveyed with warranty, and the other two defendants had <em>released, </em>and thereby completely barred themselves from all claim, it was, though not in the words, yet within the meaning of the covenant, a substantial performance; *and it would have been absurd, and never could have been the intention of the parties, that the <em>two </em>who had nothing in the lands should have made a deed in common form jointly, with <em>Parker, </em>and thereby subjected themselves to an action instantly. But if the Court should be of opinion that the plea in bar is insufficient, then they would look at the declaration, which he said was also bad. And he contended that the action ought to have been <em>debt, </em>and that <em>covenant </em>would not lie on an instrument like the one declared on. He said that the sum of $100, mentioned in the writing, was to be considered either as <em>liquidated damages, </em>or as <em>&amp; penalty. </em>If the <em>former, </em>which he believed to be the case, then <em>debt </em>only would lie for it, being a sum certain. If the <em>latter, </em>then by our statute the action of debt ought to have been brought, that the Court might exercise the equitable powers which the statute has given them on the subject.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number><em>Parsons, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad2\">As to the plea in bar, it certainly was of importance to the plaintiff to have the warranty of the other defendants ; because, although it were true that <em>Parker </em>was sole seised, yet that seisin might be by wrong; and if he were evicted by a person having elder title, it might be that the plaintiff could obtain no indemnification from <em>Parker </em>alone. The plaintiff intended to have <em>able warrantors, </em>and had made a contract accordingly; and the law will not permit the covenant to be evaded by such proceedings as the defendants have had recourse to in the present case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-5\">As to the <em>declaration, </em>of which the deed declared on is to be considered as a part, it is evident that the sum of $100 is not liquidated damages, but a penalty. The obligation itself considers the sum as a <em>forfeiture; </em>but what is there in the statute which takes away the right that the plaintiff has at common law of electing to pursue either * remedy? Nothing which differs this case from the common cases of charter-parties, covenants of indenture, and other covenants secured by a penalty. If, however, the Court should be of opinion that the sum is to be considered as liquidated damages, they will assess that sum in damages. If the Court should think that the sum mentioned is a penalty, they will exercise their equitable jurisdiction, and assess such damages as they think just; the Court having, by the statute, a right, at the motion of either party, to assess damages in an <em>action of covenant. </em>Had the plaintiff considered the sum as a penalty, and brought an action of debt for the recovery of it, and there had been an issue to the jury, the jury could not inquire of the damages, because, by the statute, that is a subject for the equitable interference and settlement of the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-6\">This case was argued on the <em>second </em>day of the term, and on the <em>ninth </em>day of the term, the opinion of the Court was delivered by Dana, C. J., who said that the Court (viz., <em>himself, Sedgwick, Sewall, </em>and <em>Thacher, </em>justices) were unanimously of opinion that the plea in bar was insufficient, on the ground that the warranty of one of the defendants, with a release of the other two, was not a performance of the covenant declared on.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-7\"><em>S. Dana, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUx\">prayed to be heard in chancery, on the ground that the sum of $100 mentioned in the deed declared on, was to be considered as a penalty, and not as liquidated damages.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The Court did not decide whether the sum was to be considered as a penalty or as liquidated damages, but seemed to think that it was a penalty. They appeared to have some doubts with regard to their power, by the statute, 1785, <em>c. </em>22, to assess damages in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>action of covenant which is not brought to recover the forfeiture or penalty; but as the defendant had moved to be heard by the Court as *to the damages, they, with the assent of the plaintiff, assessed the same, and ordered the judgment to be entered for $ 100, and the interest thereof, from the service of the writ, saying that the defendants ought to satisfy the Court that the sum should be reduced, but they had given no evidence to that effect. <footnotemark>(1) (a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\"><em>Parsons </em>and <em>T.
