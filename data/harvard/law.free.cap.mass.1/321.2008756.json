after her death, which was in 1798, application was made to the judge of probate for this county, for a division and distribution of the estate set off to the widow as dower, (being a brick mansion house and land, situate in Boston,) among the heirs at law of the intestate,- and on the 6th day of July, 1802, the judge passed a decree assigning all the real estate of the intestate, which remained to be distributed or divided, to the appellee, <em>Gibbs Atkyns, </em>the only surviving son of said intestate, he having given bond to pay to the other heirs, or legal representatives of the * intestate their [ * 322 J ratable parts or proportion of said estate. <em>&amp;c</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>From this decree the appellants appealed, and filed the following reasons, <em>viz., First, </em>That the said <em>Gibbs Atkyns, </em>subsequent to the decease of the said <em>Thomas Atkyns, viz., </em>on the 22d day of April, 1795, by deed, duly executed, acknowledged, and recorded, conveyed to <em>Sarah Atkyns, Timothy Atkyns, Robert Marrable, Sally Marrable, Jones Marrable, Mary Atkyns, </em>the said <em>Martin Gay </em>and Ruth, his wife, the said <em>Edward Proctor </em>and <em>Hannah, </em>his wife, <em>Ephraim Lombard, </em>and the said <em>Catharine Lombard, </em>his wife, all his right, title, interest, and claim, in and unto all the estate of the said <em>Thomas Atkyns, </em>both real and personal, for a valuable consideration in the said deed expressed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-5\">And, <em>secondly, </em>because the aforesaid assignment is contrary to law.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-6\"><em>Ephraim Lombard, </em>the husband of <em>Catharine Lombard, </em>one of the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWH\">had died after making the deed, and previous to the <em>decree;
