Whitman, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7c\">conceded that the note was signed by <em>Weston, </em>but he objected to its going in evidence to the jury, because, as he contended, it was evidence of a several demand only, a demand against <em>Weston </em>as the <em>surety </em>of Keith\u2014of a collateral undertaking by <em>Weston, </em>and not of his <em>joint </em>undertaking with <em>Keith, </em>as alleged in the declaration. This, he insisted, was evident from the note itself, which was in the singular number. It appeared that <em>Keith </em>was the <em>actual </em>debtor, the original promisor, and that the defendant\u2019s undertaking was subsequent, and, by his signing as <em>surety </em>only, it was clear that he did not mean to bind himself <em>jointly </em>with <em>Keith. </em>Upon inspecting the note, it would appear that the signature of the defendant was not made at the time the note was signed by <em>Keith, </em>as was obvious from the color of the ink in the signature of the defendant, which was very different from that of <em>Keith's </em>signature and the body of the note, in both of which the ink was the same.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b130-14\"><em>Sedgwick </em>and <em>Sewall,</em></author>\n<p id=\"AWb\">justices, said, that, as at present advised, they thought the engagement of the defendant was collateral only, for the reasons given by <em>Whitman, </em>and, therefore, the note ought not to go in evidence to the jury.</p>\n<author id=\"b130-15-pl-split\">Strong, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AE0\">I think, from the words of the note, that the defendant is to be considered as a joint promisor. If the note had been written, <em>We </em>promise, &amp;c., there would be no doubt. Then what is this note? <em>I </em>promise\u2014that is, <em>I, George Keith, Jun., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>and <em>I, Ezra Weston, </em>promise\u2014which seems to be * the [ * 158 ] same thing as, <em>We </em>promise. The note is signed in the usual place, has only one date, and it is signed in the common mode. The word <em>surety </em>is added (as is frequently the case) merely for the benefit of the surety, and that it may appear he is not the real debtor. I am clear that this is a joint note. But a majority of the Court being of a different opinion, it is not admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The plaintiff had leave' to amend his declaration on the common rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\"><em>Parsons </em>for the plaintiff. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\"> For aught appears upon the note, the defendant was responsible in the same way and manner as Keith, the bankrupt. The undertaking of <em>Weston </em>was direct, and not collateral, unless the contrary is implied by the word \u201c surety.\u201d Now that word of itself seems to have no such meaning, and the editor is not aware that such a construction has ever been given to it in recognizances, bonds, and other instruments, where it is frequently used, and where, if the undertaking is meant to be several, express words to that effect are always introduced. It is usually added to show that the consideration did not pass to the person named as surety, and to give him a remedy against the principal debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The editor has reason to believe that Sedgwick, J., afterwards changed the opinion here given by him. In a case similar to the present, except that the word \u201c surety \u201d was not annexed to either signature, Lord <em>Kenyon </em>held the note <em>joint </em>and several. <em>Marsh </em>vs. Ward, <em>Peake's </em>JV\\ P., case 130; and in a case precisely similar to that last mentioned, the same decision was made by this Court; post, vol. vii. p. 58, Hernmen<em>way </em>vs. <em>Stone.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
