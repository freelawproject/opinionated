The bond produced had the <em>same date </em>in the penal part, and in the usual place ; at the close of the condition to the instrument, immediately above the signature of the obligor, there was written, \u201c Given under my hand and seal this <em>25th day of October, </em>1802.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-13\"><em>B.
