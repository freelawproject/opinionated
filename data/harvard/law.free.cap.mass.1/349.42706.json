The last plea resulted in an issue to the country ; and to the first there was a general demurrer and joinder.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b362-6\"><em>Chase, </em>for the demandant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Adm\">in support of the demurrer, contended that the plea was no answer to the demandant\u2019s action ; that the statute has given to the person claiming dower her election to bring the action either against the tenant in possession, or against such person as has, or claims, the right or inheritance in the estate ; and therefore the defendant * ought, in her plea, to have disclaimed all right in the lands.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b362-7\"><em>E. Whitman, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZu-\">insisted that no such election was given by the statute; and that the action must always be brought against the tenant in possession, if there be one ; but if there \u25a0 were no person in the actual possession, then the action might be brought against him who claimed the right or inheritance.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b362-8\">Teacher, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAU\">It appears to me, that the law <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> contemplates two descriptions of persons against whom a writ of dower may be <em>brought </em>\u2014 First, persons in the actual possession of the estate, in which dower is demanded ; and <em>Secondly, </em>such persons as have or claim right or inheritance in the estate. The present action is brought against th\u00e9 defendant as tenant in possession, not stating that she has or claims the right or inheritance. The plea, which is confessed by the demurrer to be true, denies that the defendant is the tenant in possession s this sufficiently answers and rebuts the demand in the writ; and therefore there must be judgment for the defendant, as to that part of the lands in which the demandant claims dower, which is described in the first plea in bar.</p>\n<author id=\"b362-9\">Sewall, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A3D3\">of the same opinion. The declaration does not allege that the defendant claims the inheritance or right: the plea therefore is a sufficient answer to the action, as. it is a direct negative to the material allegations in the writ.</p>\n<author id=\"b362-10\">Sedgwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXG\">In this case, the demandant, after setting out her title to dower, alleges that the defendant has entered into the prem ises of which the demandant is dowable, deforced her of her dower <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>and holds her out of it. To this demand, the answer of the defendant, by plea, is, that neither at the time the dower was demanded, nor at any time since, was she <em>(the defendant) </em>in possession of the * premises in which the dower is demanded. To this plea, which contains an express denial of the material facts on which the demandant relies, there is a general demurrer; and nothing can be more certain, than that the plea exhibits a good bar to the demandant\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b362-11\"> Act of March 11, 1784, <em>sect. </em>1, <em>(slat. </em>1783, <em>c. </em>40.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
