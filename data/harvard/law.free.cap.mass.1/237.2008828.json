And the distinction appears to be reasonable ; for the whole, and every part and parcel, of the real estate being liable for the payment of the debts of the deceased, there does not appear to be any <em>good </em>reason why, in the <em>first </em>case, the heirs should be notified to show cause, upon an application which is made <em>merely </em>to carry that liability into effecj,. But in the other case, the application being to dispose of not only so much of the real estate as may be necessary for that purpose, but also of the <em>inheritance </em>of the heirs, on the ground that it will be for their benefit, they certainly ought to have an opportunity to be <em>heard </em>upon a question in which they are so materially <em>interested; </em>though it is conceived that the statute is not wholly free from ambiguity, as it respects the question made by the counsel for the petitioners in the foregoing case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
