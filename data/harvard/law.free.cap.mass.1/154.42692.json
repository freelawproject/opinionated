[Ante, p. 62.]</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The defendant\u2019s counsel then objected to the bill going in evidence, because in the first count there was no allegation of an intent to defraud, and in the second count, a part of the date, <em>viz., </em>the words and figures, \u201c <em>the 2Ath day of,\u201d </em>were omitted in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The Court said the <em>first </em>objection would be proper in arrest of judgment, and that the <em>second </em>was fatal as to giving the bill in evidence, the word <em>tenor </em>binding the party to a strict recital.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">The defendant consented to an amendment of the second count, and pleaded guilty to <em>that count; </em>the <em>Attorney-General </em>consenting to enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>on the first count in the indictment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
