They said that the <em>number </em>of the bill, and the <em>words </em>and <em>figures </em>in the [ * 63 ] margin, were not parts of the bill, but merely * marks superadded for the convenience of the bank, or of the holder of the bill, and, therefore, not necessary to be set out in an indictment in <em>any </em>case. The whole <em>bill, </em>all that is evidence of a contract, is set out; and set out truly and precisely. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b60-14\"> Vide ante, p. 54, <em>Commonwealth </em>vs. <em>Stow; </em>post, p. 203, <em>Commonwealth </em>vs. <em>Stevens.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
