On his return, they demanded the said parts as they had measured and marked them; said <em>Tyler </em>made the same answer as before ; they were then standing before the cellar door ; said <em>Tyler </em>ordered the demandants away, and appeared in such a passion that a witness, who saw him, concluded that, if they attempted to take possession of their parts of the cellar, he would have prevented them by force. If the Court shall be of opinion that the demandants, by virtue of said partition, took a fee simple in four seventh parts of one moiety of the cellar under the rear tenement, and on the facts aforesaid are entitled to recover seisin and possession of the same in this action, the defendants agree to be defaulted; otherwise the demandants agree to be nonsuited ; and the party prevailing shall be entitled to costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-5\"><em>Ed.

And he insisted that the words of the partition showed clearly that the distributors intended that <em>these </em>heirs should take a fee in one moiety, and <em>Mary Haden </em>in the other moiety ; because, in the partition, when nothing more than a <em>privilege </em>was intended to be assigned, the distributors had <em>so </em>expressed it; as was apparent from several places where they had made use of the word <em>privilege; </em>if so, then the demandants are tenants in common of the cellar with <em>Tyler, </em>and, if there has been an <em>ouster, </em>are entitled to recover; that there has been an ouster, he said, was obvious from the case stated. <em>Tyler </em>had, upon demand made, refused to permit the demandants to enter, and had actually hindered their entry, which in law was an actual ouster</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-8\">\n<em>Parsons,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AM0\">on the same side, said that the question was, as to the intention of the distributors, to be collected from the words of the partition, which is to be construed like a will. In the assignmen* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>to <em>Mary </em>Haden, had it stopped at the <em>tenement </em>assigned and set off then, undoubtedly, the whole cellar would have passed to her ; but giving afterwards to her <em>one half of the cellar under the rear tene</em>ment, and the other half thereof to the heirs of <em>Marcy Norcross, </em>shows that they intended each should have one half in fee; for had they intended the whole should pass to <em>Mary Haden </em>in fee by assigning to her the rear tenement, and that the heirs of <em>Marcy Norcross </em>should have only a privilege, there could have been no necessity to have said that <em>Mary </em>should have one moiety of the cellar.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-5\"><em>Dexter </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqs\">The question we make is, whether persons appointed by the judge of probate to make partition of the estate of an intestate can create a new tenancy in com- [ * 331 ] mon. \u2022 If * this partition is to stand, a new tenancy in common is created between <em>part </em>of the heirs in <em>part </em>of the estate of the intestate; that is, going on the ground that a <em>fee </em>passes in the manner contended for by the counsel for the demand-ants. But the distributors have no such power; their powers are to <em>divide </em>and set out <em>in severalty </em>an estate which was <em>before </em>held in common. All their powers and authority in this and similar cases depend upon the statutes; these powers, as in other cases, are to be construed strictly. It becomes, then, material to see what the pow ers of' the distributors are by\u00bb virtue of the statutes. By the statute passed in 1692, <em>(Prov. stat. </em>4 <em>W. &amp; M., c. </em>22, \u00a7 1,) the <em>real </em>estate of an intestate is subject to a <em>division </em>with his personal estate, and to be <em>alike distributed </em>according to the rules of the statute expressed <em>; \u201c that is to say, </em>the real and personal estate by <em>equal portions </em>to and among his children, and such as legally represent them, (if any of them be dead,) the <em>division </em>of the real estate to be made by five freeholders, or any three of them, &amp;c.\u201d Afterwards, by the statute passed in 1760, <em>(Prov. stat. </em>33 <em>Geo. c. </em>2, \u00a7 2,) the judge of probate is authorized to appoint either <em>three or five, </em>freeholders to make <em>partition </em>of the real estate of an intestate. In <em>that </em>statute provision is made <em>\u201c </em>for settling on one of the parties, not a minor, any messuage, tract of land, or other tenement, of greater value than either party\u2019s share in the estate <em>to be divided, </em>which cannot be subdivided, or part thereof assigned to one and part to another, without great inconvenience, he paying such sum or sums, &amp;c.\u201d In neither of, these statutes, nor in any <em>act </em>in force at the time when the partition now under consideration was made, is there a syllable to be found which countenances the idea that distributors have the power of creating a new tenancy in common. The <em>real </em>estate is, if it will conveniently admit of it, to be <em>divided </em>and distributed [ * 332 ] equally in <em>like </em>manner * with personal estate ; if it will not conveniently admit of such division, it is <em>not </em>:o <em>be </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number><em>divided </em>at all, but is to be assigned to some one of the heirs in the manner pointed out in the statutes. The partition is an act of law, not the act of the parties; .if the law has not authorized the distributors to make a new tenancy in common by the partition, their doings are void, and the demandants are not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-5\">But even if it should be admitted that the distributors have the power contended for, the demandants have no claim; for they expressly give to <em>Mary Haden </em>the rear tenement, <em>with the land thereto belonging, </em>which by necessary implication and intendment of law gives her the whole cellar under <em>that </em>part of the mansion house; what follows, as to giving her one moiety of the cellar, and to the heirs of <em>Marcy Norcross </em>the other, is repugnant and contradictory to what goes before, and, therefore, is void as to the cellar. The same rule of construction is applicable to this species of partition as to <em>deeds; </em>nor is there any reason why a different rule, a rule which applies to <em>wills, </em>and which has been adopted on account of the peculiar circumstances under which wills are frequently made, should govern in cases of partition. If, as is believed, a tenancy in common cannot be created in this way, yet, perhaps, the Court might construe what is said in the partition as to the cellar, to be an assignment of a privilege; this construction would establish the partition, give effect to every part of it, and avoid the repugnancy and contradiction already mentioned ; but if only a <em>privilege </em>is assigned, the demandants are not' entitled to recover, as they declare of a seisin in fee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-6\">Then as to the conveyance of <em>Nathaniel Norcross, </em>one of the demandants, to <em>Tyler; </em>the description in the deed is different from <em>that </em>in the partition ; he expressly conveys the rear tenement * <em>\u201c with the land under the same and thereto belong- </em>[ * 333 ] <em>ing,\u201d &amp;c. Whatever </em>estate he had is by that deed conveyed ; he has conveyed all he could convey, and, therefore, cannot recover against his own deed. As to the ouster, there is no evidence of <em>actual </em>ouster, without which the demandants cannot maintain their action ; all that appears in the case is, that <em>Tyler </em>told the demandants they should not have possession unless they could obtain it by law; there was no violence offered or threatened; nothing but the <em>bare suspicion </em>of the witness present that <em>Tyler </em>would have prevented by force any attempt of the demandants to enter.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-7\"><em>Parsons, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMT\">As to the ouster, it is a question whether, by <em>o\\r </em>statute, the common law doctrine of <em>actual </em>ouster is not at an end ; that is, whether the defendant is not bound to <em>disclaim </em>as to the part which he does not claim to hold a\u00a7 tenant. But in the present case there was a demand of possession. The tenant refuses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>forbids the entry, says you must get it by law if you can, and as fai as <em>words </em>could do it, turns them off. Refusal to admit one of the tenants in common to enter is an ouster by the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-5\">As to the partition of lands in the Probate Court, if the heirs have entered and submitted to the partition, it must be considered as valid : the same as if the heirs had made it by deed between themselves; which they surely might have done in the same manner as the distributors have done for them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-6\">The subject matter is within the jurisdiction of the Probate Court; and if there be an <em>informality </em>in the proceedings, <em>that </em>will not render them void. What is there in any of the statutes which prohibits the distributors from leaving one <em>strip </em>in common where the estate is such that it cannot be equally divided in any other way ? If the heirs themselves might make such division, why may not [ * 334 ] the distributors * for them ? They are appointed to act for the heirs, who, if dissatisfied, might have objected, and, upon sufficient cause shown, would have prevented the acceptance of the return of the distributors; not having done it, they and all claiming under them, are concluded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-7\">As to the construction of this partition, if it be void in part, <em>,t </em>must be void in the whole; but the intent of the distributors is tc be collected from the whole instrument taken together, and to be carried into effect if consistent with the rules of law. No precise form of words is necessary to evidence that intention; the law does not require them to use certain <em>technical </em>terms, which in the case of deeds is frequently necessary. Reading the partition, can there be any doubt ? To <em>Mary Haden </em>they set off the <em>rear, </em>of the mansion house; to the heirs of <em>Marcy Norcross </em>the <em>front; </em>and to each they give one moiety of the cellar which is under the <em>rear. </em>To have to them and their heirs, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-8-pl-split\">Then as to the deed from <em>Nathaniel Norcross. </em>It is said that <em>he </em>is <em>not </em>entitled to recover, because whatever estate he had has been conveyed. Recurring to the deed, it appears that he conveyed \u201c the rear tenement or back part of the said mansion house, <em>with land under the same, </em>and <em>thereto belonging: </em>\u201d had he intended to convey all the land under the same, he would not have used the words <em>\u201c </em>and thereto belonging,\u201d because the previous words were amply sufficient for that purpose; these words being added show that both parties understood and knew that all the land under the rear'tenement did not belong to it. Perhaps the sentence would have been more correct had the word \u201c and \u201d been omitted, in which case it would have read, \u201c with the land under the same thereto belonging; \u201d which undoubtedly was the real meaning. That the words were not intended to convey all the land under the rear tenement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>#is obvious from subsequent words in the deed; for [*335] after describing the bounds, it adds, <em>\u201c together with one half of the cellar under the said rear tenement.\u201d </em>If this construction be correct, then <em>Nathaniel Norcross </em>is on the same ground with the other demandants ; and it is believed they are entitled to judgment according to the demand in their writ.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b258-6\"> There is an ambiguity here, and in the two places immediately preceding where these words, <em>{i </em>under the same,\u201d are used <em>; but so stands </em>the original stated case, unless a copy in my possession, signed by the counsel for the parties, be incorrect. I believe, however, that it may safely be taken for granted the words were used, in the deeds mentioned thus, <em>with the </em>land, <em>u </em>under the same,\u201d <em>thereto belonging. </em>This is rendered, as I think, almost certain from the words in the deed of <em>Norcross </em>to the <em>Cunninghams, </em>a few lines subsequent. But as I have never had an opportunity to see the several deeds of <em>Mary Haden, John Gordon, </em>and <em>William M\u2019Keen, </em>they not being made part of the case, I cannot be positive that the words were used in the connection above supposed. *</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b263-5\">Dana, C.

On the question of ouster, they thought that a sufficient ouster was stated to maintain the action; and that from the whole partition taken together, and comparing the several parts, it appeared to the Court to be the manifest intention of the distributors that the heirs of <em>Marcy Norcross </em>should take a fee in one moiety of the cellar, as appurtenant to that part of the mansion-house which was set off to them ; and therefore that there must be</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the demandants, </em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>(a)</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Note.\u2014It was not <em>expressly </em>stated whether, under the statutes, distributors of the estates of intestates could so divide the estate as to create a new tenancy in common ; nut it is evident the Court could not have pronounced the judgment they did, unlesi they had been of opinion that distributors have <em>that </em>power.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\"><em> [Cummings </em>vs. <em>Wyman, </em>10 <em>Mass. </em>464.\u2014Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
