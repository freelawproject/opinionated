The jury acquitted them of the breaking, &amp;c., and found them guilty of the simple larceny only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>Jackson </em>moved in arrest of judgment, on the ground that the <em>value </em>of the money stolen ought to have been alleged in the indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-5\">* He said that, if the coins mentioned in the indictment were, by law, made current as money, and a legal tender for the payment of debts, it might, perhaps, be unnecessary to <em>aver </em>the value in the indictment; but it was clear, by the act of congress, passed February 9, 1793, that <em>French </em>crowns were not legal current money, and had ceased to be a legal tender; and although in the act there is an exception of <em>Spanish </em>milled dollars, and parts of such dollars, which, under certain circumstances, are still a legal tender, yet the act is express that no foreign coin which had been, or might be, issued subsequent to the first day of January, in the year 1792, should be a tender, until samples thereof should have been found, by assay, at the mint of the <em>United States, </em>to be conformable to the standard required by the act, and proclamation thereof made by the president of the <em>United States; non constat </em>that the other coins mentioned were issued previous to 1792; and therefore the value of the whole, as well of the <em>Spanish </em>milled dollars, and parts of a dollar, as of the <em>French </em>crowns, ought to have been averred.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b199-6\">The <em>Solicitor-General, (Davis,) </em>for the commonwealth,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXLc\">said that the reason for averring the value in <em>England </em>was, that it might appear whether the offence charged was simple or grand larceny, which did not apply <em>here, </em>as <em>that </em>distinction did not here exist; that, although it might be said that it was necessary <em>here </em>to aver the value, to enable the Court to give judgment for the treble damages, yet, if the Court should be of that opinion, it did not follow that judgment ought to be arrested; for if the indictment be not good upon the statute, the Court may give judgment as at common law, this being an offence at common law.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The Court <em>(Sedgwick, Sewall, </em>and <em>Thacher, </em>justices) were of opinion that they could not give judgment for treble damages for ahy part of the * articles stolen, excepting for the <em>chest, </em>the value of which is averred ; that for <em>that </em>they might, and arrest the judgment as to the other articles. But they informed the prisoners that the consequence would be the requiring them to recognize to appear at the next term to answer to a new indictment; whereupon the prisoners consented to have the present indictment amended by inserting the value of the money stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Note. \u2014 See 2 <em>Hawk. P. C. c. </em>25, <em>sect. </em>75, as to the necessity of averring the <em>value </em>of the things stolen in an indictment of larceny; to which section, in the Gth edition, is the following note: \u2014 \u201cThe benefit of clergy is taken away by several statutes, provided the larceny amounts to a certain value. It is therefore necessary now to state the value of the things stolen, pursuant to the words of the respective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>statutes.\u201d See also 2 <em>Hawk. c. </em>33, <em>sect. </em>59, that the benefit of clergy is taken away by <em>stat </em>8 <em>Eliz. c. </em>4, where <em>any </em>money, goods or chattels are stolen from the person of any other, <em>privily, </em>without his knowledge. In the index to the same edition, part 2, under the word <em>value, </em>it is said, \u201c At the <em>Lent </em>assizes for <em>Essex, </em>1787, <em>Gould, </em>J. and <em>Thompson, </em>B., held an indictment for <em>privately </em>stealing bad because <em>no value </em>was <em>stated </em>\u2014 M. <em>S.\u201d</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
