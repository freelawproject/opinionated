B. </em>Being convicted in <em>that </em>court, they appealed to <em>this, </em>and at the last term thereof were found guilty by the verdict of the jury. The indictment was at common law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-13\"><em>Bliss </em>moved in arrest of judgment on the ground that the Court of Sessions had not jurisdiction in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-14\">He said that this was a common law offence, and so laid in the indictment; that justices of the peace were officers not known to the common law, but were created by statute, and of course all \u2666heir powers were given by statute; and that none of our statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>nad given them jurisdiction over the offence charged in the indictment. And he cited 4 <em>Com. Dig. Title, Just, of the Peace, </em>B. 1, and 1 <em>Salk. </em>406.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-5\"><em>Hooker, </em>for the prosecution,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH2\">conceded that justices of the peace were officers created by statute, and that their jurisdiction and powers were w holly dependent upon the statutes; 2 <em>Hawk. P. C. c. </em>8, \u00a7 13, &amp;c. But he contended that their jurisdiction <em>here </em>was not limited to those offences which are expressly, and by <em>name </em>in <em>our own </em>statutes, made cognizable by them; on the contrary, that it extended to all cases in which justices of the peace in <em>England </em>had jurisdiction by any of the statutes of that country which were passed previous to the emigration of our ancestors; which were to be considered as a part of <em>our </em>common law ; that this was strongly implied in the act for establishing Courts of General Sessions of the Peace, passed July 3, 1782, <em>(stat. </em>1782, <em>c. </em>14,) by the <em>first section </em>of which <em>\u201c </em>they are empowered to hear and determine all matters relative to the conservation of the peace,, and the punish- [ * 60 ] ment of such offences as are cognizable * by them at <em>common law, </em>or by the acts and laws of the legislature, and to give judgment, &amp;.c. In <em>this </em>act, the term <em>common law </em>cannot mean the common law of <em>England,, </em>because justices of the peace <em>there </em>are not common law officers: it must, therefore, mean <em>our </em>common law; and on <em>this </em>subject, <em>our </em>common law\u2019 must be precisely what the <em>statute </em>law of <em>Enxgland </em>was at the time of the emigration of our ancestors from that country. The statutes which were previous to that time enacted in <em>England, </em>and which define or describe the authorities, powers, and jurisdiction of justices of the peace, give to them, expressly, cognizance of divers offences which were offences at common law; among which are trespasses. The present indict ment is for a trespass, and, therefore, within the jurisdiction of the Sessions.\u20142 <em>Hawk. c. </em>8, \u00a7 33, 38, 39.\u20143 <em>Burr. </em>1320, <em>Rex </em>vs. Rispall.\u20141 <em>Lev. </em>139, <em>Rex </em>vs. <em>Sommers &amp; Al.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-6\"><em>Bliss, </em>in reply, conceded that if the <em>stat. </em>of <em>Ed. </em>3, which gives jurisdiction to justices of the peace in <em>England, </em>is adopted, and makes part of <em>our </em>common law', the objection to the indictment was unfounded ; otherwise that it ought to prevail.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b58-7\">Thacher, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AE4\">I am of opinion that the statutes of 1 <em>Ed. </em>III. <em>c. </em>16, and 34 <em>Ed. </em>III. <em>c. </em>1, respecting the jurisdiction and powers of justices of the peace have been adopted, used, and approved <em>here, </em>and are to be considered as part of <em>our </em>common law; that the offence charged in the indictment is cognizable by the Court of Sessions, and, therefore, that judgment ought not to be arrested.</p>\n<author id=\"b58-8\">Sedgwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahl\">Justices of the peace, whether acting individually or in sessions, are creatures of statute ; and their powers are given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>them by the statutes.\u20142 <em>Hawk. </em>61, 8.\u2014It appears to me, generally speaking, that the <em>English statutes </em>which were in force at the time of the emigration of our ancestors from that country, are common law <em>here. </em>*The statutes of <em>Ed. </em>III. have been [ * 61 ] adopted and practised upon <em>here, </em>and are, therefore, to be considered as part of our common law. This is decisive of the question before the Court, as the offence charged in the indittme I is, by those statutes, within the jurisdiction of the Sessions.</p>\n<author id=\"b59-5\">Strong, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-v\">I have no doubt upon the question. Justices of Ine peace have exercised this authority for a long time ; certainly as far back as the memory of any of us reaches, probably much farther; which affords a strong presumption that the statutes of <em>Ed. </em>III. have been considered as common law <em>here. </em>Usage in like points has always been taken as evidence of what is our own law\u2014common law.</p>\n<author id=\"b59-6\">Dana, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"As0\">The term <em>common law </em>ought not to be construed so strictly as is contended for by the counsel for the defendant. Generally when an <em>English statute </em>has been made in amendment of the common law of <em>England, </em>it is <em>here </em>to be considered as part of <em>our </em>common law. For instance, the statute of 7 <em>Ja. </em>I. c. 5, and 21 <em>Ja. </em>I. <em>c. </em>12, giving double costs to an officer who is sued out of his county, for any thing done by him in the execution of his office, being made in amendment of the common law, is adopted here, and is part of our common law. So also the <em>statute of Anne, </em>respecting negotiable notes. Usage of the country establishes and makes the common law of the country. No one, probably, can recollect the period when the Courts of Sessions have not exercised the authority which is now excepted against. Justices of the peace have this authority expressly given them in their commissions. It appears to me that they have uniformly exercised it, and that without being questioned ; and, therefore, that the law is to be consid ered as settled. <em>Per Cur. </em>unanimously. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\n<em>Motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b59-9\"><em> [Commonwealth vs. Leach, </em>3 <em>Mass. </em>59.\u2014Blankard vs. <em>Galdy, </em>2 <em>Salk. 411; </em>2 <em>Peer Williams, 75.\u2014Campbell vs. Hall, Cowp. </em>204.\u2014Case of Sir <em>Thomas </em>Picton, 30 <em>How.
