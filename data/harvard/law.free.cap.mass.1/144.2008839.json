But it appearing that what the defendant had acknowledged was drawn from him under a promise of favor to be shown him by the prosecutor, the Court would not admit the evidence. The counsel for the defendant offered to prove, by a witness present, that <em>another person </em>had owned to the witness that <em>he </em>had stolen some of the articles mentioned in the indictment. The Court would not admit it, saying it was no more than hearsay. If a person other than the defendant had stolen the goods, it was undoubtedly competent to the defendant to prove the fact, in exculpation of himself; but not by the mode of proof now offered.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b120-12\"><em>(Strong, Sedgwick, Sewatt, </em>and <em>Thacher, </em>justices-present.) ----for the defendant.</p>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b120-15\">[Vide <em>2 </em>Russ. <em>Crim. </em>G44\u2014654.\u2014Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
