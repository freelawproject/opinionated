The tipper stated that shortly after Royce Jobe moved in next door, \"a brown privacy fence was constructed to hide the view of the detached garage on the property,\" \"a strong smell of marijuana\" began emanating from the house, and there had been \"a lot of activity in the late evening at the house including multiple vehicles arriving and individuals coming and going.\" On or about November 3, Special Agent Paul Cotcher found that the utilities account associated with the residence was not registered under Jobe's name. Cotcher prepared an affidavit outlining the information in the tip and stating that power use for the property had spiked, Jobe had prior convictions for possession of a firearm and marijuana, and Jobe had a business registered as \"420 Boutique,\" a reference to marijuana. The affidavit also stated that Cotcher had observed \"PVC piping, planters, and cooling fans\" attached to and around the garage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Based on that affidavit, on November 21, a California state judge issued a warrant authorizing a search of Jobe's residence and the seizure of certain property, including \"[a]rticles of personal property tending to establish and document sales of [marijuana,] ... including ... hard drives.\" The next day, on November 22, Cotcher and other officers executed the\n   warrant and seized, among other items, drugs, a pistol, Jobe's laptop and other electronic devices. The laptop was not searched at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After the evidence was seized, Cotcher contacted the United States Attorney's Office (\"USAO\") to ask whether the case would be prosecuted federally. Over the next ten days, Cotcher continued his investigation: He logged and arranged for storage of seized evidence, obtained Jobe's rental application and lease agreement, interviewed a postal employee who stated that Jobe mailed packages three to four times a week, and interviewed individuals whose names were tied to the utilities accounts Jobe used. On or about December 1, Cotcher was informed that the case would be prosecuted federally. He began drafting an affidavit in support of a criminal complaint and a federal warrant to search the laptop, which he completed on or about December 7. On December 12, twenty days after the laptop was seized, the complaint was filed and the warrant was signed. That same day, agents searched Jobe's laptop. The laptop contained messages indicating that Jobe had stolen credit card and bank account information. He was charged with identity theft, accessing devices without authorization, mail fraud, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Jobe moved to suppress the evidence found on the laptop. The district judge granted the motion, finding that, while the state seizure warrant was supported by probable cause, the government unreasonably delayed before obtaining a second warrant to search Jobe's computer. The government timely appealed that order.

Nevertheless, Cotcher's affidavit supporting the state warrant contained sufficient information to render his reliance on the warrant reasonable. It laid out facts indicative of a large-scale marijuana growing operation, including information from a tipper that was corroborated by Cotcher's own observations, investigation, and experience. Given the apparent scale of Jobe's operation, as indicated by his having a registered marijuana business and the substantial, consistent foot traffic to his residence late at night, the affidavit provided \"a colorable argument for probable cause,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1085, to seize items \"tending to establish and document sales of marijuana.\" Cotcher reasonably relied on the warrant's authorization to seize digital devices, such as Jobe's laptop, that might contain such documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

There is no indication that Cotcher deliberately tarried or received insufficient training. Rather, immediately after seizing the laptop, he contacted the USAO about prosecuting the case federally. During the ten days between that initial contact and being told that the USAO would handle the case-a period which included the Thanksgiving holiday-Cotcher continued with his investigation. Once the USAO responded to his inquiry, he began drafting a detailed and lengthy affidavit in support of a federal search warrant, which he finished less than a week later and then transmitted to an Assistant U.S. Attorney. Jobe contends that Cotcher could have prepared an affidavit even without hearing from the USAO. But it is USAO policy to review warrant applications prior to their submission to a magistrate, so a reasonable officer in Cotcher's position could have believed that he could not submit his warrant application until the USAO decided to proceed. While Cotcher could have been more efficient in preparing an application, his delay does not evince negligence, let alone deliberate and culpable misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Even if police conduct is not \"deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent,\" \"recurring or systemic negligence\" alone may warrant deterrence through exclusion.\n   <em>\n    Herring\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679252\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/135/#p140\">\n    555 U.S. at 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679252\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/135/#p140\">\n    129 S.Ct. 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
