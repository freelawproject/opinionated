States implement their own Medicaid plans, subject to the federal government's review and approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a. Treating the indigent proves costly even\n   for hospitals that receive Medicaid payments. Indeed, not all hospital services are covered by Medicaid; not all costs associated with covered services are allowed by Medicaid; and Medicaid does not fully reimburse hospitals for all allowable costs associated with covered services. Recognizing this, the Congress authorizes supplemental payments (\"DSH payments\") to hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients (\"DSH hospitals\"). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(13)(A)(iv) (requiring that Medicaid payment rates \"take into account (in a manner consistent with section 1396r-4 of this title) the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate number of low-income patients with special needs\"); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-4 (entitled \"Adjustment in payment for inpatient hospital services furnished by disproportionate share hospitals\"). There is both a state-specific and a hospital-specific limit on DSH payments. The state-specific limit-not at issue in this case-dictates that all DSH payments to DSH hospitals within a single state must be drawn from the same pool of federal funds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-4(f). The hospital-specific limit, which is at issue in this case, dictates that a DSH payment to a single hospital cannot exceed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   [T]he costs incurred during the year of furnishing hospital services (as determined by the Secretary and net of payments under this subchapter, other than under this section, and by uninsured patients) by the hospital to individuals who either are eligible for medical assistance under the State plan or have no health insurance (or other source of third party coverage) for services provided during the year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A). This sentence-although not the picture of clarity-establishes a few matters clearly. A DSH hospital cannot receive a DSH payment that exceeds its \"costs incurred during the year of furnishing hospital services\" to Medicaid-eligible and uninsured individuals. The Secretary is assigned the task of determining \"costs incurred.\" And \"costs incurred\" are \"net of payments under this subchapter, other than under this section, and by uninsured patients\"; in other words, payments made by Medicaid and uninsured individuals\n   <em>\n    must be\n   </em>\n   subtracted out when calculating a hospital's \"costs incurred.\" The dispute here is about whether payments made by Medicare and private insurers\n   <em>\n    should also be\n   </em>\n   subtracted out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2003, the Congress enacted legislation requiring states to submit annual reports and independent certified audits regarding their DSH programs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-4(j).

To be clear, we agree with the plaintiffs that the 2017 Rule and the 2008 Rule establish different policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   But it makes no difference. CMS explained why the statute's purposes are better fulfilled by a policy that requires consideration of payments by Medicare and private insurers (the 2017 Rule) than one that does not (the 2008 Rule, as we interpret it):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   In light of the statutory requirement limiting DSH payments on a hospital-specific basis to uncompensated care costs, it is inconsistent with the statute to assist hospitals with costs that have already been compensated by third party payments. [The 2017] rule is designed to reiterate the policy and make explicit within the terms of the regulation that all costs and payments associated with dual eligible and individuals with a source of third party coverage must be included in calculating the hospital-specific DSH limit. This policy is necessary\n   to ensure that only actual uncompensated care costs are included in the Medicaid hospital-specific DSH limit. And, because state DSH payments are limited to an annual federal allotment, this policy is also necessary to ensure that limited DSH resources are allocated to hospitals that have a net financial shortfall in serving Medicaid patients.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016%2C114\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. at 16,117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This explanation is more than sufficient to survive review under \u00a7 706(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The plaintiffs also claim that the Secretary has not tied the 2017 Rule to the administrative record. According to their reading, the record shows that CMS reduces DSH payments to the plaintiff hospitals when it considers private insurance payments, notwithstanding \"they have among the highest Medicaid inpatient utilization rates in their respective states and the highest net financial shortfalls in serving Medicaid patients.\" Plaintiffs Br. 65. The plaintiffs claim this outcome is inconsistent with the purpose of the 2017 Rule, which is \"to ensure that limited DSH resources are allocated to hospitals that have a net financial shortfall in serving Medicaid patients.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016%2C114\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. at 16,117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Their argument is doubly flawed. For starters, \"Medicaid inpatient utilization rates\" are not mentioned in \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-4(g)(1)(A). More importantly, the plaintiffs misstate which hospitals suffer a \"net financial shortfall.\" Programs and services a hospital provides that are not paid for by Medicaid are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   relevant to the shortfall calculation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-4(j)(2)(C) (\"Only the uncompensated care costs of providing inpatient hospital and outpatient hospital services to individuals described in paragraph [ (g)(1)(A) ] are included in the calculation of the hospital-specific limits under such subsection.\"). Indeed, the statute does not consider a hospital's\n   <em>\n    actual costs\n   </em>\n   ; it considers only those costs that Medicaid pays for.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016%2C114\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. at 16,118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Ancillary programs and services that hospitals provide to patients may be laudable, but they are not paid for by Medicaid because they are not costs associated with furnishing inpatient and outpatient hospital services.\"). Calculating \"net financial shortfall\" using only those costs that Medicaid pays for, no hospital that suffers a \"net financial shortfall\" will be denied a DSH payment. Thus, we disagree with the plaintiffs' argument that the Secretary has failed to tie the Rule to the record. Like their \u00a7 706(2)(C) challenge, their \u00a7 706(2)(A) challenge fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the district court, reinstate the 2017 Rule and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    We have also considered and reject the plaintiffs' other arguments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Headings, although \"not commanding,\" \"supply clues\" about Congressional intent.\n    <em>\n     Yates v.
