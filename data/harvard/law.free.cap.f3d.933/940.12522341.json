The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   concluded that Hataway had at least three prior violent felony convictions, subjecting him to a mandatory minimum fifteen-year sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), and at least two prior crime of violence convictions, which increased his guidelines base offense level under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). The district court sentenced Hataway to the bottom of the resulting advisory guidelines range -- 262 months -- followed by five years of supervised release. He appeals the sentence, arguing that his prior Arkansas conviction for aggravated assault and South Carolina conviction for pointing a firearm at another person are not ACCA \"violent felonies\" or \"crimes of violence\" under the Guidelines.

Hataway then argued that subsection (a)(2) does not satisfy the force clause because it \"only requires the government to prove that a defendant display a firearm in such a manner that creates a substantial danger of death or serious physical injury to another person,\" not the use or threatened use of violent force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court ruled on ACCA issues in an Order issued the day before sentencing.

Therefore, the district court erred, Hataway argues, because the judicial records lacked the certainty we required in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

On the other hand, when the charging document cites an over-inclusive but divisible statute or quotes the entire statute, as the Information at issue did, and simply alleges the defendant violated it, the document has done no narrowing and is insufficient to establish, using the modified categorical approach, that the defendant pleaded guilty to and was necessarily convicted of an ACCA violent felony.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In that case, the indictment narrowed an over-inclusive assault statute by charging the defendant with violating three of its five subsections.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4337548\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/744/#p748\">\n    828 F.3d at 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the defendant's admissions at the plea colloquy established that he could have been convicted under any of the three subsections, including one that did not qualify under the ACCA force clause. Applying the modified categorical approach, we concluded \"the judicial record does not establish that Horse Looking necessarily\n   <em>\n    was convicted\n   </em>\n   of an assault that has the required element.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4337548\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/744/#p748\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4337548\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/744/#p748\">\n    at 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, unlike the Information in this case, the charging document in\n   <em>\n    Horse Looking\n   </em>\n   , by specifically charging the defendant with violating a non-qualifying subsection, failed to narrow the charge to an offense that\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   qualifies. The same was true of the criminal complaint in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The South Carolina Conviction.\n   </strong>\n   Hataway argues that his prior conviction for violating \u00a7 16-23-410 of the South Carolina Code was not an ACCA violent felony or a guidelines crime of violence under the force clauses. In\n   <em>\n    Reyes-Soto v.

The force clause in \u00a7 16(a) is identical to the force clauses in the ACCA and the Guidelines, except that \u00a7 16(a) includes an offense \"that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person\n   <em>\n    or property\n   </em>\n   of another.\" However, the South Carolina statute at issue provides that \"[i]t is unlawful for a person to present or point\n   <em>\n    at another person\n   </em>\n   a loaded or unloaded firearm.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016-23-410\">\n    S.C.

Rather, he argues that\n   <em>\n    Reyes-Soto\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   were \"wrongly decided\" because they misinterpreted what should be controlling South Carolina state court decisions in two respects -- whether a defendant can be convicted under \u00a7 16-23-410 without directing a threat at another person, and whether the statute could be construed to encompass negligent conduct. However, we considered and rejected both these contentions in\n   <em>\n    Reyes-Soto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4366267\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/808/369/#p371\">\n    808 F.3d at 372-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Supervised Release Issue.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Hataway argues the district court abused its discretion in imposing a special supervised release condition requiring him to abstain from use of alcohol during substance abuse treatment because there was no finding that he suffers from alcoholism, or that use of alcohol contributed to the offense of conviction or would impede efforts to rehabilitate him. It is undisputed that Hataway has a long history of drug abuse. He began abusing methamphetamine at age 18, has multiple prior drug-related arrests and convictions, and reported using methamphetamine daily when interviewed after his arrest for this offense. We have previously held that a district court did not err in imposing an alcohol abstinence condition when the defendant was \"drug dependent.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Forde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859945\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/1219/#p1222\">\n    664 F.3d 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1222-24 (8th Cir. 2012). Here, the condition is not a total ban and is aimed at curbing addictive behavior during substance abuse treatment. There was no abuse of the district court's substantial discretion to impose reasonable special conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The Honorable Kristine G.
