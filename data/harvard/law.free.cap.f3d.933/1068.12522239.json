The State of Nevada claims that later Nevada Supreme Court decisions require us to eschew our earlier interpretation of Nevada law. While those recent Nevada Supreme Court decisions take issue with\n   <em>\n    Riley I\n   </em>\n   , they do not disagree about the relevant state-law question that was the basis for that decision: whether, at the time of Riley's conviction, first-degree murder in Nevada required three discrete elements for mens rea. Rather, they simply disagree about whether these elements needed to be separately defined.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

A close look at the relevant cases reveals that no change in state law undermines\n   <em>\n    Riley I\n   </em>\n   's interpretation of these requisite mens rea elements.

Relevant here,\n   <em>\n    Nika\n   </em>\n   emphasized that \"the\n   <em>\n    Hern\n   </em>\n   court did not specifically define 'premeditation' and 'deliberation.' \"\n   <em>\n    Nika\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3937610\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/124/1272/\">\n    198 P.3d at 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Nevada Supreme Court has explained, \"[b]efore\n   <em>\n    Kazalyn\n   </em>\n   , [decided in 1992,] it appears that 'deliberate' and 'premeditated' were both included in jury instructions without being individually defined but also without 'deliberate' being reduced to a synonym of 'premeditated.' \"\n   <em>\n    Byford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"934826\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/116/215/\">\n    994 P.2d at 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, at the time of Riley's trial and conviction, the three separate mens rea elements did not need to be individually defined, although each element needed to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Byford\n   </em>\n   further emphasized the distinction between definitions and elements. The Nevada Supreme Court concluded there were two separate problems with the\n   <em>\n    Kazalyn\n   </em>\n   instruction: it defined only premeditation without defining deliberation\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   it mandated a finding of first-degree murder if the jury found only premeditation, which erased deliberation as a distinct mens rea element.\n   <em>\n    Byford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"934826\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/116/215/\">\n    994 P.2d at 713-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court thus distinguished between the need to articulate each of the elements and the need to define those elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   However, the State argues that whether these statutory terms are separate elements or require separate definitions is functionally the same issue where the State defines those elements as effectively encompassing each other. The thrust of the State's position is that, despite\n   <em>\n    Hern\n   </em>\n   's conclusion that first-degree murder consisted of three separate mens rea elements and that \"all three elements ... must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,\"\n   <em>\n    Hern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4810145\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/97/529/\">\n    635 P.2d at 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Nevada Supreme Court understood those elements to mean functionally the same thing and merged the three into a single concept of intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The State's position fails in light of the unequivocal language in\n   <em>\n    Hern\n   </em>\n   and the principle that \"a state court is not free to define an element out of existence\" because \"every element of a crime must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Goldyn v. Hayes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5321993\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/444/1062/#p1070\">\n    444 F.3d 1062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1070 (9th Cir. 2006). Applied here, the Nevada Supreme Court is not free to define the established element of deliberation out of existence by subsuming it within premeditation, which is the effect of the\n   <em>\n    Kazalyn\n   </em>\n   instruction given during Riley's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ultimately, neither\n   <em>\n    Leavitt\n   </em>\n   nor the two non-precedential cases undermine\n   <em>\n    Riley I\n   </em>\n   's interpretation of 1991 Nevada law as announced in\n   <em>\n    Hern\n   </em>\n   . These three cases' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Nika\n   </em>\n   , and its focus on the fact that the Nevada Supreme Court did not require separate\n   <em>\n    definitions\n   </em>\n   of the statutory mens rea elements when\n   <em>\n    Hern\n   </em>\n   was decided, are irrelevant to\n   <em>\n    Riley I\n   </em>\n   's interpretation of Nevada law concerning whether the mens rea terms were separate\n   <em>\n    elements\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, these cases do not constitute a change in the relevant law required to support the State's Rule 60(b)(6) motion. Because there has been no change in the law, the central factor in this analysis, we do not reach the other factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The Nevada Supreme Court's recent pronouncement about the required elements for first-degree murder,\n   <em>\n    Byford\n   </em>\n   , confirms the same elements recognized in\n   <em>\n    Hern\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Byford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"934826\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/116/215/\">\n    994 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   713-14 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riley I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191816\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/719/#p723\">\n    786 F.3d at 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To be sure, the Nevada Supreme Court did take a short detour in its thinking about mens rea. Along the way from\n   <em>\n    Hern\n   </em>\n   in 1981 to\n   <em>\n    Byford\n   </em>\n   in 2000, the court \"changed its mind\" and, in 1992 in\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   , held that there is one, unified mens rea element: \" 'deliberate, premeditated and willful are a single phrase, meaning simply that the actor intended to commit the act and intended death to result.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Riley I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191816\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/719/#p723\">\n    786 F.3d at 723-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8558410\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/108/700/\">\n    838 P.2d at 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    vacated on other grounds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1146726\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/79/\">\n    511 U.S. 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1146726\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/79/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1146726\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/79/\">\n    128 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) ). But, in 2000, \"the Nevada Supreme Court again reversed course, abrogating\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   \" by holding in\n   <em>\n    Byford\n   </em>\n   that the first-degree murder statute includes three separate mens rea elements.\n   <em>\n    Riley I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191816\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/719/#p723\">\n    786 F.3d at 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Byford\n   </em>\n   explained that \"in\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   we overlooked earlier pronouncements of this court which recognized that 'deliberate' and 'premeditated' define distinct elements.\"\n   <em>\n    Byford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"934826\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/116/215/\">\n    994 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   713-14 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4810145\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/97/529/\">\n    635 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   280 ). In interpreting\n   <em>\n    Byford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nika\n   </em>\n   explained it amounted to a \"change in state law\" that \"abandoned the line of cases starting with\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Nika\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3937610\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/124/1272/\">\n    198 P.3d at 847, 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So for a short period-from 1992 to 2000-Nevada operated under the principle that the three elements were merged. However, this occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Riley's conviction was final. Thus, before and after\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   , the Nevada Supreme Court interpreted its first-degree murder statute to include three distinct mens rea elements-an interpretation to which we defer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Because there was no change in Nevada law that affects\n   <em>\n    Riley I\n   </em>\n   's interpretation of the required elements for first-degree murder in Nevada when Riley's conviction became final, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the State's motion under Rule 60(b)(6).
