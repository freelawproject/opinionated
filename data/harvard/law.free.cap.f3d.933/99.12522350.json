Lansuppe, which holds more than two-thirds of a class of senior notes issued by Soloso, initiated this trust instruction proceeding to seek a declaratory judgment and an order of specific performance directing Wells Fargo Bank, as Trustee, to liquidate the trust's assets and distribute the proceeds pursuant to the trust Indenture. If the liquidated assets are distributed according to the Indenture scheme, senior noteholders will be substantially compensated for their investment, while junior noteholders will receive nothing. Intervenors cross-claimed, alleging that Soloso violated the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\"ICA\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , thereby entitling them to rescission of their investment in notes issued by Soloso, under ICA \u00a7 47(b), or in the alternative to\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   distribution of Soloso's assets. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Lansuppe, finding that ICA \u00a7 47(b) does not create a private right of action, and that even if it did, Intervenors' cross-claims fail on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We conclude that the district court erred in finding that ICA \u00a7 47(b) does not provide a private right of action. However, we agree with the district court that Lansuppe has demonstrated that it is entitled to summary judgment ordering distribution of Soloso's assets according to the terms of the Indenture and that Intervenors' cross-claims fail. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment to Lansuppe, denial of summary judgment to Intervenors, and dismissal of Intervenors' cross-claims, albeit on the different ground that Intervenors failed to state a claim under the ICA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Soloso is a special purpose investment vehicle. It issued notes to investors pursuant to the terms of an Indenture dated August 24, 2005. Using proceeds from its sale of the notes, Soloso purchased Trust Preferred Securities (\"TruPS\"), which it held as collateral to secure its obligations to noteholders, and which generated interest used to pay noteholders a return on their investment. Soloso's notes include Class A-1 Notes (\"senior notes\"), as well as several tranches of junior notes. Plaintiff Lansuppe holds senior notes, which are entitled to priority of payment in the event of a liquidation, whereas the Intervenors hold junior notes, which receive a higher rate of return but lower priority of payment in relation to senior notes. Intervenors did not purchase their junior notes\n   directly from Soloso, but rather on the secondary market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In April 2013, Soloso failed to pay the periodic interest due on senior notes, which constituted, according to the terms of the Indenture, an \"Event of Default.\" Indenture \u00a7 5.1(a)(iii)(A). The occurrence of an Event of Default triggers certain noteholder rights, including the right of holders of two-thirds of the senior notes (the \"Requisite Noteholders\") to direct the Trustee to liquidate the trust's assets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5.2(a). Lansuppe, which holds more than two-thirds of the senior notes and thus qualifies as the Requisite Noteholders, directed the Trustee on July 31, 2015 to liquidate the estate. Under the distribution scheme set forth in the Indenture's \"Waterfall Provision,\" the Trustee is to use the liquidated assets first to satisfy outstanding obligations to senior noteholders, and second-if any assets remain-to satisfy outstanding obligations to junior noteholders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 5.4, 11.1. Prior to liquidation, the Trustee notified all noteholders that the Requisite Noteholders had instructed it to liquidate and distribute trust assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Junior noteholders-now Intervenors in this action-objected to the planned liquidation on the ground that Soloso had violated the ICA by issuing notes to a purchaser who was not a \"Qualified Purchaser\" within the meaning of the ICA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-3(c)(7). The ICA requires investment companies to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") but exempts from this requirement issuers whose notes are owned only by persons who at the time of their acquisition were Qualified Purchasers under the ICA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 80a-3(c) (\"[N]one of the following persons is an investment company ... (7)(A) Any issuer, the outstanding securities of which are owned exclusively by persons who, at the time of acquisition of such securities, are qualified purchasers ...\"). The Indenture contains provisions meant to ensure that Soloso remains exempt from the ICA's registration requirement, including, as relevant here, that notes may be sold or transferred only to Qualified Purchasers as defined under the ICA, and that \"no transfer of a Note ... may be made if such transfer would require registration of the Issuer or Co-Issuer under the [ICA].\" Indenture \u00a7 2.5(d). Additionally, according to the terms of the Indenture, a purchaser of Soloso securities is deemed to have represented that it is a Qualified Purchaser.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.5(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The basis for the junior noteholders' objection is its claim that certain notes issued by Soloso were resold by initial purchasers from Soloso to an entity (Bank of Morton) that was not a Qualified Purchaser.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result of this resale to a purported non-Qualified Purchaser, and in light of Soloso's reliance on the exemption for issuers that sell notes only to Qualified Purchasers, junior noteholders argued that the transfer of a note to Bank of Morton constituted an Event of Default under \u00a7 5.1(e) of the Indenture. According to junior noteholders, the Trustee could not proceed with liquidation and distribution on the basis of the Requisite Noteholders' instruction because of this alleged Event of Default.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of the dispute, the Trustee\n   requested a judicial determination of its obligations under the Indenture before proceeding with the liquidation. Plaintiff disputes the consequences that would flow from such a transfer under the ICA and the\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Indenture, as well as that notes were transferred to any non-Qualified Purchaser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In an earlier-filed action, the Intervenors brought suit against the Trustee in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, seeking injunctive relief to prevent the liquidation.\n   <em>\n    Oxford University et al. v. Wells Fargo Bank\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-cv-00145,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205138189\">\n    2015 WL 5138189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Miss. filed Aug. 24, 2015). While that case was pending, Lansuppe initiated this trust instruction action in the Southern District of New York, alleging that the court in Mississippi lacked jurisdiction over two necessary parties-Soloso and Lansuppe-and that Mississippi was therefore not a proper venue for Intervenors' ICA claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Lansuppe filed a motion for summary judgment on its complaint in the New York action, seeking a judicial construction of the Indenture to the effect that Requisite Noteholders were entitled to direct liquidation, and an order for specific performance. Intervenors filed an unopposed motion to intervene and cross-claimed for summary judgment on their ICA claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In their cross-claim, Intervenors sought a declaration that Soloso's failure to register violated ICA \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8, and entitled Intervenors to rescission pursuant to \u00a7 47(b) the ICA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court granted the motion to intervene, and granted partial summary judgment for Lansuppe, directing the Trustee to liquidate the trust estate to preserve the value of the trust and further directing the Trustee to hold the assets pending resolution of this dispute. It is undisputed that if the liquidated trust assets are distributed in accordance with the Indenture, such distribution will largely satisfy senior noteholders' claims but will be insufficient to fund any distribution to Intervenors. In subsequent orders, the district court granted summary judgment in Lansuppe's favor, denied Intervenors' cross-motion for summary judgment, and dismissed Intervenors' claim seeking rescission. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We review a district court's grant of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , \"resolv[ing] all ambiguities and draw[ing] all [reasonable] factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

We respectfully disagree with the district court's analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The proposition that the\n   <em>\n    Bellikoff\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs did not have a private right of action for damages does not support the conclusion that Intervenors here have no private right of action for rescission. The district court erred in its application of the third\n   <em>\n    Bellikoff\n   </em>\n   factor, and in so doing, overlooked clear evidence of Congressional intent to provide a right of action: the text of \u00a7 47(b) itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The text of \u00a7 47(b) unambiguously evinces Congressional intent to authorize a private action. Both subsections of \u00a7 47(b) indicate that a party to an illegal contract may seek relief in court on the basis of the illegality of the contract. Section 47(b)(1) renders contracts that violate the ICA \"unenforceable by either party\" to the violative contract, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-46(b)(1), meaning at least that a party sued for failure to perform under such a contract may invoke the illegality of the contract as a defense. Section 47(b)(2), the provision on which Intervenors rely, provides that \"a court may not deny rescission at the instance of\n   <em>\n    any party\n   </em>\n   ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3868304\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/481/110/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 80a-46(b)(2) (emphasis added). Although Congress did not expressly state that a party to an illegal contract may sue to rescind it, the clause that begins \"a court may not deny rescission at the instance of any party\" necessarily presupposes that a party may seek rescission in court by filing suit. The language Congress used is thus effectively equivalent to providing an express cause of action.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   LOUIS LOSS, FUNDAMENTALS OF SECURITIES REGULATION 919 (1988) (describing \u00a7 47(b)(2) as a provision with a \"semi-express\" cause of action).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In addition to presupposing the availability of a private right of action, \u00a7 47(b)(2) also identifies a \"class of persons,\"\n   <em>\n    Bellikoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3868304\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/481/110/\">\n    481 F.3d at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , who benefit from the availability of the right of action. The most natural reading of the clause providing for rescission, which appears in a section entitled \"Validity of Contracts\" and provides a remedy that benefits a party to an illegal contract, is that \"any party\" refers to parties\n   <em>\n    to a contract whose provisions violate the ICA\n   </em>\n   . Section 47(b)(2) thus both indicates a \"class of persons\" and comes close to expressly stating that such persons have a private right of action for rescission. We therefore find that the third\n   <em>\n    Bellikoff\n   </em>\n   factor cuts in favor of finding a private right of action for Intervenors, and that the \"determinative\" statutory intent manifested by the terms of the statute is that parties to such a contract have a cause of action to rescind the violative contract.\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/#p286\">\n    532 U.S. at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/#p286\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[S]tatutory intent ... is determinative.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Lansuppe counters that the right to seek rescission might instead be that of a governmental actor, such as the SEC, and not of a private party. Appellee Br. 18-19. This is unpersuasive for three reasons. First, the phrase \"any party\" contemplates that more than one party may seek rescission. Lansuppe's interpretation, by contrast, would limit \"any party\" to one: the SEC. We consider it highly unlikely that Congress meant to allow a suit only by the SEC when it used a phrase that so unambiguously contemplates that more than one\n   entity may seek rescission. Second, the context in which the term appears further undermines Lansuppe's interpretation. Section 47(b)(2) cannot be read in isolation from \u00a7 47(b)(1), which provides that contracts that violate the ICA are unenforceable by parties to the contract. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-46(b). The next subsection, \u00a7 47(b)(2), provides the parallel remedy-rescission rather than non-enforcement-for violative contracts that have already been performed. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-46(b)(2) (providing a remedy in the event that \"a contract described in paragraph (1) has been performed\"). It is difficult to conceive of a reason why Congress would use the term \"party\" to mean one thing in \u00a7 47(b)(1) and so different a thing in \u00a7 47(b)(2). The context of the use of \"any party\" in \u00a7 47(b) strongly supports that it means any party\n   <em>\n    to a contract that violates the ICA\n   </em>\n   . Third, the ICA elsewhere refers to the SEC repeatedly as \"the Commission\" or \"Commission,\" but never simply as a \"party,\"\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-32 ; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-42 ; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-45, which supports that \"any party\" in \u00a7 47(b)(2) was not the statute's way of designating the SEC. The clear inference of \u00a7 47(b)(2) is that it provides a party to a contract that violates the ICA (or whose performance violates the ICA) the right to seek rescission of the violative contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As discussed below, the provision of other (private or public) enforcement mechanisms (\n   <em>\n    Bellikoff\n   </em>\n   factors (i) and (ii)) merely \"suggests\" \"that Congress intended to preclude\" implied private rights of action.\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/#p286\">\n    532 U.S. at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/#p286\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Prior to the 1980 amendment, \u00a7 47(b) provided generally that contracts \"made in violation of,\" or \"the performance of which involves the violation of,\" the ICA \"shall be void. ...\" Investment Company Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20Stat.%20845\">\n    54 Stat. 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Aug. 22, 1940). The amended text, which is still in effect, distinguished between unperformed and performed contracts, consistent with\n   <em>\n    TAMA\n   </em>\n   's interpretation of Congress's intent. It makes clear in \u00a7 47(b)(1) that illegality could be raised as a defense to enforcement (\"A contract that is made, or whose performance involves, a violation of this subchapter ... is unenforceable by either party ....\"), and reinforces in \u00a7 47(b)(2) that illegality gives rise to a right to seek rescission (\"To the extent that a contract described in paragraph (1) has been performed, a court may not deny rescission at the instance of any party ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The legislative history further supports the view that, in the 1980 amendment, Congress intended to confirm the availability of a private action for rescission.

The court in\n   <em>\n    Santomenno\n   </em>\n   found that plaintiffs did not have a cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We do not find the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Santomenno\n   </em>\n   persuasive. Strangely, the Third Circuit failed to mention the strongest textual indication of Congressional intent to provide a right of action: the clear language of \u00a7 47(b)(2) that \"a court may not deny rescission\n   <em>\n    at the instance of any party\n   </em>\n   ....\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-46(b)(2) (emphasis added). Instead of focusing on the text of the statute, the Third Circuit relied on interpretive canons that are intended to help resolve ambiguity. First, the\n   <em>\n    Santomenno\n   </em>\n   court concluded, as did the district court in our case, that the provision of an express right of action in ICA \u00a7 36(b) means that Congress intended that \u00a7 36(b) provide the only private right of action.\n   <em>\n    Santomenno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3870977\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/178/\">\n    677 F.3d at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the\n   <em>\n    Santomenno\n   </em>\n   court emphasized that the provision allegedly violated, \u00a7 26(f), does not contain \"rights-creating language\" because it \"focus[es] on the [regulated] companies rather than the [plaintiff] investors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3870977\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/178/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3870977\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/178/\">\n    at 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We respectfully disagree. Section 47(b)(2) does contain rights-creating language in providing that a \"court may not deny\" a party's claim for rescission. Further, while\n   <em>\n    Santomenno\n   </em>\n   resorted to canons designed to aid in the interpretation of ambiguous statutory provisions, this statutory text, even though not explicit in declaring the right to a cause of action, unambiguously communicates Congress's intention that parties to illegal contracts have a cause of action for rescission. Moreover, although \u00a7 26(f)-like \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8-addresses regulated entities, \u00a7 47(b)(2) itself identifies a class of persons who are intended to benefit from the right to seek rescission: parties to illegal contracts.

The Indenture obligates the Trustee to protect the interests of noteholders by ensuring that the notes are performed lawfully and in accordance with the Indenture's terms, including, as relevant here, by distributing the assets of the trust as provided in the Waterfall Provision upon the occurrence of an Event of Default at the election of the Requisite Noteholders. Indenture \u00a7\u00a7 1.1, 5.2(a), 5.4(a)(iv), 11.1. Intervenors do not claim that these provisions of the Indenture violate the ICA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Intervenors argue that the sale of\n   <em>\n    unregistered\n   </em>\n   notes to non-Qualified Purchasers violated the ICA. They may well be correct, and the Intervenors, or some of them, therefore may have had valid claims to rescind the contracts of sale under which non-Qualified Purchasers acquired unregistered notes on the basis that they were contracts whose terms or performance violated the ICA. But those are not the contracts the Intervenors seek to rescind, and the resellers from whom they acquired the notes are not parties to this action. Instead, they seek by this action to block performance of the Indenture, which, as the district court found, compels the Trustee to distribute the assets of the trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Intervenors have not identified any provision of the Indenture whose performance would violate the ICA. There is no provision of the Indenture that authorized acquisition of unregistered notes by non-Qualified Purchasers. To the contrary, several of its provisions are designed to ensure that only Qualified Purchasers acquire notes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the relief sought by the Intervenors is not a rescission of the Indenture, so much as a restructuring of its terms to give junior notes a priority status equal to that of senior notes. They do not seek to terminate the rights and obligations established by the Indenture. They seek a selective change of its terms that would effectively convert different tranches of notes, with different priorities of distribution under the Waterfall Provision, into notes of the same class. Even if the Intervenors had an\n   entitlement to rescind the Indenture, that would not entitle them to rewrite its terms to alter the relative priorities of the covered classes of notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We therefore find that Intervenors have failed to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We have considered Intervenors' remaining arguments against the district court's ruling and find them to be without merit.

In this litigation, junior noteholders abandoned their claim that liquidation required approval of 100% of noteholders, and have instead sought rescission, or, in the alternative,\n    <em>\n     pro rata\n    </em>\n    distribution.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Initially, Intervenors sought to dismiss or transfer the New York action in light of the earlier-filed Mississippi action.
