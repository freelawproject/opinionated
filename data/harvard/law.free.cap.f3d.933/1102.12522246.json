The Statute defines \"electioneering communication\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (a) \"Electioneering communication\" means a paid communication that is publicly distributed by radio, television, cable, satellite, internet website, newspaper, periodical, billboard, mail, or any other distribution of printed materials, that is made within 60 days of the initiation of voting in an election, that does not support or oppose a candidate or ballot issue, that can be received by more than 100 recipients in the district voting on the candidate or ballot issue, and that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (i) refers to one or more clearly identified candidates in that election;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (ii) depicts the name, image, likeness, or voice of one or more clearly identified candidates in that election; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (iii) refers to a political party, ballot issue, or other question submitted to the voters in that election.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (b) The term does not mean:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (i) a bona fide news story, commentary, blog, or editorial distributed through the facilities of any broadcasting station, newspaper, magazine, internet website, or other periodical publication of general circulation unless the facilities are owned or controlled by a candidate or political committee;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (ii) a communication by any membership organization or corporation to its members, stockholders, or employees;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (iii) a commercial communication that depicts a candidate's name, image,\n   likeness, or voice only in the candidate's capacity as owner, operator, or employee of a business that existed prior to the candidacy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (iv) a communication that constitutes a candidate debate or forum or that solely promotes a candidate debate or forum and is made by or on behalf of the person sponsoring the debate or forum; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (v) a communication that the commissioner determines by rule is not an electioneering communication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mont.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2013-1-101\">\n    Mont.

Montana law distinguishes among several types of political committees, \u00a7 13-1-101(31)(b), two of which are relevant to this case: \"incidental\" committees and \"independent\" committees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   An \"incidental committee\" is a political committee \"not specifically organized or operating for the primary purpose of supporting or opposing candidates or ballot issues but that may incidentally become a political committee by receiving a contribution or making an expenditure.\" \u00a7 13-1-101(23)(a). A prototypical incidental committee is a business that operates continuously. If such a committee makes an expenditure of more than $250, it is considered an incidental political committee under S.B. 289, but only for the election cycle in which it makes a qualifying expenditure. An incidental committee must report to whom it is making expenditures, but it is not required to report from whom it is receiving contributions unless those contributions were solicited or earmarked for a particular candidate, ballot issue, or petition for nomination. \u00a7 13-37-232.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   An incidental committee must file periodic reports of expenditures and, if applicable, contributions during an election cycle in which it makes an expenditure, so long as it continues to accept qualifying contributions or make qualifying expenditures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   If, however, an incidental committee has terminated all qualifying contribution and expenditure activity for an election cycle, it may file a closing report at any time. \u00a7 13-37-226(9). If it does so, the committee need not file any subsequent reports. In practice, if an incidental committee makes only a single expenditure in an election cycle, it can fulfill all registration, reporting, and closing requirements in a single filing of two forms. If an incidental committee makes multiple expenditures, it is required to file reports at the intervals required by law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   An \"independent committee\" differs from an incidental committee in purpose. It is a political committee \"organized for the primary purpose of receiving contributions and making expenditures that is not controlled either directly or indirectly by a candidate and that does not coordinate with a candidate in conjunction with the making of expenditures\" except pursuant to certain provisions not relevant here. \u00a7 13-1-101(24). An independent committee is subject to more detailed disclosure and reporting requirements than an incidental committee. It must report the source and amount of its contributions, as well as the target and amount of its expenditures. \u00a7 13-37-229.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   An independent committee must make the required disclosures in the same periodic intervals as an incidental committee. \u00a7 13-37-226(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Like an incidental committee, an independent committee may file closing reports at any time. However, because its primary purpose is to advocate during elections, an independent committee often does not close after an election cycle but instead carries over from one election cycle to the next.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In 2016, NAGR filed suit against several Montana officials and agencies alleging, among other challenges, that the State's definition of \"electioneering communication,\" \u00a7 13-1-101(16), is both facially overbroad in violation of the First Amendment and unconstitutional as applied to NAGR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   NAGR's primary contention in district court was that the First Amendment, as a categorical matter, permits states to require disclosure only of express advocacy and its functional equivalent, defined as speech \"susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.\"\n   <em>\n    FEC v. Wis.

NAGR asserted that because its proposed mailers did not specifically advocate for or against a specific candidate, but just provided information about a candidate's position on Second Amendment issues, the Association could not constitutionally be required to comply with Montana's disclosure requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The district court rejected this contention. It granted summary judgment to Montana on NAGR's electioneering communication claim, holding that the \"electioneering communication\" definition was not constitutionally overbroad. The court reasoned that NAGR's argument was foreclosed by\n   <em>\n    HLW\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3794652\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/990/#p1016\">\n    624 F.3d at 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which, said the district court, \"reject[ed] [the] contention that ... disclosure requirements must be limited to speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy.\" Applying exacting scrutiny, the district court held that Montana's interests in \"increasing transparency, informing Montanans about who is behind the messages vying for their attention, and decreasing circumvention\" are important governmental interests, and that Montana's disclosure requirements are substantially related to those interests because \"they are tailored to the degree of an organization's political activity.\" In support of its determination, the court noted that NAGR would likely need only to register as an incidental committee, a minimal burden, and that the Montana law's disclosure requirements are further tailored because the requirements are limited to a communication that costs more than $250 and is made within a few months before an election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This appeal followed.

For example, the Washington disclosure laws upheld in\n   <em>\n    HLW\n   </em>\n   require organizations with \"a primary purpose of political advocacy\" to disclose the source and amount of both contributions and expenditures; organizations without such a purpose must disclose only the source and amount of expenditures.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3794652\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/990/#p1016\">\n    624 F.3d at 998-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For organizations that make electioneering communications, such as NAGR, only a communication made \"within 60 days of the initiation of voting in an election\" triggers the requirement to register as a political committee. \u00a7 13-1-101(16). Once an organization registers as a political committee, it usually must file disclosure reports at intervals preceding and shortly after an election, as well as at\n   the end of the calendar year. \u00a7 13-37-226(4), (5). Committees that receive contributions or make expenditures \"supporting or opposing a candidate ... or ballot issue\" must file more frequent reports. \u00a7 13-37-226(1)-(3). If a committee terminates qualifying contributions and expenditure activity for an election cycle, it may file a \"closing report\" at any time, relieving it of subsequent reporting obligations. \u00a7 13-37-226(9). A committee making a single expenditure in an election cycle can thus fulfill all registration, reporting, and closing requirements in one filing of two forms. Montana's reporting requirements are therefore carefully tailored to pertinent circumstances, distinguishing them from one-size-fits-all disclosure regimes that other circuits have invalidated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swanson\n   </em>\n   , 692 F.3d at 873-74 ;\n   <em>\n    Tooker\n   </em>\n   , 717 F.3d at 596-98.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , disclosure laws specifying a monetary threshold at which contributions or expenditures trigger reporting requirements ensure that the government does not burden minimal political advocacy.

No similar limitation on the audience reached is here at issue: Montana requires only that a\n   <em>\n    single\n   </em>\n   individual be a registered Montana voter-a political committee's treasurer. So long as an organization can find one such treasurer, the size of the audience it can reach will not be limited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   So, given the limited burden on a political committee's speech imposed by Montana's registered-voter requirement, we apply exacting rather than strict scrutiny to determine its validity. But we conclude anyway that the registered voter requirement does not significantly forward the interests it is said to advance and so violates the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Addressing the connection between the registered-voter requirement and the goals of its disclosure scheme, Montana asserts that the registered voter requirement is \"shorthand\" for the prerequisites that being a registered Montana voter entails-being at least 18, of sound mind, a Montana resident, and not an incarcerated felon. Such types of prerequisites can be substantially related to Montana's important interest in identifying representatives of political committees who can be held accountable for violations of electioneering laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, the State has a strong interest in assuring that it can subpoena treasurers of political committees, and only individuals within the state can be subpoenaed.

Montana could have made appropriate prerequisites for registration the conditions for serving as treasurer without requiring registration itself. Montana identifies no interest served by excluding potential treasurers who are not registered voters but could be if they chose. We cannot identify any such interest either. And none of the disclosure regimes we have upheld have included such a registration requirement.\n   <em>\n    Yamada\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4192008\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/1182/\">\n    786 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1195 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Haw.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2011-324\">\n    Haw.
