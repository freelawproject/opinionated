If they live in the same area as their favorite team-such as Los Angeles Rams fans who live in Los Angeles-they can tune into their local Fox or CBS station to enjoy their team's game on free, over-the-air television. But if NFL fans happen to live far away from their favorite team-such as Seattle Seahawks fans residing in Los Angeles-they can watch every Seahawks game only if they purchase DirecTV's NFL Sunday Ticket, a bundled package of all NFL games available exclusively to subscribers of DirecTV's satellite television service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The plaintiffs, a putative class of Sunday Ticket subscribers, claim that this arrangement harms NFL fans because it eliminates competition in the market for live telecasts of NFL games. Without this arrangement restricting the televising of NFL games, plaintiffs argue, the individual teams would create multiple telecasts of\n   each game and would compete against one another by distributing telecasts of their games through various cable, satellite, and internet channels. We conclude that at this preliminary stage, plaintiffs have stated a cause of action for a violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act that survives a motion to dismiss. We therefore reverse the district court's decision to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   To analyze the challenged arrangement between the NFL teams, the NFL, and DirecTV, it is necessary to understand the history of television broadcasting of NFL games.

The consequence of this agreement is that an individual team cannot enter into individual agreements with networks, satellite TV providers, or internet streaming services. Instead, only the NFL can enter into an agreement to sell those rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Acting on behalf of its teams, the NFL entered into two additional agreements licensing the teams' telecast rights: (1) \"the NFL-Network Agreement,\" which governs \"local games,\" and (2) \"the NFL-DirecTV Agreement,\" which governs \"out-of-market games.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Under the NFL-Network Agreement, CBS and Fox coordinate to create a single telecast for every Sunday-afternoon NFL game. Pursuant to that agreement, NFL owns the copyright in the telecasts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , U.S. Copyright Office,\n   <em>\n    NFL 2016 Season: Cowboys @ Packers, Week #6\n   </em>\n   , Reg. No. PA0002069024 (Jan. 4, 2017) (noting that copyright was held by the NFL pursuant to transfer \"[b]y contract\"). The NFL, in turn, permits CBS and Fox to broadcast a limited number of games through free, over-the-air television. These are the so-called local games.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under the NFL-DirecTV Agreement, the NFL allows DirecTV to obtain all of the live telecasts produced by CBS and Fox, package those telecasts, and deliver the bundled feeds to NFL Sunday Ticket subscribers. Thus, Sunday Ticket subscribers have access to both local and out-of-market games.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As a result of these agreements, fans who do not subscribe to Sunday Ticket have access to, at most, two to three local games each Sunday afternoon, in any given geographic area. This means, for example, that Los Angeles fans would be able to use over-the-air cable to watch the Rams play the Chargers at 1:00PM E.T. on Fox, the Vikings play the Patriots at 1:00PM E.T. on CBS, and the Dolphins play the Cowboys at 4:00PM E.T. on CBS. But there is no option for NFL fans to watch any of the other 7 to 10 games played each Sunday afternoon which are not available on free, over-the-air television.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Fans who want to watch other out-of-market games cannot purchase games individually or by team, but are required to buy the entire package of NFL games. Additionally, in order to subscribe to the Sunday Ticket, consumers must also purchase a basic television package from DirecTV. In 2015, the cost of a basic Sunday Ticket package was $251.94 annually for residential subscribers. For commercial subscribers, the price varied depending on the capacity of the establishment, ranging from $2,314 to $120,000 per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Four plaintiffs (Ninth Inning, Inc., 1465 Third Avenue Restaurant Corp., Robert Gary Lippincott, Jr., and Michael Holinko) filed a consolidated complaint against the National Football League, NFL Enterprises LLC, all 32 individual NFL teams, DirecTV Holdings LLC, and DirecTV, LLC, on behalf of a putative class of residential and commercial NFL Sunday Ticket subscribers. (Our reference to \"plaintiffs\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   refers to the plaintiffs collectively. We will refer to the defendants collectively, or as the NFL, the NFL teams, and DirecTV, as appropriate.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The plaintiffs' consolidated complaint alleges that the defendants' interlocking agreements work together to suppress competition for the sale of professional football game telecasts in violation of Section 1 and Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Specifically, the complaint alleges that absent the anti-competitive Teams-NFL and NFL-DirecTV Agreements, the telecasts broadcast solely on Sunday Ticket would be available through other distributors. Additionally, each NFL team could make its own arrangements for telecasts of its games, and could contract with competing distribution channels or media, including other cable, satellite or internet carriers or competing networks. As a result of competition, the complaint alleges, a greater number of telecasts of NFL games would be created, and those telecasts would be more accessible to more viewers at lower prices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The district court dismissed the consolidated complaint for failure to state a claim under either Section 1 or Section 2 of the Sherman Act. \"We review a district court's grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Bain v.

The complaint here alleges that the interlocking agreements in this case impose analogous limitations: plaintiffs assert that the Teams-NFL and NFL-DirecTV Agreements limit the \"amount of televised [professional] football\" that one team may televise because they restrict the number of telecasts made to a single telecast for each game.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Second, the Supreme Court noted that the agreements in\n   <em>\n    NCAA\n   </em>\n   provided that \"[n]o member [college] is permitted to make any sale of television rights except in accordance with the basic plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337229\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/85/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In our case, plaintiffs allege that the NFL teams are similarly restricted.

We conclude that for purposes of determining whether plaintiffs have stated an injury to competition, the plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the output in this case is the number of telecasts of games, and that the defendants' interlocking agreements reduce that output.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   4\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Finally, defendants claim that the complaint fails to allege injury to competition because it has not alleged a properly defined market in which defendants have market power. Defendants argue that the complaint failed to plausibly allege that they have market power in either the market for live video presentations of regular season NFL games or the submarket for out-of-market game broadcasts. We reject these arguments. Given that professional football games have no substitutes (as fans do not consider NFL games to be comparable to other sports or forms of entertainment),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    L.A.

The complaint therefore plausibly alleges a naked restraint on output: that the defendants' interlocking agreements have the effect of limiting output to one telecast of each game, which is then broadcast in a limited manner, solely according to the NFL's agreements with CBS, Fox, and DirecTV.

In such cases, courts must determine how much of the consumer price stems from ordinary market forces, and how much of it stems from the distributor's efforts to recoup its overpayment to the manufacturer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Illinois Brick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1590\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/720/#p746\">\n    431 U.S. at 744-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1590\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/720/#p746\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Thus, unlike with a price-fixing conspiracy, the reviewing court must still make the exact determination \"sought to be avoided in\n   <em>\n    Illinois Brick\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Shamrock Foods Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1938924\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/729/1208/\">\n    729 F.2d at 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Finally, in\n   <em>\n    In re ATM Fee Antitrust Litigation\n   </em>\n   , we ruled that the co-conspirator exception \"only applies when the co-conspirators\n   <em>\n    fix the price paid by the plaintiff\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050772\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/686/741/#p750\">\n    686 F.3d at 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Instead, that case stands only for the uncontested proposition that a conspiracy to price fix and a conspiracy to restrict output both injure consumers by arbitrarily raising the price they pay for a product-i.e., both types of conspiracy have the same anticompetitive effects.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133724\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/756/#p770\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133724\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/756/#p770\">\n     at 777\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That says nothing about whether a particular consumer's injury is direct or indirect, or which consumers are authorized to seek judicial redress (i.e., which consumers do not rely on a pass-on theory of injury). Indeed, in\n    <em>\n     Illinois Brick\n    </em>\n    itself, the Court acknowledged that the indirect purchasers were injured by the manufacturer overcharging the distributor, but held that those purchasers were not the proper parties to sue to recover damages.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1590\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/720/#p746\">\n     431 U.S. at 744-46\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1590\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/720/#p746\">\n     97 S.Ct. 2061\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    The Majority's reliance on\n    <em>\n     Apple Inc. v. Pepper\n    </em>\n    , is likewise misplaced, as the plaintiffs in that case purchased the relevant good directly from the monopolizing entity-not from a middleman who conspired with the monopolizing entity down the line. --- U.S. ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12619260\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/1514/#p1520\">\n     139 S.

Here, Plaintiffs purchased a service from DirecTV, which is not a party to the NFL's horizontal agreement. While the Majority is correct that \"we are required to take a holistic look at how the interlocking agreements actually impact competition,\" Maj. Op. at 1152, determining whether a party has alleged anti-competitive effects is distinct from determining whether the party is a direct or indirect purchaser with respect to a specific agreement-and none of the cases cited by the majority say otherwise, or even address that issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    Relying exclusively on the fact that Plaintiffs \"allege that DirecTV is part of the conspiracy,\" the Majority conclusively states that \"a court would not need to determine to what extent the NFL overcharged DirecTV,\" because \"it would need to consider only the prices consumers paid compared to the prices that would have existed in a competitive market.\" Maj. Op. at 1157 n. 7. However, it is unclear how in practice a court\n    <em>\n     could\n    </em>\n    consider what the theoretical consumer price would have been in a competitive market (absent the NFL's horizontal agreement) without considering whether and how much of an overpayment DirecTV made.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
