We disagree and so will affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The operative facts are not in dispute. Bergamatto began working for the Port of New York and New Jersey as a longshoreman in 2000. He last worked there in April\n   2010. In April 2013, he applied for retirement benefits under his pension plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   That plan is the New York Shipping Association-International Longshoremen's Association Pension Trust Fund and Plan, a plan covered by ERISA. The 2010 version of the plan said that \"[t]he provisions ... in effect during the Participant's last year of credited service shall be applied to determine the Participant's right to benefits and the amount thereof.\" (Supp. App. at 5.) The 2010 plan also originally precluded longshoremen hired between October 1996 and September 2004 from accruing benefits for work performed before October 2004.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It did so by excluding from the definition of \"Participant\" \"any employee who was not a Participant prior to October 1, 1996\" and stating that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [n]otwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Plan, any person who was first hired for employment in the longshore industry on or after October 1, 1996, and who was not a Participant as of September 30, 2004, shall be eligible to participate as a Participant in the Plan effective October 1, 2004, but shall not be entitled to accrue credited service for pension benefit accrual purposes under the Plan for any hours of employment earned prior to October 1, 2004.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Supp. App. at 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2013, however, an amendment was made to the 2010 plan. That amendment provided that, \"[e]ffective October 1, 2012, Participants hired on or after October 1, 1996 shall receive pension benefit accruals for years of credited service earned from 1996 through 2004[.]\" (D. Ct. D.I. 31-3, at *173.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The 2010 plan contained several administrative provisions. Among other things, it said that \"[t]he Fund shall be administered by a Board of Trustees\" (Supp. App. at 65) and that the Board had to \"make available to the Fund's Participants and beneficiaries such reports and other documents as are required by ERISA\" (Supp. App. at 68). It further provided that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [t]he Board of Trustees shall have sole and absolute discretionary authority (1) to determine eligibility for benefits, (2) to interpret and construe the terms and provisions of the Trust and Plan, and (3) to make factual findings in connection with applications for benefits and to make other determinations involving application of the provisions of the Trust and Plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Supp. App. at 73.) Finally, it said that the Board \"delegates to the Executive Pension Director ... the power and authority to process and approve all non-disputed applications for pension benefits and to commence timely payments of such benefits\" but that \"[a]ll actions taken and decisions made pursuant to [that delegation] are subject to ratification by the Board of Trustees.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Supp. App. at 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In January 2015, an updated version of the plan was produced. Like the 2010 plan, the 2015 plan contained a \"last year of credited service\" clause, saying that \"[t]he\n   provisions of the Plan in effect during the Participant's last Year of Credited Service shall be applied to determine the Participant's right to benefit and the amount thereof.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (App. at 70.) The 2015 plan also expressly incorporated the 2013 amendment to the 2010 plan, providing that, \"[e]ffective October 1, 2012, Participants hired on or after October 1, 1996 shall receive pension benefit accruals for Years of Credited Service earned from 1996 through 2004.\" (App. at 58.) Relatedly, it eliminated the language preventing employees hired between October 1996 and September 2004 from accruing benefits for work prior to October 2004. The 2015 plan also contained the same administrative provisions from the 2010 plan that have just been noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In June 2013, Bergamatto's application for pension benefits was approved by Charles Ward, Executive Director of the Fund, but based on only the years of credited service starting in October 2004. Ward reasoned that the 2010 plan required that benefit determinations be made based on the plan provisions in force during the participant's last year of credited service, that Bergamatto's last year of credited service was 2010, and that the 2010 plan terms prevented longshoremen hired between October 1996 and September 2004 - like Bergamatto - from receiving benefit accruals for work performed before October 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Bergamatto responded to Ward's decision by requesting that, in light of the 2013 amendment to the 2010 plan, his pension benefits incorporate his years of service before October 2004. A series of communications between Ward and Bergamatto ensued, which ultimately led to Bergamatto accusing Ward of failing to respond to him as required by ERISA. Specifically, Bergamatto maintained that Ward had not adequately addressed his request for the pre-October 2004 benefit accruals and for the relevant plan provisions or summary plan description.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Bergamatto ultimately filed an appeal with the pension fund's Board of Trustees, which denied the appeal after a hearing. Its decision was based on the following reasoning: the 2015 plan \"provides that the provisions of the Plan in effect during the Participant's last year of credited service shall be applied to determine the Participant's right to a benefit and the amount thereof\"; Bergamatto's last year of credited service was 2010; the 2010 plan likewise \"provides, with various exceptions that apply only to the amount of benefits, that the provisions of the Plan in effect during the Participant's last year of credited service shall be applied to determine the Participant's right to benefits and the amount thereof\"; and the 2010 plan further \"provides that ... any person who was hired ... on or after October 1, 1996, and who was not a Participant as of September 30, 2004, shall be eligible to participate as a Participant in the Plan effective October 1, 2004, but shall\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be entitled to accrue credited service for pension benefit accrual purposes under the Plan for any hour of employment earned prior to October 1, 2004[.]' \" (D. Ct. D.I. 31-3, at *206-07.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Board's decision was communicated to Bergamatto, and he then filed this action under ERISA, naming the Board of Trustees and Ward as defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He claimed first that the denial of his claim for pre-October 2004 benefit accruals was erroneous, as it was based on a misinterpretation\n   of the plan provisions and, second, that Ward's failure to adequately respond during the parties' correspondence amounted to a violation of the statutory responsibility of the plan administrator to respond to a plan participant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants ultimately moved for summary judgment, which the District Court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As to Bergamatto's first claim, the Court concluded that, under the applicable \"arbitrary-and-capricious standard\" of review, the Board of Trustees' interpretation of the 2015 and 2010 plans was \"reasonably consistent\" with the plans' unambiguous language, which \"makes clear that Bergamatto was not eligible for benefit accruals\" for the years that he worked before October 2004. (App. at 15-16 (citation omitted).) Mirroring the Board's reasoning, the Court said that, under the 2015 plan, the terms in place during a participant's last year of credited service are controlling for purposes of benefit determinations; that Bergamatto's last year of credited service was 2010; and that, therefore, the 2010 plan governs Bergamatto's claim. It then concluded that the 2010 plan also requires that the provisions in effect during a participant's last year of credited service control. The Court said that the 2010 provisions preclude workers like Bergamatto from earning benefit accruals for years of service before October 2004, and that the 2013 amendment allowing such accruals was not in effect in 2010. It rejected Bergamatto's assertion that the \"last year of credited service\" clause does not apply, saying instead that \"the Clause does clearly apply to such accruals.\" (App. at 17.) The Court also disagreed with Bergamatto's contention that\n   <em>\n    Moench v. Robertson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416019\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/62/553/\">\n    62 F.3d 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 1995),\n   <em>\n    abrogated on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fifth Third Bancorp v. Dudenhoeffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20U.S.%20409\">\n    573 U.S. 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 417-19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581663\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2459/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581663\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2459/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), dictated a result in his favor. According to the Court, Bergamatto's\n   <em>\n    Moench\n   </em>\n   argument failed because the Board's interpretation was consistent with the goals of the plan, did not render any language in the plan meaningless or internally inconsistent, did not conflict with ERISA, was not inconsistent with other Board interpretations, and was consistent with the clear language of the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As to Bergamatto's second claim - that Ward breached an obligation to respond to Bergamatto's requests for information - the District Court observed that the claim was misdirected since the plan identifies the Board of Trustees, not Ward, as the administrator. The Court rejected Bergamatto's argument \"that Ward is the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   plan administrator[,]\" reasoning that \"the plain and unambiguous text of ERISA, as well as the weight of existing case law,\" foreclosed that argument. (App. at 20-21.) It noted that, although \"[t]he Third Circuit has not yet ruled on\" \"whether a party can be held liable under [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) ] under a de facto plan administrator theory[,]\" numerous other circuit courts and the District of New Jersey have rejected that theory. (App. at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court also rebuffed two alternative arguments advanced by Bergamatto: that equitable estoppel should apply because \"Ward 'never disavowed the title of Plan Administrator and never advised Bergamatto's counsel to redirect his request to the Board' \"; and that Ward was a co-administrator because \"a Notice [from the plan] advis[ed] participants to contact the Board or Ward if they ha[d] additional questions[.]\" (App. at 21 (citation omitted).) As to the first argument, the District Court said that Bergamatto could not satisfy the requirements of equitable estoppel\n   because he had provided no evidence \"that he detrimentally relied on Ward's alleged misrepresentations.\" (App. at 22.) As to the second, it determined that the Notice \"is not sufficient to support a finding that Ward was a co-administrator\" because it \"identifies Ward as Executive Director, not co-administrator, and merely states that he can answer relevant questions.\" (App. at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Bergamatto timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On appeal, Bergamatto presses two claims: (1) that he is entitled to benefit accruals for the years he worked before October 2004; and (2) that Ward should be viewed as a de facto administrator of the pension plan and thus subject to liability for failing to timely respond to Bergamatto's correspondence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bergamatto contends that the District Court erred in resolving those claims against him and should have granted summary judgment in his favor under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree and, consequently, will affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Bergamtto's Ineligibility for Benefit Accruals for Pre-October 2004 Service\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   With respect to his first claim, Bergamatto says that the Board of Trustees' decision was arbitrary and capricious in that it erroneously relied on the \"last year of credited service\" clause of the 2015 plan to deny his request for benefit accruals for pre-October 2004 work. In Bergamatto's view, that clause is inapplicable because it \"appears to apply to the entitlement to and calculation of the pension benefit but is silent as to benefit accruals and appears to be a rule of general application.\" (Opening Br. at 15.) He says that the amendment granting benefit accruals for pre-October 2004 service for workers such as him, as incorporated into the 2015 plan, should govern \"because it directly addresses accruals.\" (Opening Br. at 15.) He maintains that he is covered by the amendment because he was a participant in the plan after the amendment's effective date of October 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Bergamatto's first claim arises under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B), which permits \"a participant in an ERISA benefit plan [who has been] denied benefits\" to bring suit \"to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Howley v.

The 2015 plan states expressly that \"[t]he provisions of the Plan in effect during the Participant's last Year of Credited Service shall be applied to determine the Participant's right to benefit and the amount thereof.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (App. at 70.) The original 2010 plan contains the same \"last year of credited service\" clause and directly forbids workers hired between October 1996 and September 2004 from earning benefit accruals for pre-October 2004 work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, the effective date of the 2013\n   amendment that changed that restriction and authorized such benefit accruals was October 1, 2012, well after Bergamatto's last year of credited service in 2010. The language of the un-amended 2010 plan is thus controlling. Given that Bergamatto was hired in 2000, he is subject to the benefit accrual exclusion for pre-October 2004 work. We cannot see how the 2015 and 2010 plans could be read in any other way. The Board's decision tracks that reading and is thus \"reasonably consistent\" - in fact, totally consistent - with the unambiguous language of the plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Bergamatto's suggestion that the \"last year of credited service\" clause does not encompass benefit accruals is unpersuasive. That clause, under both the 2015 and 2010 plans, is framed expansively, covering any term used to determine a participant's right to benefits and the amount thereof. The clause, on its face, encompasses anything that could affect the benefits a worker receives, and it is hard to imagine how the accrual of benefits could fall outside its reach. Indeed, under both the 2015 and 2010 plans, \"Accrued Benefit\" is defined as the monthly pension benefit - i.e., the amount of benefit - that a participant in the plan would be entitled to receive if certain conditions were met. (App. at 48; Supp. App. at 14.) And Bergamatto necessarily concedes that benefit accruals affect the amount of a pension, given that he has consistently sought benefit accruals for additional years in order to increase his pension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In light of all that, Bergamatto's remaining arguments are unavailing. His assertion that the amendment should govern since it directly addresses benefit accruals fails because, if the \"last year of credited service\" clause applies to benefit accruals (and it does), the 2010 provisions relating to benefit accruals must control. No one disputes that Bergamatto's last year of credited service was 2010. And, again, because that was his last credited year, the 2010 provisions govern. Bergamatto's argument that he was a participant in 2012 - when the amendment authorizing the benefit accruals Bergamatto seeks became effective - is thus irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In sum, the plan language is unambiguous; the Board's interpretation aligns with that language; and Bergamatto's first claim fails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The \"De Facto\" Plan Administrator Theory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As to Bergamatto's second claim, he cites\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and says that \"a plan administrator who fails or refuses to comply with a request for information which the administrator is required by law to provide to a participant or beneficiary within 30 days is subject to a penalty of $100.00 per day.\" (Opening Br. at 17.) He then asserts that Ward failed to respond to his request for \"a copy of the pertinent\n   plan provisions or a summary plan description\" within that 30-day period. (Opening Br. at 17.) Bergamatto maintains that Ward should thus be penalized because, even though he has the title of Executive Director of the plan, he is a de facto plan administrator. According to Bergamatto, \"Ward appeared to function in all respects as a plan administrator\" - for example, answering participants and beneficiaries' questions, supplying them with information they requested, and providing summary plan descriptions - and that, \"more importantly, he never disavowed the title.\" (Opening Br. at 18.)
