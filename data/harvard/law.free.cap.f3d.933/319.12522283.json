One day, a link appeared on a secretive online message board. Accompanying the link was a message describing its contents unmistakably as child pornography, as well as numerous thumbnail images depicting sexual molestation of a female toddler. And if you clicked the link, it took you, as promised, to multiple videos of child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On that same day, an IP address associated with Nikolai Bosyk's house accessed the link. Based on these facts, the government obtained a warrant to search Bosyk's home for evidence of child pornography. The primary question before us is whether that warrant was supported by probable cause. Concluding that it was, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In September 2015, a Department of Homeland Security cybercrimes unit began investigating an online message board known as \"Bulletin Board A.\" This board was \"dedicated to the advertisement, distribution and production of child pornography,\" and had more than 1,500 \"approved users.\" J.A. 163-64. The site contained several forums and subforums in which members\n   could post and view various genres of child pornography.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   One such posting occurred on November 2, 2015. That day, an unidentified member of Bulletin Board A posted a message in the board's \"Pre-teen Hardcore\" section describing in graphic terms the contents of four videos. J.A. 164. Below the message were three sets of 20 video thumbnail images depicting \"juvenile females engaged in sexual acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And below those images was a URL link-an apparently random string of numbers and letters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The post also contained a password \"which users could input to access and open the content of the file associated with that unique URL.\" J.A. 165. Using this password, federal investigators downloaded and viewed an encrypted file, which showed a man molesting a young girl, apparently a toddler. Three other videos associated with the link also contained child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This link and its contents were hosted by a separate filesharing site (referred to as \"the File Sharing Site\"). This site allows users to upload and share various media, and hosts plenty of lawful content. But the government also knew that Bulletin Board A's members used the File Sharing Site (and similar services) to share sexually explicit content with one another. So, in December 2015, investigators subpoenaed the File Sharing Site for business records related to web pages containing illicit material. In response, the company produced records showing that on November 2, 2015, at 3:23 p.m., an IP address \"was used to download or attempt to download file content associated with\" the URL containing the four videos. J.A. 167-68. In other words, the records showed that on the same day that the post and link appeared on Bulletin Board A, someone using this IP address clicked that same link.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   By subpoenaing a broadband provider, investigators connected the IP address to Bosyk's home in Purcellville, Virginia. In April 2016, the government applied for a warrant to search Bosyk's house. It supported the application with an affidavit sworn by DHS Special Agent Kristina Eyler, which recounted the facts above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Eyler's affidavit also described several \"characteristics of individuals who possess or access with intent to view child pornography.\" J.A. 168. Such people, she said, may collect explicit materials and use them for arousal or to groom victims. They often store these materials electronically \"for several years,\" and frequently keep them nearby for ease of viewing. J.A. 169. Some individuals have been known to download, view, then delete child pornography from their electronic devices on a cyclical basis. But \"evidence of such activity, including deleted child pornography, often can be located on these individuals' computers and digital devices through the use of forensic tools.\" J.A. 169.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on this information, Agent Eyler submitted that there was probable cause to suspect violations of federal laws against distributing, receiving, possessing, and accessing with intent to view child pornography,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2252A, and that evidence of those suspected crimes would be found at Bosyk's address. A magistrate judge agreed, issuing a warrant that allowed the search of Bosyk's residence and the seizure of computers, digital devices, storage media, and related evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Investigators executed the warrant four days later (on April 12, 2016) and recovered devices containing thousands of images and videos of child pornography, including the particular video described in the search warrant affidavit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Agents also found evidence that Bosyk had used an anonymous web browser to access dark-web child pornography websites, including Bulletin Board A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Bosyk was later indicted on child pornography charges. He moved to suppress the evidence obtained under the warrant and sought a hearing under\n   <em>\n    Franks v. Delaware\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    438 U.S. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    57 L.Ed.2d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978), to show that Eyler had misled the magistrate judge. The district court denied the motion, holding that the warrant was supported by probable cause and that, in any event, suppression would be unwarranted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bosyk later pleaded guilty to one count of receiving child pornography and was sentenced to five years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Having reserved the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress, Bosyk asks us to reverse that ruling and vacate his conviction. He raises three arguments. First, he argues that the search of his home violated the Fourth Amendment as it wasn't supported by probable cause. Second, he contends that even if the government had cause to search his home in November 2015 (when the post appeared on Bulletin Board A and the link was accessed), it didn't in April 2016 when it actually obtained and executed the warrant. Finally, Bosyk argues that suppression is warranted under\n   <em>\n    United States v. Leon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    468 U.S. 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    82 L.Ed.2d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), because Eyler's affidavit was misleading and lacked any indicia of probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When considering a district court's denial of a suppression motion, we review its legal conclusions de novo, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In doing so, we consider only the facts presented in the warrant application.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lyles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519474\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/910/787/#p791\">\n    910 F.3d 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 791 (4th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Bosyk and his amicus (the Electronic Frontier Foundation, or \"EFF\") argue that the facts recounted in Agent Eyler's affidavit didn't give the government probable cause to search Bosyk's house for evidence of child pornography. They argue that the government obtained its warrant based on a \"single click\" of a URL, which, they say, cannot support a search of somebody's home. We disagree. The facts in the affidavit support a reasonable inference that someone using Bosyk's IP address clicked the link knowing that it contained child pornography. This in turn makes it fairly probable that criminal evidence would have been found at Bosyk's address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The \"critical fact\" in this case, as the district court observed, is the timing. J.A. 76. On the very day that someone clicked the link, it appeared on a website whose purpose was to advertise and distribute child pornography to its limited membership. And it appeared in a post containing text and images that unequivocally identified its contents as child pornography. The close timing between the link's appearance on Bulletin Board A and the click by a user's IP address is highly relevant: because the link was accessed on the same day it appeared on Bulletin Board A, it is at least reasonably probable that the user clicked the link having encountered it on that website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   With this fair assumption, several inferences drop into place to support the magistrate judge's decision to issue the warrant. If one assumes, given the close timing, that the user accessed the link after seeing it on Bulletin Board A, it's fair to conclude that the user also knew it contained child pornography, as that much was explicit from the posting. On top of that, one can fairly conclude that the same person typed the password posted on Bulletin Board A, downloaded the content, and viewed the video contained at that URL. For why else would someone who had seen the pornographic stills and read the description on Bulletin Board A click the link if not to access its contents? Thus, if we suppose that someone accessed the link through Bulletin Board A, it's fairly probable that the same person downloaded or viewed child-pornographic images.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Recall that the magistrate judge knew someone using Bosyk's home IP address had clicked the link. Given that fact-and the permissible inferences described above-we think it was fairly probable\n   that child pornography would be found on computers or other devices within Bosyk's property. And because child pornography constitutes contraband or evidence of a crime, this is all that was needed for probable cause to search Bosyk's house.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4), 2252A(a)(5) (crime to knowingly possess or access with intent to view any video depicting child pornography);\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The affidavit doesn't specify what time on November 2, 2015, the post appeared on Bulletin Board A, meaning that the link (which was accessed at 3:23 p.m. that day) could have been clicked before its posting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This ambiguity, however, is not as fatal to probable cause as our dissenting colleague suggests. As his own analysis shows, it was almost twice as likely that the post preceded the click as the other way around.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dissenting Op. at 342 (Figure A) (showing more than 64% probability that link was clicked after being posted on Bulletin Board A). Thus, the much likelier scenario based on the attested facts was that the link was posted and then accessed hours later (perhaps even sooner) by Bosyk's IP address. That chronology sets in motion the series of plausible inferences described above.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In short, although the search relied on a \"single click\" of an internet link, the click was to a video of child pornography in circumstances suggesting the person behind that click plausibly knew about and sought out that content. We think the magistrate judge therefore had a substantial basis for concluding that searching Bosyk's address would uncover evidence of wrongdoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Arguing otherwise, Bosyk and EFF train their sights on the first inference in\n   this chain of reasoning: that the user at Bosyk's IP address quite probably knew the link contained child pornography. They note that Eyler's affidavit didn't say whether the link existed elsewhere on the internet, or whether the site linked at the URL contained content other than the illegal videos described in the affidavit. And they also point out that the URL didn't indicate what it linked to and that, in general, the act of clicking a URL doesn't prove familiarity with its contents. We do not find these alleged shortcomings fatal to probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Bosyk's main critique is that the affidavit doesn't establish whether the user who clicked on the link accessed it through Bulletin Board A. He and EFF point out that the affidavit doesn't exclude the possibility that the user might have stumbled upon the link from another, perhaps innocent, source-especially given how easily and frequently links are shared over the internet. This is also the essence of our dissenting colleague's position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dissenting Op. at 342-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The problem with this argument, however, is that it demands more proof than is required to obtain a warrant. Probable cause, as the Supreme Court has reiterated time and again, \"does not require officers to rule out a suspect's innocent explanation for suspicious facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Wesby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12615996\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/577/#p586\">\n    138 S. Ct. at 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the government needs to demonstrate only a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found at the place to be searched. To be sure, innocent reasons may explain why someone accessed a file sharing page containing child pornography. Perhaps (as our friend in dissent posits) someone received the link from a malicious sender, or was looking for innocuous material hosted at the same filesharing webpage, or truly stumbled upon the URL accidentally. But this is all conjecture-no facts in the affidavit suggested the link existed anywhere on the internet but Bulletin Board A. And the possibility that it did doesn't defeat probable cause when it's fairly probable, given the temporal proximity, that the person clicked on the link because he saw it on Bulletin Board A and wanted to view child pornography.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Indeed, given the nature of the content, we think the magistrate judge had reason to be skeptical about possible innocent explanations. The notion advanced by EFF and accepted by our dissenting colleague that a link containing child pornography would spread throughout the internet like more benign web content seems implausible in light of the present record and the law's experience with online pedophiles. As Eyler's affidavit explained, people who possess and view child pornography often take steps to conceal their contraband material, guard it closely, and sometimes delete it to avoid detection. Cases likewise show that consumers of child pornography frequently employ complex measures to keep their online activities secret.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. McGarity\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722795\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/1218/#p1230\">\n    669 F.3d 1218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1230-31 (11th Cir. 2012) (child pornography ring used elaborate system of encryption, codenames, and hidden instructions to conceal activities from outsiders),\n   <em>\n    abrogated on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paroline v.

Thus, the likelihood that a specific filesharing page\n   containing child pornography would find its way to somebody uninterested in such contraband-thereby exposing its distributors to detection, capture, and loss of their materials-is probably quite low.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This point bears emphasis. Our dissenting colleague is of course right that Bosyk's IP address could have connected with a link containing child pornography in a variety (though probably not \"millions,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dissenting Op. at 342-43) of different ways. But, contrary to our friend's suggestion, these many possible alternative paths aren't of equal\n   <em>\n    probability\n   </em>\n   ; rather, the likelier avenues incriminate Bosyk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In the first place, the facts involve material that, for reasons just explained, is unlikely to travel widely outside child pornography circles. On top of that, there is a suspiciously short interval between such material appearing on a members-only child pornography forum and being accessed by a user at Bosyk's IP address. Given these facts, we believe a magistrate judge could reasonably think it fairly likely-if not most likely-that the user found the link through Bulletin Board A or otherwise received it knowingly from a member of that site.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 169 (explaining that people who possess and view child pornography may \"share information and materials\" with one another). Contrary to our colleague's suggestion, this belief is not \"wholly unsupported speculation,\" Dissenting Op. at 363; rather, it is based on the contents of the affidavit, the magistrate judge's likely familiarity with online child pornography crimes, and his ability to reach \"common-sense conclusions about human behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p238\">\n    462 U.S. at 231-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187462\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/213/#p238\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

They focus, for instance, on the fact that the URL looked like a random string of numbers and letters and therefore betrayed little about its contents. Certainly, the government could have established probable cause more easily had the link been clearer about its illicit content. But here, the URL appeared in a post that described and depicted its contents on the same day that somebody clicked it. This context provides evidence about the probable knowledge and intent of the user that is otherwise lacking from the face of the URL.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   EFF and our dissenting colleague's broader arguments against the inferential value of URLs merit the same response. They point out that because URLs are often randomly generated, shortened, or masked, they don't necessarily reveal their contents to the person accessing them. Thus, EFF says, that an IP address accessed a URL associated with contraband doesn't necessarily provide cause to search property and devices related to that address. That may often be true, and in a case based purely on an IP address connecting with a URL, probable cause may be hard to establish absent other incriminating evidence. But that is not the case before us because such evidence exists here: whoever clicked did so on the same day that the link was advertised in a closed forum dedicated to child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, we are unswayed by the cases Bosyk and EFF rely on.

Still, to the extent our sister circuits have at times emphasized \"additional facts ... over and above the single click of a URL that provides for download of child pornography,\" Dissenting Op. at 357, we are all in tune.

But we see little indication that the district court misunderstood the facts. Rather, we think the court's oral ruling as transcribed can be read to reflect a proper understanding both of the chronology of events and of the relationship between Bulletin Board A and the File Sharing Site. Regarding the timing, the court said that the URL was clicked \"the same day\" that the posting appeared on Bulletin Board A, J.A. 76, which is perfectly consistent with the affidavit. As for the distinction between the two websites, the court noted that on the day in question, \"the IP address that is linked to a computer in the defendant's home ... attempts to or at least shows an interest in that particular site.\" J.A. 76-77. It's admittedly unclear whether \"that particular site\" refers (incorrectly) to Bulletin Board A or (correctly) to the File Sharing Site. But the preceding sentence includes references to both the \"posting\" and \"the URL that is linked,\" so both readings are possible. J.A. 76.

Contrary to our dissenting colleague's suggestion, however, there's nothing wrong with finding probable cause based on compound probability-provided, of course, that the probabilities taken together establish a fair likelihood of criminal conduct. But more fundamentally, we reject the dissent's apparent premise-that probable cause is subject to rigid statistical analysis.

Indeed, rather than confronting the difficult technological questions courts must address in assessing warrant applications premised on online conduct, the majority opinion rests on analog frameworks that fail to account for the meaningful differences between the Internet and the physical world. With due respect to my colleagues in the majority, I believe the majority opinion displays a troubling incomprehension of the technology at issue in this matter. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   This matter arose from the government's monitoring of Bulletin Board A, an \"Internet-based bulletin board ... dedicated to the advertisement, distribution and production of child pornography\" with over \"1500 'approved users.' \" J.A. 163-64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   According to an affidavit submitted by the government in support of the challenged search warrant, the government began \"observ[ing] various postings\" and \"captur[ing] content\" on Bulletin Board A in October 2015. J.A. 164; Gov't Br. at 4, 5, 13. On November 2, 2015, a Bulletin Board A member posted on a sub-forum of Bulletin Board A. That post described a particular child pornography video; posted \"three different sets of twenty video thumbnail images\" of the video; and included a URL\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   composed of a largely random sequence of letters and numbers, described in the affidavit alternatively as \"http://[redacted].rar.html\" and\"http://[redacted].comxu5me9erdipp/brochure.rar.html.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   J.A. 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The affidavit states that the Bulletin Board A post also provided a password, which users could input to access the content of the file associated with that unique URL. Gov't Br. at 5. Without the password, the file could not be opened and viewed. The affidavit does not identify at what time on November 2, 2015, the Bulletin Board A member made the post. And notwithstanding that the government was routinely \"observ[ing]\" and \"captur[ing]\" content on Bulletin Board A at that time, the affidavit does not state whether the URL and password had previously or subsequently been posted on Bulletin Board A or elsewhere on the Internet. J.A. 164; Gov't Br. at 4, 5, 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Significant to an understanding of the technology at play in this matter, Bulletin Board A did not host the URL or the content accessible through the URL. Rather, a wholly independent website \"offer[ing] online file hosting and sharing services\" (such as DropBox, Google Drive, or Apple iCloud)-which the affidavit refers to using the pseudonym \"File Sharing Site\"-hosted the URL and content. J.A. 165-66; Gov't Br. at 14. File Sharing Site is also used to store and share lawful content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   To that end, File Sharing Site's \"Terms of Service\" expressly prohibit users from storing or sharing \"[p]ornography, nudity, sexual images and any kind of offensive images or videos.\" J.A. 166. According to the affidavit, law enforcement officers nonetheless had \"reason to believe\" that File Sharing Site \"was used by [Bulletin Board A] members to store files containing child pornography and make them accessible to other members.\" J.A. 165-66; Gov't Br. at 14. In addition to File Sharing Site, Bulletin Board A members used \"several\" other \"cloud-based storage services\" to store and share files \"depicting minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" J.A. 165; Gov't Br. at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Sometime after the November 2, 2015, post, law enforcement officers monitoring Bulletin Board A clicked on the URL, navigated to File Sharing Site, and then downloaded an encrypted video file from File Sharing Site. The officers used the password provided in the post to open the video file, which depicted child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Thereafter, the officers obtained an order directing File Sharing Site to disclose business records pertaining to unique URLs containing files that law enforcement knew to depict minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct. In response, File Sharing Site produced the \"dates, times, and IP addresses connected to the downloading of the file content associated with the URLs specified in the application for the Order.\" J.A. 167; Gov't Br. at 6. These records revealed that at 3:23 pm on November 2, 2015, an IP address associated with Defendant's residence was \"used to download or attempt to download file content associated with that URL.\" J.A. 167-68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The affidavit does not explain what \"download\" or \"attempt to download\" entailed. The affidavit does not state that Defendant or anyone likely to be using Defendant's IP address was a member of Bulletin Board A-or had ever even visited Bulletin Board A-and the government subsequently conceded that \"membership in Bulletin Board A could not be definitively established.\" Gov't Br. at 30. Nor does the affidavit state whether someone using Defendant's IP address ever used the password to open the files hosted and shared on File Sharing Site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In addition to describing the Bulletin Board A investigation and someone using Defendant's IP address to \"download or attempt to download\" the child pornography stored on File Sharing Site, the affidavit does include several paragraphs describing certain characteristics of \"individuals who possess or access with intent to child pornography\"-individuals commonly referred to as \"collectors.\" J.A. 168-69. But the affidavit does not state that Defendant or someone likely to be using Defendant's IP address was a \"collector\" of child pornography or exhibited any of the particular behaviors associated with collectors set forth in the affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Based on the foregoing information, on April 8, 2016, the magistrate judge issued a warrant authorizing the government to search Defendant's residence, including any electronic devices found therein. On April 12, 2016, law enforcement officers executed the warrant. A forensic examination of the hard drive of a laptop computer found in Defendant's residence revealed thousands of images and videos of minor children engaged in sexually explicit conduct, in folders created from April 14, 2012, to November 18, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   I note that the majority opinion points out that the video available through the File Sharing Site URL was among the files found on the hard drive of Defendant's laptop.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 323-24.

Put differently, Special Agent Eyler's affidavit represented, without qualification, that someone using Defendant's IP address \"attempt[ed] to download child pornography on\n   <em>\n    Bulletin Board A\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202252\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added), not File Sharing Site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   On December 14, 2017, a grand jury issued an indictment charging Defendant with one count of receipt of child pornography in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) and (b)(1) and one count of possession of child pornography in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B) and (b)(2). On January 3, 2018, Defendant filed a motion to suppress all evidence seized during the April 12, 2016, search as well as the fruits of that search. Defendant's motion to suppress argued, in part, that the affidavit provided insufficient evidence to establish probable cause to search Defendant's residence because it failed to establish a fair probability that someone using Defendant's IP address navigated through the URL posted on Bulletin Board A to the contraband stored on File Sharing Site.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 27 (\"The instant affidavit contains no information or contentions as to [Defendant]'s involvement, access, or membership to Bulletin Board A. In fact, the affidavit makes no contention that the subject URL, purportedly containing child pornography, could have only been accessed through Bulletin Board A.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In its opposition to Defendant's motion to suppress, the government claimed that the affidavit did, in fact, connect Defendant's IP address to the Bulletin Board A post given \"the close proximity in time between the posting at Bulletin Board A and attempt to download\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   child pornographic content.\" J.A. 45 (emphasis added). By characterizing the content as the property of Bulletin Board A-not as content stored by File Sharing Site-the government invited the district court to not draw a distinction between Bulletin Board A and File Sharing Site, notwithstanding that the affidavit connected Defendant's IP address with\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   File Sharing Site, not Bulletin Board A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Additionally, an unstated, but essential, premise of the government's temporal proximity argument was that someone using Defendant's IP address attempted to download the child pornography from File Sharing Site\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Bulletin Board A post prompting the investigation-a premise that the government invited the district court to indulge by relying on a case in which a district court found probable cause to issue a warrant when the allegations in the affidavit established that the download of contraband occurred soon\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   a link to the contraband was posted to a child pornography message board.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 45 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Evans\n   </em>\n   , 2:16-cr-20292, Doc. No. 69, report and recommendation, at 14 (E.D. Mich. Nov. 20, 2017)). The government further rejected Defendant's argument that the File Sharing Site URL \"could have been accessed through innocent means\" because \"there was no reason for the agent to believe the link was available anywhere other than on Bulletin Board A.\" J.A. 44-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   On February 2, 2018, the district court denied Defendant's suppression motion. Ruling from the bench, the district court accepted the key factual premises relied on by the government to connect Defendant's IP address with Bulletin Board A:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   What is clearly in the affidavit is that Bulletin Board A is a dedicated bulletin board to advertising distribution and production of child pornography and that it therefore, already anybody who might be on that site, there would be a reasonable belief that that person was interested in accessing that kind of information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   Then there was the posting of that particular section [of Bulletin Board A] that was clearly advertising video clips of what would absolutely be unequivocally child pornography, and the critical fact ... is that the same day that posting went up, the URL that is linked-or the IP address that is linked to a computer in the defendant's home ... attempts to or at least shows an interest in [Bulletin Board A]. In my view, that's enough for probable cause to believe that there would be a computer in that residence that would have child pornography on it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   J.A. 76-77. In other words, in accordance with the government's invitation, the district court drew no distinction between Bulletin Board A and File Sharing Site and presumed that someone using Defendant's IP address clicked on the URL navigating to the child pornography stored on File Sharing Site\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   seeing the URL posted on Bulletin Board A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   But the majority maintains that it is \"unclear\" whether the district court was referring to Bulletin Board A or File Sharing Site because the district court could have been referring to File Sharing Site, rather than Bulletin Board A when it referred to \"both the 'posting' and 'the URL that is linked.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . That reading is simply implausible. Clearly, the district court did not refer to the Bulletin A Board \"posting\" and the \"URL that is linked\" as two separate websites,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Bulletin Board A and File Sharing Site. Instead, the district court stated that on the \"same day that\n   <em>\n    posting\n   </em>\n   went up, the\n   <em>\n    URL that is linked\n   </em>\n   -or the IP address that is linked to a computer in the defendant's home ... attempts to or at least shows an interest in\n   <em>\n    that particular site\n   </em>\n   .\" J.A. 76-77 (emphases added). The district court therefore considered both the \"posting\" and the \"URL that is linked,\"\n   <em>\n    on Bulletin Board A\n   </em>\n   , to be referencing a single website: Bulletin Board A. The district court discussed the URL only in the context of it being\n   <em>\n    linked\n   </em>\n   on Bulletin Board A, rather than it being\n   <em>\n    hosted\n   </em>\n   by File Sharing Site. Accordingly, the district court incorrectly assumed that Defendant's IP address demonstrated an interest in Bulletin Board A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In short, the district court did not expressly contemplate the possibility that someone using Defendant's IP address navigated to the URL by any means other than the Bulletin Board A post.

According to the majority opinion, the affidavit established that someone using Defendant's IP address \"plausibly knew\" that the URL linked to child pornography because the November 2, 2015, post on Bulletin Board A, in which a copy of the URL appeared, \"contain[ed] text and images that unequivocally identified its contents as child pornography.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 325. The majority opinion's finding of probable cause, therefore, rests entirely on the premise that the affidavit established a fair probability that someone using Defendant's IP address \"clicked the link having encountered it on [Bulletin Board A].\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 325.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   That factual premise finds no direct support in the materials considered by the magistrate judge in granting the warrant. The affidavit does not assert that Defendant, or someone likely to be using Defendant's IP address, was a member of Bulletin Board A. Indeed, the government conceded that it could not establish whether Defendant or someone using his IP address was a member of Bulletin Board A. Gov't Br. at 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The affidavit also does not provide any direct evidence that Defendant or someone using Defendant's IP address had ever visited Bulletin Board A. On the contrary, the government conceded before the district court that because Bulletin Board A \"was only accessible on the dark web via a special web-browser called TOR,\" it could not provide an electronic record establishing whether Defendant's IP address ever visited Bulletin Board A. J.A. 37-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Instead of relying on direct evidence, the government contends, as it did before the district court, that circumstantial evidence makes it fairly probable that someone using Defendant's IP address navigated through the Bulletin Board A post to attempt to download the child pornography hosted by File Sharing Site. In support of that argument, the government's brief makes several representations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   First, the government repeatedly represents that the post appeared on Bulletin Board A\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   someone using Defendant's IP address sought to access the child pornography stored by File Sharing Site. Gov't Br. at 4 (\"On November 2, an IP address that resolved back to [Defendant]'s residence was recorded to trying to access a link containing child pornography that had been posted on Bulletin Board A\n   <em>\n    less than 24 hours earlier\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added));\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 30 (\"The short duration\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   when the link appeared on Bulletin Board A\n   <em>\n    until\n   </em>\n   someone at the defendant's residence clicked on the link established a fair probability that the link had been accessed through Bulletin Board A.\" (emphases added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Second, the government represents that the \"link ...\n   <em>\n    originated\n   </em>\n   on a dark web forum dedicated to sharing child sexual abuse content,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11 (emphasis added), meaning Bulletin Board A.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 9 (\"Probable cause existed to search [Defendant]'s home on April 12, 2016, because law enforcement determined that a computer at [Defendant]'s residence accessed a link to downloadable child pornography,\n   <em>\n    which originated on a\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    website that caters to individuals seeking child pornography\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added)). That \"originat[ion]\" contention serves to reinforce the government's assertion that someone using Defendant's IP address attempted to download the child pornography from File Sharing Site\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   encountering the URL on Bulletin Board A-if the URL \"originated\" on Bulletin Board A, then someone using Defendant's IP address had to have clicked on the URL\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   it appeared on Bulletin Board A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   For two principal reasons, the government's temporal proximity argument fails to establish a fair probability that someone\n   using Defendant's IP address navigated to the URL via the post in Bulletin Board A. First, the government's temporal proximity argument rests on the \"critical fact\" that someone using Defendant's IP address clicked on the URL\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the post containing the URL appeared on Bulletin Board A-a premise that the government repeatedly asserted in its briefing and argument to the district court and this Court. But if that \"critical fact\" lacks support-if the click on the URL occurred before the post on Bulletin Board A-then the person using Defendant's IP address could not have encountered the URL on Bulletin Board A, and therefore could not have viewed the text and images in the Bulletin Board A post indicating the URL linked to child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   That is the case. Contrary to the government's repeated representations in its briefing, the affidavit does not assert, much less establish, that someone using Defendant's IP address clicked the URL\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the post containing the URL appeared on Bulletin Board A. On the contrary, whereas the affidavit reports the time someone using Defendant's IP address clicked on the File Sharing Site URL-3:23 pm on November 2, 2015-it does not report at what time that day the post first appeared on Bulletin Board A. Rather, it simply states that the post appeared on Bulletin Board A sometime on November 2, 2015. Accordingly, the post could have appeared on Bulletin Board A anytime within a window of 8 hours, 37 minutes\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   someone using Defendant's IP address downloaded or attempted to download the child pornography from File Sharing Site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Significantly, notwithstanding that the government represented to both this Court and the district court that-as a matter of fact, not inference-the Bulletin Board A post appeared\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   someone using Defendant's IP address attempted to download the child pornography from File Sharing Site, the affidavit nowhere addressed whether the government knew, or could have known, the time of the Bulletin Board A post as a result of its ongoing observation and capturing of content on Bulletin Board A. Gov't Br. at 13. Indeed, the government never has explained to this Court or the district court why the repeated representations in its briefing as to the sequence of events does not find direct support in the facts set forth in the affidavit it submitted with the warrant application. Of course, in assessing probable cause, we do not look to the representations the government makes after the fact, but the facts the government presented to the magistrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Because the government's circumstantial causation argument rests on the attempted download from File Sharing Site occurring after the post appeared on Bulletin Board A, the government's failure to establish that sequence of events fatally undermines its effort to rely on temporal proximity as a circumstantial basis for proving that someone using Defendant's IP address navigated to the URL through Bulletin Board A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Notwithstanding this fatal flaw, the majority opinion accepts the government's temporal proximity argument-and the government's crucial factual representations underlying that argument-hook, line, and sinker. Although the majority recognizes that the affidavit does not establish whether the Bulletin Board A post preceded the \"attempted download\" by someone using Defendant's IP address, it nevertheless contends that the \"critical\n   <em>\n    fact\n   </em>\n   \" supporting probable cause is \"[t]he close timing between the link's appearance on Bulletin Board A and the click by a user's IP address.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 325 (emphasis added). According to the majority, \"because\n   the link was accessed on the same day it appeared on Bulletin Board A, it is at least reasonably probable that the user clicked the link having encountered it on that website.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 325. Yet, even as it acknowledges that the affidavit failed to establish the \"critical fact\" supporting its theory of probable cause, the majority opinion nevertheless accepts that theory wholesale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 326 (\"That chronology [of the URL click following the Bulletin Board A post] sets in motion the series of plausible inferences described above.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Notably, the majority opinion distinguishes that \"critical fact\"-that the click occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the appearance of the Bulletin Board A post-from the \"inferences\" it draws from that fact-most notably, that someone using Defendant's IP address encountered the link in the Bulletin Board A post, not via some other electronic pathway.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 325-26, 327 (reasoning that \"it's fairly probable, given the temporal proximity, that the person clicked on the link\n   <em>\n    because he saw it on Bulletin Board A and wanted to view child pornography\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added)). Put differently, rather than relying on an inference from an established fact, the majority opinion impermissibly draws inferences on inferences to uphold the warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosencranz v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"839336\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/356/310/#p317\">\n    356 F.2d 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 317 (1st Cir. 1966) (noting that a magistrate may not \"reach for external facts and ... build inference upon inference in order to create a reasonable basis for his belief that a crime is presently being committed\"). The majority opinion therefore improperly draws an inference of causality based on a sequence of events the government failed to establish.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Figure A (illustrating the 35.9% probability that the Bulletin Board A post followed the IP address's click of the URL).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    Figure A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   But that is not the only flaw with the temporal proximity argument advanced by the government and embraced by the majority opinion. The government's temporal proximity argument also rests on the wholly unsupported premise that-even if someone using Defendant's IP address had clicked on the File Sharing Site URL after the post appeared on Bulletin Board A (which, again, the affidavit does not establish)-the user navigated to the URL through the post appearing on Bulletin Board A. Indeed, the facts set forth in the affidavit fail to address, much less rule out, a multitude of ways someone using Defendant's IP address could have navigated to the File Sharing Site URL without encountering the URL on Bulletin Board A, and therefore without observing the text and images that would have put that person on notice of the download link's content. The majority nowhere meaningfully contemplates the significance of this internet\n   technology in our role to assess probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   To begin, users can\n   <em>\n    encounter\n   </em>\n   URLs, or hyperlinks to URLs,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in myriad ways-including through websites, emails, chats, text messages, comment threads, discussion boards, File Sharing Sites (such as DropBox, Google Drive, or Apple iCloud), tweets, Facebook posts, Instagram captions, Snapchat messages, embedded images or videos, unwanted pop-up windows, any combination thereof, or by any other digital means.

In this matter, none of the facts alleged in the affidavit rule out any of these potentially millions of alternative paths-wholly unconnected to the Bulletin Board A post-through which someone using Defendant's IP address could have encountered the URL navigating to the child pornography on File Sharing Site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Additionally, users can\n   <em>\n    navigate\n   </em>\n   to a URL in numerous ways beyond clicking on a link included in a post on a particular webpage, like Bulletin Board A. For example, a user could click on a copy of the URL posted to another website, click on a bookmark, type the URL directly into a browser's navigation bar, or click a hyperlink in an email or a news article, to name only a few.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Amicus Br. at 8. That is particularly true when the URL navigates to a site on the normal Internet, like File Sharing Site, as opposed to a site, like Bulletin Board A, that can only be reached using a specialty browser, like Tor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The majority opinion maintains that the \"randomness of the URL\" in this case-which contains a string of letters and numbers with no discernible pattern or meaning-\"helps the government, as internet users aren't likely to type a truly random string of numbers and letters into their web browser by mistake.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 328 n.7. That assertion-that someone using Defendant's address\n   <em>\n    typed\n   </em>\n   the URL into a web browser-contradicts the probable cause theory advanced by the government and otherwise relied on in the majority opinion-that someone using Defendant's IP address intentionally\n   <em>\n    clicked\n   </em>\n   on the URL in the Bulletin Board A post because they believed it led to child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Additionally, the randomness of the URL weighs against a finding of probable cause because it increases the likelihood that someone using Defendant's IP address clicked on the URL without knowing the content to which it navigated. Even assuming the user actually saw the URL-which, as explained below, is not necessarily the case-the random sequence of letters and numbers would provide a user with no indication that the URL navigated to child pornography. And most significantly, the majority opinion's myopic focus on one method of navigating to a URL-typing the URL into a browser-again ignores the multitude of other equally plausible-and likely far more plausible-ways someone using Defendant's IP address could have navigated to URL, none of which ways the facts set forth in the affidavit rule out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Importantly, users can\n   <em>\n    unintentionally navigate\n   </em>\n   to URLs because-as is the case with the URL clicked by someone using Defendant's IP address-URLs frequently do not provide any external indication of the content to which they navigate. For example, services like YouTube and DropBox generate random URLs that provide no information about their underlying content. Amicus Br. at 10. Other services, like Bitly, TinyURL, and Perma shorten URLs, which may otherwise provide external indicators of their content, to generic URLs that include a standard URL base, such as \"https://bit.ly/,\" \"https://tinyurl.com/,\" or \"https://perma.cc/,\" followed by a random string of alphanumeric characters.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Robin Camille Davis,\n   <em>\n    The Future of Web Citation Practices\n   </em>\n   , 35 Behav. &amp; Soc.

Again, none of the facts in the affidavit address, much less rule out, the numerous possible ways in which someone using Defendant's IP address could have unintentionally navigated to the File Sharing Site URL hosting the child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The majority opinion adverts to one of the many alternative paths through which someone using Defendant's IP address could have navigated-intentionally or unintentionally-to the File Sharing Site URL, acknowledging that Defendant's IP address may have \"received [the link] knowingly from a member of [Bulletin Board A],\" rather than \"f[i]nd[ing] the link through Bulletin Board A.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 327-28. But the majority opinion fails to recognize that this alternative path, by itself, materially undermines its theory of probable cause. If someone using Defendant's IP address did not encounter and navigate to the File Sharing Site URL through the Bulletin Board A post, then that person did not have an opportunity to observe the text and pictures in the post indicating the nature of the content to which the URL navigated. As the majority opinion concedes, absent a fair probability that someone using Defendant's IP address \"clicked the link knowing that it contained child pornography\"-which would not necessarily be the case if Defendant \"received [the link] knowingly from a member of [Bulletin Board A]\"-then there is no basis to find probable cause.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 325, 328.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   In sum, there are myriad ways users can encounter and navigate to a URL-including unintentionally, particularly when, as here, the text of the URL provides no indication as to the nature of the content to which it navigates. Accordingly, even if the Bulletin Board A post preceded the attempt by someone using Defendant's IP address to download child pornography from File Sharing Site-again, a fact not established by the affidavit-there are potentially millions of paths through which someone using Defendant's IP address could have encountered and navigated to the File Sharing Site URL hosting the child pornography other than through Bulletin Board A. Put simply, the affidavit does not establish the probability of the single sequence of events upon which the majority opinion relies-that someone using Defendant's IP address navigated to the File Sharing Site URL after encountering it on Bulletin Board A.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Figure B (contrasting the majority opinion's myopic focus on one pathway between Defendant's IP address and the File Sharing Site URL with the myriad pathways, only some of which are reflected by the dashed lines, consistent with the affidavit).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    Figure B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The majority acknowledges that the probability of the IP address accessing the URL through Bulletin Board A \"depends on the link being clicked\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   it was posted on Bulletin Board A\" and that the affidavit does not specify the timing of the Bulletin Board A post.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 326. But, in the majority's view, the \"ambiguity\" regarding the timing of the Bulletin Board A post is not fatal to a probable cause finding because it \"was still almost twice as likely that the post preceded the click as the other way around.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (citing Figure A). Therefore, the majority opinion maintains, \"the much likelier scenario\" was that the Bulletin Board A post preceded the URL click and was therefore accessed by Defendant's IP address through Bulletin Board A.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 326.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   However, the majority's analysis ignores that the probability that the Bulletin Board A post preceded the File Sharing Site URL click is only one of several layers of uncertainty governing the likelihood that someone using Defendant's IP address accessed the File Sharing Site URL through the Bulletin Board A post. Put simply, assessing whether it is fairly probable that Defendant's IP address navigated to the URL via Bulletin Board A involves a compound probability,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   governed by the probabilities of at least two independent events: first, whether the Bulletin Board A post preceded the URL click,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   second, whether Defendant's IP address encountered the URL through the Bulletin Board A post. Stated formulaically,\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-138\"><em>P{Navigated to URL via</em> = <em>P{Bulletin Board A Post</em> <em>Bulletin Board A}</em> <em>Preceded Click}</em> * <em>P{Encountered Link on Bulletin</em> <em>Board A}</em> 0.641<em>x</em> = .641 * <em>x</em> <em>x</em> = 1</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   As to the first event, there is a 64 percent chance that the Bulletin Board A post temporally preceded the URL click.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Figure A. And as to the second event-whether Defendant's IP address accessed the File Sharing Site URL through the Bulletin Board A post-the affidavit provides no facts that in any way circumscribe the massive universe of paths someone using Defendant's IP address could have taken to the URL, meaning that that probability, under the facts set forth in the affidavit, is necessarily vanishingly small.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Figure C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    Figure C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Without additional facts further limiting the universe of possibilities, we cannot know whether it is fairly probable that the IP address encountered the URL through Bulletin Board A. All but one of these potentially millions of the paths to the File Sharing Site URL do not involve the factual scenario that the majority opinion, at the government's urging, credulously accepts-that someone using Defendant's IP address encountered the URL in the November 2, 2015, post on Bulletin Board A and, using the link in that post, sought to download the child pornography shared on File Sharing Site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The majority opinion glosses over these myriad alternative paths of accessing the URL because in its view, these \"aren't of equal probability; rather, the likelier avenues incriminate [Defendant].\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 328. The majority opinion claims that the \"avenue[ ]\" advanced by the government-that someone using Defendant's IP address clicked on the File Sharing Site URL after encountering it in the Bulletin Board A post-is \"likelier\" because the \"likelihood that a specific filesharing page containing child pornography would find its way to somebody uninterested in such contraband ... is probably quite low.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   But the majority opinion identifies no facts in the affidavit supporting its bald assertion that it is unlikely that a user would innocently access child pornography. Instead, it first cites to the affidavit's boilerplate language regarding the characteristics of individuals who \"collect\" child pornography. The Fourth Amendment permits courts to rely on \"the affiant-officer's experience\" and knowledge regarding given crimes only when the affidavit contains sufficient evidence linking an individual to that crime. Wayne R. LaFave, 2 Search &amp; Seizure \u00a7 3.7(d) (5th ed. 2018). For example, because it is \"merely common sense that a drug supplier will keep evidence of his crimes at his home,\" at least one court has found that informant statements, as well as corroborating record evidence, setting forth \"sufficient evidence\" that a defendant was a drug supplier supported probable cause to search the supplier's home.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But when individualized information connecting an individual to a crime is absent, an affiant-much less a court-cannot rely on generalized, boilerplate assumptions about criminal habits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Underwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071971\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/1076/#p1082\">\n    725 F.3d 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1082-83 (9th Cir. 2013) (concluding that a trio of facts-a detective's observation of a personal-use sized baggie of marijuana at a suspect's home, the suspect's one-time delivery of two crates to drug traffickers, and the affiant's claims based on \"experience and training\" regarding the general habits of drug traffickers-could not support a finding of fair probability that drug trafficking evidence would be found at defendant's home).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Here, like\n   <em>\n    Underwood\n   </em>\n   , the majority opinion relies on the affidavit's explanation of the generalized habits of collectors of child pornography but points to no individualized facts in this case demonstrating that someone using Defendant's IP address was, in fact, a collector of child pornography.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 327-28. For example, the affidavit does not allege that someone using Defendant's IP address viewed or possessed child pornography-or even successfully downloaded the illicit content associated with the URL-let alone that the IP address had ever accessed Bulletin Board A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Ultimately, the majority's reasoning is circular: the IP address must have accessed the URL through Bulletin Board A because the IP address was associated with a collector of child pornography, and in turn, the IP address must be associated with a collector of child pornography because the IP address accessed the URL through Bulletin Board A. But without any affidavit evidence suggesting that the IP address in fact accessed the URL through Bulletin Board A or any evidence demonstrating that the IP address belonged to a collector of child pornography, the majority opinion cannot permissibly rely on the generalized habits of those who view and possess child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Moreover, even if the majority could permissibly rely on the affidavit's boilerplate language in this case, that language does not describe the sharing habits of\n   child pornography collectors or the \"complex measures\" used to conceal their online activities, and therefore that language has no bearing on the likelihood of an innocent user accessing child pornography inadvertently.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 327-28. Indeed, the fact that the government elected not to include such language is telling. The template for search warrants in child pornography cases used by law enforcement officers in the Bulletin Board A investigation directs affiants that they should include boilerplate \"collector\" information in an affidavit \"ONLY if\" the affiant can \"tie [collector] characteristics to the specific offender.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, the government's decision not to include boilerplate language related to the \"complex\" sharing habits of child pornography collectors indicates that even it did not believe the evidence supported inclusion of those boilerplate facts and therefore the inferences drawn by the majority opinion.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 327-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   In support of its assertion that the \"likelihood that a specific filesharing page containing child pornography would find its way to somebody uninterested in such contraband ... is probably quite low,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20220176\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , the majority opinion further relies on two out-of-circuit cases to show that \"consumers of child pornography frequently employ complex measures to keep their online activities secret,\" and therefore that it is unlikely that someone uninterested in child pornography could, or would, access the URL in question.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 327-28 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Instead, it documents a single click by an unspecified user of a particular IP address of a URL containing illicit content. And even if the facts of those cases were in any way analogous to the facts set forth the affidavit-which they were not-the government elected not to reference those cases, or even the type of conduct at issue in those cases, in its warrant application. Warrant applications do not implicitly incorporate, without reference, the entire Federal Reporter. Rather, the government is obligated to put the relevant, case-specific facts in the affidavit to support probable cause. It simply failed to do so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Additionally, the approach taken in the majority opinion-relying on factually dissimilar cases not referenced in the warrant affidavit as evidence that there is a fair probability that a suspect committed a crime in the same manner as those earlier cases-eviscerates the Fourth Amendment's probable cause requirement. The majority opinion's reasoning rests on the unsupported, and unsupportable, premise that if a defendant committed a crime in a certain way in one case-like, for example,\n   the\n   <em>\n    McGarity\n   </em>\n   defendants' use of codenames and encryption methods-then there is a fair probability that every other individual suspected of the same crime committed that crime in the same manner as the defendant in the first case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Consider, for example, a case in which the government suspected a physician's involvement in an alleged health care fraud scheme. In an earlier health care fraud case, the government filed affidavits and obtained three search warrants, for the physician's two medical offices and his personal residence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Srivastava\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4234665\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/540/277/#p280\">\n    540 F.3d 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 280-81 (4th Cir. 2008). In addressing the physician's motion to suppress evidence seized from his residence, among other challenges, this Court concluded that the affidavit \"made compelling assertions that documents and records relating to [the physician's] medical practice-and that may constitute evidence of health care fraud-would be found in [his] residence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 289. In particular, the affidavit demonstrated that the physician \"conducted a substantial part of his medical practice from [his] residence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . For example, the insurance billing for the physician's medical practice was conducted from his house, and his personal residence was listed as a billing address.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 281. Therefore, the affidavit demonstrated probable cause that evidence of health care fraud would be found at his residence.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 289. In so doing, this Court emphasized that the affidavit included case-specific facts demonstrating a nexus between the physician's residence and the evidence of health care fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Under the majority opinion's analytical approach-in which one defendant's conduct may be imputed to all future individuals suspected of committing the same crime-there is a fair probability that every future health care fraud suspect conducted health care fraud in the same way as the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Srivastava\n   </em>\n   -namely, from their personal residence as well as their medical offices, even if the affidavit alleges no facts to support such a finding. Accordingly, under the majority opinion's flawed analysis, law enforcement would be able to procure a search warrant for a future health care fraud suspect's home, even if the affidavit does not demonstrate a nexus between her home and health care fraud, simply because health care fraud has been previously conducted in that manner.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336683\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/375/#p382\">\n    828 F.3d 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 382 (6th Cir. 2016) (\"If the affidavit does not present sufficient facts demonstrating why the police officer expects to find evidence in the residence rather than in some other place, a judge may not find probable cause to issue a search warrant.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Such an analytical approach violates the Fourth Amendment's requirement that the \"affidavit supporting the search warrant ... demonstrate a nexus between the evidence sought and the place to be searched.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Contrary to the majority opinion's reasoning, we cannot rely on factually unrelated cases to ascertain probable cause merely because they implicate the same crime. Rather, determining if an affidavit properly establishes a nexus is a \"fact-intensive question resolved by examining the totality of circumstances presented.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   In further support of its conclusion that Defendant's IP address is unlikely to have innocently encountered the URL in question, the majority points to the \"suspiciously short interval\n   <em>\n    between\n   </em>\n   \" the Bulletin Board A post and the URL click.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 328 (emphasis added). In the majority's view, this temporal proximity is based \"on the contents of the affidavit, the magistrate judge's likely familiarity with online child pornography crimes, and his ability to reach 'common-sense conclusions about human behavior.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   But as explained previously, the simple fact that the Bulletin Board A post and the alleged accessing of the File Sharing Site URL took place on the same day does not support the majority opinion's inferential leap. The naked click of a URL provides very little information about how a particular IP address-or individual using that IP address-actually encountered or navigated to a URL. Simply because\n   <em>\n    law enforcement officers\n   </em>\n   navigated the URL through one particular pathway-clicking the URL included in the Bulletin Board A post-does not establish, in the absence of additional circumstantial evidence, a fair probability that\n   <em>\n    Defendant's IP address\n   </em>\n   also accessed the URL using the same pathway through the Bulletin Board A post. Because the affidavit lacks facts to circumscribe the multitude of potential paths someone using Defendant's IP address could have taken to encounter and navigate to the File Sharing Site URL, the probability that the person in fact reached the URL through the Bulletin Board A post-the foundation of the probable cause theory embraced by the majority opinion-necessarily approaches zero. This is not the \"fair probability\" the Fourth Amendment demands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   On the contrary, the inference advanced by the government and made up out of whole cloth by the majority opinion-that someone using Defendant's IP address navigated to the File Sharing Site URL after encountering the URL on Bulletin Board A-amounts to the type of \"improbable leap\" that the Fourth Amendment does not countenance.\n   <em>\n    Lyles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519474\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/910/787/#p791\">\n    910 F.3d at 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nevertheless, the term \"probabilities\" necessarily contemplates that courts try to estimate (at least) outer bounds on the likelihood that contraband or evidence will be found in a particular location at a particular time. Otherwise, the probable cause inquiry would be devoid of guardrails, opening the door to the general warrants the Framers feared. To estimate those outer bounds, courts rely on facts-facts that circumscribe the universe of potential explanations and therefore allow the court to make an estimate as to the numerator and denominator determining the probability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lyles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519474\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/910/787/#p791\">\n    910 F.3d at 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The question, as so often in Fourth Amendment cases, is what precisely the facts show.\");\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Richard Posner,\n   <em>\n    Against Constitutional Theory\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20N.Y.U.%20L.%20Rev.%201\">\n    73 N.Y.U.

In determining whether a warrant should issue-whether there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence will be found at the suspect's home-courts rely on numerous circumstantial facts to guide their determination. Thus, for example, courts upholding warrants issued in such circumstances have emphasized that a recent drug sale took place within a close vicinity of the suspect's home,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The proximity between the trash cans and the home-the police found the trash cans directly behind the house-reduced the likelihood that contraband in the trash can was unconnected to the adjacent home because generally \"trash cans placed directly behind a home are used by those who live there\" and trash inside those trash cans is \"usually generated\n   <em>\n    by the house closest to those cans\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 327-28 (emphasis added).

These facts, considered together, established probable cause because they rendered \"too slight\" the possibility that the tied trash bags did not come from the house.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 328. Importantly, unlike the majority opinion's failure to meaningfully consider the myriad ways someone using Defendant's IP address could have clicked on the File Sharing Site URL without encountering the Bulletin Board A post, the\n   <em>\n    Gary\n   </em>\n   Court did not dismiss out of hand potential \"innocent reasons\" weighing against the likelihood that drug evidence would be found in the home. Instead, this Court looked at the totality of the circumstances and cited specific facts that made those possibilities unlikely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   By contrast, in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lyles\n   </em>\n   , we held that a single trash pull \"revealing evidence of three marijuana stems, three empty packs of rolling papers, and a piece of mail, standing alone\" did not justify a search warrant for an adjacent home.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519474\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/910/787/#p791\">\n    910 F.3d at 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching that conclusion, we highlighted several case-specific facts that rendered the case distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Gary\n   </em>\n   . Whereas in\n   <em>\n    Gary\n   </em>\n   the trash pull revealed drug distribution paraphernalia-evidence consistent with recurrent or ongoing activity within the residence, meaning that contraband was likely still at the residence-the single trash pull in\n   <em>\n    Lyles\n   </em>\n   revealed only a \"tiny quantity of discarded [marijuana] residue\" that provided no evidence of recurrent or ongoing activity, rendering it possible, but \"not probabl[e],\" that drugs would be found in the home.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 793-94 (citations omitted). Additionally, whereas in\n   <em>\n    Gary\n   </em>\n   law enforcement officers received a tip that drug distribution activities\n   were taking place at the residence, in\n   <em>\n    Lyles\n   </em>\n   the affidavit submitted by the government in support of the warrant provided no evidence, beyond the evidence in the trash bag, that the residence, or individuals living therein, was involved in drug distribution activities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519474\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/910/787/#p791\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The types of corroborative facts present in\n   <em>\n    Gary\n   </em>\n   -and absent in\n   <em>\n    Lyles\n   </em>\n   -are especially important in cases, like the instant case, in which the government seeks to obtain a warrant based on online conduct, as the Internet significantly expands the universe of \"countervailing probabilities\" that courts must consider in weighing whether the government has met its burden to show that there is a fair probability that contraband will be found in the place it seeks to search.\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3443688,8944798\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/415/88/\">\n    415 F.3d at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, many of the physical, spatial, and temporal limitations that historically proved invaluable in assessing probable cause do not apply in the digital context or apply in meaningfully different ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   For example, whereas this Court could rely on geographic proximity in\n   <em>\n    Gary\n   </em>\n   to conclude that there was a fair probability that contraband would be found in the residence adjacent to the trash cans, geographic proximity has little or no relevance in the context of conduct on the Internet-like the alleged download of child pornography-because the Internet allows for rapid dissemination of electronically stored content throughout the world. That is to say, whereas the limited number of homes within the physical proximity of a trash can means that the probability contraband will be found at any one house near the trash can is fairly large (because the limited number of homes renders the denominator of the probability relatively small), geographic proximity does not serve to increase the probability that contraband will be found at a particular location in the Internet context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   That certain facts courts historically have relied on to assess probable cause lack, or have diminished, probative value in the Internet context does not mean that the government will never be able to surmount its evidentiary burden to obtain a warrant based on Internet conduct. \"Technology is both a threat and a promise.\"\n   <em>\n    Vieth v.

For example, the ease with which Internet and telecommunications companies can capture and store information regarding an IP address's browsing behavior and online activities provides a wealth of additional information for the government to rely on in seeking to obtain a search warrant for a residence associated with the IP address.

For instance, the affidavit may have been able to provide the timestamp of the Bulletin Board A post, and thereby rule out the possibility that someone using Defendant's IP address clicked on the URL before the post appeared on Bulletin Board A. Or, the affidavit may have been able to state whether Defendant's IP address actually downloaded the child pornography hosted by File Sharing Site-meaning that the contraband was more likely stored on a computer in Defendant's residence-rather than simply \"attempt[ing]\" to do so. Or, the affidavit may have been able to state, based on the government's monitoring of Bulleting Board A, whether Defendant, or someone using his IP address, ever had posted to Bulletin Board A. Or, the affidavit may have addressed whether someone using Defendant's IP address had clicked the File Sharing Site URL another time. Or, the affidavit could have stated whether the IP address had clicked\n   <em>\n    another\n   </em>\n   URL on File Sharing Site or some other website containing child pornography. Or, the affidavit may have been able to state whether Defendant, or someone likely to be using his IP address, had committed prior offenses indicative of a potential interest in child pornography. Or, the affidavit may have been able to state, based on the records the government obtained from File Sharing Site, how many different IP addresses downloaded or attempted to download the content accessible through the URL, thereby providing some indication as to how widely the URL was disseminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Any one of these facts would have provided the magistrate with greater clarity as to whether there was a fair probability that someone using Defendant's IP address clicked on the URL knowing that it would likely lead to the download of child pornography, and therefore that contraband was likely to be found in Defendant's residence.

That is to say, the approach taken by the majority opinion-which relies on those representations in the government's briefing that do not find support in the affidavit submitted in support of the warrant-sends a message to government that any ambiguities or omissions in the evidence it submits in support of a warrant application will inure to its benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   That is precisely the wrong message for the judiciary to send to the government.

Wright &amp; Gold, Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc.: Evid. \u00a7 7109, at 80-81 (\"[W]hile earlier cases often assumed that the use of letterhead paper is sufficient to establish authenticity, that conclusion is now undermined by the current widespread availability of photocopy machines, scanners, and computer software capable of forging any letterhead.\"). Accordingly, the ease with which URLs can be copied and shared renders inapt the analogy upon which the majority opinion implicitly relies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Or consider another proposed analogy advanced by one of my colleagues in the majority during oral argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   If a package is being sent through the mail to a residence and that package contains cocaine ... and [law enforcement officers] go and say they want a search warrant for that house because the package is being delivered there, there is probable cause to search that house, right. We recognize though that it could well be and, in fact, we actually know that often ... drug dealers will send packages to their next door neighbor, for example, and try to pick them up before they are gathered. So there are always possibilities that that package could be sent to an innocent neighbor instead of the actual drug dealer. But throughout the case law we say that that may well be true-that is a possible explanation-that the receiver doesn't know that it was coming, but that doesn't destroy probable cause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Oral Argument at 41:40-43:46;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Again, several aspects of this analog analogy do not map well onto the digital context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   To begin, as in the trash pull example at issue in\n   <em>\n    Gary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.B.1, the limited number of houses \"neighbor[ing]\" the house to which the package of cocaine is delivered allows courts to place a lower bound on the probability that the house to which the package was delivered was, in fact, the package's intended recipient. By contrast, because URLs can be copied myriad times and rapidly disseminated to an infinite number of IP addresses around the world, geographic proximity provides no assistance to courts in assessing the probability that electronically disseminated contraband will be found in any particular location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Second, contraband disseminated over the Internet is not subject to the same physical constraints as the package of cocaine in my colleague's hypothetical. A URL, and the content to which it navigates, can be replicated, stored, and reposted with little or no cost or effort. By contrast, a package of cocaine cannot be replicated and obtaining additional packages of cocaine is costly. Due to the cost and complexity of obtaining packages of cocaine, someone is not likely, for example, to send a package of cocaine to a large swath of innocent persons as part of an extortion scheme, as has occurred with\n   child pornography disseminated electronically.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Levin,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Third, there are more ways to disguise the content to which a URL navigates than a package of cocaine. As explained above, there are virtually an infinite number of ways that one can mask a URL, through methods such as link shortening or disguising. To be sure, there also are ways to disguise a package of cocaine-the sender, for example, can use a false return address or use a box that suggests the contents of the package are innocuous. But the methods for disguising cocaine are more limited-a given quantity of cocaine takes up a certain amount of space and has a certain weight, meaning any effort to mask a package of that quantity of cocaine is necessarily subject to certain physical limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Fourth, the cocaine package can be delivered by limited means-the postal service, a commercial service like FedEx or UPS, or a private individual or group. By contrast, as explained above, the IP address could have encountered and navigated to the URL in myriad ways, only some of which provide any indication of the nature or origin of the content to which the URL navigates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   That the bare-bones facts provided in the affidavit-a single click of a random alphanumeric URL leading to a widely used file sharing website hosting downloadable child pornography on the same day as a copy of the URL appeared on a different website devoted to child pornography-render the analogies my colleagues in the majority seek to draw inapt does not mean, however, that courts can never rely on analogical reasoning to assess probable cause in the Internet context. Rather, it means that the government must put forward sufficient facts in an affidavit to establish that the online conduct at issue is \" 'relevant[ly] similar\" to the facts of prior cases such that the analogy the government wishes the court to draw is valid. The government simply failed to do that here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   The majority opinion's resolution of this case also opens the door to the government obtaining the general warrants the Framers feared. In particular, it opens the home-\"first among equals\" when it \"comes to the Fourth Amendment\"-to sweeping governmental searches based on a single click of a URL by an Internet user, regardless of whether the government adduces facts indicating that the user intended to navigate to the URL's illicit content.\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12696458\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/1/#p6\">\n    569 U.S. at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12696458\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/1/#p6\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Several hypotheticals illustrate the dangerous scope of the majority opinion's holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Suppose, for example, that a businessperson is conducting Internet research related to her business when a pop-up suddenly appears stating that her computer has a virus and that she should \"Click here\" to start the computer's clean-up process. Thinking the pop-up window was generated by her computer's anti-virus program, she clicks the link and navigates to a URL hosted by a widely used file sharing service, like File Sharing Site, where, upon entry of a password, a user can download child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Or consider that Grandma receives an email from what appears to be a close friend. The email contains the following sentence \"Click HERE for my favorite knitting website.\" The word \"HERE\" is a hyperlink, appearing to direct Grandma to that knitting website. Grandma hovers her mouse over the word \"HERE,\" which reveals the URL. But given the URL's random alphanumeric string, it reveals nothing about its content. Believing that the URL navigates to the knitting website,\n   Grandma clicks \"HERE\" and is redirected to the same file sharing service URL encountered by the businessperson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Or consider a teenager who clicks an online post that purportedly links to the latest viral YouTube video. Unbeknownst to the teenager, the link has been spoofed to appear to look like a YouTube link. Clicking the link in fact takes the teenager to the same file sharing service URL encountered by the businessperson and Grandma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Or consider a college student who regularly visits a popular website devoted to adult pornography. A post in a discussion forum on the website includes a random alphanumeric URL, which the post says navigates to additional free pornographic images. The student clicks the link, which navigates the student's browser to the same file sharing URL encountered by the businessperson, Grandma, and the teenager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   In each of these hypotheticals, also suppose that the same day, independently of each individual's innocent navigation to the URL, a post on a known child pornography site, like Bulletin Board A, included that same URL. The timing of the post on the child pornography site is irrelevant-it could have appeared before or after the businessperson, Grandma, the teenager, or the college student navigated to the File Sharing Site URL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Under the majority's opinion, in each of these hypothetical scenarios, the government would be able to obtain a search warrant to conduct an invasive search of each individual's home and electronic devices for evidence of wrongdoing. Like the instant case,\n   <em>\n    no additional fact\n   </em>\n   in these hypotheticals demonstrates the businessperson's, Grandma's, the teenager's, or the college student's intention either to access the child pornography site or child pornography, and\n   <em>\n    no limiting fact\n   </em>\n   reduces the countervailing innocent probabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Contrary to the majority's wholly unsupported speculation that the \"likelihood that a specific filesharing page containing child pornography would find its way to somebody uninterested in such contraband ... is probably quite low,\" these hypotheticals are not far-fetched.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 327-28;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Robert Siciliano,\n   <em>\n    Why Is Child Pornography on Your PC?\n   </em>\n   , HuffPost (Dec. 6, 2017), https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-is-childpornography_b_356539?

A single click of a URL, absent any further factual evidence circumscribing the universe of paths through which someone\n   using Defendant's IP address could have encountered and navigated to that URL-nearly all of which have no relation to Bulletin Board A-is insufficient to establish probable cause.
