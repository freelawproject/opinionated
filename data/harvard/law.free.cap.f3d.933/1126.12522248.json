The policy statement applicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\"U.S.S.G.\") \u00a7 1B1.10, authorizes a sentence reduction if, but only if, the retroactive amendment has the \"effect of lowering the defendant's applicable [G]uideline[s] range.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Applying this policy statement, a district court determines whether the Guidelines range is lowered by calculating the \"amended [G]uideline[s] range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the [relevant amendment] to the [G]uidelines ... had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454872,3641961\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/817/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   But that determination may not be the end of a district court's inquiry into eligibility for sentence reduction.

The defendants' original terms of imprisonment were therefore calculated according to the Guidelines' drug quantity table, which determines the base offense level for drug-related offenses according to drug type and weight. In 2014, the U.S. Sentencing Commission adopted Amendment 782, which revised the Guidelines' drug quantity table by reducing the base offense level for most drugs and quantities by two levels.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. supp. app. C amend. 782 (Nov. 1, 2014); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c).

The assigned district courts denied the sentence reduction motions, concluding that the defendants were categorically ineligible under \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) because downward variances or departures at the time of sentencing had resulted in original terms of imprisonment below the amended Guidelines range. The district courts further concluded that the defendants were not eligible for \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B)'s limited exception, as their downward variances or departures had not been based on substantial assistance to authorities.

As noted previously, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) commands otherwise; it permits policy statements to render a defendant ineligible for sentence reduction. In other words, the statute permits a sentence reduction when both of the following conditions are true-(A) the original term was \"based on\" a sentencing range that is later reduced;\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (B) the reduction is consistent with the U.S. Sentencing Commission's policy statements. The problem in\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   was that (A) was not true; the problem here is that (B) is not true.
