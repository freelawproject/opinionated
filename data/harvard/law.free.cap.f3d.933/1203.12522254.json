The EEOC exercised those powers when it sought information from Centura, a multi-facility healthcare organization operating primarily in Colorado. Between February 2011 and October 2014, eleven current or former Centura employees, working across eight Colorado locations, filed charges of discrimination with the EEOC. They alleged that Centura violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") by terminating their employment or refusing to allow them to return to work after medical leave. These employment decisions were allegedly made because of their disabilities or their requests for accommodations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After receiving the first charge in February 2011, the EEOC requested information from Centura related to that charge, including the employee's personnel file and a list of all positions Centura had open at the time her employment ended. Centura provided the information. After three more charges had been filed, the EEOC informed Centura that its \"investigation may include like and related allegations by other\n   aggrieved individuals involving bases and/or issues not directly affecting the Charging Party, as well as those like and related issues not alleged in the charge.\" The EEOC asked Centura for information about all employees from January 2009 through the date of the request in February 2012 who had \"requested and/or who were placed on non-[Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") ]\" or FMLA leave, or who had requested an accommodation for their disability. Centura responded that the request was overbroad and unduly burdensome and asked the EEOC to narrow the scope of its request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A month later, the EEOC sent Centura an identical request identifying multiple charges as the objects of its investigation. Centura provided some of the requested information but argued some requests were irrelevant to the charges at issue and contended the cases involved \"unique and isolated circumstances at separate locations\" that did not suggest a pattern of discrimination that might justify the EEOC's broad request. As the remainder of the eleven charges were filed, the EEOC sent Centura more requests for information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Centura provided information regarding each charging party but refused to provide further information, arguing the requests sought information irrelevant to the individual charges and were overly burdensome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The EEOC issued an administrative subpoena in December 2014. Subpoena items 9 and 18(e) requested identifying information for each employee who worked at the same facilities in Colorado as the eleven charging parties and who, between August 2009 and 2014, requested an accommodation due to a medical condition (item 9) or were identified as disabled (item 18(e)). Item 9 requested information about the identified employees' accommodation requests, the outcome of those requests, and any disciplinary action or separation from employment. Item 18(e) requested for each identified employee the type of medical condition at issue and information about discipline or separation from employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Centura petitioned the EEOC to revoke or modify the subpoena. The EEOC denied the petition and directed Centura to provide the requested information. Centura refused, so the EEOC filed a subpoena-enforcement action in the district court. Centura challenged only parts of the subpoena, including items 9 and 18(e), arguing that compliance would be unduly burdensome and that the information sought was not relevant to the eleven individual charges within the meaning of \u00a7 2000e-8(a). It alleged the information would only be relevant to a pattern-or-practice investigation, but the EEOC had not filed a pattern-or-practice charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court issued an order enforcing the subpoena in part. The court ordered Centura to provide information it did not object to and ruled against Centura regarding the relevance of the information requested in items 9 and 18(e). The court determined the disputed information was relevant within the meaning of \u00a7 2000e-8(a), \"given the number of ADA charges the EEOC has received and the widespread geographic distribution of those charges.\" The court noted that relevance is \"generously construed\" and that \"it is crucial that the Commission's ability to investigate charges of systemic discrimination not be impaired.\" It referred the undue burden question to a magistrate judge, who concluded producing information related to items 9 and 18(e) would not be unduly burdensome and declined to take up Centura's contention that the information was not relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court overruled Centura's objections to the magistrate judge's undue burden decision. The court construed Centura's objections in part as a motion to reconsider the earlier ruling regarding relevance and determined this argument lacked merit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court therefore ordered Centura to comply with the magistrate judge's order. Centura appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Centura now challenges only the district court's relevance determination, not its undue burden ruling.

Centura contends the only common theme tying the requested information to the eleven individual charges is the broad fact that all the charges alleged disability discrimination. Relatedly, Centura distinguishes cases the EEOC relies on where pattern-or-practice evidence was held relevant to individual charges, pointing out that each case related to the investigation of a policy more specific than some generic form of discrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Centura's representations\n   of the disparate factual nature of the eleven charges is largely accurate, and we agree with the distinctions it draws regarding the EEOC's cases.
