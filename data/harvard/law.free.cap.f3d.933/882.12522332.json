It operates as an institutional over-the-counter, foreign-exchange liquidity provider and engages solely in transactions with other eligible contract participants such as financial institutions or highly capitalized trading counterparts. Because of the nature of Effex's trading, it is not subject to regulation by the NFA and is therefore not a member of the NFA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In accordance with its responsibilities under the Commodity Exchange Act, the NFA initiated an investigation into an association member, FXCM, and found that the company had engaged in several practices that violate the NFA's rules. FXCM chose to settle with the NFA, and on February 6, 2017, the NFA released several documents related to the settlement (collectively, the \"FXCM Settlement Documents\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   These documents include: (1) a complaint setting forth the NFA's allegations against FXCM; (2) a decision by the NFA Business Conduct Committee finding that FXCM committed the violations outlined in the complaint and detailing the terms of a settlement between the NFA and FXCM; (3) a publicly accessible narrative summarizing the decision; and (4) a press release announcing the decision and directing the public to the narrative posted on the NFA's website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The NFA's complaint against FXCM alleged that FXCM failed to comply with a litany of NFA rules. More pertinently, the NFA claimed that Effex was involved in the misconduct allegedly committed by FXCM. The resulting decision outlined the allegations in the complaint, including those involving Effex, and accepted them as true. The accompanying narrative summarized the decision, including its statements about Effex. The press release, although it did not specifically reference Effex, noted that FXCM committed numerous deceptive and abusive actions and directed the public to the narrative on the NFA's website. Effex alleges that the NFA's findings in the FXCM Settlement Documents are false and that their publication is defamatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although its investigation into FXCM implicated Effex, the NFA did not contact Effex or provide Effex with notice of the investigation. The CFTC, on the other hand, conducted its own investigation into FXCM. As part of its investigation, the Commission subpoenaed documents from Effex and took the deposition of Mr. Dittami and other Effex employees. Effex alleges that the NFA obtained documents necessary for its investigation from the CFTC despite Effex's request that its responses as a third party be kept confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On the same day that the NFA announced its settlement with FXCM, the\n   CFTC issued its own decision about FXCM and its business practices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   It determined that FXCM had concealed an improper trading relationship with a \"high-frequency trader\" and a company the trader formed (which the Commission termed \"HFT Co\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although not explicitly named, the HFT Co is Effex. The CFTC found materially the same facts as the NFA did regarding Effex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Effex did not seek review of either the NFA's decision or the Commission's decision regarding FXCM. Rather, four months after the decisions were released, Effex filed this action against the NFA in the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On July 31, 2017, Effex brought this action against the NFA. In its federal claims, Effex alleges that the NFA violated its due process rights by not providing it with notice of the investigation or an opportunity for a hearing before the publication of the FXCM Settlement Documents. The federal claims further submit that the NFA denied Effex due process of law when it did not allow Effex access to a post-deprivation remedy. In its state-law claims, Effex alleges that the statements about it in the FXCM Settlement Documents, published by the NFA, were defamatory. Additionally, Effex alleged business tort claims and a claim under the Illinois Trade Secrets Act, 765 Ill. Comp. Stat. 1065\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Effex sought injunctive relief, asking for an order requiring the NFA to remove the FXCM Settlement Documents from its website, to delete all references to Effex, or, alternatively, to provide Effex with a \"name clearing hearing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   It further requested an order compelling the NFA to \"issue a new press release stating: (a) NFA did not make any findings against Effex or Dittami; (b) Effex was not a de facto dealing desk of FXCM; (c) Effex was not controlled by FXCM; and (d) FXCM was not ordered to make any customer restitution.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Effex also asked for money damages of $10,000,000 for lost profits and to redress its constitutional injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The NFA moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to the federal claims, it submitted that dismissal was proper because there is no federal\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy and Effex had not exhausted its administrative claims under the Commodity Exchange Act. As for the state-law claims, the NFA contended that all were preempted by the Commodity Exchange Act. Finally, it claimed absolute immunity from any damages because the claims were based on its disciplinary proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The district court held that Effex failed to exhaust its remedies under the Commodity Exchange Act and dismissed without prejudice. The district court determined that the Commodity Exchange Act provides a statutorily mandated exhaustion requirement and that Effex had four avenues to pursue relief under the scheme. First, it found that Effex could have petitioned the CFTC to exercise its authority under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2021\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(2) to review the FXCM Settlement\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   because the statute permits the Commission to review an NFA decision \"on its motion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267119\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/1268/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 21(h)(2). Second, relying on the CFTC's decision in\n   <em>\n    Paribas Futures, Inc. v. New York Mercantile Exchange\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=CFTC%20No.%2090-E\">\n    CFTC No. 90-E\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1990%20WL%20282868\">\n    1990 WL 282868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Mar. 22, 1990),\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   the district court decided that if Commission review under \u00a7 21(h)(2) is only available to aggrieved parties, Effex could have intervened to become a party under the relevant regulations. Third, citing\n   <em>\n    In re Petition of Lake Shore Alternative Financial Asset Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , CFTC No. CRAA-07-03,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202751884\">\n    2007 WL 2751884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Sept. 17, 2007),\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   the district court noted that the CFTC had previously suggested that a nonparty could ask the Commission to waive its rules so that the nonparty could obtain CFTC review, but Effex had not made such a request. Finally, the district court determined that Effex could have turned to the Administrative Procedure Act and petitioned the CFTC to revise its rules generally to permit Commission review in such instances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The district court rejected Effex's argument that any resort to the Commodity Exchange Act's remedies would have been impossible or futile. It noted that the CFTC had the ability to adjudicate due process claims. Moreover, the court acknowledged that even though the Commission rarely reviews NFA settlements, it previously had reviewed settlements. Finally, observing that Effex's claims \"touch on the contents of the NFA Publications-documents generated as a result of the NFA investigation relating to a disciplinary action,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   the district court rejected Effex's contention that it was not seeking review of an NFA disciplinary action but rather merely was seeking a court order regarding the publication of the FXCM Settlement Documents containing the alleged defamatory statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Therefore, the district court dismissed Effex's Complaint. It did so without prejudice to any rights Effex might have to pursue its remedies before the CFTC and then to seek further review of those exhausted claims in the appropriate court of appeals. Having dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, the court also denied Effex's motion for a preliminary injunction as moot. Effex timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We now turn to the merits of this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, we address whether Effex has a federal cause of action. The comprehensive nature of the federal regulatory scheme, as set forth above, grounded in the language and structure of the statute, makes clear that, in fashioning the disciplinary provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act, Congress certainly did not countenance a separate federal remedy,\n   much less a separate federal remedy fashioned by the judiciary. Indeed, Effex does not maintain that there is a specific federal cause of action to redress harm inflicted by an SRO upon one of its\n   <em>\n    members.\n   </em>\n   Rather, it asks that we imply a cause of action to remedy harm to a\n   <em>\n    nonmember\n   </em>\n   (such as Effex) resulting from an SRO proceeding. It casts this cause of action as one to remedy a due process violation under\n   <em>\n    Bivens v.

The enactment of the Commodity Exchange Act provides far more than a \"doubt\" about Congress's willingness to tolerate an alternate remedy to the comprehensive remedial structure of federal oversight by SROs found in the statute. In the Commodity Exchange Act, Congress has set forth, with significant precision, the remedies available to members of an SRO and to others. Indeed, in another\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   case, the Court has explained that, where Congress has exercised comprehensively its power to regulate, there is no room, or justification, for additional regulation through court-created causes of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schweiker v.

We do not believe, however, that the difference is so significant that such an entity can maintain a judicially created cause of action against the SRO for harms that the nonparty claims to have suffered as a result of disciplinary proceedings. Such a view presupposes a very narrow, and in our view\n   <em>\n    too\n   </em>\n   narrow, understanding of the scope of the Commodity Exchange Act.

Undoubtedly, a \"person aggrieved\" by an SRO's action always includes a party to the proceedings. And there may be circumstances where a nonparty may fall within the zone-of-interests of the statute and therefore have the right to seek redress before the CFTC.

The comprehensive way by which the Commodity Exchange Act deals with disciplinary proceedings before an SRO also raises the question as to whether Congress intended the scheme to be free from other remedial devices based on state law. We conclude that Congress did intend to preempt state-tort claims such as the ones brought in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The general principles governing the preemption of state law can be stated succinctly. Preemption is most obvious, of course, when the federal statute expressly commands it and defines the scope of such a preemptive effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pac. Gas &amp; Elec.

Effex claims, in essence, that the NFA improperly conducted its disciplinary proceedings. It does not matter whether Effex is a member or nonmember of the NFA or a party or nonparty to the proceedings.
