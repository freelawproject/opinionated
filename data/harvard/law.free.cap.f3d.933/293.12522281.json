Romansky of car theft-related crimes. Over the decades his case wound its way through the Pennsylvania courts and eventually generated this federal\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   petition in the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The District Court denied Romansky's lengthy, multifaceted petition in full and declined to grant a certificate of appealability. We did grant a certificate of appealability as to two claims related to an alleged discrepancy between the charging documents and the jury instructions at Romansky's trial over three decades past. But because we conclude that this petition is not timely as to the undisturbed events at that first trial, and are unpersuaded by his other claims, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   One Pennsylvania court described this case as a \"procedural quagmire.\" We have no quibble with that portrayal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Steven Romansky came under suspicion in 1985 for his involvement in an auto theft ring in northeastern Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth convened an investigative grand jury, and in May 1985 it issued Presentment No. 33. The Presentment recommended charges against Romansky, among others, that included receiving stolen property under 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3925, conspiracy under 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 903, removal or falsification of identification numbers under 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7102(b), dealing in vehicles with removed or falsified numbers under 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7103(b), dealing in titles and plates for stolen vehicles under 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7111, and false application for certificate of title or registration under 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7121. (The presentment stated that it recommended bringing charges \"including, but not limited to[,] the listed offenses.\") In late August 1985 the Commonwealth filed a criminal complaint leveling the same slate of charges against Romansky. They included three counts of each offense (except false application for certificate of title or registration), with each count pertaining to a different vehicle: a 1977 Pontiac Trans-Am Firebird, a 1979 Ford Bronco, and a 1977 GMC truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As the proceedings continued, the substantive offenses remained intact, but the conspiracy charges changed. At a preliminary hearing in September 1985, two of the three conspiracy counts were dismissed, and notes from the hearing indicate that the remaining count-dealing with the Pontiac-was amended to conspiracy to receive stolen property. In December 1985, however, a criminal information formally charged Romansky with conspiracy to commit dealing in vehicles with removed or falsified identification\n   numbers and/or theft. This information was the operative charging document at the time of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May 1987 the case proceeded to trial on the conspiracy charge for the Pontiac and on the substantive charges for all three cars. The jury acquitted Romanksy as to each charge relating to the GMC truck, but convicted on most others dealing with the Pontiac and the Bronco. Importantly for our purposes, he was convicted on the conspiracy charge, which the jury instructions described as \"conspiracy to deal in vehicles with removed or falsified numbers and/or theft.\" In explaining the elements of this charge, however, the trial judge omitted the \"and/or theft\" component and stated only that the jury had to find that the defendant entered into an agreement with others to deal in vehicles with removed or falsified numbers. The verdict form indicated only that the jury found Romansky guilty of \"conspiracy\" with no elaboration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Romansky's sentence in 1987 was 9 to 18 years' total incarceration, including 2 to 4 years on the conspiracy charge. He appealed in state court, unsuccessfully, and then brought a state post-conviction claim. Among other things, he alleged that the evidence was insufficient to show conspiracy to deal in vehicles with removed or falsified numbers; and in responding to this argument the Commonwealth noted that the charge had been changed to conspiracy to receive stolen property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ten years after the trial, the Pennsylvania Superior Court ultimately ruled that the Commonwealth had unlawfully used false testimony and therefore vacated Romansky's convictions as to the Bronco, but\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   as to the Pontiac-and therefore not including the conspiracy charge as to the latter. Romansky was retried on the vacated charges in January 2000, again resulting in conviction on all of those counts. Two months later he received the same sentence on each of the counts as in 1987-9 to 18 years in total, including 2 to 4 years on the conspiracy charge. Romansky later testified that he mentioned the discrepancy about the conspiracy charge to his counsel prior to his resentencing, and then asked to file a motion on the issue after the sentencing, but that his counsel did not raise the issue at any time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After resentencing, Romansky filed another direct appeal, and the Superior Court affirmed in June 2001. He did not seek allowance of appeal from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Instead, he filed another state post-conviction petition in April 2001, while his direct appeal was still pending, as well as several addenda to the petition in April a year later. The post-conviction court dismissed the petition in June 2002, but the Superior Court vacated that order in September 2003, remanding with instructions to allow Romansky's newly appointed counsel to review the petition and file an amended version. His counsel ultimately filed that amendment in August 2008, but it was dismissed in July 2010, and again the Superior Court reversed in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court of Common Pleas appointed new counsel for Romansky, and immediately she engaged in a flurry of activity that included a Motion to Vacate Illegal Sentence as to the conspiracy charge. At oral argument on this motion, the Commonwealth's lawyer conceded that the jury was instructed on the wrong charge and thus did not oppose the motion. Yet the Court denied it, and in October 2013 denied all of Romansky's post-conviction claims. This time the Superior Court affirmed, and the Commonwealth Supreme Court denied allowance of appeal in February 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the meantime, Romansky had filed a federal\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   petition before the District\n   Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, which was held in abeyance while he proceeded to exhaust his state-court remedies. Once this was done and the federal petition litigated, the District Court denied Romansky's claims in full in a March 2017 order and denied a certificate of appealability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Romansky v. Folino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20810689\">\n    2017 WL 810689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Pa. 2017). A panel of our Court granted a certificate for two of the many issues raised in the petition: whether Romansky was convicted and sentenced for a crime with which he had not been charged-\"conspiracy to deal in vehicles with falsified identification numbers and/or theft\" instead of \"conspiracy to receive stolen property\"-and whether his lawyer during the 2000 resentencing had been ineffective for failing to raise this issue. We also asked the parties to address whether the first claim is timely under\n   <em>\n    Magwood v. Patterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644480,12455282\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/320/\">\n    561 U.S. 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644480,12455282\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/320/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644480,12455282\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/320/\">\n    177 L.Ed.2d 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).

United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167188\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/361/212/\">\n    361 U.S. 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167188\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/361/212/\">\n    80 S.Ct. 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167188\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/361/212/\">\n    4 L.Ed.2d 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1960), that an indictment cannot be amended or enlarged except by a grand jury. Although creative, this argument is not supported by any authority and is inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Hurtado\n   </em>\n   . The reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Stirone\n   </em>\n   depends on the fact that, in the federal system, no one may be tried for a crime except as charged by a grand jury. Naturally, then, an indictment cannot be modified at trial to include new crimes without going back to the grand jury. But state governments, including the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, are under no obligation to charge through a grand jury, and there is nothing offensive about trying a defendant for crimes some of which were charged by a grand jury and some of which were not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Romansky also seeks an expanded certificate of appealability for his claim that the Commonwealth violated his right under\n   <em>\n    Brady v.

If so, his current\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   petition is timely as to the events of that trial. But the question we have is slightly different from the one left open in\n   <em>\n    Magwood\n   </em>\n   . There the issue was whether, when a defendant is resentenced on a given charge (such as capital murder), the new judgment includes the underlying conviction as well as the sentence. Here it is whether, where some but not all counts of conviction are disturbed on appeal or in post-conviction proceedings, the defendant's eventual resentencing is a new judgment as to the undisturbed counts of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We conclude the answer is no. The sentence imposed in 2000 after retrial was not a new judgment on the undisturbed counts of conviction. This is plain from considering a counterfactual (that is, hypothetical) in which Romansky was acquitted on all charges during the retrial for the vacated counts. In that case there would have been no new sentence: instead he would simply have continued serving out his sentence on the undisturbed counts. Romansky conceded at oral argument that in this scenario the time limits for filing his federal\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   petition would not have been reset in 2000. If an acquittal at retrial would not change the undisturbed conviction, Romansky's argument that a conviction should have such an effect is illogical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Nor did the 2000 sentencing order impose a new sentence as to the undisturbed counts. Instead it imposed sentences for the charges on retrial, and then stated that they would \"run consecutively to the sentence imposed on [the undisturbed counts] on December 17, 1987.\" Potentially the result could be different in a court system using the \"sentencing package\" doctrine, where a trial court will undertake a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   resentencing as to all counts of conviction if any count is vacated on appeal, under the theory that the sentencing judge would \"craft a disposition in which the sentences on the various counts form part of an overall plan.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522164\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/594/172/#p180\">\n    594 F.3d 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 180 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In that case the resentencing might constitute a new judgment as to every count of conviction, at least if we were to follow the majority approach to the open question in\n   <em>\n    Magwood\n   </em>\n   . Here, however, the Pennsylvania courts imposed separate sentences for each count and conducted only a \"limited\" resentencing after the retrial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522164\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/594/172/#p180\">\n    594 F.3d at 179-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining the concept of \"limited resentencing\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In summary, we conclude that Romansky's\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   petition was not timely as to the conspiracy conviction at his 1987 trial because the petition was not filed within one year of the conclusion of his state post-conviction\n   process and because the 2000 resentencing did not impose a new judgment as to the undisturbed counts of conviction (including the conspiracy charge). Accordingly, we affirm the District Court's dismissal of Romansky's claim that he was denied due process by the purported discrepancy between the charging documents and the jury instructions as to the nature of the conspiracy charge against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Romansky Was Not Denied the Effective Assistance of Counsel.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Romansky also asserts he was denied the effective assistance of counsel when his lawyer during the 2000 retrial and resentencing refused to raise the issue of the 1987 conspiracy-charge discrepancy despite repeated requests that he do so. Because this pertains to events in 2000, it is undoubtedly timely. We nonetheless conclude that Romansky is not entitled to\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance, a defendant must show (1) deficient performance and (2) prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 687,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984).

Horn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076917\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/485/103/#p127\">\n    485 F.3d 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 127 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 688, 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). To award Romansky relief on his ineffectiveness claim, we would need to conclude that his lawyer behaved unreasonably by failing to raise this issue at the time of the resentencing and that, had he done so, Romansky likely would have obtained relief (or at least that this was reasonably possible).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Here, Romansky's ineffectiveness claim fails because the conspiracy charge was not at issue during the 2000 retrial, but only those counts of conviction the Superior Court had vacated in 1997. There was no basis for Romansky's counsel to raise any argument related to that conviction during the retrial. Moreover, we doubt Romansky would have been afforded any relief had he done so. Thus his counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the issue, and in any event that failure may not have prejudiced Romansky.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   To the extent he claims that his counsel during the retrial was ineffective for failing to file a post-conviction claim on his behalf challenging the conspiracy conviction, it is well established that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not extend to post-conviction proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania v. Finley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218288\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/551/\">\n    481 U.S. 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218288\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/551/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218288\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/551/\">\n    95 L.Ed.2d 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). Rather it extends only to trial and \"to the first appeal of right.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 555,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218288\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/551/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This claim of ineffective assistance would therefore fail as a threshold matter, as Romansky had no constitutional right to the assistance of counsel in filing such a collateral attack on his conspiracy conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Though the history of this case is lengthy and convoluted, the question before us is ultimately quite simple. Romansky was convicted in 1987 and, after some but not all counts of conviction were vacated, retried and again convicted on those counts in 2000. Romansky now believes he has found an error in the 1987 trial regarding the conspiracy charge that was never vacated. So did the retrial and resentencing in 2000 gave him another bite at the apple to raise this issue in a federal\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   petition? We think not. The new sentence imposed in 2000 was not a new\n   judgment on the undisturbed counts of conviction from the 1987 trial. Therefore, neither\n   <em>\n    Magwood\n   </em>\n   nor any of its possible implications apply to our case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Accordingly, Romansky's principal claim-that he was deprived of due process by the discrepancy between the conspiracy charge as described in the charging documents and the charge as presented to the jury-is not properly before us because his\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   petition was not timely filed as to events pertaining to his 1987 trial. His ancillary claim of ineffective assistance fails because the conspiracy conviction was not at issue during the 2000 retrial. And his request that we expand our certificate of appealability fails, as his claim under the Grand Jury Clause is foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent from the Nineteenth Century and he has not made a substantial showing as to his\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Thus we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Believe it or not, Romansky is still in custody.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Additionally, the Fifth Circuit has taken a more nuanced position.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Lampton\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716406\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/585/#p588\">\n     667 F.3d 585\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 588-89 (5th Cir. 2012). There, it seemed to acknowledge that, under\n    <em>\n     Magwood\n    </em>\n    , a petition would not be second or successive if a new sentence has been imposed for an undisturbed conviction. But because Lampton's prior petition, successfully challenging one of his convictions under the Double Jeopardy Clause, had merely resulted in having that conviction vacated with no change in the sentence for any other count of conviction, the Court held that there had been no such intervening judgment. Thus it appears that the Fifth Circuit largely agrees with the majority rule, although it may take a narrower view of when a new judgment has been imposed than, for example, the Second Circuit in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3791008\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/41/#p46\">\n     623 F.3d at 45-46\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (finding that an amended judgment had been entered on all counts of conviction in essentially identical circumstances to\n    <em>\n     Lampton\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
