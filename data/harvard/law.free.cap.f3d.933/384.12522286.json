We previously affirmed the district court's denial of his request under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203599\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) for investigatory funding because he had not shown a \"substantial need\" that made the funds \"reasonably necessary\" to the representation. The Supreme Court held the statute does not require a showing of \"substantial need\" and remanded with instructions to consider only whether funding is \"reasonably necessary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We conclude that investigatory funding is not reasonably necessary because nothing would establish the ineffectiveness of state-habeas counsel, a gateway requirement for him to overcome the procedural default of his claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present certain mitigating evidence of substance abuse and mental illness. AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 1997, Carlos Manuel Ayestas was convicted of murdering Santiaga Paneque, a 67-year-old Houston woman, after he and two accomplices broke into her home one morning. Paneque's son discovered her body when he returned home for lunch. He testified at sentencing that it had been important to his mother that he become a United States citizen, and that he had wanted her at his naturalization ceremony, which occurred two days after her death. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Ayestas's conviction and death sentence in 1998; that court denied his application for a writ of habeas corpus in 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We have previously described in detail Ayestas's federal-habeas proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Ayestas v.

We explain here some recent developments. In 2014, the district court denied Ayestas's federal habeas application as well as his\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   motion for additional investigatory funding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203599\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). With respect to the Section 3599(f) motion, the district court recited then-controlling precedent that Ayestas was required to show a \"substantial need\" for investigative assistance, as well as the statutory requirement that the assistance be \"reasonably necessary\" to the representation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Section 3599(f) Motion for Investigatory Funding\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district court denied the Section 3599(f) motion for these reasons: Ayestas \"fail[ed] to demonstrate that [1] trial counsel was deficient, [2] that there [was] a reasonable probability that his claimed evidence of substance abuse would have changed the outcome of either his trial or his state habeas corpus proceeding, or [3] that his state habeas counsel was ineffective.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Whether the district court's reliance on the first two reasons abused its discretion under the standard described in the Supreme Court's\n   <em>\n    Ayestas\n   </em>\n   decision are close questions because of the district court's emphasis on\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   as opposed to\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   evidence. The district court's third reason for denying funding was that state-habeas counsel was not ineffective. Ayestas must establish that his state-habeas counsel was ineffective to overcome the procedural default of claims based on failures to present mitigating evidence of substance abuse and mental illness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trevino v.

If the district court's assessment of effectiveness is valid, then the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying funding regardless of any potential error in the other stated reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We previously concluded that Ayestas's state-habeas counsel was not constitutionally ineffective.\n   <em>\n    Ayestas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812670\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/888/#p892\">\n    817 F.3d at 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Ayestas's counsel pursued that evidence. In fact, just a year before the state-habeas application was filed, we explicitly characterized an ineffective assistance claim \"for failing to present mitigating lay testimony from family or friends\" as a \"stronger argument\" than a claim premised on \"failing to locate an expert who would conclude that [the defendant] was retarded or suffered from mental illness.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Ayestas's state-habeas counsel, J. Gary Hart, has never been publicly disciplined for any reason. In December 1998, eleven months after being appointed, Ayestas's state-habeas counsel filed a 70-page application for relief raising several constitutional claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Claims 1-10\n   </em>\n   . That ten distinct actions or omissions by Ayestas's trial counsel, including the failure to present mitigating evidence, each denied Ayestas effective assistance in violation of the Sixth Amendment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Claims 11-13\n   </em>\n   . That the failure to inform Ayestas of his right, under an international treaty, to consult with the Honduran Consul prevented him from presenting mitigating evidence in violation the Eighth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Sixth Amendment's compulsory process clause;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Claims 14-15\n   </em>\n   . That the state knowingly presented false testimony from a witness at the guilt phase of the trial in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and at the punishment phase in violation of the Eighth Amendment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Claim 16\n   </em>\n   . That the state suppressed impeachment evidence in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Hart did not merely repeat claims raised in the direct appeal. In fact, there is virtually no overlap between them. Hart's independent efforts are also represented in the extra-record evidence that he developed and attached to the initial state-habeas application, which included affidavits from a forensic pathologist, Ayestas himself, three of Ayestas's family members, and one of the jurors that sentenced Ayestas to death, as well as documents from the Honduran government and a letter from an independent fingerprint examiner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In summary, state-habeas counsel raised ten ineffective assistance of trial counsel (\"IATC\") claims, including multiple claims premised on a failure to present certain mitigating evidence. Specifically, state-habeas counsel argued that Ayestas was prejudiced by the failure to present mitigating testimony from family members that he had no criminal record in Honduras and that he had lived a normal life. In other words, this claim was the\n   <em>\n    opposite\n   </em>\n   of what would likely be shown by evidence of mental illness and substance abuse, which as mentioned already had little support in the case law at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The omission of these claims was not because state-habeas counsel was unaware of the mental illness and substance abuse. State-habeas counsel had access to the psychological and disciplinary records subpoenaed by trial counsel's investigator. That trial investigator provided Ayestas with a questionnaire, and state-habeas counsel had Ayestas's responses where he identified a history of head traumas and \"admitted to drinking alcohol since he was 16 years old and to doing cocaine at least once a week, which became more frequent as he slipped into the grips of addiction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Despite the relative novelty of mitigation specialists,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   state-habeas counsel hired one\n   shortly after being appointed. That specialist advised:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   It is clear the defendant had a history of substance abuse. What we know from reviewing the trial evidence is that Ayestas probably abused heroine and/or cocaine while in California: that he had what appeared to be a drug-related run-in with alleged victim Martinez in Houston days after this murder, and that he had gotten so drunk he \"passed out\" on the day of his arrest. Would there have been a defense to his conduct due to some sort of addiction? We should look at substance abuse as mitigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Hart commented in his handwritten notes: \"Ayestas's drinking and/or drug consumption as a possible mitigating fact. How could this have been developed at trial?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Prior to filing the initial state-habeas application, Hart requested investigatory funding based on his mitigation specialist's recommendations that he estimated would cost $15,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, recognizing an existing \"policy to authorize no more than $2,500.00 for investigative expenses to begin with,\" Hart requested only that amount. The state court granted only $1,500. State-habeas counsel managed to obtain only an additional $1,000 in investigatory funding before he filed the initial application, after which further requests were denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.

They document that Ayestas was examined on September 22, 2000, at which time he complained of delusions that inmates could read his mind. The handwritten notes also indicate that Ayestas \"report[ed] no psy problems until 2 months ago.\" In other words, there is evidence that he did not begin exhibiting any symptoms of schizophrenia until July 2000.

After meeting with Ayestas, Ambassador Hugo Pino told Hart he believed that Ayestas was delusional. In May 2003, in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. Virginia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255406\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/304/\">\n    536 U.S. 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255406\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/304/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255406\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/304/\">\n    153 L.Ed.2d 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002), Hart arranged for a psychologist to evaluate Ayestas's intellectual status. The psychologist concluded that there was no evidence of mental retardation but did express concerns about his mental state and delusional thinking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   While this evaluation concluded there was not a viable\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   claim, state-habeas counsel nonetheless leveraged it to support the IATC claim premised on the failure to present evidence Ayestas was only guilty of lesser included felony murder. State-habeas counsel used the psychologist's finding that Ayestas was not intellectually disabled to support his argument that trial counsel should have called Ayestas to testify. State-habeas counsel filed the psychologist's letter in the habeas proceedings but redacted the discussion of Ayestas's delusional thinking. Delusional thinking, of course, was arguably inconsistent with state-habeas counsel's attempt to portray Ayestas as a viable witness who should have been called at trial. Ayestas was formally diagnosed with schizophrenia in October 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   State-habeas counsel cannot have been ineffective for failing to investigate mental illness because the record establishes that there \"was nothing to\n   <em>\n    factually\n   </em>\n   put counsel on notice of any reasonable likelihood that any such condition existed\" at trial or when the state-habeas application was filed.\n   <em>\n    West v.

This is not a\n   <em>\n    Wiggins\n   </em>\n   fact-pattern.
