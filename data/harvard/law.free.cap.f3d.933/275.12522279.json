The question presented is whether that seal violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Consistent with the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    American Legion v. American Humanist Association\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620544\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2067/\">\n    139 S.

Although the record contains no evidence of the three Commissioners' contemporaneous understandings of the imagery used in the seal, Commissioner Harry D. Hertzog, who designed and voted for the seal, explained two years later: \"in center of Shield appears the huge cross in canary-yellow signifying Christianity and the God-fearing people which are the foundation and backbone of our County.\" App. 99. This appears to be the only available explanation of the cross's initial inclusion in the seal. The cross is partially obscured by a depiction of the Lehigh County Courthouse and surrounded by many other symbols representing the County's history, patriotism, culture, and economy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Appendix A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The seal appears on County-owned property and on various government documents, as well as on the County's website, so Lehigh County residents encounter it regularly. The Freedom from Religion Foundation (FFRF) wrote to the County in November 2014 to complain about the seal and request its use be discontinued-the first such complaint in the seal's history. After a series of meetings and attempts to gather information about the seal, the Board of Commissioners voted unanimously to retain the seal in March 2015. Responding to FFRF by letter, the County stated the cross's \"presence ... on the seal among all the other items of historical significance has the secular purpose of recognizing the history of the County\" and \"honor[s] the original settlers of Lehigh County who were Christian.\" App. 310. The present-day Board did not know why the 1944 Commissioners decided to include the cross, and interpreted Hertzog's 1946 statement to mean the cross-like other symbols on the seal-represented \"elements that were important to the early settlers\" of Lehigh County. App. 266-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   FFRF and four of its members who reside in Lehigh County filed this lawsuit in 2016. After both parties moved for summary judgment, the District Court denied the County's motion and granted FFRF's. It found the seal unconstitutional under the\n   <em>\n    Lemon\n   </em>\n   test as modified by the endorsement test, after asking whether the cross lacked a secular purpose and whether a reasonable observer would perceive it as an endorsement of religion.\n   <em>\n    Freedom from Religion Found., Inc. v.

The District Court explained in dicta that although FFRF's claim would fail under the Establishment Clause as originally understood, the Court was obliged to apply the\n   <em>\n    Lemon\n   </em>\n   -endorsement test despite its shortcomings. The County timely appealed, but after oral argument we held the case pending resolution of\n   <em>\n    American Legion\n   </em>\n   and then asked the parties to provide supplemental briefing based on that decision. We now hold that\n   <em>\n    Lemon\n   </em>\n   does not apply to \"religious references or imagery in public monuments, symbols, mottos, displays, and ceremonies\" like the seal.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620544\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2067/\">\n    139 S.

It argues that the facts of this case show\n   <em>\n    American Legion\n   </em>\n   's presumption does not apply and, even if it did, the presumption is overcome. Neither argument proves availing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On the first point,\n   <em>\n    American Legion\n   </em>\n   held that the presumption applies to longstanding symbols just like the Lehigh County seal. What's more, the Supreme Court's four considerations for applying a presumption of constitutionality to the Bladensburg Peace Cross apply equally here. For these reasons, we begin our evaluation of the Lehigh County seal with \"a strong presumption of constitutionality\" for this longstanding symbol.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620544\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2067/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620544\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2067/\">\n    at 2085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   And on the second, it's clear on the record in this case that Plaintiffs have not overcome the presumption. The evidence does not show the sort of \"discriminatory intent\" in maintaining a symbol or \"deliberate[ ] disrespect[ ]\" in a design itself that\n   <em>\n    American Legion\n   </em>\n   suggested could overcome the presumption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620544\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2067/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620544\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2067/\">\n    at 2074, 2089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    American Legion\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that the presumption applies to all \"established, religiously expressive monuments, symbols, and practices.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620544\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2067/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620544\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2067/\">\n    at 2085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Lehigh County's seal checks those boxes. It was adopted almost 75 years ago, so it is established. It depicts a Latin cross, so it is religiously expressive. And it represents the County and its government, so it is a symbol. Satisfying these three conditions triggers the \"strong presumption of constitutionality.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620544\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2067/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Moreover, although none is required for the presumption to apply, all four of\n   <em>\n    American Legion\n   </em>\n   's considerations further confirm the presumption's applicability:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , 75 years after the seal's adoption, the only available evidence of original purpose is Commissioner Hertzog's statement made two years after the County adopted the seal.

The Supreme Court suggested that challengers could overcome the presumption by demonstrating a \"discriminatory intent in the selection of the design of the memorial or the decision of a [government body] to maintain it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620544\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2067/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620544\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2067/\">\n    at 2074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It focuses on the statement Commissioner Hertzog made two years after the seal was created. But his statement that \"Christianity and the God-fearing people ... are the foundation and backbone of our County,\" App. 99, does not, under\n   <em>\n    American Legion\n   </em>\n   , doom the cross's inclusion in perpetuity, because \"no matter what the original purpose[ ] for the [adoption of a symbol], a community may wish to preserve it for very different reasons.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

Here, the Board's intent in retaining the seal-to continue \"recognizing the history of the County,\" App. 310-was plainly non-discriminatory. Without evidence of \"discriminatory intent\" in the County's recent decision to maintain the seal or \"deliberate[ ] disrespect[ ]\" in the seal's design itself, the record compels the conclusion that FFRF and its members have not overcome\n   <em>\n    American Legion\n   </em>\n   's \"strong presumption of constitutionality.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620544\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2067/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620544\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2067/\">\n    at 2074, 2089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Our task turns on \"the ability and willingness to distinguish between real threat and mere shadow.\"\n   <em>\n    Sch.
