The privilege license application instructs potential entrepreneurs to coordinate with city planners to ensure\n   that their proposed locations and uses comply with zoning laws. Adam and Eve did not do so, and on January 25, 2018, the building inspector refused to issue a certificate of occupancy that is required to open a business. The City Attorney explained that \"the location chosen by the store requires them to apply for and receive a conditional use permit, based upon its zoning.\" JA 13. The permit could not issue because \"it does not meet the distance requirement from churches, daycares, and residential uses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174622\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/427/50/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Adam and Eve filed suit pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   alleging that the Act violated its First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights and similar Arkansas rights. The complaint asserted that the Act violated the First Amendment because it \"restrains the plaintiff's retail sale of merchandise, based on the content of the merchandise.\" JA 5. Adam and Eve highlighted it would not host on-site entertainment such as \"booths, stalls, or ... rooms for the on-premises viewing of movies\" or \"live adult entertainment or dancing of any sort.\" JA 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Arkansas intervened to defend the Act. The parties conducted limited discovery and stipulated to these facts: (1) Adam and Eve could open a store in the correct zoning area, (2) Adam and Eve would not sell pornographic DVDs, books, and magazines, (3) other Jonesboro stores, such as Walmart, sell regulated items like condoms, and (4) a nonparty retailer, Spencer's, opened prior to 2007 and its inventory contains less than 10% of such items. Adam and Eve also conceded that more than 30% of its revenue derived from regulated items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After a full day of argument, the district court ruled from the bench. The court concluded that intermediate scrutiny applied to Adam and Eve's First Amendment claim and held that, under\n   <em>\n    Renton\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Alameda Books,\n   </em>\n   the Act passed muster. Specifically, the court credited the legislature's focus on the secondary effects caused by adult businesses. Thus, it was \"quite reasonable and rational for a legislator to conclude that more of these kinds of [adult-oriented] businesses contribute or create the potential for more of the bad secondary effects.\" JA 181.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Turning to the vagueness challenge, the court rejected Adam and Eve's arguments that the Act was unconstitutional because it \"doesn't contain percentages, [and] it doesn't contain definitions of what [ ] a principal business purpose is.\" JA 139. According to Adam and Eve, the legislature must define it \"by floor space, gross revenue, net revenue, [or] amount in inventory.\" JA 141. The district court, however, interpreted the term's plain meaning as \"main or chief.\" JA 181. Although 10% of gross revenue from regulated products is not enough to qualify as a principal business purpose, the district court found that a business with \"one-third of the gross revenue [ ] derived from [these] various products that qualify\" is sufficient. JA 184.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The district court also rejected the claim that the Act violates equal protection because it has not been applied to Walmart and Spencer's, who also sell regulated items. It held that \"[t]here's no other business similarly situated that's been treated differently or better.\" JA 182-83. Although Spencer's is similar to Adam and Eve, it was not similarly-situated because the Act grandfathered in nonconforming businesses. The court noted that the law \"routinely draws lines involving dates.\" JA 183. As to other stores, the court explained that there was \"no evidence that the sale, offering for sale of these kind of materials at Walmart or Walgreen's or CVS is anything other than incidental.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Adam and Eve timely appealed.
