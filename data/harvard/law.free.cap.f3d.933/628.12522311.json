Schmitt and Chad Thompson submitted proposed ballot initiatives to the Portage County Board of Elections that would effectively decriminalize marijuana possession in the Ohio villages of Garrettsville and Windham. The Board declined to certify the proposed initiatives after concluding that the initiatives fell outside the scope of the municipalities' legislative authority. Plaintiffs then brought this action asserting that the statutes governing Ohio's municipal ballot-initiative process impose a prior restraint on their political speech, violating their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The district court issued a permanent injunction against the Portage County Board of Elections and Defendant Frank LaRose, in his official capacity as the Secretary of State of Ohio, prohibiting the enforcement of the statutes in any manner that failed to provide adequate judicial review.

The ballot-initiative statutes do not set forth the legislative-administrative distinction.

To show entitlement to mandamus relief, the petitioner must prove by clear and convincing evidence: \"(1) a clear legal right to the requested relief, (2) a clear legal duty on the part of the board members to provide it, and (3) the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The initiatives eliminated criminal penalties associated with possession of marijuana in Garrettsville and Windham, two villages within Portage County, by abolishing criminal fines, court costs, and consequences related to driver's licenses. Although the proposed initiatives met Ohio's statutory prerequisites-each addressed only a single subject and contained the requisite number of signatures-the Board declined to certify the petitions. In an August 21, 2018 email to Plaintiffs, a representative of the Board explained that the initiatives were rejected because the Board deemed them administrative, rather than legislative:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Reviewing the language in the proposals presented by the Village of Garrettsville and the Village of Windham, the $ 0 fine and no license consequences are administrative in nature. The $ 0 court costs is administrative in nature and is an impingement on the judicial function by a legislature. Accordingly, as the Garrettsville Village and Windham Village petitions deal with subject matter that is not subject to the initiative process, the Board of Elections, in its discretion, has chosen not to certify these issues to the ballot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (R. 1-4, PID 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Rather than petitioning for mandamus relief, Plaintiffs filed this action, bringing\n   facial and as-applied challenges to the Ohio ballot-initiative statutes under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.

On election day, the two proposed ordinances met different fates; the Windham initiative passed by a vote of 237 to 206, but the Garrettsville initiative failed 471 to 515.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the election, the district court ordered additional briefing on Plaintiffs' facial challenge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs maintained that the ballot-initiative statutes constituted a prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment \"because [they] vest[ ] discretion in local election officials to select initiatives for ballots without providing timely and meaningful judicial review.\" (R. 32, PID 240.) Plaintiffs alternatively argued that the statutes authorized content-based review by local boards of elections and were therefore subject to strict scrutiny. Ohio, on the other hand, argued that the ballot-initiative statutes were not susceptible to a First Amendment challenge because they merely set forth the process by\n   which legislation is made, and therefore did not implicate any expressive interests. Ohio also argued that even if the First Amendment is implicated, the state's interests in regulating elections, reducing voter confusion, and simplifying the ballot all justify the alleged infringement on Plaintiffs' constitutionally protected interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district court found that Plaintiffs were entitled to de novo review of the denial of their ballot initiative, and issued a permanent injunction barring the Ohio Secretary of State \"from enforcing the gatekeeper function in any manner that fails to provide a constitutionally sufficient review process to a party aggrieved by the rejection of an initiative petition.\"\n   <em>\n    Schmitt v.

Ohio Apr. 15, 2019). Notably, the district court did not analyze Plaintiffs' claim under the First Amendment, but rather under procedural due process. This approach had no basis in the pleadings or arguments below; the complaint did not separately state a procedural due process claim, and the parties' supplemental briefing did not invoke due process. On appeal, neither party defends the district court's analysis in its order granting the permanent injunction. The State disputes the merits of the procedural due process claim, and Plaintiffs insist their claim is founded only on First Amendment law. Because Plaintiffs did not raise a procedural due process argument below, and did not address it in their appellate briefing, we would ordinarily deem the issue waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Watson v.

I join Parts I, II, and IV of the majority opinion, but, as explained below, my reasoning differs from the remainder of the Majority's analysis. It is arguable that Ohio's legislative authority statutes do not regulate \"speech\" within the meaning of the First Amendment at all because they concern only election mechanics. But even assuming that state-referendum laws regulate First Amendment speech, regulations of the nature at issue here do not warrant heightened scrutiny under that constitutional provision.

First, these statutes do not regulate a citizen's ability to advocate for a proposed initiative or regulate any speech surrounding the issue on the ballot.

In\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , the election-mechanics law at issue was a Utah constitutional provision that imposed a requirement that any \"legislation initiated to allow, limit, or prohibit the taking of wildlife ... shall be adopted upon approval of two-thirds of those voting.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3090001\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/450/1082/\">\n    450 F.3d at 1086\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Utah Const. art.

In reviewing whether the Utah provision was subject to heightened scrutiny, the\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   court defined a key distinction (just as this court did in\n   <em>\n    Taxpayers United\n   </em>\n   ) between the types of election laws that were constitutionally permissible and those that were not: \"The distinction is between laws that regulate or restrict the communicative conduct of persons advocating a position in a referendum, which warrant strict scrutiny, and laws that determine the process by which legislation is enacted, which do not.\"\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3090001\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/450/1082/\">\n    450 F.3d at 1099-1100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   court reasoned that the First Amendment is not a vehicle for challenging regulations of the process that must be followed for legislation or popular initiatives to be enacted or adopted into law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Under the Plaintiffs' theory, every structural feature of government that makes some political outcomes less likely than others-and thereby discourages some speakers from engaging in protected speech-violates the First Amendment. Constitutions and rules of procedure\n   routinely make legislation, and thus advocacy, on certain subjects more difficult by requiring a supermajority vote to enact bills on certain subjects. Those who propose, for example, to impeach an official, override a veto, expel a member of the legislature, or ratify a treaty might have to convince two-thirds of the members of one or both houses to vote accordingly. State constitutions attach supermajority requirements to a bewildering array of specific categories of legislation, [collecting specific examples]. These provisions presumably have the \"inevitable effect\" of reducing the total \"quantum of speech\" by discouraging advocates of nuclear power plants, general banking laws, or unauthorized state flags from bothering to seek legislation or initiatives embodying their views. Yet if it violates the First Amendment to remove certain issues from the vicissitudes of ordinary democratic politics, constitutions themselves are unconstitutional. Indeed, the Plaintiffs' theory would have the ironic effect of rendering the relief they seek in this litigation unconstitutional under the First Amendment: if it is unconstitutional to amend the Utah constitution to require a supermajority to approve a wildlife initiative, those who favor such an amendment would be less likely to engage in advocacy in its favor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   No doubt the Plaintiffs are sincere in their many sworn statements that they find the heightened threshold for wildlife initiatives dispiriting, and feel \"marginalized\" or \"silenced\" in the wake of Proposition 5. Their constitutional claim begins, however, from a basic misunderstanding. The First Amendment ensures that all points of view may be heard; it does not ensure that all points of view are equally likely to prevail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3090001\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/450/1082/\">\n    450 F.3d at 1100-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Additionally, the\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   court noted that it would be wholly inappropriate to strike down an election-mechanics law under intermediate or strict scrutiny because it \"would be an especially egregious interference with the authority of 'We the People' to adopt constitutional provisions governing the legislative or initiative process.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3090001\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/450/1082/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3090001\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/450/1082/\">\n    at 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Tenth Circuit reasoned, heightened scrutiny would be problematic, as it could imagine few tasks \"less appropriate for federal courts than deciding which state constitutional limitations serve 'important governmental interests' and which do not. ... Under our form of government, the people and their representatives, and not judges, assume the task of determining which subjects should be insulated from democratic change.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3090001\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/450/1082/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   I find the\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning to be persuasive and another way to explain this court's holdings in\n   <em>\n    Taxpayers United\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ohio Ballot Board\n   </em>\n   . To be sure, our prior precedent did not involve an election-mechanics regulation that concerned subject-matter limitations for popular initiatives as in\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   . But, as\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   indicates, the First Amendment simply is not implicated by structural requirements for the adoption of such laws, and this conclusion aligns with our circuit's prior holdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   I share the Tenth Circuit's concern that we, as judges, are ill-suited to determine whether or not a state advances an important\n   governmental interest by limiting the subject-matter of its initiative petitions. Here, the people of Ohio and their elected representatives, through their state constitution and statutes, have determined that only \"legislative actions\" are within the municipal power and thus, that the subject of any initiative must be a legislative, rather than an administrative, matter. We are in no position to second-guess this rule. Just as the Tenth Circuit feared to tread into whether Utah's subject-matter limitations relating to the wildlife initiatives served an important governmental interest, so too are we ill-suited to address the importance of the state separation-of-powers principles implemented by Ohio through its legislative authority requirement for popular referenda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Furthermore, this case is similar to\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Taxpayers United\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Ohio Ballot Board\n   </em>\n   in that there is no contention here that the election-mechanics regulation at issue discriminates against any particular point of view. In\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , the law imposed a two-thirds approval of voters as to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   law that pertained to the taking of wildlife, regardless of whether it was for or against such practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3090001\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/450/1082/\">\n    450 F.3d at 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Taxpayers United\n   </em>\n   , there was no discrimination against any viewpoint by the requirement of a requisite number of registered voter signatures for an initiative to be placed on the ballot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511499\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/994/291/#p297\">\n    994 F.2d at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in\n   <em>\n    Ohio Ballot Board\n   </em>\n   , the single-subject rule applied to all initiatives, regardless of their subject matter.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516321\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/443/\">\n    885 F.3d at 447-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, here, the legislative authority statutes apply equally to all referenda, without regard to their subject matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Thus, based on the logic of\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , I question whether that the election-mechanics statutes at issue are even within the purview of the First Amendment. However, even assuming that they are, these statutes are constitutional under the rational-basis review applied in\n   <em>\n    Taxpayers United\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ohio Ballot Board\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, there is no merit to Appellees' assertion that the legislative authority statutes are an unconstitutional prior restraint, given that Ohio either is not restraining any constitutionally protected speech or that, if it is, the restraint is nonetheless valid under rational-basis scrutiny. As I explain below, these provisions survive rational-basis review because they are content-neutral and non-discriminatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Consistent with this court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Taxpayers United\n   </em>\n   , the Ohio statutes satisfy\n   rational-basis review because they are \"nondiscriminatory, content-neutral limitations on the [Appellees'] ability to initiate legislation.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511499\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/994/291/#p297\">\n    994 F.2d at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, consonant with Supreme Court precedent, the Ohio statutes at issue can be justified without reference to the content of the regulation. In\n   <em>\n    Reed v.

Moreover, the laws can be justified without reference to the content of the initiative petition, because, as explained by the Secretary, \"[t]he challenged portion of the [laws] channel ballot-access decisions to county boards and then mandamus proceedings that ensure that the State can quickly and efficiently promote its legitimate interests in screening out ineligible administrative actions and simplifying the ballot.\" Reply Br. at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   It is true that the contents of the proposed initiative dictate its fate in one limited sense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3501.38(M)(1)(a), 3501.39. Under the statutes, if the reviewer, either the Board of Elections or the Ohio Secretary of State, finds that the proposed initiative is outside the municipal power or is an administrative matter, then the proposed initiative will not be certified. By contrast, proposed initiatives that are within the municipal power and are legislative, assuming all other conditions are met, are certified to appear on the ballot. But despite the different treatment that proposed initiatives receive depending upon their legislative or administrative nature, Ohio's legislative authority statutes are nonetheless content-neutral for purposes of the First Amendment because (1) their application does not depend on \"the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed,\" (2) they can \"be justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,\" and (3) they were not \"adopted ... because of disagreement with the message ... convey[ed].\"\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/\">\n    135 S.

To put the point more concretely, based on the initiative that gave rise to this case, the Ohio legislative authority statutes do not regulate on the topic of marijuana possession in particular or operate to restrict any viewpoint, idea, or message on that topic. Rather, they simply regulate the manner in which\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   topic concerning\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   viewpoint, idea, or message may be presented to the voters for approval via the initiative process. Such regulation, though it involves analysis of the text of the initiative, is nonetheless content-neutral under the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taxpayers United\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511499\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/994/291/#p297\">\n    994 F.2d at 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding Michigan Board's review of the contents of the petition signatures to determine whether they were valid and from registered voters was content-neutral and did not violate the First Amendment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In light of this conclusion, whether the Ohio legislative authority statutes survive\n   review turns on the neutral application of the statutes by the Board and the Secretary-that is, are they applied in a discriminatory or non-discriminatory manner? Had Appellees presented evidence that the Board of Elections treated their initiatives differently because of their position regarding marijuana advocacy, then their claims might have had some merit. But, in the absence of evidence that the legislative authority statutes were applied in a discriminatory manner, it follows that the Board applied the gatekeeper provisions in a content-neutral and non-discriminatory way and therefore in compliance with the First Amendment. Although the Board may make mistakes in reviewing petitions and determine that otherwise certifiable initiatives are administrative (as the Secretary acknowledged happened here, Oral Arg. at 38:02-07), that does not mean that Ohio's legislative statutes are discriminatory as to any point of view. Instead, it is a steadfast reminder that humans make errors and likely is the reason why Ohio provides petitioners the right to seek a writ of mandamus in the Ohio Supreme Court. And thus, Ohio's legislative authority statutes are nondiscriminatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Because \"it is constitutionally permissible for [Ohio] to condition the use of its initiative procedure on compliance with content-neutral, nondiscriminatory regulations that are, as here, reasonably related to the purpose of administering an honest and fair procedure,\" the Appellees' \"First Amendment claim is without merit.\"\n   <em>\n    Taxpayers United\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511499\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/994/291/#p297\">\n    994 F.2d at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But Plaintiffs have made clear in the district court and on appeal that they \"do not challenge Ohio's ability to limit the subject matter of its initiatives.\" (R. 19, PID 136.) Instead, the focus of Plaintiffs' challenge is the asserted inadequacy of the review afforded to the boards' discretionary judgments. This aspect of the ballot-initiative statutes is plainly content-neutral. Moreover, the mere fact that the legislative-administrative distinction is directed to the content of an initiative does not necessarily make it content based such that it triggers strict scrutiny.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Committee to Impose Term Limits on the Ohio Supreme Court &amp; to Preclude Special Legal Status for Members &amp; Emps. of the Ohio Gen.
