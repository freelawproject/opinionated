The district court denied Ernst's motion for summary judgment, and Ernst appeals on the ground that he is entitled to qualified immunity. We conclude that Ernst did not violate a clearly established right of Kelsay under the Fourth Amendment, so we reverse the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The question presented is whether Ernst is entitled to summary judgment, so while there are some disputes about the facts, we ultimately consider the evidence in the light most favorable to Kelsay. On\n   May 29, 2014, Kelsay, her three children, and her friend Patrick Caslin went swimming at a public pool in Wymore, Nebraska. At one point, Caslin came up behind Kelsay like he was going to throw her in the pool, and she objected. Although Kelsay later explained that she and Caslin were \"just playing around,\" some onlookers thought Caslin was assaulting her, and a pool employee contacted the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As Kelsay and her party left the pool complex, they encountered Wymore Police Chief Russell Kirkpatrick and Officer Matthew Bornmeier. Kirkpatrick informed Caslin that he was under arrest for domestic assault and escorted him to a patrol car. Kelsay was \"mad\" that Caslin was arrested. She tried to explain to the officers that Caslin had not assaulted her, but she thought that the officers could not hear her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to Kirkpatrick, Caslin became enraged once they reached the patrol car and resisted going inside. Kirkpatrick says that after he secured Caslin in handcuffs, Kelsay approached the patrol car and stood in front of the door. Kirkpatrick claims that he told her to move three times before Bornmeier escorted her away so that Kirkpatrick could place Caslin into the patrol car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Kelsay denies approaching the patrol car until after Caslin was inside the vehicle. At that point, while Kirkpatrick interviewed witnesses, she walked over to the car to talk to Caslin. Bornmeier told her to back away from the vehicle, and Kelsay says that she complied. Two more officers-Deputy Matt Ernst and Sergeant Jay Welch from the Gage County Sheriff's Office-then arrived on the scene. When they appeared, Kelsay was standing about fifteen feet from the patrol car where Caslin was detained, and twenty to thirty feet from the pool's exit doors. Kelsay's younger daughter was standing next to her; her older daughter and son were standing by the exit doors. Kelsay stood approximately five feet tall and weighed about 130 pounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Police Chief Kirkpatrick told Ernst and Welch that Kelsay had interfered with Caslin's arrest. According to Welch, Kirkpatrick explained that Kelsay tried to prevent Caslin's arrest by \"trying to pull the officers off and getting in the way of the patrol vehicle door.\" Kirkpatrick thus decided that Kelsay should be arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the meantime, Kelsay's older daughter was near the pool exit doors yelling at a female patron who the daughter assumed had contacted the police. Kelsay started to walk toward her daughter, but Ernst ran up behind Kelsay, grabbed her arm, and told her to \"get back here.\" Kelsay stopped walking and turned around to face Ernst, at which point Ernst let go of Kelsay's arm. R. Doc. 53-8, at 54, lines 10-12. Kelsay told Ernst that \"some bitch is talking shit to my kid and I want to know what she's saying,\" and she continued walking away from Ernst and toward her daughter and the woman. The patron testified that she did not feel threatened at that particular moment, but later realized that Kelsay was \"coming towards me to hurt me or yell at me or whatever she was planning on doing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Kelsay walked a few feet away from Ernst on the grass, the deputy placed Kelsay in a bear hug, threw her to the ground, and placed her in handcuffs. Kelsay momentarily lost consciousness after she hit the ground. When she regained her senses, she was already handcuffed, and she began screaming about pain in her shoulder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ernst drove her to the Gage County jail, but a corrections officer recommended that Kelsay be examined by a doctor. Kirkpatrick took Kelsay to a hospital, where she\n   was diagnosed with a fractured collarbone. Kelsay ultimately was convicted of two misdemeanor offenses after pleading no contest to attempted obstruction of government operations and disturbing the peace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Kelsay later sued the City of Wymore and Kirkpatrick, Bornmeier, Ernst, and Welch in their individual and official capacities, alleging wrongful arrest, excessive force, and deliberate indifference to medical needs. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants on all claims but one. The court ruled that Deputy Ernst was not entitled to qualified immunity on a claim that he used excessive force to arrest Kelsay when he took her to the ground and caused the broken collarbone. The court reasoned that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Kelsay, could lead a factfinder to conclude that Ernst's use of force was unreasonable and violated Kelsay's clearly established rights under the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As an initial matter, Kelsay challenges our jurisdiction over this appeal. We have jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal of an order denying qualified immunity if the appeal seeks review of a purely legal issue, but we ordinarily lack jurisdiction to decide \"which facts a party may, or may not, be able to prove at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Unless the district court's assumed facts are blatantly contradicted by incontrovertible evidence of a sort that is not present here, we cannot entertain a contention by Ernst disputing the district court's determination about which facts Kelsay could prove at trial-for example, that Kelsay was not in a position to threaten witnesses or that she posed no danger to anyone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wallace v.

The district court rejected Ernst's defense of qualified immunity. The court reasoned that where a nonviolent misdemeanant poses no threat to officers and is not actively resisting arrest or attempting to flee, an officer may not employ force just because the suspect is interfering with police or behaving disrespectfully.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shekleton v.

The court ruled that the excessiveness of Ernst's use of force would have been apparent to a reasonable officer, because while Kelsay \"was not precisely 'compliant'-that is, she had been told to stop but kept walking instead-she was not using force or actively resisting arrest, and posed no danger to anyone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We respectfully disagree with this conclusion. It was not clearly established in May 2014 that a deputy was forbidden to use a takedown maneuver to arrest a suspect who ignored the deputy's instruction to \"get back here\" and continued to walk away from the officer.

Kelsay then walked toward another patron after stating that \"some bitch is talking shit to my kid and I want to know what she's saying.\" Even if a jury could find that Kelsay posed no danger to anyone at the time of the seizure, a reasonable officer in Ernst's position could have believed that it was important to control the situation and to prevent a confrontation between patrons that could escalate.

They are matters for resolution by the court, not by a jury. And Ernst's conclusion that Kelsay failed to comply was objectively reasonable.

Because Deputy Ernst \"didn't say anything\" to Kelsay in response, she \"turned around and started walking back.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54. Kelsay testified that she was not resisting arrest or stopping Deputy Ernst from handcuffing her. She also testified that she did not know that Chief Kirkpatrick wanted Deputy Ernst to arrest her. Nevertheless, Deputy Ernst \"ran up behind [Kelsay] and he grabbed [her] and slammed [her] to the ground.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51. The maneuver-\"like, a bear hug\"-lifted Kelsay \"off the ground.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98, 99. Due to the ground impact, Kelsay briefly lost consciousness. Deputy Ernst's takedown maneuver broke Kelsay's collarbone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The majority characterizes Kelsay's actions as one of \"a suspect who ignores a command and walks away\"; therefore, it holds that \"[d]ecisions concerning the use of force against suspects who were compliant or engaged in passive resistance are insufficient to constitute clearly established law that governs an officer's use of force.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   Op. at 980. But crediting Kelsay's account of the events, Kelsay complied with Deputy Ernst's command to \"get back here\" by stopping, turning around, and explaining what she was doing; in response, Deputy Ernst let go of Kelsay's arm and said nothing further. If there is a dispute of fact on this question, it is material and should be resolved by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The majority relies on\n   <em>\n    Ehlers\n   </em>\n   as \"[o]ur closest decision on point,\"\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Op. at 981, but\n   <em>\n    Ehlers\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable. The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Ehlers\n   </em>\n   twice ignored the officer's command to put his hands behind his back and continued walking as he passed the officer. For this reason, we held that the plaintiff \"at least appeared to be resisting.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12137674\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/1002/\">\n    846 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1011 (citing\n   <em>\n    Small v.

Deputy Ernst implicitly recognized her compliance by letting go of her arm and saying nothing in response to her explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In summary, construing the facts in the light most favorable to Kelsay, a reasonable officer would have known based on our body of precedent that a full-body takedown of a small, nonviolent misdemeanant who was not attempting to flee, resisting arrest, or ignoring other commands was excessive under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Kelsay also appears to contend that Ernst violated her Fourth Amendment rights by failing to remove handcuffs despite her repeated complaints of shoulder pain.

That is simply a disagreement with the majority on the application of precedent. Beyond this, however, I do take exception to the court's opinion in one important respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   At oral argument, the absence of judicial opinions in this circuit addressing the specific facts here, including the precise take-down maneuver used on Ms. Kelsay, was used to counter the arguments of her counsel. Yet, the court now declines to address whether the maneuver used on Ms. Kelsay violated her constitutional rights. Instead, the court relies solely on the second (\"clearly established\") prong of qualified immunity analysis. While this is allowed by governing precedent,\n   <em>\n    Pearson v.

The Supreme Court indicated in\n   <em>\n    Pearson\n   </em>\n   that the option for courts to skip to the second prong of analysis would not necessarily stunt the development of constitutional law.\n   <em>\n    Pearson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p236\">\n    555 U.S. at 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p236\">\n    129 S.Ct. 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court's opinion belies that expectation, at least in the context of excessive force claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This situation has much broader implications than Ms. Kelsay's broken collar bone. In the context of violations of constitutional rights by state officials, application of\n   <em>\n    Pearson\n   </em>\n   in this manner imposes a judicially created exception to a federal statute that effectively prevents claimants from vindicating their constitutional rights. The law is never made clear enough to hold individual officials liable for constitutional violations involving excessive force as Congress authorized in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
