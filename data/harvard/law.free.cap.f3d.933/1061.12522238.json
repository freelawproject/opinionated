We hold that an issue was actually litigated only if it was raised, contested, and submitted for determination in the prior adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Khalil Janjua (\"Janjua\"), a noncitizen, was granted asylum in the United States. Shortly thereafter, he applied for adjustment of status, which was denied on the ground that he was inadmissible under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B)(i) for having supported a Tier III terrorist organization. To be eligible for asylum, an applicant must not be inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B). Adjustment of status imposes the same requirements. Janjua thus argues that because he was granted asylum-and therefore was necessarily\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   found inadmissible on account of terrorism-related activities under \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(i) -issue preclusion bars the government from now denying his adjustment of status application on that ground. The question of whether Janjua was inadmissible on terrorism-related grounds was never raised, contested, or submitted for determination at Janjua's asylum proceeding. Janjua's work for the relevant organization, however, was discussed at length. Assuming without deciding that issue preclusion applies in adjustment of status proceedings, the central question before us is whether the issue of\n   terrorism-related inadmissibility was actually litigated at Janjua's asylum proceeding for purposes of issue preclusion. Because that issue was not raised, contested, or submitted for determination at Janjua's asylum proceeding, it was not actually litigated. Issue preclusion does not bar the government from disputing that issue in Janjua's adjustment of status proceeding. We therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Janjua is a native and citizen of Pakistan. As a Muhajir\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   living in Pakistan, Janjua joined the Muhajir Qaumi Movement (\"MQM\"), a political group. Janjua worked on behalf of the MQM, \"attending ... meetings, organizing ... rallies, distributing ... flyers,\" and advocating for the group's message during elections. As a result of his affiliation with and work for the MQM, Janjua was arrested and beaten by the police and by members of the opposition party numerous times while in Pakistan. Janjua eventually fled Pakistan in July 1998, entering the United States without inspection in Arizona on January 17, 1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In November 1999, Janjua applied for asylum with the legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service. In January 2000, Janjua's application was rejected, and the government served Janjua with a Notice to Appear (\"NTA\") in removal proceedings, charging him with inadmissibility under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(A)(i), as an alien present in the United States without having been admitted or paroled. The NTA did not charge him with inadmissibility under any terrorism-related inadmissibility grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Janjua conceded removability, but submitted applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\") predicated on his fear of persecution on the basis of his membership in the MQM. At Janjua's merits hearing, the immigration judge (\"IJ\") admitted into evidence Janjua's written statement regarding his participation in MQM activities and meetings, and Janjua testified at length about what he did as a member of the MQM and the abuse he suffered as a result of his membership. At one point, the government attorney focused on the MQM's reputation for violence, noting that \"the Country Reports on Pakistan put out by the Department of State for the United States Government suggests that the MQM has demonstrated its willingness to use violence and intimidation to further its objectives\" and asking whether Janjua had ever \"used violence and intimidation to further the goals of the MQM,\" to which Janjua responded, \"Never.\" Neither Janjua's written statement nor his oral testimony discussed whether Janjua collected funds or donations on behalf of the MQM, although he did at one point briefly discuss the annual donation his father would make to the MQM. At no point in the hearing was the issue of whether MQM would qualify as a terrorist organization ever raised or discussed. Then, as remains the case today, asylum was prohibited if an applicant was inadmissible for engaging in terrorist activity, which included knowingly providing material support to or soliciting funds on behalf of a designated terrorist organization.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B)(iv)(IV)(cc), (VI)(cc).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The IJ denied Janjua's applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n   under CAT, but the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") reversed and remanded on the issue of Janjua's credibility. On remand, the IJ eventually granted Janjua's application for asylum in April 2007, without a written opinion. By that time, Congress had expanded terrorism-related inadmissibility to also cover so-called Tier III terrorist organizations, \"group[s] of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engage[ ] in, or has a subgroup which engages in\" certain terrorist activities.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B)(iv)(IV)(cc), (VI)(dd).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In December 2008, Janjua filed a Form I-485, applying for adjustment of status to permanent residency pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201159\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After waiting years without adjudication of his application, Janjua filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging unlawful delay by the government and asking the court compel the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (\"USCIS\") adjudicate his adjustment of status application. USCIS responded by requesting additional evidence from Janjua regarding his activities with MQM, which he provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   USCIS denied Janjua's application on August 2, 2016, on the ground that he was inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(i)(I) because he \"afford[ed] material support [to]\" and \"solicit[ed] funds\" for MQM. which qualified as a Tier III terrorist organization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B)(iv)(IV)(cc), (VI)(dd). Thus, USCIS concluded that Janjua was inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(i)(I) -and therefore barred from receiving adjustment of status-because he had engaged in terrorist activity by supporting the MQM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following this, Janjua amended his complaint to challenge USCIS' denial of his application. Because the same terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility that bar asylum also bar adjustment of status,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)(v) (asylum); \u00a7 1159(b)(5), (c) (adjustment of status), Janjua argued that issue preclusion prevented the government from raising terrorism-related inadmissibility in the adjustment of status proceedings because the IJ had necessarily concluded that Janjua was not inadmissible on these grounds when he granted Janjua asylum. Janjua moved for summary judgment on the same basis. The government filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that issue preclusion did not apply to Janjua's adjustment application and, even if it did, the issue was not identical, previously litigated, or decided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 6, 2017, the district court denied Janjua's motion and granted the government's. The district court first held that issue preclusion does apply in adjustment of status proceedings governed by the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"). The district court agreed with the government, however, that the elements of issue preclusion were not met here because the issue had not been \"actually litigated\" in Janjua's asylum proceedings because it was not explicitly raised and contested. Accordingly, the district court granted the government's motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Janjua timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Even if an issue is not explicitly raised, if it is necessary to the ultimate determination, it is \"necessarily decided.\" But if an issue is actually litigated if it was implicitly raised, the requirement of actually litigated is rendered meaningless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Further, the standard urged by Janjua-that an issue is actually litigated if it\n   was implicitly raised-would expand the province of issue preclusion and encroach upon the province of claim preclusion. Both claim preclusion and issue preclusion are meant to preserve judicial resources, minimize inconsistent decisions, and prevent superfluous suits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

But one of the key distinctions between claim preclusion and issue preclusion is that the former bars relitigation of any and all matters that were or could have been raised at that adjudication,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715506\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/90/#p95\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715506\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/90/#p95\">\n    at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715506\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/90/#p95\">\n    101 S.Ct. 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , while the latter precludes relitigation of only those issues that were \"actually and necessarily determined,\"\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180409\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/147/#p153\">\n    440 U.S. at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180409\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/147/#p153\">\n    99 S.Ct. 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , those that were raised, contested, submitted for determination, and determined. The standard urged by Janjua would allow much broader preclusion, including of issues implicitly-but not in fact-raised. And precluding an issue that was not actually litigated-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , not raised, contested. and submitted for determination-does not conserve judicial resources or facilitate reliance on the earlier judgment because resources were not expended on the issue in the first place. To the extent that Janjua argues that the issue should be foreclosed because it was\n   <em>\n    implied\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    ought\n   </em>\n   to have been raised by the government, that is precisely the sort of preclusion reserved for\n   <em>\n    claim\n   </em>\n   preclusion, not issue preclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Janjua also makes the alternative-and ultimately unpersuasive-argument that an issue was \"actually litigated\" so long as there was a \"fair opportunity\" to litigate the issue. But our precedent clearly lays out \"actually litigated\" and a \"full and fair opportunity\" to litigate as separate requirements, each of which must be met for issue preclusion to apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oyeniran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736820\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/672/800/#p806\">\n    672 F.3d at 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And although we have at least once characterized the necessity that a party have had a \"full and fair\" opportunity to litigate the issue as part of the \"actually litigated\" consideration,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Littlejohn v.

A full and fair opportunity was (and remains) a necessary condition for issue preclusion, but we never suggested that it was\n   <em>\n    sufficient\n   </em>\n   to satisfy the actually litigated requirement.

We reject Janjua's proposed rule because it conflates two distinct elements of the issue preclusion test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Having determined that an issue was actually litigated if it was raised, contested, and submitted for determination by the parties, we now turn to the question of whether Janjua's terrorism-related inadmissibility was actually litigated here. Neither the question of whether MQM qualifies as a terrorist organization nor whether Janjua engaged in terrorist activity and was inadmissible as a result was raised, contested, or submitted for determination in Janjua's asylum proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To be sure, Janjua's membership in and work for the MQM were discussed at length at the merits hearing, including whether he had ever used violence or intimidation to further the organization's goals. Yet, these topics were explored for their relevance to Janjua's purported basis for persecution; no one raised, or even hinted at, these topics as potential grounds for inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Neither party ever addressed whether the MQM was a Tier III terrorist group-this category did not exist at the time of the merits hearing, and no further argument was presented to the IJ after the statutory amendment. And neither party addressed whether Janjua's support for the MQM would make him inadmissible-which makes sense for the same reasons. While Janjua's work for the MQM was addressed in the asylum proceedings, the specific issue of whether he was inadmissible based on that work was not raised, contested, or submitted for determination. It was not actually litigated in Janjua's asylum proceeding, and issue preclusion does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Janjua's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Paulo v.

There, the petitioner's eligibility for INA \u00a7 212(c) relief from removal was raised, contested, and submitted for determination in the first proceeding; in the second, the government advanced a new\n   <em>\n    argument\n   </em>\n   as to why he was ineligible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724223\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/911/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724223\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/911/\">\n    at 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
