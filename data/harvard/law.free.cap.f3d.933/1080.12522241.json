We hold that it may not. Accordingly, we reverse the district court's denial of David Sainz's motion for a sentence reduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In July 2012, Sainz pleaded guilty to six drug offenses. Sainz's advisory sentence range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines was 188-235 months in prison. The district court sentenced Sainz to 188 months in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sainz filed a notice of appeal, but later dismissed his appeals when he and the government entered into a post-conviction cooperation agreement. That agreement stated that Sainz's sentence would be reduced if he provided substantial assistance to the government. The agreement contained an express waiver of Sainz's right to seek relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The government abided by its promise. It filed a motion to reduce Sainz's sentence under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b)(2), and recommended a 151-month prison sentence. Sainz asked the court for the mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 21, 2014, the district court held a resentencing hearing. Sainz raised \"the prospect of [an] additional two-point reduction for ... the congressional amendment, which doesn't take [e]ffect until Congress's failure to act on November 1st. Which I guess we can all expect.\" Sainz was referring to a forthcoming amendment to USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, which would lower by two levels the base offense level for Sainz's convictions. Although the amendment had not yet been enacted, the court agreed that the amendment was likely to take effect on November 1 because \"[y]ou can expect Congress to do nothing.\" Sainz and the sentencing judge then engaged in a colloquy about whether the court could sentence Sainz below the 120-month mandatory minimum sentence. The court concluded that \" Rule 35 opens the door to [a sentence] below the mandatory minimum .... The power of the court is such that I could reduce the sentence [below the mandatory minimum].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court sentenced Sainz to 120 months in prison. Following the imposition of the sentence, the government asked the court whether the sentence was \"in contemplation of the expected two-level guideline reduction.\" The sentencing judge responded that he\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [had taken] that into consideration ... I have taken [into] consideration the reduction that comes with that because of the motion made by the court, made and accepted by the court ... [I] have before me the anticipation that the next week there will be a reduction of the sentence level ... all of that consideration leads to my conclusion that a sentence of 120 months is sufficient under the circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In October 2015, Sainz moved for a reduction of his 120-month sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2), which allows resentencing for \"a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered.\" Under Amendment 782, Sainz's Guidelines range had been reduced from 188-235 months in prison to 151-188 months in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   denied Sainz's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court based its holding on the fact that \"Sainz expressly waived the right to seek relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\" even though neither party had raised the waiver. The court also declined to consider a reduction to Sainz's sentence\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   on the ground that \"[the district court] expressly considered the potential effect of then-expected Amendment 782 in determining the appropriate sentence reduction for Sainz's cooperation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We begin our analysis by noting that no circuit has directly addressed whether it is appropriate for a district court to invoke\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   a defendant's waiver in an agreement with the government of the right to file a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Indeed, the government does not cite a single case in which a district court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   raised the defendant's waiver of such a right after the government failed to raise it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Although we have not addressed whether a district court may raise a defendant's waiver, we have concluded that, on appeal, courts should not raise waiver\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   . If the government does not raise the argument in the district court that a defendant has waived the right to bring a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in a plea agreement, we have held that the government has waived the right to make this argument on appeal. We addressed the issue tangentially in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Chaney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755884\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/1123/#p1125\">\n    581 F.3d 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2009). In\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   , the defendant sought a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755884\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/1123/#p1125\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755884\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/1123/#p1125\">\n    at 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In her plea agreement, the defendant had waived her rights \"to appeal any aspect of her sentence as long as her sentence is no longer than the top of the sentencing guidelines range\" and \"to bring a post-conviction attack on her ... sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755884\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/1123/#p1125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1124 n.1. Because the government had not sought to enforce the defendant's agreement not to seek a sentence reduction in the district court, we expressly declined to address whether the defendant waived her right to file the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion or to appeal from its denial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We also declined to raise a waiver\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Norwood v.

There, we held that, even though the defendants may have waived the issue of whether they were entitled to qualified immunity by failing to raise the issue in the district court, the plaintiff waived the waiver because he failed to raise it on appeal and instead addressed qualified immunity on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507526\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/1062/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507526\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/1062/\">\n    at 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[We] will not address waiver if not raised by the opposing party.\").

The holding in\n   <em>\n    Norwood\n   </em>\n   on waiver\n   was not unequivocal, however, because we also noted that even if we had discretion to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   enforce the waiver, we would choose not to do so because \"the more prudent course is to resolve the case on the basis of the issues actually briefed and argued by the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507526\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/1062/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507526\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/1062/\">\n    at 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The government, relying on two habeas cases, contends that the district court was permitted to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   raise Sainz's waiver because the government was silent about the waiver and, therefore, its waiver was not shown to be intentional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Day v.

Instead, the government omitted an argument based on facts of which it was well aware: Sainz had waived his right to file a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as part of the post-conviction cooperation agreement that the government entered into with him. Nevertheless, the government never relied on that waiver when addressing the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion before the district court. Furthermore, the policy concerns surrounding \u00a7 2254 habeas petitions and the rules that favor allowing the district court to raise the timeliness of a habeas petition\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   are not present in this case. For these reasons we find that\n   <em>\n    Day\n   </em>\n   is not applicable to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   also is not persuasive authority for the government's position.

The State told the district court that it would not challenge the timeliness of the petition and the district court addressed the petition on the merits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189545\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/463/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Supreme Court ruled that, given that the State deliberately waived its challenge to the timeliness of the petition, the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion by ignoring the district court's review of the merits of Wood's petition and\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   dismissing the petition on statute of limitations grounds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189545\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/463/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (noting that \"the State ... deliberately steered the District Court away from the question and towards the merits of Wood's petition\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The government argues that, in contrast to\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   , there is no evidence it intentionally refrained from invoking Sainz's waiver of his right to file a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and thus the district court properly denied the motion by\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   raising Sainz's waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   But the situation here differs from\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   . The government's silence about Sainz's waiver did not lead the district court to ask if the government wished to intentionally relinquish or abandon the defense, and the government did not expressly disavow the waiver. The government has not pointed to any evidence in the record that it inadvertently failed to raise Sainz's waiver below. We decline to hold that the government's silence about a defendant's waiver of the right to file a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion allows the district court to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   raise the waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Indeed, we have held that the government can waive waiver by failing to assert it.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Tercero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718884\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/979/#p981\">\n    734 F.3d 979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 981 (9th Cir. 2013) (\"It is well-established that the government can waive waiver implicitly by failing to assert it.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Norwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507526\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/1062/\">\n    591 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1068 ). In other words, the government must do more than remain silent; it must expressly invoke the waiver to avoid waiving it. Accordingly, because the\n   <em>\n    Day\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   habeas cases do not control the outcome here, under our law and the circumstances in this case, it would be an abuse of discretion for the court to conclude that the government's silence and failure to invoke the waiver of the right to file the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion allows the district\n   court to raise the waiver on its own volition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We are also persuaded by the reasoning of several circuits that have declined to raise\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   a defendant's waiver of his right to appeal his sentence if the government did not raise the issue. The Tenth Circuit has recognized that the obligation to raise a waiver of a right to appeal rests solely with the government; if the government does not raise the issue, it is forfeited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Tenth Circuit explained that one of the reasons for this result, \"rooted in the adversarial character of litigation,\" is that in some cases \"the government might conclude that justice would be better served by allowing a criminal defendant to appeal a wrongful sentence, even when the plea agreement included an appeal waiver.\"\n   <em>\n    Calderon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1280418\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/428/928/\">\n    428 F.3d at 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
