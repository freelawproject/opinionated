But the argument gets no further traction because it fundamentally misunderstands the ALJ's task.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   What the Mine Act requires is that the Secretary prove \"the alleged\n   <em>\n    violation\n   </em>\n   by a preponderance of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Secretary of Labor v.

That is, the Secretary bears the burden of proving the facts making out a violation of law.

The Company, in fact, does not dispute that the Secretary met this burden, and does not even seek review of the findings of violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Where the Company goes wrong is in trying to extend that burden of proof to the Secretary's suggested penalty amount.

Nothing in the regulation obligated the Secretary to then go before the Commission and\n   <em>\n    prove\n   </em>\n   why he recommended the penalty he did. Under regulations past and present, the Secretary's proposal is nothing more than his own chosen litigating position. It is a party's argument; it is not a fact to be proven by evidence. The only penalty calculation that matters is the Commission's, which is independent of the Secretary's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the Company argues that the ALJ abused his discretion by imposing penalties that were higher than the Secretary's regulations would permit. That meets the same fate as the preceding argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As noted, the Secretary's regulations regulate the Secretary; they \"do not extend to the independent Commission.\"\n   <em>\n    Mach Mining\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059442,12310395\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/1259/\">\n    809 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1263 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sellersburg Stone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"587572\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/736/1147/#p1152\">\n    736 F.2d at 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding \"no basis upon which to conclude that [the Secretary's] regulations also govern the Commission,\" and \"refus[ing] to utilize [those regulations] to determine the reasonableness of the Commission's assessment\"). The ALJ had no obligation to follow regulatory requirements that apply only to the Secretary's exercise of enforcement discretion.\n   <em>\n    Mach Mining\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059442,12310395\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/1259/\">\n    809 F.3d at 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , the Company contends that the ALJ inadequately explained his reasons for computing the penalty amount. That is incorrect. The ALJ rationally explained his penalty assessments with reference to each of the six statutory factors,\n   <em>\n    American Coal\n   </em>\n   , 38 FMSHRC at 2618-2622, and he expressly disclaimed any use of \"the Secretary's proposed specially assessed penalties as a baseline or starting point,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 2622. Rather than discounting the proposed penalties, he arrived at an independent determination of a penalty amount that would respond to the seriousness of the Company's violations and would deter future violations.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2616-2618. The ALJ also contrasted his judgment with that of the Secretary \"[t]o the extent that there were any substantial deviations in [his] penalty amounts that would require a[n] * * * explanation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2617. The ALJ need drill no deeper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   To be sure, the Commission's precedent seems to point in two directions. On the one hand, an ALJ's penalty \"assessment must be independent, and the Secretary's proposal is not a baseline or starting point that the Judge should use [as] a guidepost for his/her assessment.\"\n   <em>\n    American Coal\n   </em>\n   , 38 FMSHRC at 1990. On the other hand, ALJs are supposed to provide \"an explanation of any substantial divergence from the penalty proposal of the Secretary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . But all that matters here is that the ALJ satisfied both of those standards, provided an independent and reasoned basis for the penalty calculation, and supported all relevant factual determinations with substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For all of those reasons, we deny the petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate until seven days after the resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. APP. P. 41(b) ; D.C. CIR. R. 41(a)(1).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
