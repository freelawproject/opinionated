Some time later, he bludgeoned Berta Herndon to death with hammer blows to her head and killed Del Herndon by bludgeoning him in the head with a hammer and shooting him between the eyes.

In July 2003, the state moved to summarily dismiss Pizzuto's petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 646. In August 2003, Pizzuto moved to disqualify the state trial court judge.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   In October 2004, Pizzuto moved for additional psychological testing, asking that he be transported to an appropriate medical facility for testing in connection with a neuropsychiatric evaluation by Dr. James R.

Pizzuto did not notice the motion\n   for a hearing, however.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 655.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In January 2005, the state trial court denied the motion for disqualification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 646.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In seeking dismissal of Pizzuto's petition, the state argued that the petition was untimely under Idaho law and, alternatively, that Pizzuto had failed to establish a prima face case of intellectual disability under the new Idaho statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to the latter contention, the state noted that there were three elements of intellectual disability - subaverage intellectual functioning, significant limitation in adaptive functioning and an onset before age 18. With respect to the first criterion, the state noted that Pizzuto had \"a verbal IQ of 72\" - based on an IQ test administered by Dr. Michael Emery in 1985 - but that \"[t]he Statute says 70 or below,\" and \"72 is not 70 or below.\" In addition, because Pizzuto's IQ score of 72 was obtained when he was 28 years old, the state argued that \"we have no indication of what his IQ was - no testing, at least - what his IQ ... was before his 18th birthday.\" The state noted that the court had \"no evidence of an IQ test prior to age 18.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Pizzuto both opposed the state's motion for summary dismissal and, in September 2005, moved for summary judgment, arguing that he had, as a matter of law, established a prima facie case of intellectual disability.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Pizzuto argued that the state trial court should deny the state's motion for summary dismissal and grant his motion for summary judgment. In the alternative, Pizzuto argued that his October 2004 motion for additional testing should be granted and the matter set for trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 655-56 &amp; n.9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In addressing whether Pizzuto had made a prima facie showing of intellectual disability under the Idaho statute, both sides recognized that Idaho's requirement of an IQ of 70 or below was inconsistent with the AAMR and American Psychiatric Association clinical standards in effect at the time. Counsel for Pizzuto, however, acknowledged that\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   did not \"dictate what retardation is,\" while counsel for the state emphasized that \"[t]he United States Supreme Court said that the states were permitted to define mental retardation ... basically as they saw fit.\" The state recognized that the DSM and AAMR manual \"talk[ed] about ... a 70 IQ plus or minus five,\" but the state emphasized that \"the Idaho Statute doesn't say that. [ Section] 19-2515A is very specific, 70 or below. It doesn't say plus or minus five. Seventy or below, period, end of story.\" The state observed that \"some states have actually gone below the 70 and one state ... has gone to 75.\" But \"Idaho chose 70.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The state argued, moreover, that the margin of error was of no use to Pizzuto, because his \"actual\" IQ was as likely to be 77 as 67:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [Section] 2515A says that if the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is mentally retarded - preponderance of the evidence, more likely than not, ... something over 50 percent. Well, isn't it just as likely that Pizzuto's IQ is 77 as opposed\n   to 67? That's not a preponderance of the evidence. So, you have to go with the 72 and that's the only number that this Court has before it, the only number.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In December 2005, after a hearing on the motions, the state trial court dismissed Pizzuto's petition on the grounds that it had not been timely filed under state law and that Pizzuto had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact supporting his claim of intellectual disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 646. Pizzuto timely appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In a 2008 decision, the Idaho Supreme Court affirmed the state trial court's denial of Pizzuto's\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pizzuto I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068928\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/146/720/\">\n    202 P.3d 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court noted that, to survive summary dismissal, Pizzuto had to present evidence establishing a prima facie case - i.e., enough evidence to allow the factfinder to infer the fact at issue and rule in his favor - on each element of his claim under \u00a7 19-2515A(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 650. The court interpreted the Idaho statute as requiring proof of three elements: \"(1) an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 70 or below; (2) significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two of the ten areas listed; and (3) the onset of the offender's IQ of 70 or below and the onset of his or her significant limitations in adaptive functioning both must have occurred before the offender turned age eighteen.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 651.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The court concluded that Pizzuto failed to establish a prima facie case as to the first element - an IQ of 70 or below. The record reflected only a single IQ test score for Pizzuto, a score of 72 on the test administered by Dr. Emery in December 1985, shortly before Pizzuto's 29th birthday.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The court acknowledged Pizzuto's argument that \"an IQ score is only accurate within five points,\" but it found \"two problems\" with Pizzuto's argument that \"his actual IQ could have been five points lower or higher than 72\": first, it would be just as reasonable for the state trial court to infer that his actual IQ was 77 as it would be to infer that it was 67; second, the state trial court was permitted to infer that his IQ had decreased during the 11 years between his 18th birthday and the date of his IQ test.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court noted that Pizzuto \"did not offer any expert opinion\" showing that he \"had an IQ of 70 or below at the time of the murders and prior to his eighteenth birthday.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 655. Accordingly, the court held that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the state.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We granted Pizzuto permission to file a successive federal habeas petition on his\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   claim.

The onset of significant subaverage general intelligence functioning and significant limitations in adaptive functioning must occur before age eighteen (18) years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (b) \"Significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning\" means an intelligence quotient of seventy (70) or below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -2515A(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In 2008, the Idaho Supreme Court applied this definition for the first time in Pizzuto's case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pizzuto I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068928\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/146/720/\">\n    202 P.3d at 650-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court began by noting that \"the statutory definition ... requires proof of three elements: (1) an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 70 or below; (2) significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two of the ten areas listed; and (3) the onset of the offender's IQ of 70 or below and the onset of his or her significant limitations in adaptive functioning both must have occurred before the offender\n   turned age eighteen.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 651. Focusing on the first element, the court held that, \"[i]n order for Pizzuto to have presented a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, there must be evidence showing that he had an IQ of seventy or below before age eighteen.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The court then noted that the record included only one IQ test score for Pizzuto - a Verbal IQ of 72 on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Revised, administered by Dr. Emery in December 1985, shortly before Pizzuto's 29th birthday.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   This test score, the court concluded, was insufficient to establish an IQ of 70 or below before the age of 18:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Pizzuto argues that an IQ score is only accurate within five points. He contends that his actual IQ could have been five points lower or higher than 72. There are two problems with that argument.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   First, when enacting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -2515A(1), the legislature did not require that the IQ score be within five points of 70 or below. It required that it be 70 or below. Although Pizzuto argued that the district court should infer that Pizzuto's actual IQ was lower than his test score, the court could just as reasonably have inferred that it was higher. The alleged error in IQ testing is plus or minus five points. The district court was entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the undisputed facts. It would be just as reasonable to infer that Pizzuto's IQ on December 12, 1985, was 77 as it would be to infer that it was 67.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Second, Pizzuto's argument also requires the district court to infer that Pizzuto's IQ had not decreased during the eleven-year period from his eighteenth birthday to the date of his IQ test. The district court, as the trier of fact, was not required to make that inference, especially in light of the opinions of Pizzuto's experts that his long history of drug abuse and his epilepsy would have negatively impacted his mental functioning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Pizzuto argues that the Idaho Supreme Court's decision was both \"contrary to\" and an \"unreasonable application\" of\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   .

Those standards required an IQ of \"approximately 70\" and recognized that \"it is possible to diagnose Mental Retardation in individuals with IQs between 70 and 75 who exhibit significant deficits in adaptive behavior.\" DSM-IV at 41-42. The Idaho Supreme Court, by contrast, required an \"actual\" IQ of \"70 or below,\" irrespective of \"[s]ignificant limitations in adaptive functioning.\"\n   <em>\n    Pizzuto I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068928\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/146/720/\">\n    202 P.3d at 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pizzuto, therefore, is correct in arguing that the state court's determination that he failed to make a prima facie showing of intellectual disability is \"not consistent with clinical definitions\" discussed in\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   and subsequently required by\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Under \u00a7 2254(d)(2), however, we review a state court's factual determinations, not its legal conclusions. Here, the Idaho Supreme Court did not purport to determine whether Pizzuto was intellectually disabled under the clinical definitions. Instead, it determined only that Pizzuto failed to make a prima facie \"showing that his IQ was 70 or below prior to his eighteenth birthday.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068928\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/146/720/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is that factual determination, therefore, that we may review under \u00a7 2254(d)(2), not the state court's legal conclusion that an IQ of 70 or below was required. Accordingly, we must reject Pizzuto's contention that the state court's factual determinations are unreasonable merely because the state court did not apply the clinical definitions of intellectual disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Pizzuto's Argument That the State Court's Unreasonably Failed to Consider His School Records as Evidence of Subaverage Intellectual Functioning\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Pizzuto argues that the Idaho Supreme Court's determination that he failed to make a prima facie showing that his IQ was 70 or below before his 18th birthday was unreasonable because it focused exclusively on his single IQ test score while ignoring other evidence of subaverage intellectual functioning in the form of his \"abysmal school record.\" Opening Brief at 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Pizzuto is correct that a \"state-court fact-finding process is undermined where the state court has before it, yet apparently ignores, evidence that supports petitioner's claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9260220\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/366/992/#p1000\">\n    366 F.3d at 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, however, Pizzuto has not shown that the Idaho Supreme Court ignored such evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   First, although Pizzuto cites his \"abysmal school record,\" the actual evidence in the record regarding his schooling is\n   sparse and incomplete. It consists solely of affidavits from five educators, two of whom have no specific recollection of Pizzuto. Although some of these records show that Pizzuto received low grades and was held back, there are many reasons Pizzuto may have performed poorly in school, and no expert opined that this poor performance was evidence of significantly subaverage intellectual functioning or an IQ of 70 or below. Thus, even if Pizzuto's school records are some evidence of pre-18 significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, they do not render unreasonable the Idaho Supreme Court's determination that Pizzuto failed to make a prima facie showing that he had an IQ of 70 or below before the age of 18. School records can be strong evidence of intellectual disability.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Moore I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602607\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1039/\">\n    137 S.

In state court, Pizzuto cited his school records to show limitations in adaptive functioning but not to establish subaverage intellectual functioning.

Because his prison records do not show continued seizures or drug use, Pizzuto argues that a \"more reasonable inference\" would be that he was substantially drug free and not experiencing seizures after he turned 19.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The Idaho Supreme Court's determination, however, was based on record evidence from Pizzuto's own experts. In 1988, Dr. James Merikangas noted that Pizzuto had \"a life long history of almost continuous drug abuse including intravenous Heroin as well as cocaine, speed and marijuana\"; that Pizzuto's \"long history of polydrug abuse has caused him further neurological dysfunction and ... substantial defects of mind and reason\"; and that \"[w]e will probably not know to any scientific degree of accuracy what his state of mind was at the time of the alleged crimes.\" In 2004, Dr. Craig Beaver opined that Pizzuto would benefit from further neurological study in part because, \"[o]ften, patients that have persistent seizure disorders ... will decline over time in their overall mental abilities\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Mr. Pizzuto has continued to require pharmacological management of his seizure disorder since he was last examined by myself in 1996. He has continued to have neurological difficulties. Therefore, given that it has now been over eight years since his last comprehensive neuropsychological examination, I would strongly recommend that he undergo repeat neuropsychometric studies. Repeat neuropsychometric studies are needed to better determine Gerald Pizzuto's cognitive abilities. Often, patients that have persistent seizure disorders, for example, will decline over time in their overall mental abilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In light of this evidence, it was not unreasonable for the Idaho Supreme Court to determine that the state trial court reasonably could have inferred that Pizzuto's IQ may have declined as a result of drug abuse or epilepsy. Even if, as Pizzuto contends, a \"more reasonable inference\" would be that he was substantially drug free and not experiencing seizures after he turned 19, this does not render the state court's contrary determination objectively unreasonable under \u00a7 2254(d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Second, Pizzuto argues that it would have been unreasonable to infer from Dr. Beaver's 2004 affidavit that Pizzuto's mental functioning may have declined between 1974 and 1985,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pizzuto I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068928\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/146/720/\">\n    202 P.3d at 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because \"[t]here is no statement in the affidavit that Mr. Pizzuto's IQ had declined ... between 1996 and 2008,\" let alone \"any statement that Mr. Pizzuto's IQ had declined ... from his 18th birthday to the time of Dr. Emery's testing.\" Opening Brief at 42. Dr. Beaver's affidavit, however, clearly gave the impression that Pizzuto's mental functioning may have declined between 1996 and 2004. It would not have been unreasonable, therefore, to infer that it also might have declined between 1974 and 1985. Dr. Beaver did not need to expressly state that a decline in IQ occurred for the Idaho Supreme Court to determine that it was possible. The very reason Dr. Beaver requested more testing was that those with persistent seizure disorders, like Pizzuto, tend to decline in their mental abilities over time. The Idaho Supreme Court's determination, therefore, was not unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Pizzuto's Argument That the State Court's Denial of an Evidentiary Hearing Was Based on an Unreasonable Determination of the Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Pizzuto argues that he \"only needed to raise a reasonable doubt regarding his intellectual capacity to be entitled to an evidentiary hearing\" and that the Idaho Supreme Court's determination that he \"did not meet that low threshold was unreasonable\" under \u00a7 2254(d)(2). Opening Brief at 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   This argument is unpersuasive. First, although Pizzuto argues that the Idaho Supreme Court unreasonably determined that he did not raise a reasonable doubt regarding his intellectual capacity, the Idaho Supreme Court in fact never addressed that question. The only question the state court decided was whether Pizzuto had made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie showing\n   </em>\n   of intellectual disability, in particular whether he had made a prima facie showing of a pre-18 IQ of 70 or below. The court did not address whether Pizzuto had raised a \"reasonable doubt\" as to his intellectual disability. Accordingly, there is no \"reasonable doubt\" determination for us to review under \u00a7 2254(d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Second, although Pizzuto contends that the Idaho Supreme Court's failure to apply a \"reasonable doubt\" standard was \"contrary to, and an unreasonable application of\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   ,\" as \"expressly addressed in\n   <em>\n    Brumfield\n   </em>\n   ,\" we must disagree. Opening Brief at 46.\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   did not address the\n   legal standard applicable to a request for an evidentiary hearing. In\n   <em>\n    Brumfield\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    state courts\n   </em>\n   adopted a reasonable doubt standard,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brumfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590278\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2269/\">\n    135 S.

Pizzuto's Argument That the State Court's Factfinding Process Was Unreasonable\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Pizzuto argues more broadly that the denial of a hearing, as well as the denial of access to an expert, rendered the Idaho Supreme Court's factfinding process itself unreasonable under \u00a7 2254(d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Hibbler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3519301\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/1140/#p1146\">\n    693 F.3d at 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"[c]hallenges under \u00a7 2254(d)(2) fall into two main categories.\" \"First, a petitioner may challenge the substance of the state court's findings and attempt to show that those findings were not supported by substantial evidence in the state court record.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3519301\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/1140/#p1146\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, as relevant here, \"a petitioner may challenge the fact-finding process itself on the ground that it was deficient in some material way.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3519301\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/1140/#p1146\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In some circumstances, for instance, a \"state court's failure to hold an evidentiary hearing may render its fact-finding process unreasonable under \u00a7 2254(d)(2).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3519301\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/1140/#p1146\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3519301\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/1140/#p1146\">\n    at 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Idaho Supreme Court did not specifically address whether the state trial court erred by granting summary judgment to the state on Pizzuto's\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   claim without holding an evidentiary hearing. The court, however, addressed a related question - whether the state trial court erred by dismissing Pizzuto's petition without permitting further testing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pizzuto I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068928\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/146/720/\">\n    202 P.3d at 655-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concluded that the trial court did not err. First, the court noted that Pizzuto had not pursued the motion for testing. Pizzuto had moved for additional testing in October 2004 but he \"did not notice this motion for a hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 655. Instead, \"[w]ithout pursuing the motion for testing, Pizzuto moved for summary judgment on September 23, 2005.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He did so, moreover, even though, under Idaho law, \"[i]f a trial court denies a party's motion for summary judgment, it has discretion to grant summary judgment to the opposing party.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 656 (citing\n   <em>\n    Harwood v.

Even in connection with the summary judgment proceedings, \"Pizzuto did not ask the [state trial] court to rule on his motion for the specified additional testing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"428354\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/136/672/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Second, as framed by the Idaho Supreme Court, the central issue in the case was whether Pizzuto could establish a pre-18 IQ of 70 or below. Pizzuto did not argue that, were he afforded the opportunity to conduct further testing, he would develop additional evidence on that question. The court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   The definition of \"mentally retarded\" in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -2515A requires that the defendant have an IQ of 70 or below both at the time of the murder(s) and prior to age eighteen. In its briefing opposing Pizzuto's motion for summary judgment, the State argued that Pizzuto had failed to provide evidence that his IQ was 70 or below and failed to provide evidence showing it was 70 or below prior to his eighteenth birthday. Pizzuto's alleged IQ is obviously a matter requiring expert testimony. He did not\n   offer any expert testimony opining that his IQ was ever 70 or below,\n   <em>\n    nor does he allege that the requested additional testing was intended to address that issue\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   In short, Pizzuto did not pursue his motion for additional testing, and he did not contend that further factual development of the record would shed additional light on the dispositive issue - his ability to establish a pre-18 IQ of 70 or below. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the denial of an evidentiary hearing rendered the state court's factfinding process unreasonable under \u00a7 2254(d)(2)'s highly deferential standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hibbler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3519301\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/1140/#p1146\">\n    693 F.3d at 1146-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hen the challenge is to the state court's procedure, mere doubt as to the adequacy of the state court's findings of fact is insufficient; we must be satisfied that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   appellate court to whom the defect in the state court's fact-finding process is pointed out would be unreasonable in holding that the state court's fact-finding process was adequate.\" (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    6.

IQ test scores are approximations of conceptual functioning but may be insufficient to assess reasoning in real-life situations and mastery of practical tasks. For example, a person with an IQ score above 70 may have such severe adaptive behavior problems in social judgment, social understanding, and other areas of adaptive functioning that the person's actual functioning is comparable to that of individuals with a lower IQ score.

Thus, it is possible to diagnose Mental Retardation in individuals with IQs between 70 and 75 who exhibit significant deficits in adaptive behavior.
