The district court concluded that the action, filed by an Indian tribe seeking to enforce a tribal court judgment against nonmembers, did not present a federal question and dismissed it based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Inherent in the recognition of a tribal court's judgment against a nonmember is a question regarding the extent of the powers reserved to the tribe under federal law. As in previous decisions involving the application of tribal law to nonmembers, we hold that actions seeking to enforce a tribal judgment against nonmembers raise a substantial\n   question of federal law. We accordingly reverse the district court's order dismissing the case for lack of subject of matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Defendants-Appellees Steve and Deanne Hawks are not members of the Tribe but own an interest in real property abutting the St. Joe River. The Hawks also own and maintain a boat garage set on pilings that extend from their property into the St. Joe River. Beginning in 2003, the Tribe advised the Hawks through letters and compliance orders that the pilings and boat garage encroached on land the Tribe is entitled to control. The Hawks never responded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2016, the Tribe sued the Hawks in the Coeur d'Alene Tribal Court (the \"Tribal Court\") for encroachment without a permit in violation of tribal law. The Hawks were served with notice but did not answer the complaint or otherwise contest the allegations. The Tribal Court accordingly entered default judgment against the Hawks in the form of a $3,900 civil penalty and a declaration that the Tribe was entitled to remove the encroachments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Tribe subsequently sought federal recognition and enforcement of the Tribal Court's judgment by filing a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Hawks moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Tribe responded by arguing that the case fell under the court's jurisdiction to adjudicate questions of federal law because in order to enforce the judgment, the court would be required to determine the extent of the Tribal Court's jurisdiction over nonmembers, a question that federal law governs. Although the district court acknowledged that the Tribal Court's authority over the Hawks presented a federal question, it held the question was not present on the face of the Tribe's complaint. Having found \"no federal statute or law ... in dispute,\" the district court dismissed the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Tribe timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
