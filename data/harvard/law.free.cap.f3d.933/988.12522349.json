The district court concluded that Raymond did not qualify for the ACCA mandatory minimum but that it nonetheless was unable to grant relief because Raymond could not show a\n   complete miscarriage of justice. Raymond appeals not from that order, but from an order denying his later, counseled motion for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6).

The drug count carried a 20-year maximum term of imprisonment. The firearm count normally carried a 10-year maximum, but the district court found that five of Raymond's prior Minnesota convictions qualified as violent felonies under the ACCA, which increased the minimum term of imprisonment on the firearm count to 15 years. Raymond objected to the ACCA enhancement. The district court overruled the objection but encouraged Raymond to appeal the enhancement, noting that the Supreme Court would soon \"be taking up this issue\" in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   . It then sentenced Raymond to concurrent 15-year terms of imprisonment on both counts, which it explained was the mandatory minimum sentence allowed under the ACCA and thus the sentence \"that no judge can go under.\" It also imposed a five-year term of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Raymond appealed, challenging the ACCA enhancement.

The government does not contest this determination.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The government suggests that the district court erred in imposing a concurrent five-year term of supervised release on the drug count and that Raymond forfeited his right to correct that error by not raising the issue on direct appeal. But the district court simply imposed a single five-year term of supervised release without specifying specific lengths for each count, presumably because terms of supervised release are statutorily required to run concurrently.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203624\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e). So there was no error for Raymond to challenge on direct appeal, and Raymond did not forfeit his right to a term of supervised release authorized by statute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
