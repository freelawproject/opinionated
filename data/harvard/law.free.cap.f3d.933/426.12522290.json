The district court sentenced Leal to 240 months imprisonment and ordered Leal to pay $58,415 in restitution to \"Andy,\" a victim depicted in Leal's materials. On appeal, Leal seeks to vacate the order of restitution, contending that it was imposed in violation of the proximate cause requirements described in\n   <em>\n    Paroline v.

Some depicted sadistic acts involving children, and some depicted infants or toddlers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In relevant part, Leal's plea agreement stated that the district court could impose a sentence including \"restitution to victims or to the community, which is mandatory under the law.\" The agreement noted, \"The defendant fully understands that the actual sentence imposed (so long as it is within the statutory maximum) is solely in the discretion of the Court.\" Finally, the agreement contained an appeal waiver stating in full:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant waives his rights, conferred by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203742\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to appeal his conviction, sentence, fine, order of restitution, and forfeiture order in amount to be determined by the district court.

The defendant, however, reserves the rights (a) to challenge the voluntariness of his plea of guilty or this waiver, and (b) to bring a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Pre-Sentence Report initially found restitution inapplicable. After the PSR was completed, Andy submitted his restitution request and the government sought to amend the PSR accordingly. Two weeks before sentencing, the Probation Office filed an addendum to the PSR recommending that Leal be ordered to pay $58,415, the full amount sought by Andy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The addendum attached the twenty-one-page restitution request submitted by Andy's attorney. The letter explained that beginning when Andy was seven and continuing until Andy was twelve, Andy was sexually abused by an older man (not Leal) who made and circulated \"graphic video recordings of his sexual abuse of Andy\" in which Andy was \"clearly recognizable.\" Relying on reports from a forensic psychologist and an economist, Andy estimated that he had suffered losses of $267,038 in future psychological counseling costs and $1,854,925 in future lost income, totaling $2,121,963 in general losses\n   \"stem[ming] from the actions of defendant Leal as well as other criminals.\" Andy acknowledged that Leal did not appear to be \"directly connected to the initial production of his images,\" but had harmed Andy by possessing Andy's images.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Andy argued that Leal should be responsible for $25,000 of Andy's general losses. Andy also sought to recover $33,415 for the forensic psychologist's and economist's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Leal was sentenced on August 15, 2016, at a consolidated sentencing hearing that combined the instant case with a related case, in which Leal had pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography and to being a felon in possession of a firearm. At sentencing, Leal confirmed that he had reviewed the PSR and the addendum and raised no objections. The district court adopted the factual contents of the PSR and addendum and ordered Leal to pay Andy $58,415 in restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 30, 2016, Leal filed a pro se notice of appeal from \"the judgment and sentences imposed by this court on August 15th, 2016.\" Leal's notice of appeal was timely. However, it was filed only in the related case, not in the present case, and hence arguably failed to \"designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed\" as required by Rule 3(c)(1)(B).

Leal recognizes that the district court adopted the reasoning set forth in Andy's extensive restitution request and submission, which was attached to the PSR addendum. Leal does not challenge Andy's $2.1 million estimate of general losses and argues only that the $25,000 figure was derived without considering proximate cause. It is true that much of Andy's restitution request focused on the \"reasonableness\" of a $25,000 assessment in light of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which entitles child pornography victims to liquidated damages of $150,000 when they prevail in civil suits. That reasonableness argument appears to have little bearing on the relative significance of Leal's conduct in causing Andy's losses. But Andy's submission did discuss some of the\n   <em>\n    Paroline\n   </em>\n   factors. It represented that \"Andy has received restitution in only a tiny number of cases in which he has been named a victim, in large part due to the fact that it was too late in the criminal process to ask for restitution by the time Andy retained our services.\" It also explained that Andy did\n   not have information about whether future offenders contributing to Andy's general losses might be caught and convicted, nor did Andy have an estimate of the number of offenders involved with his images. Based on this evidence, holding Leal responsible for roughly one percent of Andy's general losses does not make Leal \"liable for an amount drastically out of proportion to his own individual causal relation to the victim's losses.\"\n   <em>\n    Paroline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706995\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/434/\">\n    572 U.S. at 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706995,12579853\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1710/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Andy argued that he was entitled to recover those costs in full because Leal's \"conviction was both a 'necessary' and 'sufficient' condition to produce all the [expert] costs.\" Put another way, Leal's offense caused the need for Andy's restitution request, and expert reports were required to support that request. However, Andy also forthrightly acknowledged that he \"is submitting [the] ... reports in other criminal cases in support of restitution, and with request for full restitution in these other cases.\" In these narrow circumstances, the government ideally should have presented evidence about these other defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203664\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The burden of demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained by a victim as a result of the offense shall be on the attorney for the Government.\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202259\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) (defining \"full amount of the victim's losses\" to \"include[ ]\n   <em>\n    any costs\n   </em>\n   incurred, or that are reasonably projected to be incurred in the future, by the victim, as a\n   <em>\n    proximate result\n   </em>\n   of the offenses involving the victim\") (emphasis added).
