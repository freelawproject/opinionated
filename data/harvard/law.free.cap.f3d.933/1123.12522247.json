We hold that it did not, and deny Young's application for authorization to file another habeas petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2006, a California jury convicted Young of fourteen counts of second-degree burglary, fourteen counts of grand theft, and one count of selling stolen property, with enhancements. He was sentenced to state prison for thirty years and eight months. The California Court of Appeal affirmed his conviction and the California Supreme Court denied his petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Young later challenged his conviction in federal district court with a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, which was denied on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the years following the district court's denial, Young has filed several applications in this court for authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2254 petition. Most recently, he filed a motion to reconsider the denial of his application, which we deemed another application for authorization. Young asserted that his conviction was unconstitutional because there was an unreasonable search of his cell phone based on\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   , which held that a warrant is \"generally required\" to search a cell phone's data.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20U.S.%20373\">\n    573 U.S. at 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We requested that respondent address whether the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   meets \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A) 's requirements for authorization of a second or successive petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
