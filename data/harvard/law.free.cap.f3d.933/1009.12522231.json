Sims appealed, arguing that his previous Arkansas burglary convictions do not qualify as violent felonies and that he therefore lacks the three or more convictions necessary to qualify as an armed career criminal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The ACCA specifically enumerates burglary as a violent felony.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii).

In a supplemental letter brief, the Government points to the various state burglary laws at the time Congress passed the ACCA in 1986 and argues that Arkansas's residential burglary statute qualifies as generic burglary because a majority of states had similar laws. In addition, the Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Stitt\n   </em>\n   also relies on the definition of burglary in the Model Penal Code.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p598\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In his supplemental letter brief, Sims counters the Government's argument by pointing out that the Model Penal Code's definition of burglary includes \"vehicles adapted for overnight accommodation\" but \"exclude[s] from burglary intrusions into ... motor vehicles other than home trailers or mobile offices\" even though \"a person\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   sleep or conduct business in such a place.\" Model Penal Code \u00a7 221.1 cmt.

The Court observed that Congress \"viewed\n   burglary as an inherently dangerous crime because burglary creates the possibility of a violent confrontation between the offender and an occupant, caretaker, or some other person who comes to investigate.\"\n   <em>\n    Stitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12622667,12622668\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/399/\">\n    139 S.

Indeed, the Court favorably cited a Tenth Circuit decision noting that burglaries of less traditional structures \"pose a greater risk of violence to the occupant or owner than the burglary of a building or house because it is more difficult for the burglar to enter or escape unnoticed.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Spring\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7644330\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/80/1450/#p1462\">\n    80 F.3d 1450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1462 (10th Cir. 1996). This reasoning is no less true of an ordinary vehicle in which someone happens to be living. For example, it would be difficult for the offender to enter or escape unnoticed if he entered a van unaware that someone was sleeping in the back seat. In short, we agree that the Model Penal Code's emphasis on the \"\n   <em>\n    apparent\n   </em>\n   potential for regular occupancy\" ensures that an \"intruder is ordinarily well able to judge whether the structure is a ... place where people might normally be present.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Model Penal Code \u00a7 221.1 cmt. (3)(b) (emphasis added). But given the malleable and ever-changing nature of modern residences, the meaning of generic burglary was not so limited in 1986.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dwelling, Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (5th ed. 1979) (defining dwelling to include \"a vehicle or other enclosed space which is used or intended for use as a human habitation, home or residence\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Of course, as\n   <em>\n    Stitt\n   </em>\n   recognizes, a statute that prohibits breaking and entering into\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   vehicle does not qualify as generic burglary.\n   <em>\n    Stitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12622667,12622668\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/399/\">\n    139 S. Ct. at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Arkansas criminalizes unlawful entry\n   into a vehicle not used for residential purposes in a separate statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ark. Code. Ann. \u00a7 5-39-202 (2013). As the Arkansas Supreme Court explained, \"The obvious reason for the distinction between our burglary and breaking and entering statutes is the intent of the general assembly to punish burglary more severely because it involves entering a place where people, as opposed to mere property, are likely to be.\"\n   <em>\n    Julian v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1889907\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/298/302/\">\n    298 Ark. 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1889907\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/298/302/\">\n    767 S.W.2d 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 301 (1989). Because the Arkansas statute at issue here applies only to vehicles in which someone lives or that are customarily used for overnight accommodation, it addresses the risk of violence that concerned Congress when it passed the ACCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p598\">\n    495 U.S. at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p598\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing Congress as \"immersed in the intensely practical concerns of controlling violent crime\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, one benefit of\n   <em>\n    Stitt\n   </em>\n   's straightforward focus on the potential for violent confrontation is that it brings all residences within the ambit of generic burglary. While this was not true historically,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 4 William Blackstone,\n   <em>\n    Commentaries\n   </em>\n   , *226 (\"Neither can burglary be committed in a tent or booth erected in a market or fair; though the owner may lodge therein: for the law regards thus highly nothing but permanent edifices ....\" (citation omitted)), generic burglary affords the same protection to a homeless person living in a car that it does to a person living in a manor,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276330\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/854/\">\n    860 F.3d at 880-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Sutton, J., dissenting) (\"Let them live in 'mansion houses' may have been an answer to those who wanted the protection of the burglary laws for lesser dwellings a long time ago. But that has not been true for many decades.\");\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rivera-Oros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3504725\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/590/1123/#p1130\">\n    590 F.3d 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1130 (10th Cir. 2009) (\"[T]he unique wounds caused by residential burglary are independent of the size or construction of the dwelling. They are the same for the mansion house and the boarding house, the tract home and the mobile home.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Accordingly, we vacate our prior opinion and affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    The Honorable James M. Moody Jr., United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The Government contends that the statute applies to vehicles only if they \"exhibit some physical alterations or modifications,\" effectively collapsing the distinction between the two subsections of the definition of residential occupiable structure. The Government observes that this does not make the statutory language superfluous because it applies to buildings or other structures as well as vehicles (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , a building \"where any person lives\" and a vehicle \"which is customarily used for overnight accommodation of persons\"). We assume without deciding that the plain language of the statute does extend to vehicles in which any person lives even if the vehicles lack physical alterations or modifications.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
