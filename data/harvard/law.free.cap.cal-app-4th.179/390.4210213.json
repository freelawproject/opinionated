At issue is whether defendant engaged in actionable conduct when it refused to permit the installation of a new mobilehome in its mobilehome park, to replace an older one that plaintiff had inherited. As alleged in the complaint, defendant\u2019s refusal to approve the replacement home violated the Mobilehome Residency Law (Civ. Code, \u00a7 798 et seq.), breached the rental agreement to which plaintiff had succeeded, and interfered with the economic relations between him and the purchaser who had contracted to buy the older mobilehome.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>On appeal, plaintiff contends that the court erred by failing to treat his well-pleaded factual allegations as true, by failing to recognize the preemptive effect of the Mobilehome Residency Law, and by justifying defendant\u2019s actions on the basis of its internal rules, which were not promulgated according to law. Plaintiff further contends that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant him leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">We conclude that the complaint fails to state a cause of action. Moreover, we find no abuse of discretion in failing to grant leave to amend. We therefore affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The parties to this action are plaintiff David Hoffman and defendant Smithwoods RV Park, LLC. Defendant owns and operates the San Lorenzo Mobile Home Park in Santa Cruz County.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Following the death of his mother, plaintiff inherited her mobilehome (the older mobilehome). The older mobilehome is located in defendant\u2019s park, at space 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">\n<em>Rental Agreement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s mother occupied space 37 pursuant to a rental agreement with defendant, which had a one-year term commencing December 1, 2006. By its express terms, the rental agreement binds and benefits the contracting parties\u2019 heirs, successors, and assigns. An exhibit to the rental agreement sets forth the park\u2019s rules and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">\n<em>Purchase Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">In March 2007, plaintiff entered into a contract to sell the older mobilehome to \u201cWallace Homes or Assigns.\u201d Shortly thereafter, an escrow was opened, which identified the buyers as Wallace Homes Association and Thomas E. Rotter. The purchase contract provides that the sale is \u201ccontingent on park approval to replace old mobile with new one at no cost to seller.\u201d According to the complaint, defendant knew of the purchase contract and of the buyer\u2019s \u201cintent ... to install a new home,\u201d though the complaint does not specify when defendant gained that knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\n<em>Buyers\u2019 Installation Request; Defendant\u2019s Response</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In April 2007, acting as the buyer, Rotter sought defendant\u2019s signature on a plot plan and mobilehome installation permit, as required by California\u2019s Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). According to the complaint: \u201cExcept for certifying that the lot lines contained in the Plot Plan and Installation Permit are correct,\u201d applicable law \u201cdoes not require, or allow, the park owner to grant or withhold . . . approval for the placement of the mobilehome on its lot or for the issuance of the . . . HCD permit to occupy the mobilehome. . . .\u201d The complaint further asserts that \u201cHCD has promulgated the exclusive statewide setback and siting standards for the placement of mobilehomes on their lots . . . throughout California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">By letter dated June 7, 2007, attached as an exhibit to plaintiff\u2019s complaint, the buyers\u2019 attorney told defendant that its \u201cinstallation requirements\u201d were \u201cunlawful.\u201d In the words of the letter: \u201cYou are not permitted to attempt to implement your own stricter standards nor are you permitted to require that the installation of the mobilehome go through your own approval process, as you have attempted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">In mid-June 2007, the complaint alleges, defendant \u201cwrote a letter refusing to sign Rotter\u2019s mobile home Plot Plan and Installation Permit Application\u201d and \u201cinstead setting forth new \u2018Park Rules\u2019. The Park Rules . . . contain setback or placement requirements that are in addition to, exceed, or are more stringent\u201d than those provided in pertinent HCD regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Meanwhile, between March 22, 2007 (the date of the purchase contract), and June 7, 2007 (the date of the attorney\u2019s letter), defendant\u2019s agent contacted a competitor of the buyers \u201cin an attempt to gain her assistance to purchase the old mobile home . . . from plaintiff, for defendant\u2019s sole benefit and profit\u201d at a lower price than the buyers had offered. Defendant\u2019s intent was to prevent \u201canyone else but defendant from purchasing the old mobile home at space #37 from plaintiff by imposing unreasonable \u2018new\u2019 rules and regulations on any prospective purchaser if other than defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">In January 2008, the complaint alleges, \u201cdefendant began erecting a 12 foot tall fence adjacent to plaintiff\u2019s mobilehome at space #37 in the Park in order to strip plaintiff of the view and desirability of the common area open space adjacent to space #37.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\n<em>Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In February 2008, plaintiff filed his complaint in this action. It enumerates six causes of action: (1) \u201cBreach of Statute (the California Mobilehome Residency Law)\u201d; (2) injunctive and declaratory relief that defendant cannot usurp BCD\u2019s exclusive authority; (3) injunctive and declaratory relief that defendant cannot enforce setback or size regulations that conflict with HCD regulations; (4) \u201cIntentional Interference With Economic Relationship\u201d; (5) \u201cNegligent Interference With Economic Relationship\u201d; and (6) \u201cBreach of Contract (Breach of Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\n<em>Demurrer; Judicial Notice Requests; Response</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">In April 2008, defendant demurred to the complaint on the ground that it failed to state a cause of action. Defendant also asked the court to take judicial notice of four documents. The first two represent the results of title searches, which show that plaintiff holds title to two mobilehomes in the park: the older mobilehome at space 37 and another one at space 33. The other two documents in defendant\u2019s judicial notice request are HCD regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Plaintiff opposed the demurrer. He did not object to the request for judicial notice, however. Nor did he seek leave to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Defendant replied to plaintiff\u2019s opposition. Defendant also submitted a supplemental request for judicial notice of three documents from a \u201ccompanion\u201d suit against defendant arising out of the same transaction, brought by the buyer, Rotter. In addition, defendant filed a \u201cnotice of exhibits\u201d in opposition to any request by plaintiff for leave to amend. Appended to that document were three letters purportedly exchanged between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">Plaintiff objected both to the supplemental request for judicial notice and to the notice of exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">\n<em>Hearing and Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">In May 2008, the court conducted a hearing on the demurrer. The court announced that its \u201ctentative ruling would be to sustain the demurrer without leave to amend.\u201d The court explained its reasons in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>The court also addressed defendant\u2019s requests for judicial notice. The court first noted that defendant\u2019s initial request was unopposed. It granted that request. The court then took up defendant\u2019s supplemental request for judicial notice of documents from the companion case. The court denied that request, but it nevertheless commented that the subject documents \u201ccould be utilized for determining whether . . . leave to amend[] should be granted or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">After discussing the judicial notice requests, the court entertained argument on the demurrer. Thereafter, the court adopted its tentative ruling, sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In June 2008, the court filed a formal order consistent with its oral ruling, sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend. In July 2008, the court entered a judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\n<em>Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">This appeal followed. As noted above, plaintiff makes four appellate claims: (1) the court erred by failing to treat his well-pleaded factual allegations as true; (2) the court erred by failing to recognize the preemptive effect of the Mobilehome Residency Law; (3) the court erred in relying on defendant\u2019s internal rules, which were not promulgated according to law; and (4) the court abused its discretion in failing to grant leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">To establish the proper framework for our analysis, we begin by summarizing the pertinent statutory issues and the law governing demurrers. We then apply those principles to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">I. <em>Legal Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">A. <em>Mobilehome Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">Various statutory and administrative provisions govern mobilehomes and mobilehome tenancies.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>1. <em>Mobilehome Parks Act: Statute and Regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Mobilehome park construction and operation are governed by the Mobilehome Parks Act (MPA), which is codified at Health &amp; Safety Code section 18200 et seq. <em>(County of Santa Cruz v. Waterhouse </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1483, 1489 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 543].)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The HCD has promulgated regulations under the MPA, which are found in title 25 of the California Code of Regulations (Title 25) at section 1000 et seq. One of the regulations addresses approval for new mobilehome installation, stating in pertinent part: \u201cPark operator approval is required with all applications for a permit to install an MH-unit, or to alter an MH-unit located in a park, if the alteration would affect the electrical, fuel gas or plumbing system of the park.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 25, \u00a7 1032, subd. (d).) Another regulation provides for minimum setbacks on lots in mobilehome parks. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1330.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">2. <em>Mobilehome Residency Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Mobilehome tenancies in mobilehome parks are governed by the Mobilehome Residency Law (MRL), codified at Civil Code section 798 et seq.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cOrdinarily, mobilehome park tenants own their homes but rent the spaces they occupy.\u201d <em>(People ex rel. Kennedy v. Beaumont Investment, Ltd. </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 102, 109 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 429].) \u201cThe protections afforded by the [MRL] reflect legislative recognition of the unique nature of mobilehome tenancies.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The MRL begins with general provisions (\u00a7\u00a7 798-798.14). It then covers such topics as rental agreements (\u00a7\u00a7 798.15-798.22), park rules and regulations (\u00a7\u00a7 798.23-798.29.6), and ownership transfers (\u00a7\u00a7 798.70-798.83). Through these and its other provisions, the MRL \u201cregulates relations between the owners and the residents of mobilehome parks.\u201d <em>(Cacho </em>v. <em>Boudreau </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 341, 345 [53 Cal.Rptr.3d 43, 149 P.3d 473].)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">B. <em>Principles of Statutory Construction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">1. <em>Statutes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">\u201cIn statutory construction cases, our fundamental task is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number><em>(Estate of Griswold </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 904, 910 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 165, 24 P.3d 1191].) \u201c \u2018We begin by examining the statutory language, giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 911.) As a general rule of statutory construction, \u201cwhere possible, significance should be given to every word, phrase, sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCart </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 338, 342 [185 Cal.Rptr. 284, 649 P.2d 926].) \u201cIf the terms of the statute are unambiguous, we presume the lawmakers meant what they said, and the plain meaning of the language governs.\u201d <em>(Estate of Griswold, </em>at p. 911; see also, e.g., <em>Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. </em>(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 976-977 [11 Cal.Rptr.3d 45].)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">2. <em>Regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u201cGenerally, the same rules of construction and interpretation which apply to statutes govern the interpretation of rules and regulations of administrative agencies.\u201d <em>(California State Restaurant Assn. v. Whitlow </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 340, 344 [129 Cal.Rptr. 824].) \u201cThe fundamental rule of interpretation is to ascertain the intent of the agency issuing the regulation so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u201d <em>(Brewer </em>v. <em>Patel </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1017, 1021 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 65].) \u201cIn order that legislative intent be given effect,\u201d a regulation, like a statute, \u201cshould be construed with due regard for the ordinary meaning of the language used and in harmony with the whole system of law of which it is a part.\u201d <em>(California State Restaurant Assn. v. Whitlow, </em>at p. 347.)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">C. <em>Demurrers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\u201cA general demurrer searches the complaint for all defects going to the existence of a cause of action and places at issue the legal merits of the action on assumed facts.\u201d <em>(Carman v. Alvord </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 318, 324 [182 Cal.Rptr. 506, 644 P.2d 192].) On appeal from the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend, the reviewing court is faced with two questions: the sufficiency of the pleading and the pleader\u2019s ability to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">1. <em>Sufficiency of the Pleading</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">To assess the pleading\u2019s sufficiency, \u201cwe independently review the complaint to determine whether the facts alleged state a cause of action under any possible legal theory.\u201d <em>(Berger v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 989, 998 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 583]; see <em>Buller v. Sutter Health </em>(2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 981, 986 [74 Cal.Rptr.3d 47].) We will affirm \u201cif proper on any grounds stated in the demurrer, whether or not the court acted on that ground.\u201d <em>(Carman </em>v. <em>Alvord, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 324.) On appeal, \u201cthe plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the trial court erred\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>sustaining the demurrer. <em>(Cantu </em>v. <em>Resolution Trust Corp. </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 879 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 151].)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u201cIn reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer, we are guided by long-settled rules. \u2018We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Blank v. Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58]; accord, <em>Schifando v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1074, 1081 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 457, 79 P.3d 569].) In addition to the complaint\u2019s allegations, we consider matters that must or may be judicially noticed. <em>(Blank v. Kirwan, </em>at p. 318; <em>Schifando v. City of Los Angeles, </em>at p. 1081; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 430.30.) We also consider the complaint\u2019s exhibits. <em>(Dodd v. Citizens Bank of Costa Mesa </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1624, 1627 [272 Cal.Rptr. 623]; <em>108 Holdings, Ltd. v. City of Rohnert Park </em>(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 186, 193 [38 Cal.Rptr.3d 589].) Under the doctrine of truthful pleading, the courts \u201cwill not close their eyes to situations where a complaint contains allegations of fact inconsistent with attached documents, or allegations contrary to facts which are judicially noticed.\u201d <em>(Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [176 Cal.Rptr. 824].) \u201cFalse allegations of fact, inconsistent with annexed documentary exhibits [citation] or contrary to facts judicially noticed [citation], may be disregarded . . . .\u201d (4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Pleading, \u00a7 397, p. 536; see also <em>id., </em>\u00a7 431, p. 564; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 440, p. 572.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In undertaking our independent review, \u201cwe give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.\u201d <em>(Blank v. Kirwan, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 318; see <em>Schifando v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 1081.) \u201cIf the complaint states a cause of action under any theory, regardless of the title under which the factual basis for relief is stated, that aspect of the complaint is good against a demurrer.\u201d <em>(Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 709, 960 P.2d 513].)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">2. <em>Amendment of the Pleading</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u201cIf the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, as here, we must decide whether there is a reasonable possibility the plaintiff could cure the defect with an amendment.\u201d <em>(Schifando v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 1081.) \u201cThe burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Blank </em>v. <em>Kirwan, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 318.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u201cAs a general rule, if there is a reasonable possibility the defect in the complaint could be cured by amendment, it is an abuse of discretion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.\u201d <em>(City of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445, 459 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 329]; see also, e.g., <em>Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co., supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 39; <em>Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 810 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 661, 110 P.3d 914].) \u201cNevertheless, where the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim is clear, and under substantive law no liability exists, a court should deny leave to amend because no amendment could change the result.\u201d <em>(City of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>at p. 459.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In analyzing liability under the governing substantive law, \u201cwe exercise our independent judgment about whether the complaint states a cause of action as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Montclair Parkowners Assn. v. City of Montclair </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 784, 790 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 598].) Where the issue of substantive law presents a question of statutory interpretation, our review likewise is de novo. <em>(Kramer v. Intuit Inc. </em>(2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 574, 578 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 412].)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">As just explained, our analysis of the demurrer ruling proceeds in two steps. First, we independently review the sufficiency of plaintiff\u2019s complaint, addressing its six causes of action category by category. Next, we consider whether leave to amend should have been granted. As we explain below, after undertaking both steps in the analysis, we conclude that the trial court acted properly in sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">A. <em>The Complaint Fails to State a Cause of Action for Statutory Violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">1. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">In arguments below, the parties disagreed about application of the MRL.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">Plaintiff relied on section 798.25, which sets forth procedural requirements for amendments to mobilehome park rules. Plaintiff asserted that defendant failed to follow those procedures in promulgating its siting and setback requirements for the installation of new mobilehomes in the park.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">Defendant relied on section 798.78. That provision recognizes that an \u201cheir\u201d who inherits a mobilehome from a \u201chomeowner\u201d has \u201cthe right to sell the mobilehome\u201d under conditions set forth in the MRL. (\u00a7 798.78, subd. (a).) But the provision further states: \u201cIn the event the mobilehome is to be replaced, the replacement mobilehome shall also meet current standards of the park as contained in the park\u2019s most recent written requirements issued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>prospective homeowners.\u201d (\u00a7 798.78, subd. (c).) According to defendant, under this statute as applied to space 37, plaintiff is not a \u201chomeowner\u201d but instead is an \u201cheir\u201d and thus subject to the park\u2019s current standards, as reflected in its written guidelines for obtaining approval of new mobilehome installations after January 1, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The trial court agreed with defendant. In its formal order of June 2008, the court stated that it \u201cmust analyze the guidelines attached to the Plaintiff\u2019s complaint under Civil Code Section 798.78, rather than Civil Code Section 798.25.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">On appeal, the parties continue to press the statutory arguments that they presented below. Furthermore, according to plaintiff, the complaint raises a factual issue about when the written guidelines were instituted, which the court improperly resolved against him. In addition, plaintiff urges, defendant\u2019s siting and setback rules are preempted, because they are in conflict with applicable state law regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">2. <em>The Statutory Provisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">In part, at least, the parties\u2019 arguments over application of the MRL turn on the proper characterization of plaintiff\u2019s status as either a \u201chomeowner\u201d or an \u201cheir.\u201d Depending on that status, different portions of the MRL apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Article 1 of the MRL applies generally. It contains a number of statutory definitions. (\u00a7\u00a7 798.2-798.12.) As relevant here, \u201chomeowner\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who has a tenancy in a mobilehome park under a rental agreement.\u201d (\u00a7 798.9.) \u201cHeir\u201d is not specifically defined for purposes of the MRL.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Article 3, \u201cRules and Regulations,\u201d sets forth procedures that govern park management\u2019s activities vis-a-vis <em>homeowners. </em>Among those provisions is section 798.25.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the express terms of that section indicate, park management must \u201cmeet and consult with the homeowners in the park\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>concerning proposed amendments. (\u00a7 798.25, subd. (a).) A \u201cnoticed amendment to the park\u2019s rules and regulations may be implemented\u201d with the consent of an affected \u201chomeowner, or without the homeowner\u2019s consent upon written notice of not less than\u201d the specified statutory periods. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).) As the quoted language reflects, this provision is aimed at park rule amendments affecting <em>homeowners </em>as statutorily defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Article 7, entitled \u201cTransfer of Mobilehomes and Mobilehome Parks,\u201d governs ownership transfers. That article includes section 798.78.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>section specifically applies to an \u201cheir, joint tenant, or personal representative of the estate who gains ownership of a mobilehome in the mobilehome park through the death of the owner of the mobilehome who was a homeowner at the time of his or her death . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 798.78, subd. (a).) Thus, as relevant to this appeal, article 7 applies to heirs and other successors in interest, as distinct from homeowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">3. <em>Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">a. <em>Section 798.78 governs here.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Applying the foregoing provisions to the facts as pleaded, we reach the same conclusion as the trial court: the governing provision is section 798.78, which applies to heirs. Plaintiff alleges that he is \u201cthe heir\u201d of his mother with respect to space 37, pursuant to her rental agreement with defendant. As an heir under the governing provision, his proffered \u201creplacement mobile-home\u201d is required to \u201cmeet current standards of the park as contained in the park\u2019s most recent written requirements issued to prospective homeowners.\u201d (\u00a7 798.78, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">b. <em>The procedural requirements of section 798.25 do not apply.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">In asserting his statutory violation claims, plaintiff argues that defendant was required to satisfy the procedural requirements of section 798.25 in considering whether to accept a replacement mobilehome under section 798.78. We reject that argument. As a matter of statutory interpretation, we see no basis for importing the requirements of that first provision into the second. We offer two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">First, as explained above, the two provisions appear in two different articles of the MRL, with each article apparently directed at a different aspect of mobilehome park tenancies. That structure is suggestive of legislative intent to differentiate the two articles\u2019 requirements. <em>(In re Mark B. </em>(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 61, 76 [56 Cal.Rptr.3d 697] [the \u201cinternal organization of a code may aid in understanding a statute\u2019s purpose . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">\u201cIn addition to the difference in their function, the language of\u2019 the two provisions \u201cis manifestly different.\u201d <em>(People v. Jones </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 585, 595 [250 Cal.Rptr. 635, 758 P.2d 1165].) The Legislature\u2019s use of the words \u201cstandards\u201d and \u201cwritten requirements\u201d in section 798.78 contrasts with its use of the phrase \u201crules and regulations\u201d in section 798.25. \u201cOf course, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number><em>different </em>words are used in contemporaneously enacted, adjoining subdivisions of a statute, the inference is compelling that a difference in meaning was intended.\u201d <em>(Jones, </em>at p. 596.) Here, the two provisions appear in separate sections, enacted a year apart. (\u00a7 798.25 [added by Stats. 1978, ch. 1033, \u00a7 10, p. 3188]; \u00a7 798.78 [added by Stats. 1979, ch. 198; \u00a7 1, p. 437].) But they were amended together in 1982, to substitute the term \u201chomeowner\u201d for \u201ctenant.\u201d (\u00a7 798.25 [amended by Stats. 1982, ch. 1397, \u00a78, p. 5321]; \u00a7 798.78 [amended by Stats. 1982, ch. 1397, \u00a7 32.5, p. 5328].) The Legislature nevertheless employed distinct terms in each provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Given this statutory structure and language choice, we infer that the Legislature did not intend to equate a park\u2019s \u201ccurrent standards\u201d and \u201cmost recent written requirements\u201d under section 798.78 with its \u201crules and regulations\u201d under section 798.25. We further infer a legislative intent to treat \u201cheirs\u201d and \u201chomeowners\u201d differently with respect to the standards and rules implemented by park management. Given the distinctions between the two provisions, there is no basis for grafting the procedural requirements of section 798.25 onto section 798.78.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">c. <em>The court did not improperly disregard'plaintiff\u2019s allegations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">We also reject plaintiff\u2019s argument that the court erred in its treatment of his factual allegations on this point. According to plaintiff, had the court deemed true his \u201cwell-pleaded allegations that [defendant\u2019s] mobile home park rules were promulgated after [plaintiff] made arrangements to sell the mobile home on lot 37 and replace it with a new mobile home,\u201d the court \u201cproperly\u201d would have overruled the demurrer. We reject this argument for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">First, contrary to plaintiff\u2019s appellate contention, his complaint does not include any \u201cwell-pleaded allegations\u201d that defendant\u2019s written guidelines postdated plaintiff\u2019s contract to sell the older mobilehome. The complaint makes no mention of when the written guidelines were promulgated. The only reference to the guidelines\u2019 origination or timing is the complaint\u2019s use of the adjective \u201cnew\u201d to describe them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Second, even if such an allegation had been or could be made, the governing statute requires replacement mobilehomes to \u201cmeet <em>current standards </em>of the park as contained in the park\u2019s <em>most recent written requirements </em>issued to prospective homeowners.\u201d (\u00a7 798.78, subd. (c), italics added.) Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>plaintiff does not assert or even suggest that defendant\u2019s written guidelines, effective January 1, 2007, did not reflect its \u201ccurrent standards\u201d as that term is used in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">d. <em>Plaintiff's substantive challenge to the written guidelines is unavailing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Plaintiff argues that defendant\u2019s written guidelines are in conflict with state regulatory law, which preempts them. We reject that argument for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">First, plaintiff\u2019s claims against defendant do not implicate preemption principles, which come into play when state legislation fully occupies a field, thereby preventing regulation by local government. (See, e.g., <em>County of Santa Cruz v. Waterhouse, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1489-1490.) This case concerns the policies promulgated by a <em>private </em>mobilehome park, not regulation imposed by a <em>governmental </em>entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Second, the challenged written guidelines are not in conflict with the cited state regulation, California Code of Regulations, title 25, section 1330.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That regulation calls for <em>minimum </em>setbacks from lot lines in mobilehome parks. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 25, \u00a7 1330; <em>Qualls </em>v. <em>Lake Berryessa Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1286 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 143].) Nothing in the regulation prohibits park operators from requiring greater setbacks or more stringent siting requirements. Indeed, another portion of the regulation (inapplicable here) contains a contrary suggestion, expressly recognizing that mobilehomes \u201cinstalled outside of parks shall comply with local requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>for setbacks and separations\u201d\u2014albeit with the proviso that such units \u201cshall not be required to have greater setbacks or separation than other similar dwellings within the local agency\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 25, \u00a7 1330, subd. (f).) Because section 1330 of the HCD regulations provides for minimum setbacks only, we find no basis for invalidating mobilehome park siting requirements that exceed the regulation\u2019s requirements, at least so long as they are uniformly applied. Applying that conclusion to the facts alleged here, defendant\u2019s written guidelines do not offend the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">4. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Applying the governing statute to the facts (as reflected in the complaint, its exhibits, and judicially noticed matter), the first three causes of action fail. For the reasons explained above, there is no statutory violation as claimed in the first cause of action. Under the governing provision, any \u201creplacement mobilehome\u201d proffered by an <em>heir </em>must \u201cmeet current standards of the park as contained in the park\u2019s most recent written requirements issued to prospective homeowners.\u201d (\u00a7 798.78, subd. (c).) Conversely, the statutory requirements for amending park rules that affect <em>homeowners </em>do not apply. (\u00a7 798.25.) Since the second and third causes of action for declaratory and injunctive relief depend on the asserted statutory violation, they likewise fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">B\u201e C.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">D. <em>The Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Denying Leave to Amend.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">\u201cWhether to grant leave to amend a complaint is a matter within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>(Reynolds v. Bement </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 1075, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>1091 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 483, 116 P.3d 1162].) Where leave to amend has been denied, it is the plaintiff\u2019s burden to demonstrate a reasonable possibility that the complaint\u2019s defects can be cured by amendment. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In this case, plaintiff has failed to carry that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Given applicable substantive law, plaintiff cannot amend his complaint to state any claim that depends on his assertion of a statutory violation. Plaintiff relies exclusively on section 798.25, which sets forth the procedural requirements for amending park rules that affect homeowners. But as explained above, that section does not apply to plaintiff in his capacity as an heir to the mobilehome at space 37 of defendant\u2019s park. Under the provision that does apply, a replacement mobilehome must satisfy the park\u2019s current standards. (\u00a7 798.78, subd. (c).) Plaintiff offers no suggestion as to how his complaint could be amended to state a cause of action for violation of the governing statutory provision. And as explained above, \u201cwhere the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim is clear, and under substantive law no liability exists, a court should deny leave to amend because no amendment could change the result.\u201d <em>(City of Atascadero </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th at p. 459.) On this basis, denial of leave to amend was proper as to the first, second, and third causes of action of plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">As for the tort and contract claims contained in the fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action, they too depend on plaintiff\u2019s statutory violation claim, at least in part. Moreover, to the extent that those claims may exist independently, plaintiff has failed to carry his burden of showing a reasonable possibility that the defects in those causes of action could be cured by amendment. <em>(Reynolds v. Bement, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 1091.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Finally, we observe, plaintiff apparently chose to stand on his complaint. After defendant demurred to the complaint, plaintiff did not request leave to amend, either in his opposition papers or during argument at the hearing. To the contrary, in plaintiff\u2019s objection to defendant\u2019s notice of exhibits, he flatly stated: \u201cPlaintiff did not request leave to file an amended complaint.\u201d \u201cThe failure to amend and state a cause of action against defendant is an admission that plaintiff has stated the case as strongly as he can and there are no facts that could be alleged to cure the defect.\u201d <em>(Cano </em>v. <em>Glover </em>(2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 326, 330 [48 Cal.Rptr.3d 871]; see <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Bement, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 1091.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">For these reasons, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s decision to sustain the demurrers without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The judgment of dismissal is affirmed.
